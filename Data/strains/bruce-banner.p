VMore specifically, I&#39;m smoking on some Bruce Banner #3 from Golden Leaf, my favorite local pot shop in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.\u000a\u000aBruce Banner has always been on my top 5 overall favorite buds list and every time I smoke some, I remember exactly why it&#39;s there.  An indica-dominant, but still very energetic, heady strain that contains strong flavors and smells of coffee, skunk, and just plain funk, is exactly what I get every time.  I like to think of the Bruce Banner aroma as that of a very straight forward Kush of the OG persuasion, but containing slightly less of a citrus flavor than true OG.\u000a\u000aThis high launches with a distinct, low-intensity tingling in my face which quickly extends over my whole body.  My mood begins to improve dramatically, even if I&#39;m already very happy!  Anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes after that, the creativity begins to kick in and is easily applied to whatever I&#39;m doing at the moment.  My high from Bruce Banner is one of the longer cannabis highs I&#39;ve ever experienced and can last up to 4 hours.\u000a\u000aHigh Times has listed this bud among a few strains that contain the highest THC percentage ever tested in a non-concentrate bud form.  The 3.6 grams I purchased today from Golden Leaf was tested at 28.3% THC!!!  Needless to say after smoking a small personal out of the bong, I&#39;m high as a kite.

VLooking for a nice hybrid? Well I found it for you. \u000a\u000aBruce Banner is a hybrid strain that will leave you feeling good all over. The sativa and indica balanced each other out which left a feeling of clarity and upper body relaxation.\u000a\u000aTook about 10 min for the full effects to kick in. Starts with a nice head high and a little boost of energy. Then it trickles down to the body. The high sat around my shoulders the whole time. This would be good for someone who needs pain relief and a little bit of a pick-me-up during the day.

VThis has been my favorite strain to date!!\u000a\u000aIt was originally suggested to me by the dispensary budtender to help me sleep. I found that my brain got way too stimulated for it to work for that - so for awhile I put it away, and almost forgot about it in favor of my Purple Kush which was my bedtime go-to at the time (now I&#39;ve switched to Purple Candy which puts me out like a light).\u000a\u000aThen one day, after a minor surgery, I wanted some extra pain relief, but didn&#39;t want to get knocked out. I remembered the Bruce Banner, and put a bit in my one-hitter just to see how it would go. I was so pleasantly surprised at the result!\u000a\u000aAs the puff sunk in, I found myself feeling extremely energetic and uplifted, with no slowed down thinking or couch lock. I felt extremely creative, and started cleaning my room to burn off some of the energy, and wait for some kind of inspiration for a creative project. \u000a\u000aI also felt very social, which is an unusual effect for cannabis to have on me whether it&#39;s sativa or indica. I called up friends, chatted online, Skyped...it was great fun! I also ended up diving into a photography project that turned out exceedingly well. \u000a\u000aWhenever I&#39;d feel myself slowing down, I&#39;d just having another small hit off my bat, and I&#39;d be back up and running.\u000a\u000aRecovering from that surgery was one of the most enjoyable weekends I&#39;ve spent in a really long time!\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve tried smoking a regular amount, and for me, it just wasn&#39;t my favorite. But for me, micro-dosing Bruce Banner is my secret weapon for when I need an emotional lift (which has been brilliant for when I start down into a depressive slump), when I want a creative rush, or just want a really relaxing time with no couch lock.\u000a\u000aYour mileage may vary as to dosage, of course! This one was a hidden gem for me.

VThis review is on Bruce Banner by Elevate.  WA\u000a29.5% total active THC\u000a\u000aI&#39;m happy to say this version lives up to all the expectations.  Beautiful medium sized buds, light green In color with fiery red hairs.  Strong aromas of diesel and pine will make love in your nose holes while total relaxation takes over.  Really a great strain for any kind of free time, it will make you appreciate everything tenfold.  The only time I wouldn&#39;t use this strain is first thing before work but that&#39;s just because I prefer a straight sativa to start the day.  All in all, 10/10.

VLocation: L&#39;Eagle \u000aTHC: 24.43%\u000aCBD: Unknown \u000aTHC-A: Unknown \u000a\u000aAdditional Notes: I have had a few people tell me this was one strain I really needed to try and damn were they on point! \u000a\u000aAppearance Rating: 5.00\u000aAppearance Description: These beautiful and vibrant green, crystal covered flowers are perfectly formed. They have big fat calyx and deep redish brown pistils. They, as with all buds from L&#39;Eagle, were also dried and manicured very well. \u000a\u000aTaste Rating: 5.00 \u000aTaste Description: The flavor on this strain is truly delicious. You get a sweet, earthy funk with slight hints of fuel. The sweet earthy flavor is very distinct on the exhale and as it sits on your pallet you can detect sweetness. \u000a\u000aEffects Rating: 5.00 \u000aEffects Description: This sativa dominant hybrid has great effects. I always enjoy the relaxation and euphoria an indica brings, but fear the couch lock. With this one, you&#39;ll be left with plenty of energy while being able to enjoy some of its indica traits. For that reason, this would be a great strain for anyone seeking daytime relief. \u000a\u000aOverall Rating: 5.00\u000aOverall Summary: Very glad go have listened to my friends on this one. Everything about this strain was fantastic. L&#39;Eagle being the ones to cultivate this batch probably made it that much better. However, with looks, effects, and a taste like this, I&#39;m sure it is delicious wherever it comes from.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m Keith Von Fraichen ... You Keep On Fraiching

Perhaps feeling a little green? well lets get ya&#39;ll informed of whats going on, Bruce Banner is a sativa dominant strain with a very hefty euphoric and creative buzz, being a stronger sativa dominate she can be very helpful with relaxing the body, but also able to give a potent pain killer for some patients

VThe aroma and terps coming of a single 8th of this flower had me excited from the first wiff. After getting it home I ground up a gram in the Space Case. Not only was the flower covered in trichomes, it was dried and cured perfectly. I smiled and knew this was grow with love. Snapped right off what little stem was present and ground up to a nice fluff. Kief was all over the inside of the grinder. After grinding it the Aroma was so awesome I had to sit there and breath it in deeply for a few seconds. One full rip of the bowl and I felt this potent effects. I was very happy with the way this made me feel. Two bowls had me strongly medicated. The third bowl had me smiling from ear to ear and doing daily tasks around the house. My wife was very happy with the effects this had on me. One of my top strains now!

I felt super relaxed and happy.  Just when I thought the buzz was ending, it came on strong.  I was so high that I had a hard time doing simple tasks such as grinding coffee.  I was laughing at the mess I was making before I just gave up.

VA friend of mine gave me 1gram just to taste.  So, as usual, I take a puff or two before bed.  Well, it took about 5 minutes and my heart started to race and I felt so energetic I wanted to clean my home....top to bottom !!   The flavor mild, no harsh burn of the throat, burned quickly.  I took another couple of puffs and soon I became axious, light headed, and a bit dizzy.  It took me three hours to finally fall asleep.  I think this strain would be great for daytime use for someone who needs a little extra &quot;umphf&quot; to get things done.  This high strung Granny is old school and I do prefer the indica to hybrids but thought Id at least try it out. Its not for me though.

V&#129304;&#129308; Bruce Banner is a unique sativa-leaning hybrid with some of the most amazing alpha-pinene I have had in a long time. It has amazing creativity boosting properties and such a nice mood lift. I was very impressed with how I felt after the first bong rip. The taste was amazing; very diesely but smooth and with a subtle sweetness. I love this strain and recommend it to anyone looking for a clear headed and productive high while still feeling &quot;baked&quot; but not heavy!

VPurchased from Greenside Rec in Des Moines\u000aFlower: very sour diesel looking nugs. Light green, a little on the leafy side, but gorgeous nonetheless. \u000aSmell: Diesel, pungent and sweet notes. \u000aCrumble:  Fluffy and voluminous. Very nice. \u000aBurn: Even top shelf quality burn. \u000aTaste: Definitely a diesel pungency with hints of sweet strawberry and a little citrus/ginger. Like Sour D and Strawberry Cough had a baby. \u000aHigh: Oh daddy!  Holy shit!  This is why I gave this strain 5 stars, and I assume why it is named after the Hulk&#39;s alter ego. Hulk grabs both sides of your skull and with immense strength and speed claps his hands together. Like Gallagher to a watermelon your brain will explode into a million pieces/fine mist in the ether. Good luck gathering your thoughts. Good luck accomplishing tasks. You will be inebriated in the highest sense of the word. My tolerance is fairly high but this strain FLOORED me on one bong rip. Amazing.\u000aOverall Experience: 9.6-10\u000aNot for beginners or folks with low THC tolerance. Boasting over 31% total cannabinoids, 29.6% being THC, this strain will KICK YO ASS. For those of us that like getting out asses kicked (i.e. Me) this medicine is a godsend. Pick it up if you can find it.

VI still smoked the same amount that I normally do. But this strain in my personal opinion got me more high than most strains I&#39;ve smoked. The high was really uplifting and exciting. This strain is probably better for the day. But overall I liked this strain.

VHoly balls! What a strain! 6/5 stars at least! It has an odd, somewhat chemical, sweet aroma and the buds are very sticky. I loaded this into my Solo and hooked it up to a small bong. The taste was far less jarring than the smell, very earthy with some diesel notes. The high was pretty straightforward in the initial stages. I found it very relaxing, and that it greatly improved my experience of eating the cheap take out I had picked up in anticipation of not being able to cook while high. This strain is a creeper, though, and after a while I found myself very euphoric and uplifted. I got the urge to get a cup of tea and plunk on my banjo. I feel that this strain&#39;s high is best described as one that can be enjoyed in very many ways. I felt the strong body effects, relaxation and anxiety relief of an indica, and the mood elevation and creativity of a sativa. This is the kind of strain that is AMAZING for depression, social anxiety, and social recreational use.

Vsweet and sugary buds that smell like strawberry diesel with a hint of lemon and definite fuely undertones. Two very tasty strains make up this awesome hybrid. Strong sativa like, and Bruce Banner turns into the Hulk leaving you in a daze about a half hour later as it&#39;s indica effects kick in. physically and mentally relaxing, a great strain for unwinding at the end of the day. Great strain for appetite stimulation and insomnia. Flowers 80 days ish. number 3 and number 5 are great phenos. A+ medicine.

VI am sad to say that Bruce Banner and I just did not get along. I am a lightweight, so I try to take it easy with a new strain, but after two hits of this I was completly, mind numbingly baked. Two grams did last me a long time because I could only consume it in such small doses. I just sat there, feeling completly floaty and spaced out. I could only focus on one thing at a time, and that thing was usually food. my husband said I reminded him of that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where the guy&#39;s face melts off. It was definitly intense, but not always in the most pleasant way. I felt like I had been Hulk smashed.

VThis is a strain that whenever I stumble across it I always pick it up.  The first wave hits and it cracked me out of my shoes and flopped on the couch.  After about 15 - 20min there is always this second wave that hits that takes my thoughts and elevates them to the clouds.  The normal constraints I have on thought are removed and I can let my creativity surge.  The tase is actually pretty great.  Hints of pine and a flash of a citrus note all wrapped around a woody delicate note.  If you are looking to create and be a little loose this is the jambox!

VI picked up some of this at The Toronto Dispensary on Kensington. I&#39;ve been smoking for exactly 35 years and this is, no foolin, the best weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. An intense, mind-fuckingly powerful high without the usual indica dopiness, it&#39;s brought back things I haven&#39;t experienced in years and in some cases decades. A body buzz that feels almost like psychedelics; like being wrapped in a warm blanket that&#39;s just slightly vibrating. I&#39;ve built up a really high tolerance over the years and I haven&#39;t felt that in probably 15 years. I also haven&#39;t not finished a bowl in many years but I couldn&#39;t even begin to finish a bowl of this stuff. \u000aOne note is I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to a new or novice smoker. I think they&#39;d probably find it way too much to handle and could end up having a really negative experience.

VI bought this for the first time a few days ago, after previously reading reviews and adding it to my girlfriend&#39;s growing &quot;To Try&quot; list. This morning was my first chance to smoke it without already being stoned on something else. (I&#39;ve really enjoyed what it added on top of XJ-13, and the grind I made last night--15% Bruce Banner, 20% J1, 65% Harle-Tsu--is phenomenal!) I&#39;m a highly introspective person, so sativas can make me very anxious. I&#39;ve only taken 3 hits over a few hours, but the bong I used has an extra attachment that works as a third chamber and lets you take huge rips. My tolerance is relatively high, so it was a perfect balance. My mind is going places, but the indica effects are very chill and keep it from racing. I&#39;m focused, engaged, and clear-headed. I&#39;m in a good mood and feel like I can face the world, impending Trump presidency and all. I feel hopeful and capable and like I can bring forth positivity and good change. My interactions with my girlfriend are logical and direct; we&#39;ve had several productive conversations today about things we need to get done. And it&#39;s going on our list of the Best Sex Strains; it caused me to crave constant touch, and one thing led to another... We&#39;re two ladies who love weed and love trying new strains, and Bruce Banner is going to become one of our staples.

VI picked up some of this at The Toronto Dispensary on Kensington. I&#39;ve been smoking for exactly 35 years and this is, no foolin, the best weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. An intense, mind-fuckingly powerful high without the usual indica dopiness, it&#39;s brought back things I haven&#39;t experienced in years and in some cases decades. A body buzz that feels almost like psychedelics; like being wrapped in a warm blanket that&#39;s just slightly vibrating. I&#39;ve built up a really high tolerance over the years and I haven&#39;t felt that in probably 15 years. I also haven&#39;t not finished a bowl in many years but I couldn&#39;t even begin to finish a bowl of this stuff. \u000aOne note is I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to a new or novice smoker. I think they&#39;d probably find it way too much to handle and could end up having a really negative experience.

VGood strain. A bit one note . Has a nice relaxing mellow high but it sort of just stays right there if no matter how much you smoke. It&#39;s a solid night time strain or something for when you feel like relaxing but it&#39;s definitely not a strain that&#39;s going to bake you like a fucking cake , best to find something more potent than Bruce Banner. Like I said solid strain, just not anything too exciting about it. \u000a

VI bought this for the first time a few days ago, after previously reading reviews and adding it to my girlfriend&#39;s growing &quot;To Try&quot; list. This morning was my first chance to smoke it without already being stoned on something else. (I&#39;ve really enjoyed what it added on top of XJ-13, and the grind I made last night--15% Bruce Banner, 20% J1, 65% Harle-Tsu--is phenomenal!) I&#39;m a highly introspective person, so sativas can make me very anxious. I&#39;ve only taken 3 hits over a few hours, but the bong I used has an extra attachment that works as a third chamber and lets you take huge rips. My tolerance is relatively high, so it was a perfect balance. My mind is going places, but the indica effects are very chill and keep it from racing. I&#39;m focused, engaged, and clear-headed. I&#39;m in a good mood and feel like I can face the world, impending Trump presidency and all. I feel hopeful and capable and like I can bring forth positivity and good change. My interactions with my girlfriend are logical and direct; we&#39;ve had several productive conversations today about things we need to get done. And it&#39;s going on our list of the Best Sex Strains; it caused me to crave constant touch, and one thing led to another... We&#39;re two ladies who love weed and love trying new strains, and Bruce Banner is going to become one of our staples.

VFrosty and full-tasting flowers. This plant can turn out very ugly and dry if it is &quot;street&quot; quality. It often gets a bad name in (unfortunate) bootlegging cities without dispensaries. \u000a\u000aDispensary quality bud is VERY fluffy and dense at the same time. A gram nugget can be smaller than your thumb. Not a strain I would roll with, especially without an herb grinder. Pack it too tight in papers or glass and you&#39;ll have to re-break it.\u000a\u000aHarsher and stickier smoke than average, and it takes a little while for this strain to completely set in (do the math, that&#39;s where the name came from) but when it sets in, you find yourself gone. \u000a\u000aAt 28.7% THC, this is a GREAT strain for getting right, but beware, the most common roadblock I had with this strain was after a nice morning wake-n-bake session for stomach pain, this bud didn&#39;t get me to that same level the rest of the day. Keep this strain in the back of your stash for when the others just aren&#39;t cutting it for the day!

VHave no fear. Hit Bruce Banner hard and hang on for an enjoyable ride. \u000a\u000aI am most definitely a light weight. I attribute this to the fact that I typically use CBD Rich strains. Light weight or not, Bruce Banner is gonna sit you down and let you become a mere speck in the universe. You will feel it&#39;s effects quickly, but a blanket of euphoria will be slowly pulled over you as you settle into the high. Have some water close at hand. You will need it. \u000a\u000aStrangely enough, BB seemed to wear off pretty quickly. After an hour and a half I was starting to come down. So I did what any good scientist who suffers from gamma radiation would do, I blazed up again. Same effect as before. Great stuff.

My body was all nice and tingly I had a super head high. At one point I felt drunk and giggling like a little girl. A must try, they have it as a sativa hybrid I feel it\u2019s way more indica .

VI wanna slow clap it out for Bruce Banner.\u000a\u000aThe strain delivers. What do you want? Relief from muscle pain? You got it. Wanna laugh? Now you&#39;re a gigglepuss. Wanna sit down and work on a puzzle for a hour? Okay, maybe you won&#39;t be as quick, but you will still enjoy every moment. I always feel creative and just delighted on this strain.\u000aNot to mention aches and pain fade into the background.\u000a\u000aIf I could only get Bruce Banner from tomorrow on, I wouldn&#39;t be mad.\u000a\u000a

VHave no fear. Hit Bruce Banner hard and hang on for an enjoyable ride. \u000a\u000aI am most definitely a light weight. I attribute this to the fact that I typically use CBD Rich strains. Light weight or not, Bruce Banner is gonna sit you down and let you become a mere speck in the universe. You will feel it&#39;s effects quickly, but a blanket of euphoria will be slowly pulled over you as you settle into the high. Have some water close at hand. You will need it. \u000a\u000aStrangely enough, BB seemed to wear off pretty quickly. After an hour and a half I was starting to come down. So I did what any good scientist who suffers from gamma radiation would do, I blazed up again. Same effect as before. Great stuff.

VThe espresso of buds.  This strain is absolutely awesome.  I love sativa&#39;s and this is the one to be had if you want to be energized.  Even when I was feeling burnt out from other strains or doing shatter dabs, this strain could bring me right back up to being the energizer bunny.  Amazing smell and taste.

VI bought this for the first time a few days ago, after previously reading reviews and adding it to my girlfriend&#39;s growing &quot;To Try&quot; list. This morning was my first chance to smoke it without already being stoned on something else. (I&#39;ve really enjoyed what it added on top of XJ-13, and the grind I made last night--15% Bruce Banner, 20% J1, 65% Harle-Tsu--is phenomenal!) I&#39;m a highly introspective person, so sativas can make me very anxious. I&#39;ve only taken 3 hits over a few hours, but the bong I used has an extra attachment that works as a third chamber and lets you take huge rips. My tolerance is relatively high, so it was a perfect balance. My mind is going places, but the indica effects are very chill and keep it from racing. I&#39;m focused, engaged, and clear-headed. I&#39;m in a good mood and feel like I can face the world, impending Trump presidency and all. I feel hopeful and capable and like I can bring forth positivity and good change. My interactions with my girlfriend are logical and direct; we&#39;ve had several productive conversations today about things we need to get done. And it&#39;s going on our list of the Best Sex Strains; it caused me to crave constant touch, and one thing led to another... We&#39;re two ladies who love weed and love trying new strains, and Bruce Banner is going to become one of our staples.

VI picked up some of this at The Toronto Dispensary on Kensington. I&#39;ve been smoking for exactly 35 years and this is, no foolin, the best weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. An intense, mind-fuckingly powerful high without the usual indica dopiness, it&#39;s brought back things I haven&#39;t experienced in years and in some cases decades. A body buzz that feels almost like psychedelics; like being wrapped in a warm blanket that&#39;s just slightly vibrating. I&#39;ve built up a really high tolerance over the years and I haven&#39;t felt that in probably 15 years. I also haven&#39;t not finished a bowl in many years but I couldn&#39;t even begin to finish a bowl of this stuff. \u000aOne note is I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to a new or novice smoker. I think they&#39;d probably find it way too much to handle and could end up having a really negative experience.

I was gifted this strain and we also got beans to put into one of the gardens i use and to Mother for others coming online very very soon.\u000a\u000aThe garden I visited today will have 18 strains for me in less than two months.  So I will have a literally huge list of strain reviews upcoming this Summer will be a super medicated Summer like none before.  \u000a\u000aI am so jazzed by the results of this strain medicinally  that I will be exclusively using her at nights as her sativa-dominant genes 60:40 sativa/indica ratio are so wonderfully relaxing in a way many of my newly preferred Sativa strains are so Indica like in their sedative, pain killing effects I truly require as a life-long chronic pain patient..

VGreat looking tight dense buds, Good for when your mindset is right like a vacation type of bud. When you have problems and you smoke this you just dwell on them and get over hyped in the wrong way. Good taste and good strong high but didn&#39;t like the paranoid anxiety affect.

VDefinitely a mentally refreshing smoke. I don&#39;t notice the immediate head rush as much like most do seeing as Im a fairly regular smoker, but the lingering relaxation and uplifted creative buzz are a welcome part of the strain. I&#39;d say it&#39;s also good for pre-bedtime if you&#39;re done being creative or super productive for the day. I highly recommend as a top choice for sativa hybrid strains based on my own experiences.

VI bought this for the first time a few days ago, after previously reading reviews and adding it to my girlfriend&#39;s growing &quot;To Try&quot; list. This morning was my first chance to smoke it without already being stoned on something else. (I&#39;ve really enjoyed what it added on top of XJ-13, and the grind I made last night--15% Bruce Banner, 20% J1, 65% Harle-Tsu--is phenomenal!) I&#39;m a highly introspective person, so sativas can make me very anxious. I&#39;ve only taken 3 hits over a few hours, but the bong I used has an extra attachment that works as a third chamber and lets you take huge rips. My tolerance is relatively high, so it was a perfect balance. My mind is going places, but the indica effects are very chill and keep it from racing. I&#39;m focused, engaged, and clear-headed. I&#39;m in a good mood and feel like I can face the world, impending Trump presidency and all. I feel hopeful and capable and like I can bring forth positivity and good change. My interactions with my girlfriend are logical and direct; we&#39;ve had several productive conversations today about things we need to get done. And it&#39;s going on our list of the Best Sex Strains; it caused me to crave constant touch, and one thing led to another... We&#39;re two ladies who love weed and love trying new strains, and Bruce Banner is going to become one of our staples.

VI picked up some of this at The Toronto Dispensary on Kensington. I&#39;ve been smoking for exactly 35 years and this is, no foolin, the best weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. An intense, mind-fuckingly powerful high without the usual indica dopiness, it&#39;s brought back things I haven&#39;t experienced in years and in some cases decades. A body buzz that feels almost like psychedelics; like being wrapped in a warm blanket that&#39;s just slightly vibrating. I&#39;ve built up a really high tolerance over the years and I haven&#39;t felt that in probably 15 years. I also haven&#39;t not finished a bowl in many years but I couldn&#39;t even begin to finish a bowl of this stuff. \u000aOne note is I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to a new or novice smoker. I think they&#39;d probably find it way too much to handle and could end up having a really negative experience.

VBruce Banner is a very energetic and uplifting strain. I got my medicine at Left Coast Connection, with the flower testing at a whopping 31% THC content. The buds were bright green, with orange hairs, nicely trimmed and tight. Couldn&#39;t put my finger on the aroma, kind of earthy and citrusy. Reminds me of cinex with the smell. This strain will give you the munchies which is nice, although wouldn&#39;t recommend this strain before bedtime. Gets you thinking and keeps you awake. Definitely leaning towards a sativa more so than a hybrid for my experience... Can&#39;t beat an OG Kush / Diesel cross, ever.

VHave no fear. Hit Bruce Banner hard and hang on for an enjoyable ride. \u000a\u000aI am most definitely a light weight. I attribute this to the fact that I typically use CBD Rich strains. Light weight or not, Bruce Banner is gonna sit you down and let you become a mere speck in the universe. You will feel it&#39;s effects quickly, but a blanket of euphoria will be slowly pulled over you as you settle into the high. Have some water close at hand. You will need it. \u000a\u000aStrangely enough, BB seemed to wear off pretty quickly. After an hour and a half I was starting to come down. So I did what any good scientist who suffers from gamma radiation would do, I blazed up again. Same effect as before. Great stuff.

VI&#39;m normally a low-dose smoker - usually no more than a hit or two at a time. I smoked a lot of Bruce Banner last night. Super buddy and lots of thc crystals. \u000a\u000aI smoked right before eating, and I&#39;m assuming this is a sativa-dominant hybrid, because it didn&#39;t really make me any more hungry. It definitely gave me a very creative head high. Not much of a body high. I got so high I had to drink some water to combat the excess dry mouth/throat. \u000a\u000aThe one major con of my experience last night would be that my throat got so dry that I could barely talk. I felt completely mentally capable of talking to people, and was in a very jovial mood; but my cottonmouth and my red eyes made my high very obvious to people and made it hard to converse in the social situations I found myself in.\u000a\u000aAfter getting home and being alone, the high had mellowed out into a nice relaxing and content head high. I did some yoga and stretching, and got into bed. Couldn&#39;t fall asleep instantly, but eventually was able to doze into a nice deep sleep.\u000a\u000aI would really like to try this strain again in a little smaller dose (especially for social situations) or in a better situation (on a hike). I definitely laid in my bed for awhile and thought very creatively about my life. I think, while laying in bed thinking, the high gave me some creative direction in my life. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m more of a low-dose indica fan, and will probably try to stick to that in the near future. Thanks for reading!

VComing in at 33% THC (picked up from the Herbal Collective in Gresham, OR) this strain is amazing! I love stronger head highs, and with the high THC% I was hoping it would do just that...and it certainly did. \u000a\u000aMakes me feel really happy, and in a great mood. I find myself thinking about random things and instantly smiling. I also like how it has made my body feel relaxed but not so much that I can\u2019t move.\u000a\u000aI decided to watch Katt Williams. He is funny to me in general, but after smoking this he was VERY funny :) I would recommend this to anyone who likes a great head High. Enjoy!

VI could not find the Bruce Banner 2.0 20%THC and 4.2 CBD, that I actually had. But omggggg it was awesome!!  I think I bought majority of the supply CCC had a few weeks ago. I have had original Bruce and all live up to its reputation even the lowest profile will not disappoint! As a I have spinal injuries from my C3 down to L5S1 with radiating nerve pains from my neck to hands to my feet. 1gram roll up of Bruce Banner 2.0 put my body at ease and I actually slept for 4hrs straight. Taste is awesome, wasnt the best looking flower fi what Ive seen, Bruce has gorgeous illuminating hues when grown correctly!! 5star&#39;s Apelles Cult and CCC, Dc

VThe nano-drone hovered silently outside the open window. The sound of typing bounced off the walls as white rabbit filled the kitchen with a sense of certain doom. A crack pops and Hunter S. Thompson falls back against the cold tile flooring. From the side of the exposed skull emerged two Cannabisian Fairies from the pineal gland. They immediately flew off to their mission. The targets, Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton. The orders, gift the power couple a pair of brain parasites, from a dear friend. Then they flew off to an undisclosed location to influence the creation of a unique strains of cannabis directly from the mind of the good Doctor. A strain that enables one to embody their true selves. One of Master Wunjo&#39;s Top Ten Strains. Unhulk today, with Bruce Banner.

Vpicked this up at 20/20 solutions, it is a dank strain and I really like the high. the one I got was 25.6% thca. the only downfall is the drowsiness of the indica in the hybrid but it&#39;s a nice Mix of sativa  and indica.

It smelled like straight loud OG, with that pungeat OG taste with something a tad bit different thrown in, coming from the Strawberry Diesel. Totally frosted up medium sized nugs. Gets you insanely fucking high as well. 2 hours later and I&#39;m still high af like im fresh off a blunt

Not quite the hulk but you&#39;re gonna feel smashed ya dig.

VThis strain has the most dense flowers I have ever seen, and tests very high for THC (my batch was 28%). In my opinion it looks very much like generic hydro, but the with a subtle aroma coming from the OG Kush genetics.\u000a\u000aIt smokes very smooth, with a definite diesel taste. I find the sweetness from this strain comes out much more when you just vape it. I like this strain but its not my favorite, calmed me down and made me hungry!

It made me creative, active, and I wanted to do something, especially after i got done with doing something else.  Kept me calm, giggly, but also relaxed, but active.  Very much a Sativa dominant hybrid, but enough indica where you are calm and relaxed.

VLet me tell you something about this strain, so I it was my 18th birthday the first time I tried it and I was already pretty high from smoking throughout the day. I thought I was going to die after a small bowl, I felt like I was a 40 year old woman having a hot flash, I could feel my heart pulsing out of my chest like some bugs bunny shit, my skin was on fire, it was like when you take a shower and turn the knob slightly to the warmer side and it&#39;s so fucking hot it&#39;s like satin was licking my back. I was paranoid and honestly thought I was going to have a heart attack. After 30 minutes I was alright and calmed down with a chill buzz. But that shit was scary.\u000a\u000aThe second/every other time was great. A very potent and strong high. It&#39;s great for either just relaxing or wanting to be active. I use it for both occasions. \u000a\u000aOverall other then my first experience it remains to be one of my favorite strains.

VIt&#39;s difficult to rate this strain A+ but not after smoking it.  Veteran smoker and shortly after consuming started smiling and didn&#39;t stop for almost 2 hours.  Relaxed across the shoulders and back of my neck felt the urge to be creative active and social all good things my friend.  Across the board effective for my PTSD symptoms.  Don&#39;t overlook this happy green monster.

Vit&#39;s a good strain but i duno why they call it the hulk if its a diesel and OG hybrid... maybe it&#39;s like the hulk in his down time? i duno but it didn&#39;t kick my ass. it just had me feeling good. i expected with a name like that to be couch-locked or at least heavy-eyed.

VOne of the best strains that I&#39;ve reviewed so far.  Feeling like any words I chose will not do this beautiful pot justice.  Kind of a darker neon green color with very dense buds.  Golden hairs and lots of crystals.  Breaking this bud up is your first indication that something special is about to happen.  As your breaking most bud up you&#39;re left with a light dusting of crystals and shake dust.  Not with BB.  Not one crystal fell off or even a piece of loose shake.  It all just stuck to my fingers.  It was wonderful!! And then I smoked it.  Its good.  Really good.  I took about four hits and I&#39;m now currently in minute 30 of writing this one paragraph review.  I&#39;m stoned! Its a nice energetic heady high.  Not feeling to much of an indica body high.  More of a sativa trip on this one.  Would recommend to smokers with a higher tolerance.

VBruce Banner provides the best of both Sativa and Indica with its functional clarity and positive mood, as well as its heavy medicinal properties and dense smoke.  27% and you can feel it.  The flavours are on point and the smoke is smooth as silk.  The buds had beautiful dark purple streaks and white frosting everywhere.  All around impressive flowers!

VI am an indica girl at heart, but I have a new love in the sativa heavy hybrid Bruce Banner.  I am fortunate to live in Massachusetts where we now have access to products and strains that rival those of the West coast and Colorado.  This strain helps with different types of pain, both chronic and acute, and it definitely reduces the panic attacks and my anxiety in general.  It tastes sweet and earthy, and the smoke is thick and laden with THC.  Best new strain I&#39;ve come across lately...love it!

VOne look at this strain and I can see where it gets its name from. Green and purple and hard as a rock. A single bud just over 2 inches long tipped the scales at 3.7g! This stuff is gooey beyond belief and packs a hell of a punch! The effects are strong and long lasting, with a good balance between its sativa and indica lineages. At first it comes on quite strong and cerebral, mellowing out into an hours long happy relaxation. The bouquet is similar to its og kush parent, but sweeter with notes of citrus and other fruits. Due to its high resin content and dense structure, I recommend making sure it is thoroughly dried before smoking, this may require you to let it breath a bit outside of the bag. This is definitely one of the heavier hitting strains out there, and not for the faint of heart.

VI have been smoking a great deal of Bruce Banner #4 in recent months, and it is definitely among the most potent strains I commonly encounter. I am always confident that I won&#39;t be disappointed buying Bruce. In short, the quality is exceptional and consistently so, which should be a pretty ringing endorsement, if the 5 stars weren&#39;t a clear enough indication that any funds applied to the purchase of Bruce Banner is sure to be money well spent.

VTop tier worthy.  A nice blend and I find the impact to be more mellow than social.  However, this cannabis strain lives up to it&#39;s name in the sense that it looks, smells, and tastes mild.  Although mellow in its onset the duration of the impact is closer to the Hulk.  In my experience it works better as a pain reliever than it does for seizure reduction, and it is highly effective against anxiety.  No regrets here.

VI suffer badly from back and leg pain.  The pain also causes anxiety.  I really do not like full Sativa strains and lean towards hybrids or Indica.  \u000a\u000aBruce Banner #3 works very well for both.  It is a gorgeous looking bud.  It also smells very strongly.  Im not too concerned with smell, look and taste.  \u000a\u000aA few puffs of this melts the pain away, completely relaxes me yet I can stay active without any paranoia.

VMine was 29% top shelf. Starts with a raging buzz of energy that hammers through your body, leaving your mind pleasantly awake without being overwhelming, like most Sativas I&#39;ve tried. The energy continues to pump through your body, and is accompanied by a blossoming body relaxation. Like it&#39;s namesake, you feel both chill and relaxed as well as energetic and ready to hulk smash. I don&#39;t generally like Sativa doms, but enjoyed this one.

I have chronic pain so it also helped with that but I was also highly and euphoric like I\u2019d be with a sativa normally but with the benefits of an indica.. this is definitely some good shit.

VI could not find the Bruce Banner 2.0 20%THC and 4.2 CBD, that I actually had. But omggggg it was awesome!!  I think I bought majority of the supply CCC had a few weeks ago. I have had original Bruce and all live up to its reputation even the lowest profile will not disappoint! As a I have spinal injuries from my C3 down to L5S1 with radiating nerve pains from my neck to hands to my feet. 1gram roll up of Bruce Banner 2.0 put my body at ease and I actually slept for 4hrs straight. Taste is awesome, wasnt the best looking flower fi what Ive seen, Bruce has gorgeous illuminating hues when grown correctly!! 5star&#39;s Apelles Cult and CCC, Dc

VComing in at 33% THC (picked up from the Herbal Collective in Gresham, OR) this strain is amazing! I love stronger head highs, and with the high THC% I was hoping it would do just that...and it certainly did. \u000a\u000aMakes me feel really happy, and in a great mood. I find myself thinking about random things and instantly smiling. I also like how it has made my body feel relaxed but not so much that I can\u2019t move.\u000a\u000aI decided to watch Katt Williams. He is funny to me in general, but after smoking this he was VERY funny :) I would recommend this to anyone who likes a great head High. Enjoy!

VAmazing. Floral, fruity, still kind of strawberry diesel-ish in taste. So soft and floral when it&#39;s vaped. I echo the sentiment that it starts like a sativa and feels more like an indica later on. Very euphoric and strong, it makes one feel confident and in control like a floating warrior. Also, I think this is the best strain of cannabis to give as a gift.

VThe nano-drone hovered silently outside the open window. The sound of typing bounced off the walls as white rabbit filled the kitchen with a sense of certain doom. A crack pops and Hunter S. Thompson falls back against the cold tile flooring. From the side of the exposed skull emerged two Cannabisian Fairies from the pineal gland. They immediately flew off to their mission. The targets, Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton. The orders, gift the power couple a pair of brain parasites, from a dear friend. Then they flew off to an undisclosed location to influence the creation of a unique strains of cannabis directly from the mind of the good Doctor. A strain that enables one to embody their true selves. One of Master Wunjo&#39;s Top Ten Strains. Unhulk today, with Bruce Banner.

VI was recommended this strain by my local bud tender at MINT Dispensary. A FREAKING MAZING. Just toked up about 15 minutes ago. My first thought is it tastes great, it has a fruity aftertaste, leaves you with cotton mouth&#129335;&#127995;\u200d\u2640\ufe0fWhat devils lettuce doesn\u2019t though? But I have energy, defiantly more talkative. I have had lower back pain a majority of my life, and I carry A LOT of stress between my shoulders and lower back. Bruce Banner actually relives the pain and consistency gives me a burst of energy. This literally may be my new favorite strain, and I honestly didn\u2019t need to smoke much at all.  Very happy and pleased, ready to ENJOY my day. \u000a\u000aAfter I smoked I looked up the reviews and found that a lot of people are feeling the same way. Very popular strain, and I can most defiantly see why. \u000a\u000aLOVE LOVE LOVE BRUCE BANNER!

VI&#39;m normally a low-dose smoker - usually no more than a hit or two at a time. I smoked a lot of Bruce Banner last night. Super buddy and lots of thc crystals. \u000a\u000aI smoked right before eating, and I&#39;m assuming this is a sativa-dominant hybrid, because it didn&#39;t really make me any more hungry. It definitely gave me a very creative head high. Not much of a body high. I got so high I had to drink some water to combat the excess dry mouth/throat. \u000a\u000aThe one major con of my experience last night would be that my throat got so dry that I could barely talk. I felt completely mentally capable of talking to people, and was in a very jovial mood; but my cottonmouth and my red eyes made my high very obvious to people and made it hard to converse in the social situations I found myself in.\u000a\u000aAfter getting home and being alone, the high had mellowed out into a nice relaxing and content head high. I did some yoga and stretching, and got into bed. Couldn&#39;t fall asleep instantly, but eventually was able to doze into a nice deep sleep.\u000a\u000aI would really like to try this strain again in a little smaller dose (especially for social situations) or in a better situation (on a hike). I definitely laid in my bed for awhile and thought very creatively about my life. I think, while laying in bed thinking, the high gave me some creative direction in my life. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m more of a low-dose indica fan, and will probably try to stick to that in the near future. Thanks for reading!

VThis is one of the best I have tried for my Tourette&#39;s. You would think an India would be the best medicine but it&#39;s not. I get a shot of euphoria which builds up in my head with an added bonus of motivation. Better than Red Bull. I feel relaxed at the same time as pleasantly wired and talkative. \u000a\u000aI purchased it from metro Meds and this is better than when I bought same from other places and it has a great taste out of a genius pipe. I cannot wait to try this in a vaporizer tonight.

Rich green outer tendrils with a paler core, rusty and orange threading, nicely dense, fragrant grind of sweet berry diesel, hearty sweet smoke, a little expansive.  Good addition to the Garden Remedies stable, keep this one coming!\u000a\u000aStats from batch 48, TAC 19.0, THC 0.3, THCA 18.4, CBD.3

VTasty, well-balanced strain that perfectly encapsulates its parental lineage. Sweet strawberry notes upon first inhale, becoming more citrusy with more hits, but a consistent, light earthy/woody kush-tinted exhale when smoking bowls. In a spliff I found it much sweeter, tasting a little bit like Sprite, a strong lemon-lime blend, but sweet, not sour and an even-burn with a clean white-grey ash. The high was clear and uplifting mentally with a very substantial body buzz, but not couch lock like its OG parentage. That being said, I still wouldn&#39;t smoke this during the day... or if I had stuff to do. I would, however, absolutely get this again. 4.5/5. Definitely a preferred strain of mine.

VI just harvested some of this Bruce Banner. I can honestly say it is one of the best strains I have had the pleasure of smoking and growing. She smells of slightly sour Strawberry and tastes the same. There is an immediate head rush off the first toke, almost cosmic. Then the high mellows a bit, euphoric and creative. I really enjoy this strain for its uplifting mood and super chill vibe. Perfect blended buzz without the racing thoughts or paranoia that usually comes with this type of buzz. I grew this all organic under a Heliospectra LED grow lamp. She didn&#39;t get super heavy but was absolutely drenched in trichs. I would definitely recommend this strain for depression and anxiety. I don&#39;t feel the pain relief to be top notch, but I&#39;m too busy with my thoughts to think about my back and knee pains so I guess this strain is effective with pain distraction. Either way, I&#39;m a fan for life!

Vwhat can I say that hasn&#39;t been said already about this Delicious strain of herb?  I Love mixing in some Bruce Banner wax with this flower to give it that extra kick. Be careful though, it&#39;ll have you stuck giggling for hours if you do mix it.

VI find the Bruce banner to be a great strain of smoke, it embodies all I enjoy in a weed variety, subtle yet sofiaticated are the effects, bought a gram at lightshade on Sheridan and was very pleased

VMellow. That is the word I&#39;d say best describes Bruce Banner.  I found this hybrid&#39;s calming effects to be identical for both mind and body. Great for relieving stress at the end of the work day, Bruce Banner allows the mind and body to get back on the same page and relax.  If the Hulk starts smoking this bud,  the Avengers might need to look for a new member. A great choice for chilling out on the couch on a weekday. Those looking to use cannabis medicinally may find Bruce Banner useful in relieving stress, anxiety disorders - in particular PTSD - and physical pain.

VI have had my card for almost a year, and have been medicating daily. Bruce Banner is definitely my favorite for daytime use. I picked some up yesterday from YH in Prescott Valley and it&#39;s beautiful,smells great,and the high is so fun! It&#39;s very versatile,gets you going or it can be used to chill w/out couch lock!

VThis stuff is pretty great. Personally, I think it has a pungent, floral, and sourness to it. At first it seems to have a really strong body high but then it mellows out into a head high that could be great for almost any occasion (this stuff gave me super bad red eyes so I&#39;m ruling out anything too public). This stuff made me feel really calm and relaxed but like I could focus on the task at hand if I needed to.

VI&#39;d say Bruce Banner is first cousin to Blue Dream, but with more energetic effects. We got super talkative and creative on this strain. Led to a nice dreamy sleep a few hours later.

VGot to smoke about half an ounce of this stuff and it is easily one of my favorites. The smoke is SO smooth it&#39;s unreal, even after huge bong rips. One bong hit later and I was already pretty stoned. Very euphoric and energetic in the beginning but after, when you&#39;re coming down, is when you start to feel the Indica side of this strain. Just put on some headphones and go straight to sleep. All in all, I&#39;m glad I got to try this strain. I recommend this to anyone. A+

VIm a seasoned connoisseur, been smoking for about 20 years...and i can honestly say that aBruce Banner is THE strongest strain i have come across yet....it comes on SO quick, like literally 30 seconds after my first toke i was BAKED. Supe tasty, diesel and fruit hints....Very pleasant high, lile i said, comes on super quick and with a bang. Starts off kinda energetic and put me in a very good mood, once it sets in you start getting more body effects. Three hits and im ripped. Highly recommend.  And how can you go wrong with OG Kush and Strawberry Diesel

VReally really nice strain Colorado been knocken it out of the park lately. This is a great daytime strain very euphoric and upbeat but with enough relaxation and pain relief makes it awesome for lunch breaks, just don&#39;t smoke too much the stuff I picked up said it was coming in at just over 30% THC even if that&#39;s inflated somehow it&#39;s still some pretty fun stuff. The flavor is really nice very sweet u can taste the kush influence and the Strawberry D hell I was even tasting ginger. The buds are dens cone shaped bright green going all the way to purple with some serious frost with the feel of sticky Styrofoam (love that). I&#39;d really like to dab this and I am deffinetly getting more of this!
