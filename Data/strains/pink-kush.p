VPicked up a quarter of pink and a quarter of blue cheese the other day from my dealer. The pink is seriously my favorite bed time and soothing/pain relieving strain. Also everything is extremely funny and hilarious. Smells like some sort of cocktail drink, or clean wet wipes. Has pink/brown hairs, definitely recommend this my friends.

VAwesome hybrid strain. Buds are dense and covered in crystals, with small pink strands inside. Perfect for sleep, pain, anxiety, or just chilling and reading. At first, the high was uplifting and slightly energetic, with the giggles, bad. After about 20 minutes of reading, I am now stuck to my chair. Nice head high, followed by a slow rolling body stone. The best of both worlds!

VMiracle strain and fantastic medicine. This is my go-to &quot;cure-all&quot; (i.e. &#39;secret weapon&#39;) strain and probably in my top 3 favourite (certainly the most useful) strains ever. Very versatile; applicable and enjoyable in many different situations, sets and settings. Wondrously effective at treating many kinds of pain - possibly the best I&#39;ve had for pain, save for a couple heavy Indicas (&#39;The Black&#39; for example - just as good if not better for pain depending on the gardener but with an absurdly intense stoning effect). PK is one of a few strains that cause an audible sigh as soon as the effects hit, which is very fast. Indica-dom is apparent, yet I&#39;ve never felt overly sleepy on it. It&#39;s like a nuclear *relaxation* bomb detonates directly above one&#39;s head... and along with pain, any semblance of stress is beeotch-slapped far, far away by the shockwave. Better than any Bubba K or OG K for pain. On par with a good Hindu Kush for inducing relaxation/fighting stress, with a bit of a &#39;cleaner&#39; head space. Causes increased appetite more than many others I&#39;ve tried. I love Pink Kush. 4.8/5.

VSmall, dense, dark green buds - mine exhibited the most trichomes when pulled apart, in between &quot;stem leaves&quot;. The leaves themselves are smaller than most Kush family. \u000aEarthy aroma, extremely sweet smoke.\u000aUsers can expect an initial cerebral high, that eases your body in to relaxation/slight couch lock.\u000aIdentifiable qualities include: \u000a - the fact that it kind of doesn&#39;t look great, until you pull apart a bud, and get an eye on those hidden trichomes.\u000a- the smoke is ridiculously sweet\u000a- quick head high, followed by a body high (shows off it&#39;s hybrid qualities)

VIt&#39;s 2:14 pm, June 18, 2017, and the remainder of the afternoon is clear, so I&#39;ve just smoked a 1/2 of joint of Pink Kush.\u000aI&#39;ve been using cannabis for decades, but never had the good fortune to be offered Pink Kush before it was on the menu this week of my dispensary. I jumped at 14 grams.\u000a\u000aThe buds in this crop are on the small size, with classic kush bud structure, tight little spires of medicinal herb, gifted to mankind by higher powers, covered in white crystals. There are abundant orange hairstyles in the flowers, and when viewed through the white crystalline outer coats one might see pink hues. I&#39;m doing my best to try and see pink in these flowers, and if I squint and hold one up to the light, yes, I see a little pink hue there. \u000aIn the odor category, very little to report. This is interesting, because when I see a bud this covered in white, I expect a more pungent smelling herb, but this flowering wonder is able to keep itself under control and not bring on the dogs.\u000a\u000aThe smoke is very mild, with a sweetness that is both pleasant and unique. Every puff or two I get the slightest berry flavor, candy-like. This flavor profile is so sweet and mild, I think that even a relatively new smoker could tolerate the act of inhalation.  BUT BEWARE...this herb is strong.  The crop I have is tested at 31.03%, THC, and this may be too much for some. This old hombre enjoys a strong, spirit lifting shot of THC though, so please don&#39;t fret about me.\u000a\u000aMy trusty bud tender recommend Pink Kush as an Indica heavyweight hybrid, and yes, it&#39;s a wonderful, relaxing body effects immediately make one think of Indica, but I&#39;m feeling mentally stimulated, and this is a beautiful feeling. Relaxed, yet able to creativity compose this memo to you, I find this a perfect mindset/body positioning in which to spend myself today.\u000a\u000aSo, in summary, Pink Kush, (AKA Pink Lady), is getting a 5 Star rating from this man. I&#39;ve smoked a lot weed, done a lot of,things, and I really like this herb. Yeah, it might be too heavy for some, but for those of us who enjoy, who need, a stronger medical marijuana, Pink Kush is &quot;da kine&quot;.

VI got this from Starbuds Kelowna as a shatter concentrate. This stuff was very enjoyable. Very mellow, but uplifting at the same time. It smoked very nicely and smoothly; it smelled and tasted like earthy, floral incense, very delicious. I liked it for its relaxing, uplifting, appetite-stimulating effects. Food tastes great with this strain! It wasn&#39;t great for controlling my pain, but it helped with my anxiety for sure.

V**APPROVED MMPR PATIENT**\u000aI Recently recieved a 140g batch of this strain. it&#39;s one of my favorite strains. a power-house hybrid, pink kush&#39;s indica side can be almost overpowering for some, even the most experienced smokers. when i recieved this batch, all 140 g&#39;s were stuck in one gian sticky chunk. the smell was sensational upon openning the vaccuum sealed sac. As I began to rip the buds apart, to ensure no mould later on, the smell just became absoultley overpowering. the entire house was enveloped in the smell of pink kush. an excllent smell it is.\u000athe appearance of this batch was a tad strange though, appearing almost like a commercial grade hydro, but with an inane amount of trich&#39;s on it. very light green, tight tight buds, with red hairs Everywhere.\u000aA little harsh on the exhale, however the taste is abolutley phenomenal. Kushier than anything, remniscent of some good kief, Strong.\u000aOverall, this is a damn good strain. a keeper for sure, this is definitley a med that will always be on my shelf for sure!

V5 stars.  whilst no fancy gimmicky name , no hyped up boutique herb here.  this is the real deal.   one of the best strains of all time.  we all know it comes down to the grow.  the pink kush is one of the most flavorful, satisfying strains. dense. nugs. skunky, pungent, super satisfying.This is real medication for those who need real relief.   The OG kush backbone makes this a heavy hitter.  Still alwaysa great strain to have. Personally find it best for evening /night time smoke. I&#39;ve never been disappointed with pink kush.

VReally outstanding strain. Upon opening the bag I was hit by a pleasant floral/grapefruit smell, and in my Arizer Solo it tasted just as lovely.\u000a\u000aPink Kush led me to one of the most clear-headed indica highs I have experienced. I&#39;m using Yoda OG for sleep, which, in distinct contrast with Pink Kush, often makes me feel a bit dizzy and knocks me out quickly. Pink Kush is definitely more of an evening strain than a bedtime one for me. Very relaxing and calming, but without full sedation. There is a lightness to the Pink Kush high that lends it well to light social use or pain relief. It is still very potent, however, and I suspect the kinds of things you&#39;ll want to get done during its effects are more along the lines of watching netflix and calling for delivery.

Vafter smoking daily for 15 years half my life and counting, this is by far my favorite strain so far that is, what I like about it is that I find it takes a lot longer for the tolerance to build up more days of smoking before it&#39;s just not the same very important for chronic pain as myself the other thing I really like about it is unlike other strains I&#39;ve smoked it helps with multiple sleeping problems, but not in a way where you feel you need to go to sleep or wake up going shit I passed out it&#39;s more like hey I want to go to sleep smoke a few bongs lay down and sleepytown awaits I&#39;m out within 30mins of laying down for bed, usually with most other strains I&#39;ve tried it takes hours after laying down for bed I usually end up getting so frustrated that I&#39;m tired but can&#39;t fall asleep that I just give up but not with pink kush

VThis was the &quot;Lady&#39;s Choice&quot; bud of the dispensary, and was on special so I grabbed 2 grams of it. First of all the very sweet floral smell was very intoxicating in itself. I rolled it in a joint and lit up. First of all, sweet smoke that has virtually no harshness to it, and a wonderful instantaneous sativa kick. Once the joint was half smoked the indica kicked in and melted away my muscle aches and intestinal cramps. This is definitely a great medicinal bud, and for those days you just wanna get stoned, be sure to smoke it at night!

VI currently struggle with fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression and ptsd. I have a really high tolerance to mmj and pink kush does me good. Not for beginners as it can be very overpowering at first in the way it takes over your body. And couch lock and spacing out start at the same time so it&#39;s better to do this strain at home if you have nothing important to do. Great for bedtime. Using the vape, the flavours that come out of this strain are so frickin yummy that you will be hooked right away. It creates a smooth but heavy vapor, if your a cloud chaser. Two thumbs up.

Smells sweet. \u000a\u000aIf youve read my other reviews, you will have seen that indicas dont work on me or help me sleep much. 4 hrs max from violator kush.\u000a\u000aPink kush is the only strain that helped me sleep more than 6 hours. The cerebral high and relaxation is instant, and pain relief is obvious.\u000a\u000aMy fave night time strain by far. No couch lock for me, just super relaxed eventually drifting off to peaceful sleep. \u000a\u000aSome arousal is the bonus, stiff hardon with tingles and amplified sensation while feeling my wifes body just got better. Skin feels electric, i feel every shake and shudder and it felt so good i slowed down and felt every heightened sensation for the next 30 mins. \u000a\u000aOrgasm was huge, came in buckets and passed out after lol. Other than green crack god and sour diesel, the best sex ive had while high.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend this strain. Enjoy!!

VExtremely frosty and big nugs (one of them weighted over a q!). They truly show that this is a AAAA strain if grown properly. There were slight hues of pink and purple underneath all the trichomes, not that many to justify its name though. The smell was flowery and pungent, releasing sweet scents of vanilla when ground up. Tastewise the smoke was sweet and very earthly as with most kush strains. The effects are very indica like on this one with strong body effects that can be sedating, but at the same time its sativa genetics help ease you through the high by giving you a euphoric head buzz. \u000a

VI&#39;m grown to be more of a Sativa fan over the years but this is still one of my favorites for night use. My favorite part of it is the fact that it feels like a soft, warm blanket is wrapped around your body. I only experienced the overwhelming quality of its high once and can attest to it&#39;s existence so don&#39;t consume this strain if you aren&#39;t well established with cannabis. Would work excellently for muscle pain or insomnia. Best Indica I&#39;ve ever had.

A wonderful, melting bliss filled hugging sledgehammer.\u000aWhen sharing with friends I have to assure them that despite the name sounding like a slang term for very welcoming genitals and further despite my lustful sounding feelings toward this strain that I totally have not had the jar of pink kush down my pants.\u000aPink kush, a strain I kinda want to fuck.  And then marry.

VI got some Pink Kush and was a little skeptical at first because I&#39;m not a huge fan of indica-dom strains, but I have to say, Pink Kush is absolutely phenomenal, plus the taste is really quite pleasant!\u000a\u000aIf you haven&#39;t tried it, I highly recommend it. You feel happy, relaxed, and overall just blissful.

VI\u2019m almost speechless. How can you describe an experience with such simple words. First off this beauty is breathtaking. I think I stared at my mug for 20 minutes before grinding her down. My first hit of this brought me home. I felt like the person I\u2019ve been searching for and hadn\u2019t found...until Pink Kush. I felt carefree and light. I wasn\u2019t stoned, I wasn\u2019t giggly, or talkative, or unable to move. I wasn\u2019t even dazed. I simply existed. I took a few\u000amore hits, and ended doing yoga and calling it a nice. I slept beautifully by the way.

VSuper solid high, especially if used in a water pipe. I was told at the dispensary that P.K would not make me as sleepy as the strains such as Purple or Hindu Kush. They noted that it would be a more \u201ccreative\u201d high, less effects on the body and more on mood. . The crown of my head feels like it\u2019s being touched by wind, but there is no noticeable heaviness. Body effects appear to be minimal: heaviness in eyes, slight tingling on lower calfs and wrists. \u000aOverall a solid strain and would be super helpful for those medicating for depression and anxiety.

VPink kush made took me to a real beyond relaxed, but I wouldn&#39;t say it was a relaxing experience. Personally, I felt physically good, but my mind was racing, I was thinking about existentialism, the future, my place in the universe, etc. It was a good experience, and I felt physically relaxed, but if you want to switch &quot;off&quot; mentally, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the strain for you.

VGreat pain med. A bit heady, but not in a paranoid kind of way. A moderate dose still allowed me to focus for the first hour, but was sleepy after that.  Sticky and stinky. Smells wonderful, like chopped onions in a flower shop. Compassionate grower is new at it, it was roughly trimmed and is freshly dried and needs a while to cure, but the terps almost overpower the chlorophyll giving it a decent taste.\u000aAfter-thought: Next day was different. Everything from the water droplets in the shower, every subtle sound of the breeze, and especially the sight of my partners feminine form was Profoundly Sensual!

VTilray patient review. Considering the price point and the THC percentage of this strain (23.4%) I wasn&#39;t that impressed. The buds are big and sticky and it smells and tastes great. Problem is it doesn&#39;t seem to deliver in terms of effects. Maybe it&#39;s just me but I just felt more relaxed... not much more. The effects are slow to creep up and take a long time to build. I suppose I could vaporize more at a faster pace but why would I go through that effort when there are cheaper strains that can do more for me?

VStarts off a tad head-racey and elevates the heart rate. After about an hour it moves into a very body-calming, relaxing high.  Great for watching a movie in bed with the lights off, before going to sleep.

VSo I have this strain as a concentrate from Hummingbird Nectar. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s been unopened for a long while. So maybe the age has made it stronger but this particular concentrate hits me very hard. It makes sleep easy to achieve. I do get a bit dizzy on it but the pain relief for nerves, fibro, and arthritis in my spine is fabulous. \u000a\u000a

VA solid Indica for sure. It is tasty when I vaped it, but a bowlful in the pipe doesn&#39;t do it justice.(just my opinion); a nice initial buzz though. It seems to be effective for nerve pain and is relaxing, however it looses its effectiveness after you have smoked it a couple of evenings in a row. I had to switch over to something much stronger for pain relief. I would recommend this for anyone needing a chill pill :-)

VPink Kush is a beautiful indica-dominant hybrid. It is impeccable in quality when it comes to the actual buds themselves. \u000a\u000aBig beautiful buds with pronounced trichomes I just love the way this herb looks... its just miraculous! \u000a\u000aI use this hybrid specifically for its indica traits to treat insomnia, nausea, anxiety, stress and discomfort. \u000aIt does the job every time. \u000aVery reliable medicinally. \u000a\u000aSuper quality bud for the price most of the time (depending where you go I guess) \u000a\u000aI highly recommend this strain to anyone looking for a good QUALITY INDICA dominant hybrid for night time use. Although this strain can be used during the day as well at lower dosages. May cause fatigue. \u000a

VI&#39;ve smoked a lot of different strains lately but this one really does stand out from the rest. The effects hit immediately and are quite powerful. There&#39;s lots of laughing and staring off into space...maybe even a little drooling. After recovering from the massive head high, sleepy times. Give this one a try but be prepared.

VI bought a 1 gram tester from the dispensary, as a strain called &quot;Pink Tuna&quot;, with medical characteristics akin to &quot;Black Tuna&quot;.  It has a nice sweet floral scent with a good earthy diesel growl and a hint of menthol.  Good for pain, but only cut it down to about 4/10. I began at 7/10, so it did a good job of taking the edge off.  Didn&#39;t help much with my insomnia.

VA particular pleasant strain, both me and my significant other medicate for anxiety and depression and this mellowed us out powerfully, allowing for a pleasant head high and easing body effect to be followed by relaxed eyes. Didn&#39;t have the best of the best quality like I normally would however this strain has a mighty kick. Not for beginners, I was visibly high for work with this which is not cool.

VI&#39;m just finishing a 1/4 of the pink, and all I have to say is wow!  This is by far the most potent weed I have ever smoked. The one problem because of this is how expansive the smoke is (most people can&#39;t finish a joint lol). But other than that I loved this stuff. I found the high to have all my favourite parts of OG but packed with a killer body stone. Sad it&#39;s almost gone but I got a Bubba/Pink cross showing up tomorrow ;)

VTilray user here. Writing for new users and medical users with experience. First off, this is potent. And I mean potent. I&#39;m not someone who ever gets the munchies or ever gets giggly - and it did both.\u000a\u000aif you like having something that will give you the munchies - this is for you. When I used this I had the munchies, severe to moderate body tingling everywhere. The more you vape/toke the more strong the tingles. And it&#39;s everywhere from your toes to your brain. I used it with the volcano vape. This strain fascinated me. For me it was far too potent since I don&#39;t enjoy tingling and wasn&#39;t expecting to be that high - but it didn&#39;t smell like weed at all. It had a slight weed scent but it was covered by a heavy floral smell. Almost as though it was incense. It tastes like a floral tea when you vape it, and you don&#39;t need to worry about the smell in your room with this stuff. But man was I hungry and thirsty. I am not a medical patient for pain, but I did have an injury the week I received my batch - and I have severe runners knee. With this stuff, the swelling stayed but the pain was completely gone. I tried this for stress and insomnia, since I didn&#39;t enjoy the tingling - I was more stressed to have it wear off to fall asleep. If that isn&#39;t an issue and all the above is great to you - enjoy!

Small and dark buds almost a dark violet look with white hairs and a slight tent of green on the under hues. The smell hits you hard with the heavy aroma of pink grapefruit and slight lemon after smell. The smoke tastes just like it smells to the point of making your mouth water. I would recommend trying this strain simply for the smell and flavor of the flower. Not to heavy of a mind buzz bit you body will feel great. 3.75\u005c5 -Budsey

VAlthough my first blunt with Pink Kush was an absolutely amazing high, I was never able to find it again. In fact, I found nothing but bad headaches as I smoked more. I made a gravity bong and while that seemed to eliminate the headache, I found I still wasn&#39;t catching the high. I don&#39;t quite get it honestly, I guess this is just not for me because everyone else seems to love it.

VOne of my favourite strains.  Almost the perfect indica to me.  Lovely fragrances that all come through in the taste as well.  Stoned is the adjective I would use, as opposed to high.  Can make you sleepy, but for someone as high strung as me that takes a lot.  This slows me down enough to function better when being social, or to sleep, if I smoke enough, at the end of a long day.  Stone is long lasting as are the lovely fruity/sweet/earthy/pungent flavours...  Sticky tight buds burn as slow again...

VWOW, pretty much describes it. Im always iso a great Indica for my various ailments, including insomnia. These buds were dense , blanketed in sugary crystals with hues of dark/bright green, orange, purple,and red hairs that 2gether in certain lights combine to give its hairs a pinkish hue. The aroma is fuel dankness with a light floral vanilla undertone. Smokes smooooth &#128526;, and hits like Tyson &#128074;&#128074;. \u000aThis is for pros, seasoned vets and OG&#39;s , so if ur new to cannabis, BE WARNED ,U WILL BE ON UR ASS, STONED HUNGRY &amp; IN SPACE .

Vgot a 28g batch of this from a dispensary in BC that prefers to go undisclosed for reasons also undisclosed. however i have been with this company for a number of years and their prducts are always fantastic. this pink kush is no excption. with bright pink pistoles and some nice orange hairs mixed in, these dense buds boast a skunky aroma. the taste is almost undescribable. its one of the most, kushy, flowery, musky sweet flavours you will ever encounter. excellent for insomnia, almost overpowering, even for veteran users. this is a strain id highly reccomend to any insoniac or arthritic pain sufferer. 10/10 for sure. this sample was 21.2%THC

VPink kush! I love this strain and enjoy it every time I get my hands on it. Beautiful dense nugs, nice green tone and covered with tons of crystals. Has a very sweet aroma, with hints of an earthy scent. The smoke is smooth and not harsh at all. Now to the good part, the high... It is very relaxing and comforting. The first thing you start to feel is the area around your eyes  becomes very &quot;light&quot;, and creativity buzzes through. I did not get much of a body high. Personally I find it to be an extreme cerebral high. Focus is maintained throughout the high, but the indica side of it will allow you to sleep on demand. Does not KO you compared to some other potent indicas. Additionally, this strain subdues muscular and joint pains (a big plus!)

VI&#39;ve been a daily smoker for over 15 years now. The first few times I smoked pink kush had me feeling overwhelmingly high, and with the extreme need to lie down immediately. \u000a\u000aAfter trying it a few more times, I became more used to it, and now I find that if I smoke the right amount, that it makes me feel energetic and motivated to get shit done. Too much will result in being glued to the couch, with the feeling of lead in your veins. \u000a\u000aWith careful dosing, and trial and error, this has become a great strain for me for both daytime and nighttime use. Definitely a strain I will go back to.

VPK is one of my favourite strains to use for pain, next to Blueberry. \u000aI find that a very small amount can bring my pain down to a MUCH more tolerable level, to the point that I don&#39;t even notice it&#39;s there. \u000aWhile there is some dry mouth from this strain, I find that it&#39;s not really an issue compared to other strains - and if you&#39;re used to taking pain killers, then dry mouth is nothing. \u000aIf it weren&#39;t for marijuana, I&#39;d probably be on about a dozen different medications, including morphine, prednisone, or biologics (for auto-immune arthritis).

VVery nice purple green firm nugs that are extremely dank. They are very well manicured and arrived super fresh and cured to perfection. Given the great curing of this cannabis, it is quite pungent. I find this strain can be quite potent, even though its 20% the effects are far more pronounced than the Mango I tried at 27%. I would say this is at par with what 25% would do to me (Headband).  Its very good for strengthening my attention span and anxiety. I can work for hours straight now without distraction etc.  Since it helps with those factors Im able to focus on being more creative and innovative. I feel more of the Sativa effects from this. It does not make me hungry like the wolf either. Looks like I found my strain but of course the problem is going to be availability. Hopefully Tilray keeps this one around. Its really hard to switch from a strain you are comfortable with when dealing with anxiety and ADHD etc.

VPink Kush is honestly one of the best strains that I have recently smoked. The weed burns a snow white ash and is completely resinous, which means it burns very slow almost like hashish does. Great marijuana strain if you enjoy the smoking aspect of it and of course, it will get you stoned as f***. Another highly recommended strain.

VA solid Indica for sure. It is tasty when I vaped it, but a bowlful in the pipe doesn&#39;t do it justice.(just my opinion); a nice initial buzz though. It seems to be effective for nerve pain and is relaxing, however it looses its effectiveness after you have smoked it a couple of evenings in a row. I had to switch over to something much stronger for pain relief. I would recommend this for anyone needing a chill pill :-)

VThe version I have at the moment is grown by Beard Bros and feels like a warm blanket on the soul. I look for strains that can help me sleep on a daily basis and pink kush is very effective in that matter. In addition to treating insomnia it is also more than effective for people looking to increase their appetite, as it gives the munchies like no other. Insatiable munchies. As much as it can drive your motivation to get stuff done into a wall, it can also make you crave food so bad you&#39;ll drive across town to get some chicken. Overall a definite favorite, it procures a definite sense of well-being, in a deeply physical way, and keeps you in a state of euphoria. Only downside is the price, making this something you want to learn to grow if it fits you :)

VThis was the first herb i ever smoked that had a name i was aware of.  Had a good seller ask me what i was interested in and the  only name that popped into my head was &quot;kush&quot;.  This strain slapped me and said &quot;little man, sit down, shut up, and play tiger woods golf for the next two hours.  You&#39;re mine.&quot; Shes a generous mistress this one.  Clear headed functional start, up to 11 on the euphoria meter.  Your whole life becomes magically amazing.  Thats the first half.  The next half is announced by a great body buzz and the urge to convince everyone in the room that staying on the couch is the absolute best plan for rest of the night.  Prepare for embarrassment when you calculate how much you ate the next morning. After being up 3 hours past your bedtime its all you can do to just get into bed, and then its 5 hours past when you usually wake up.  This strain is a great cathardic ride.  If you dont try this i think it may technically be a sin.  Its why we all love herb.

VTasted in an Arizer Extreme Q vaporizer at 195 &#176;C.\u000a\u000aThe first puff taken from this one didn&#39;t taste much like an exotic strain, but after a few hits the flavors somehow increase a lot in the taste and it gets much better. Pink Kush is said to taste flowery on leafly, and if you are like me and thought &quot;what the fuck is a flowery flavor&quot;, then you&#39;ll discover it by vaping this strain. It definitely feels like a flowery flavor.\u000a\u000aAs for the high, it&#39;s as good as it can get. A good balance of THC and CBD leading to an engaging yet relaxed session. Pink Kush is the kind of strain you can immediately remember when you taste it again in the future.

VOne of my favourite indicas. Smell is what kush should smell like. Reminded me of the tuna can stuff we used to pay ridiculous amounts for way back. Hard to say anything bad about it. I personally wouldn&#39;t smoke it before 6pm as it makes me wind down and feel pretty cozy. Not quite couch lock, but i feel the eyelids get quite a bit heavier. Smoke is rich and tastes just like it smells. Great strain for enjoying around dinner time before curling up on the couch.

I get very relaxed but I can focus and &quot;get into it&quot;. But yeah, until you know how it will affect you, don&#39;t go passing out on your books. It&#39;s a very potent strain and easy to overdo, LOL.

VI was iffy about this strain until I think I figured out it&#39;s called &quot;SuperCritical Pink&quot;.  The description is identical to Pink Kush here.  I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s the same.  Tastes great!  Glad this stuff is becoming legal.  Should be regulated like booze and quality/.strain certification/.testing should happen.\u000a\u000aThis is indica and for pain, this creates a body mass that helps a lot.  This thing also feels like a sleeping pill,   Love Leafly!..

VA really strong strain that&#39;s best suited for a day smoke, in my opinion. The satvia effects of this flower are on full display after the first couple of drags. \u000a\u000aI smoked this, put on sunglasses and went apple picking with my girlfriend. It was a great time. A good way to satisfy the munchies that come with this strain with some healthy food.\u000a\u000aRecommended.
