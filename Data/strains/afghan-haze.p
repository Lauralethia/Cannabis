VPicked up this one on 4/20. This strain had me rethinking I was too generous with my previous five star ratings. Trying this strain was a last minute decision because I impulsively wanted a preroll. The budtender told me they have a 5 pack of five different strains to choose from. Afghan Haze was the only hybrid, so I chose it. Pre-rolls are hit or miss with me in the way that they burn. This one burned slowly and evenly, and was incredibly strong- long lasting, and smelly. There is no way to hide the aroma of the strains I brought home on 4/20. It gave me energy and woke me up mentally- but had my body buzzing with relaxation. I went to sleep for the night about an hour later. Finished it off the next day and cleaned the whole house and was able to tackle some errands before work. Definitely would recommend trying it. However, in comparison to the other two strains I got from Urban Greenhouse- this one was my least favorite. &#129316;&#128125;&#128105;&#127995;\u200d&#127981;

VIt started as a very tasty uplifted high. Very energetic, euphoric, etc. good for getting work done. Lasted about 2 hours with the last 30 minutes a very relaxed body high that hits suddenly but peacefully. 4/5 because as a hybrid i wouldve expected a little bit more body but as an overall it was very pleasant and i definitely recommend to first time users as an entrance to the types and for old time users as a mood enhancer between major highs.

VI absolutely love this! I\u2019m currently vaping this through an Avitas cartridge and it chills me out and relieves my tension headaches while providing me a good boost in creativity and focus. I tried it while socializing with friends and had an amazing time, and now I\u2019m currently sitting in my room working on art. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve met a strain that\u2019s great for both social and solitary activities. While I was with my friends last night I got so stoned from this I thought these post it notes falling from her fridge were f*ckin birds!!! It was hilarious. While vaping, I get a lovely flavor of the scent of crushed pumpkin guts. Reminds me carving pumpkins around Halloween time. Sets me in a spooky mood lol. 10/10 would smoke/vape again

VAhhh-mazing.  So far my favorite strain. A friend and i found ourselves giggling like school girls. I havent done that in YEARS and it was amazing! As a person with anxiety and a migraine sufferer, i was neither anxious nor did the migraine (that hit on day ONE of my vacay) i found myself with last. I cant stop telling people about it! A++, 100% and wow. Afghan Haze is definitely the bee&#39;s knees!

VYellow/Golden bud with Green and Dark Green scattered throughout. This bud is covered all over with brownish-orange hairs and tastes very earthy. I don&#39;t get a strong immediate taste reaction like the chemical or tropical tasting buds. It&#39;s a natural taste. It has a rich, light woody smell. The high is an enjoyable high. I am uplifted and euphoric. I feel zoned in to what I am doing,  so it is and inspiring smoke. The buzz is a real nice head rush; I feel it all over my eyes. The body high is definitely there, and the mind is relaxed by the body high but energetic and inspired.

VOne of my new favorite strains! The high comes on just as smooth as the smoke goes into your lungs! I noticed that the high is very heavy cerebrally after the first few hits, and I was carried up to a heavy spacy, trance-like sate for quite some time. As the effects lessened, a mellow feeling of body relaxation comes on, perfect for patients suffering from pain, stress, or depression. I would recommend to any patient seeking to medicate during the day :)

VI added this concentrate as a little boost to my bowl when I vaped while working all day. Initially the high is great. clear head, productive and focused. Unfortunately, I tend to be glued to my vape while I work so having to much during my day would make me crash hard later in the day. Great strain, but too much will send your ass to sleep!
