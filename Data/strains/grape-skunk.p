VSweet &amp; sleepy with the first toke spreading over body like a warm blanket &amp; each puff thereafter tucking that cozy blankie even snugger. The effects of this strain are very pronounced indica qualities with a very strong body high that starts tugging on the eyelids right away. Not a huge fan of the overly sweet strains with no anchor of another dank flavor note such as skunk or diesel. This strain is straight up fruity sweetness all around so is not my preferred flavor, but makes up for it in effect.

VAnother great Indica by Sante. This strain is made even more enjoyable by the staff at Sante-Denver because they offer it in  prerolls! This strain is a great night time Indica to help with sleep, but it&#39;s also a nice strain to have at a relaxing get together if you aren&#39;t going to be partying this strain will really mellow you out! :-)

VThis stuff is some smelly shiz nit! Strong skunk at first with a mixed berry/grape smell right after, then almost back to skunkiness. haha Good density to the buds, with not much stem at all! The smoke puts a nice lil smile on my face, earthy skunk with lush tasty grapes/berries on the end of the exhale! It made me feel alot less stressed and very happy and pleasant. Not to powerful of a buzz, but nice and tolerable. Good before having to go to job you dont like much! haha Helped with my my somewhat minor part of pain in my body including my headaches! Maybe not top 5 or 10 favorite but I would def buy again
