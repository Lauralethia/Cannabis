VI picked up this strain on August 8, 2016 from Shango Hillsboro. It definitely lives up to its name. Memory Loss (19.35% THC) \u2013 \u000a\u2022	The first sniff reminded me of breaded fish fillets sprayed with a slice of lemon.  Although not brittle, it was dry to the touch.\u000a\u2022	The buzz begins just behind the eyes and slowly radiates throughout the brain.  My normally happy being is not adversely affected and may be heightened.  For me this flower resulted in more mental wandering than mental focus, although I did experience the sativa energy.  So you will want to do things, it just might take a while to make a decision and get moving.  Unless you are an organized individual, it may be difficult to keep track of your stuff and your day.

VOne of the lovely young ladies at Curaleaf in St. Pete suggested I try the 80% Memory Loss vape cart.   WOW, My new favorite strain. This girl needs a tip and a hug.  Hits fast and nice with a great head high.  Good for my pain from a fractured vertebrae and anxiety and discomfort from chemotherapy.   With me the high lasts a long time.  If you go a bit heavy the memory loss part of the name becomes apparent.  Trust me, I&#39;m sure or my name is not... uh... um...

VA very laidback and happy high. Definitely improved my mood. There is a fair bit of haziness that comes with this. And it&#39;s very much for relaxing. The couch-lock was real. And I drifted off the sleep within an hour. This is for relaxing toward the end of the day - you won&#39;t have motivation to do much else.

VReally awesome strain for listening to some tunes. Serious mind-lock here. Surprisingly mellow, but not sedated. \u000a\u000aSome others have said it is great for after work. I totally agree. That mind-lock coupled with the happiness are a great combination for reflecting on the day. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d say this strain is particularly good for those seeking relief from mood disorders, especially those prone to anger or depression. Additionally, I have not personally felt any anxiety with this strain which is something that usually keeps me away from anything in the sativa-leaning realm. \u000a\u000aBut this is not a get-up-and-go experience. This is more like a cerebral float down a cool spring with lush greens and crystal shallows.

VML gives a pretty decent head high that is shortly lived to only become a more hazy effect. For about an hour you will be at a loss for words and things will become more mysterious but after the head high settles you&#39;ll be in a delightful daze.
