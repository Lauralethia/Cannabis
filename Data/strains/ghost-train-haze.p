VI like to write long reviews but short story, this my favorite strain and is unbelievable for depression. Perfect morning strain. Honestly, this is no &quot;beginner&quot; strain and anyone that has grown this strain right, is in for a ride. I found that as a small guy with a fairly high tolerance (even when I haven&#39;t smoked for a while) it even knocks me back with only a bowl or two. As for real beginners, I&#39;ve seen this strain fry people so badly that they could only function on the most basic levels. A few were lucky if they could stand or even talk but never did they have a bad trip. So even though they were to the point where they should have &quot;greened out&quot;, the strain had a wonderful balance that never led them to that point. Take this strain slow and warn anyone with a low tolerance to take it extra slow. As responsible stoners, it&#39;s the perfect strain for the community to have as medicine.

VMy initial response was yelling. It&#39;s almost unreasonably potent. Smooth and citrusy too, but potent. Did I mention it was potent? it was potent.\u000a\u000aA next-level sativa. Made me feel like a marijuana n00b up until now.\u000a\u000aCAREFUL, it&#39;s potent.

VGhost Train does what it says it does... an energetic sativa that helps maintain focus. Overall, that&#39;s something I cherish in a sativa, which is why I&#39;m crazy about Lemon Diesel. The problem I have with Ghost Train is that it completely lacks any mood elevation. It&#39;s an upper without adding that nice smiley kick that I look for in my weed. Since I deal with depression and anxiety, giving me an energy jolt that doesn&#39;t also mellow my mind is a recipe for a stressful high. \u000a\u000aAll that said, I&#39;ve found the combination of Ghost Train and Sour Tsunami to be an excellent daytime smoke.

VSativa girrrrl says: goddamn. I said goddamn. Like Uma Thurman, in pulp fiction.  This put me &quot;in the zone&quot; if you&#39;ve never been there:it&#39;s on time, laser precise, making things look effortless. Without thinking. &quot;Mind, no mind&quot; some Japanese word for that. Anyhow, I could sing a song, invent a product, cook a badass  meal, write frontwards and backwards,  simontaniously, completing a sentence in the middle. I&#39;d love to shoot a firearm...In a video game of course. Because all the while, it feels very psychedelic. Silly matrix type, or whatever Angelina Jolie movie.  This is a GEM. Recommended by the girl at the dispensary. Says it&#39;s her favorite. I concur. \u000aNote: some warn of anxiety.  I can only speak for myself- I have adhd. (Shocker) and this strain makes me feel focused, not anxious at all, and I have occasional panic attacks. Feels great. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s an everyday sativa, unless maybe you work your way up to it. It&#39;s an ass kicker. No joke. A bit much for the day to day grind rat races shit. So get your hands on this any chance you get, grab a hot date, good friend, cute puppy, or kick it solo with all of the above in your own damn mind. I&#39;d say, it&#39;s a party. Party of 2, 6, 8, or 1. It&#39;s a party waiting to happen. So spark it up!

One hit of this strain, and I got super paranoid and anxious. I was watching Across The Universe, which is filled with great, inspiring Beatles&#39; songs, and still GTH put me in my head and gave me a racing heart beat.

VGHOST TRAIN HAZE!\u000a\u000aOne of the best Strains I have found for getting things done! Note: this strain in large doses can leave you HAZED over!\u000a\u000aJust a little bit will get you there. You will feel it right in the head and notice whatever pain disappear. Have something close by. For me I needed a few glasses of water in between smoke breaks.\u000a\u000aI was able to get 3 loads of laundry, clean the house, reorganize a bunch of things, and still have plenty of energy to go to the park later with the kid.\u000a\u000aDo Try!

VI have to give this strain 4 stars, even though after smoking 3 joints, I had a full blown panic attack. My dispensary misinformed me, and I think they mistakenly thought Fioriden A was Foriedian B. At least in my state that&#39;s what they call GTH(Fioriden A.) Fioriden B is &quot;Starkiller&quot; a strong indica. So I bought an 1/8 th for insomnia &amp; general anxiety. I hadn&#39;t slept great for the past couple days, so I was hoping for a great couch-lock, sleepy strain. Well this strain can not be more opposite. I stupidly smoked joint after joint, trying to knock myself out, I&#39;m an experienced smoker, but 2 1/2 joints had me crazy. I became SO PARANOID. It was bad. Really bad. At first though before I smoked way too much, it made me very focused, energetic, almost speedy-like. I should&#39;ve stayed with one joint, &amp; that&#39;s my fault so I can&#39;t give this a one star, even though I&#39;ll NEVER try this again. If you like a strong sativa, something in the morning then you&#39;ll probably love this strain. But if you&#39;re more of an indica lover(like me) &amp; can be prone to anxiety &amp; paranoia from too much weed, then PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION. The strain I had had like 27% THC so it was strong anyway. If Connecticut could do away with their CRAZY strain names, the mistake would have never happened.

One will do ya.\u000a\u000aHigh energy.  Smoking this after too much coffee isnt the best idea, unless going to run around or exercise.  On the flip side, great for socializing and having a beer.\u000a\u000aThings do get hazey, but never sleepy.  In that sense, its a good daytime smoke, it didnt tire my out.\u000a\u000aSmells like rich lemon and fruit.  \u000aTastes the same.\u000aFeels like dank putty crumbling in my fingers.\u000a\u000aSuper danks, yo.

VI LOVE this strain! I suffer with Severe Fibromyalgia that seems like it can paralyze me. I have major back and hip pain, joint pain, throbbing, twitches, bladder inflammation, severe menstrual pain, fibro fog, extreme fatigue and no strength. A budtender told me about this strand that it&#39;s good for pain. I sampled it with my free preroll and I&#39;m a fan!!! I feel the throbbing and tingling throw out my body, but it&#39;s tolerable and I&#39;m able to stretch my body, which I haven&#39;t in over a year. I smoke the flower and it has my pain under control for  about 3 hours with 3 hits of a preroll, so 4 or 5 sessions a day. This strain has been a miracle for me!

Vinsane amounts of... well, insanity. the first thing I get from it is that it&#39;s fucking crazy. its sheer lack of any rationality might be its greatest feature. failing that, the taste, I guess.\u000a\u000areally intense, beautiful, religious high. as any sativa becomes an indica if you smoke enough of it, Ghost Train Haze lends well to intense, speculative concentration. good for both heady &amp; fun movies and tv. great with music.\u000a\u000adrawbacks are sleep problems (at least for me, but I go to it in part for anxiety so that&#39;s a general sativa problem for me personally. are we still in a parenthetical? ah, I see.) defcon-3 dry mouth and defcon-5 dry eyes. potent as all fuck except that&#39;s usually not a problem. bad social weed as you get High as Fuck, and nosoidt in a way that&#39;s not immediately apparent. but solid &quot;great sesh weed bro&quot; weed..\u000a\u000aweed that&#39;s introduced me - if not the nation - to a realm of getting high that I did not previously know existed.

VNormally an Indica or Indica hybrid fan (though there&#39;s a time and place for everything), this strain was suggested to me as a Sativa hybrid for Indica lovers.  It was the most beautifully coloured and formed bud I&#39;ve ever seen, and covered in a thick dusting of trichomes. The buds themselves are large, dense and robust, especially for Sativa.  Vaped two bowls with my wife, and we felt engaged in creative thought and discussion, and listened through 4 albums while travelling the space ways and tripping pretty hard. Then engaged in 3 hours of abstract photography in the dark. Very nice body high as well, with thorough relaxation and decent pain relief as the Indica shines through.  None of the raciness, heart palpitations or paranoia that some Sativas can induce, at least not for me.  A very engaging, euphoric and rewarding strain, and a beautiful one too.

It reminds me slightly of spicy, eucalyptus with hints of pine, lemon/lime, and wood. \u000a\u000aEffects Rating: 5.00\u000aEffects Description:  This strain hits me like a full on sativa. It never has made me anxious or felt racey, but it definitely gets me going.

VGather ye &#39;round, Oh Red-Eye&#39;d Clan, and let me tell you the story of the Ghost Train Haze. T&#39;was the 31st of October in that long ago year of 2016 and I was walking along the tracks, blazin&#39; mightily of the Ghost Train Haze. &quot;Damn, I&#39;m not stoned . . .&quot; I thought and that&#39;s when it hit me: the ghost train! And it was a HELL of a hit, too -- bowled me over down the tracks and left me dazed and confused. But y&#39;wanna know the scary part? It hit me a HALF-HOUR after I started blazin&#39; that bowl! I know -- spooky, right?!  Yeah, there&#39;s notta lot you can say when you&#39;re that stoned, but when it comes to The Ghost Train, you don&#39;t need to say much: just sit on the couch, grin blissfully, and watch Live From Pompeii on endless replay because you know that version of Echoes is gonna launch you into Prog-Rock orbit and the booster for this little stellar journey is gonna be four hits of Ghost Train Haze. You might wanna stand way the hell and back, &#39;tho, because when this shit finally does launch it goes off with one big, fucking BOOM! I don&#39;t even know what the fuck happened in my case; I was just sitting on the couch, waiting for Echoes to end, but that fucking bird part goes on forever and I was sitting there and I heard a sound that was a cross between someone dropping an aircraft carrier-sized deuce in the ol&#39; American Standard and a zit being popped. And that&#39;s when I realized -- FUCK, ARE THOSE BIRDS STILL GOING?! -- it was my mind being blown. &quot;Y&#39;know what?&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;I think I&#39;m completely fucking stoned!&quot; and so I was. That&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it!

VReally struggled between giving 4 or 5 stars. And I&#39;ve concluded that there is no unicorn, so there can&#39;t be a strain that is 5 stars.. Anyway, if you are still with me.. This strain is very lovely. I just had two great dabs on my nectar and I&#39;m feeling so warm and fuzzy. The haze is very noticeable and pleasant. This is literally the first time I&#39;ve felt compelled to write a review about a strain so that speaks for itself. Would recommend and plan to continue using this medication. &#128578;

VRespect the THC level of this strain. I am strictly using this strain for medicating severe and chronic RA pain in fingers, hands and wrists. It took a few tries to find an appropriate dose. I am 61 and new to medicating with marijuana. At first, a large hit on day #1, I was put in a Zombie state and although not unpleasant, this was clearly too much. As a few days went by, with more hits and highs, I found that short puffs every 20-30 minutes worked well for me all day long. I was in much less pain and still productive and clear, with a starry twinkle of light every now and then.......lol

VBelieve the reviews, one of my top 5 strains. Pure sativas (jack h, cinex, etc) generally feel mentally flavorless to me - I can tell I&#39;m high, but not in a very interesting or distinctive way. This one is just enough of a hybrid to add a kick of absolute joy to a very social, fun, energetic high. Had me singing, crying (from happiness), cracking people up, thinking the most tender and loving thoughts.\u000a\u000aDon&#39;t pass this up, especially as an oil given most of the cartridges out there are fairly mainstream and bland IMO &quot;classic&quot; strains.

VBeautiful 2014 Cannabis Cup winner! Amazing, frosty flowers. Unlike a regular sativa with those straight long nug structures, this strain had all the big beautiful nug structure if an indica with the energy boosting affects of a sativa. The flowers were just blanketed in crystals and WOW when you smell this plant you&#39;ll be transported straight into heaven. Such a pungent floral bud, really no other way to describe it besides purely dank. Highly highly recommend you go out and try an eighth but it&#39;s gunna get pricey!

VI read that Ghost Train Haze won Best Sativa at the 2014 420 and bought an 8th at a fine MJ shop - L&#39;Eagle Services.\u000a\u000aI now know why some reviewers used superlatives to describe Gth and if you ingest it you WILL be stoned.  Factor in that it smells like Jack Herer and orange citrus, is VERY potent and that you&#39;d probably be too stoned to notice any negatives, then Gth is a winner.\u000a\u000aGth is one of the best and another excellent but mellower strain is Dairy Queen.  ns

I was dancing until midnight and felt like I had 8 drinks without any of the spins, sweat, nausea or hangover. This strain helped me be social, not worry about anything, and most importantly gave me so much energy to just party. This strain might replace alcohol for me, so long live GTH!

VGreat sativa to get you motivated. It has a weak flavor with an earthy taste and starts with slow creeping body high.

VThis has to be my new favorite strain.  Not only does my happiness sky rocket, the creativity that comes along with it allows me to work on my art with ease. my energy level goes up which is a huge bonus when im always fatigued due to meds and crappy sleep. I broke my l5 vertebrae years ago and believe it or not worked factory jobs not knowing I had broken that bone, we knew about a smaller bone breaking but it wasnt until my spinal surgery in 2016 that we found out about the broken vertebrae when the doctor popped it out like half of a donut. They fused the bones, put in some sort of gadget to replace the disc and 2 rods + 4 bolts. Unfortunately 1.5 years later I&#39;m left with chronic back &amp; leg pain and 20% use of my left leg. This strain definitely helps take some of the pain away as well as all the other great attributes.

VI officially dub this &quot;Ghost of Christmas Past&quot;, because it had me reminiscing  of Christmas growing up in the 90&#39;s... Love it, Not as potent as some reviewers on here but a definite nice chill high kinda vibe with some tingly sensation. Right when I opened the package it smelled amazing (the terpenes had to be linalool a very floral aroma ), I found myself bored watching slow passed movies, might of been just me.  I didn&#39;t need my pills which is awesome, my spasticity usually kicks in about 2 hours after I smoke but it hasn&#39;t yet... Big + :) ...... This is going in my top favorite strains list...

VThe medical qualities of this strain are phenomenal for me...especially GTH&#39;s ability to crush GI pain and knock out nausea almost immediately. If I smoke a heavy amount, it gets me down on the couch though. Every cut seems slightly different, but the branded tins from HoD  have the raciest, most &quot;sativa&quot; samples I&#39;ve encountered. Definitely give it a try, but it&#39;s not for those who are wary of the effects of a string sativa.

VI recently found about half a gram of GTH in my stash and forgot if I liked it or not. It was a very bad head pain day where I felt super sad and  crying that I felt so much pain and had so much to do with my house and kids. Trying to push through, I filled my one hitter and took a puff. Almost immediately I was drifted away from all of the pain, guilt and sadness. I got up, cleaned my bathroom, did 6 loads of laundry folded and put away btw!  Made dinner for the family, bathed 3 kids and had even eaten dinner, which i just couldn&#39;t fathom despite my raging migraine, neck pain and all of that fun stuff. I most definitely will go stock up on this strain this weekend at Natural Selections in Peoria Az. This was just a perfect example of the miracle MMJ has been in transforming my life with Chronic Migraines, Occipital and Trigeminal Neuralgia. I have a life because of this plant. Very thankful to have it available to help me live out of bed again. &#128522;

VI acquired a Quarter of T27 Flower of Gtown Haze from Bluepoint Wellness in Connecticut along with 3 grams of T32 Hash, and T87 Shatter form.\u000a\u000aPersonally the hash form is my favorite just due to loving hash - I love smoking this out of a bowl or mixing it in a joint with either Lemon Skunk, East Coast Sour Diesel/Tangerine Haze Blue Dream to lift the heavier effect or to get perfect clarity euphoria and rest a bit of Afgooey and Rare Darkness.\u000a\u000aThe flower smells of a very pungent sweet earthy pine - the Shatter almost has a super sweet scent like fruit and candy :P - Although let me state that this is an excellent smelling, looking and tasting bud / concentrate.\u000a\u000aThis is perfect for when my ADHD needs to unwind; my anxiety / panic attacks are effecting me - Stress - PAIN - and it obliterates (along with a few other strains such as Rare Darkness, Afgooey etc) my PTSD Nightmare &quot;waking up in a cold sweat&quot; I had become accustom to.\u000a\u000aI am glad this is in CT - I want to go pick up an ounce to medicate with while continuing to try the ever expanding strains at Bluepoint combined with it to see what has the maximum benefit.\u000a\u000aFor Creativity and locking into Music I suggest the combination of GTH and Lemon Skunk; In order to aid the sleepy effect this strain has I suggest the incredible Sativarin D ((Blue Dream x Tom Hills Haze) -- and to completely shut down all pain and anxiety for when it is even too strong to be aided by this incredible strain; mix a bit of AfgooeyXGhostOG and Rare Darkness (My two favorite Indicas I have tried medically grown).\u000a\u000aOverall its odd to say &quot;I was surprised\u000a&#39; but I was; after two bowl hits I was feeling groovy - I turned on Pet Sounds and continued to medicate with it the first time and got to the second LP I would listen to - Nilsson - Duit On Mon Dei -- by the time &quot;the first track kicked in I was experiencing the album on another level; something I&#39;ve always appreciated as a musician about Cannabis - Not all strains can have you focus in and hear new sounds and meanings to LP&#39;s you&#39;ve spun endlessly; but while relieving pain, stress, panic, depression nausea / hunger - it makes you even more creative than it does hungry; while either putting you off your feet or putting you on your feet.\u000a\u000aSo far while working on music strains such as this Gth, Blue Dream and Lemon Haze have been the best for coming up with complex and out of the ordinary musical ideas while Afgooey/Ghost OG &amp; East Coast Sour D/Tangerine Kush are the preferred strains for when I am ready to end end up allowing me to sort of settle into this process of &quot;rinse and repeat until its got a specific groove&quot; wether on guitar/bass/synths/keys/drums. Both are good for editing, adding effects and mixing the tracks while listening -- Although I find with the heavy amounts of Gth, Blue Dream &amp; Afgooey with just a tad of Rare Darkness ends up most beneficial for listening to the playback of my mix in its near complete / rough draft phase - it ends up feeling different vibrations and with haste I am changing and tweaking the final touches before mixing it down and listening.   The stuff is called GHOST TRAIN HAZE for a reason. \u000a\u000aImagine when in Ghost Busters 2 the ghost train came speeding down and through - That is the sensation enough of this excellent Cannabis gives.

VI recently found about half a gram of GTH in my stash and forgot if I liked it or not. It was a very bad head pain day where I felt super sad and  crying that I felt so much pain and had so much to do with my house and kids. Trying to push through, I filled my one hitter and took a puff. Almost immediately I was drifted away from all of the pain, guilt and sadness. I got up, cleaned my bathroom, did 6 loads of laundry folded and put away btw!  Made dinner for the family, bathed 3 kids and had even eaten dinner, which i just couldn&#39;t fathom despite my raging migraine, neck pain and all of that fun stuff. I most definitely will go stock up on this strain this weekend at Natural Selections in Peoria Az. This was just a perfect example of the miracle MMJ has been in transforming my life with Chronic Migraines, Occipital and Trigeminal Neuralgia. I have a life because of this plant. Very thankful to have it available to help me live out of bed again. &#128522;

VI acquired a Quarter of T27 Flower of Gtown Haze from Bluepoint Wellness in Connecticut along with 3 grams of T32 Hash, and T87 Shatter form.\u000a\u000aPersonally the hash form is my favorite just due to loving hash - I love smoking this out of a bowl or mixing it in a joint with either Lemon Skunk, East Coast Sour Diesel/Tangerine Haze Blue Dream to lift the heavier effect or to get perfect clarity euphoria and rest a bit of Afgooey and Rare Darkness.\u000a\u000aThe flower smells of a very pungent sweet earthy pine - the Shatter almost has a super sweet scent like fruit and candy :P - Although let me state that this is an excellent smelling, looking and tasting bud / concentrate.\u000a\u000aThis is perfect for when my ADHD needs to unwind; my anxiety / panic attacks are effecting me - Stress - PAIN - and it obliterates (along with a few other strains such as Rare Darkness, Afgooey etc) my PTSD Nightmare &quot;waking up in a cold sweat&quot; I had become accustom to.\u000a\u000aI am glad this is in CT - I want to go pick up an ounce to medicate with while continuing to try the ever expanding strains at Bluepoint combined with it to see what has the maximum benefit.\u000a\u000aFor Creativity and locking into Music I suggest the combination of GTH and Lemon Skunk; In order to aid the sleepy effect this strain has I suggest the incredible Sativarin D ((Blue Dream x Tom Hills Haze) -- and to completely shut down all pain and anxiety for when it is even too strong to be aided by this incredible strain; mix a bit of AfgooeyXGhostOG and Rare Darkness (My two favorite Indicas I have tried medically grown).\u000a\u000aOverall its odd to say &quot;I was surprised\u000a&#39; but I was; after two bowl hits I was feeling groovy - I turned on Pet Sounds and continued to medicate with it the first time and got to the second LP I would listen to - Nilsson - Duit On Mon Dei -- by the time &quot;the first track kicked in I was experiencing the album on another level; something I&#39;ve always appreciated as a musician about Cannabis - Not all strains can have you focus in and hear new sounds and meanings to LP&#39;s you&#39;ve spun endlessly; but while relieving pain, stress, panic, depression nausea / hunger - it makes you even more creative than it does hungry; while either putting you off your feet or putting you on your feet.\u000a\u000aSo far while working on music strains such as this Gth, Blue Dream and Lemon Haze have been the best for coming up with complex and out of the ordinary musical ideas while Afgooey/Ghost OG &amp; East Coast Sour D/Tangerine Kush are the preferred strains for when I am ready to end end up allowing me to sort of settle into this process of &quot;rinse and repeat until its got a specific groove&quot; wether on guitar/bass/synths/keys/drums. Both are good for editing, adding effects and mixing the tracks while listening -- Although I find with the heavy amounts of Gth, Blue Dream &amp; Afgooey with just a tad of Rare Darkness ends up most beneficial for listening to the playback of my mix in its near complete / rough draft phase - it ends up feeling different vibrations and with haste I am changing and tweaking the final touches before mixing it down and listening.   The stuff is called GHOST TRAIN HAZE for a reason. \u000a\u000aImagine when in Ghost Busters 2 the ghost train came speeding down and through - That is the sensation enough of this excellent Cannabis gives.   IF you are like me and mix and match quite a bit you&#39;ll find some fascinating combinations and synergies for both recreational reasons and more importantly medical reasons. Get you feeling as good as you can feel to take on the tasks at hand.\u000a\u000a\u000a-side note- (talking about CT Cannabis due to lack of information about CT growing and distrubit)\u000aI am happy that CT has four great producers of Medical Marijuana - Pharm Solutions produces the Gth &amp; Lemon Skunk - Both of which are at the upper tier of what PHARM Solutions has had out for flower -   \u000a\u000a\u000aAGL creates insane flower, and concentrates.... The buds of the AfgooeyXGhost OG buds are huge, dense, leafy and snow white.  for concentrates Advanced Grow Labs has produced the highest quality Shatter / Crunch I have had in CT The Blue Dream/Tom Hills, 84.6% Shatter is like a rock to break,  is a wake up call; the raredarkness 89% is perhaps just as hard and oddly sharp; just insane crunch which includes the amazing 91% &quot;citron&quot; (super snow dog).\u000a - while Theraplant has great flower diesel/tangerine haze and any of their pre-rolls;but their &quot;Da Bizzarre&quot; wax was a waste of money 100% although for pre rolls they make the larger joints with the better RAW paper - although a few of my medication bottles have joints that are hard to draw from due to how packed they are with finely grinded bud \u000a\u000a\u000a- I Find that while faster burning and less cannabis that Curaleaf nails the pre-rolls with perfect pull; they nail the strain Absolute Darkness, the shatters they create are not super hard and dont shine like Advanced Grow Labs does; although everything from OG Kush, GscoutCookie are top notch. super snow dog is absolutely stunning and they have the best CT medibles. this being my first review and not seeing these buds listed in CT I thought I&#39;d go over my view on the 4 companies and my experience with their buds.

VGreat sativa to get you motivated. It has a weak flavor with an earthy taste and starts with slow creeping body high. There is then a boost in energy mixed with a sudden onset of haziness or the feeling of a cloud over your frontal cortex. It also puts me in a great mood. It is absolutely my favorite sativa.

VWow!!! This strain is amazing. It gives an incredible cerebral high. I thought I was cruising along at at the edge of space...wow. It made me feel so good, no raciness, no buzzy just an incredible high. I will say this is one of the best I&#39;ve smoked even better than Panama Red. It gives a happy high that makes you want to get up and get things done. I felt some euphoria, oh yeah. It tastes really good, I got an earthy, citrus taste. I smoked a pre-roll, don&#39;t know what it looks like.  It lasted a good while, maybe an hour or more. I have occasional depression with my chronic pain, this really helped pull me out and got me smiling.

VI&#39;ve been fortunate to have had this strain in both flower and 3* bubble hash; the traits were the same with both - if accentuated with the hash. the keywords for this strain would be &#39;potent&#39; and &#39;creative&#39;. it also has sativa qualities - energizing, &#39;think-y&#39; (makes you get into your thoughts) - that some people (who prefer indicas) might want to avoid. that being said, this one&#39;s energizing aspect falls well short of, say, allen wrench, and it&#39;s head-y quality isn&#39;t as intense as strains like durban poison. I found myself enjoying moving to music - it felt good - and, on different occasions, playing music and drawing. the creativity  lasted quite a while too - what I call the &#39;keep at it&#39; trait. all good stuff in my book: this one&#39;s currently at #8 out of the 80-ish strains I&#39;ve tried.

VComing to you via CPS Fioraden B vape cartridge. I think of this strain as more of a sativa leaning hybrid maybe 65/35. Nice and potent, take it easy when first trying. It&#39;s gonna creep a little. I found the flavor to have hints of ginger, some citrus. Nice tasting. Definitely a head high but your body&#39;s going to know it too. Last 2-3 hours and come down rather gently considering how high it gets you.

Fast onset after a half a doob. crazy head high that slowly takes over the body but no couch lock. Do not recommend for people with high anxiety!\u000aAll in all a great strain for the Sativa lovers. Not for rookie smokers; VERY POTENT if care is taken through her life and drying and curing cycle. Absolutely love this one. Cheers to Rare Dankness.

I found myself enjoying moving to music - it felt good - and, on different occasions, playing music and drawing. the creativity  lasted quite a while too - what I call the &#39;keep at it&#39; trait. all good stuff in my book: this one&#39;s currently at #8 out of the 80-ish strains I&#39;ve tried.

VComing to you via CPS Fioraden B vape cartridge. I think of this strain as more of a sativa leaning hybrid maybe 65/35. Nice and potent, take it easy when first trying. It&#39;s gonna creep a little. I found the flavor to have hints of ginger, some citrus. Nice tasting. Definitely a head high but your body&#39;s going to know it too. Last 2-3 hours and come down rather gently considering how high it gets you.

VGhost Train Haze is a very intense sativa. It&#39;s excellent for depression. This strain gives you an incredible amount of focus, however this can be a bit overwhelming for more inexperienced users. Ghost Train gives intense body and head highs. With heavier use, you find it becomes more of a hazy euphoria, so if you&#39;re using this to concentrate keep in mind that there is a specific &quot;sweet spot&quot; to be achieved.\u000aFollow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.

VWow!!! This strain is amazing. It gives an incredible cerebral high. I thought I was cruising along at at the edge of space...wow. It made me feel so good, no raciness, no buzzy just an incredible high. I will say this is one of the best I&#39;ve smoked even better than Panama Red. It gives a happy high that makes you want to get up and get things done. I felt some euphoria, oh yeah. It tastes really good, I got an earthy, citrus taste. I smoked a pre-roll, don&#39;t know what it looks like.  It lasted a good while, maybe an hour or more. I have occasional depression with my chronic pain, this really helped pull me out and got me smiling.

VI just had a joint of this strain, 1st time I&#39;m smoking it, and I can say it&#39;s pretty good and strong stuff. Smell is piney and pungent. It gets you a pretty much cerebral high since the very first moment. Don&#39;t be scared, as the train start strong but is able to keep a solid pace without alienating you. It&#39;s a strong sativa and a typical haze flavor: not my favorite flavor type, still I like the high so far and I feel in peace with other people. Recommend if you like haze strains.

I am very focused. and the high is all in my head. I am very clear and &quot;up in the clouds&quot; it smells very flowery as a bud. but taste (to me) kind of like cat litter lol.

Nice and cerebral, lots of visual effects, bright colors. It&#39;s just a fun strain, fucking great. Killed my depression and anxiety too, surprisingly.

VGhost train smells and tastes great. High is immediate. But.... if you in anyway get anxiety DO NOT OVERDUE this  one. I&#39;ve had this but only a small amount. I do get anxiety so if you do not get paranoia or anx then you might enjoy this. But last night I smoked a fat one and I had what was similar to an anxiety attack after smoking this until I fell asleep. I don&#39;t know if it was this particular batch and they used chemicals or if that justvthe characteristic of GTH. I have not had this happen like this though. And I have tried psychedelics so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m a lightweight

VSo far, in my (relatively short) pot-smoking career, this is by far my favorite. A buddy handed me a joint of this and said \u201cit gives you a little gut-punch at first to command your respect and then you can go be high\u201d. He was right about that. It came on a little strong, but what he failed to mention is the other worlds you travel to while you\u2019re high.  Holy shit!  Closest I\u2019ve come (on weed) to actually tripping.  Not like hallucinating or anything, just a slight detachment.  Very cool! To me, this strain has effects with are very complex.  Which also means it doesn\u2019t get old. I just wish I could get it on the regular.

VI have tried a 24.8% THC batch of Ghost Train Haze from Redecan and I can say this stuff is potent. It gives you a very cerebral high and hits you hard. Do not expect much of a body buzz. It is good for concentrating on creative endeavours, amazing for trance work but leaves something to be desired when it comes to pain relief. This is definitely an uplifting strain when it comes to depression and leaves you with some serious munchies for those having trouble with nausea and appetite. I have anxiety but did not notice issues with this strain personally. It can leave you feeling a little foggy when you are coming down. Overall I had a great experience and am ordering more this month to use in tandem with a better pain relieving strain.

It&#39;s gonna creep a little. I found the flavor to have hints of ginger, some citrus. Nice tasting. Definitely a head high but your body&#39;s going to know it too. Last 2-3 hours and come down rather gently considering how high it gets you.

The feast, Royal Blend Hashish made solely from a worthy batch of Ghost Train Haze, tested at 28% THC. Not a bad starting point, eh. Golden brown and sticky, concentrated odors of  citrus, pine, &amp; tar. Melting and bubbling filling the bong with ghostly vapors. With the G Train rollin&#39; life is back to normal; energy, enough fog to erase last night and the ability to GSD (get sh*t done).

VGhost Train Haze is a very intense sativa. It&#39;s excellent for depression. This strain gives you an incredible amount of focus, however this can be a bit overwhelming for more inexperienced users. Ghost Train gives intense body and head highs. With heavier use, you find it becomes more of a hazy euphoria, so if you&#39;re using this to concentrate keep in mind that there is a specific &quot;sweet spot&quot; to be achieved.\u000aFollow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.

VI&#39;ve been fortunate to have had this strain in both flower and 3* bubble hash; the traits were the same with both - if accentuated with the hash. the keywords for this strain would be &#39;potent&#39; and &#39;creative&#39;. it also has sativa qualities - energizing, &#39;think-y&#39; (makes you get into your thoughts) - that some people (who prefer indicas) might want to avoid. that being said, this one&#39;s energizing aspect falls well short of, say, allen wrench, and it&#39;s head-y quality isn&#39;t as intense as strains like durban poison. I found myself enjoying moving to music - it felt good - and, on different occasions, playing music and drawing. the creativity  lasted quite a while too - what I call the &#39;keep at it&#39; trait. all good stuff in my book: this one&#39;s currently at #8 out of the 80-ish strains I&#39;ve tried.

VI have tried a 24.8% THC batch of Ghost Train Haze from Redecan and I can say this stuff is potent. It gives you a very cerebral high and hits you hard. Do not expect much of a body buzz. It is good for concentrating on creative endeavours, amazing for trance work but leaves something to be desired when it comes to pain relief. This is definitely an uplifting strain when it comes to depression and leaves you with some serious munchies for those having trouble with nausea and appetite. I have anxiety but did not notice issues with this strain personally. It can leave you feeling a little foggy when you are coming down. Overall I had a great experience and am ordering more this month to use in tandem with a better pain relieving strain.

VI&#39;ve only had this strain twice but both times it was amazing. The first eighth I had of this definitely leaned towards the Neville&#39;s Wreck side more (Sativa pheno) and had a heavy mind ripping psychedelic high to it. This time around it seems to be leaning towards the Ghost OG side of things (Indica pheno.) The cerebral high is muted compared to the Sativa leaning pheno but the body high/stone is off the charts intense. After taking only 4 hits of it and THEN having walked a mile I was still so stoned when I got home that I took a 3 hour nap. Woke up to catch the bus, smoked another small bowl heading to the bus, and fell asleep on the bus lol! Now THAT&#39;S some serious Indica leaning stuff right there, I&#39;ll tell you what! \u000a\u000aAs for bag appeal it didn&#39;t have much. Buds are on the wispy side and are dark green, almost brown, with dark dark orange hairs. No trichomes sparkling on the bud (which isn&#39;t necessary in order for it to be good but it&#39;s always nice to get saturated bud.) The taste was very spicy and earthy but surprisingly it wasn&#39;t that harsh of smoke. I&#39;ve barely coughed off of any of the bud I&#39;ve smoked from this eighth. \u000a\u000aAll in all I&#39;m definitely going to have to get it again because both pheno&#39;s are awesome and shine bright in their own unique ways.

V\u2022 &#161;this one has me perplexed! \u2022 \u000a\u000aWhen I first opened the medicine bottle of this-CT Pharmaceutical Solutions&#39; thc-26% sativa &#127802; , I flashed-back to 7th grade &amp; thought I was buying dime bag-material.. it&#39;s all stemy, dry, teeny-tiny buds (or shake) smaller than a dime, with nary an aroma at all! Needless to say, my expectations were minimal when it also burned quickly bc so dry. Surprising head-to-toe euphoria with every blast of my bong, but sadly flavorless too -- in spite of its&#39; 4.71% terpenoids. It&#39;s a smooth, earthy, appetite-inducing smoke, likely good for Any + All w/o MJ-induced anxiety... So it&#39;s a tough call \u2014 I&#39;d give it 3.5 \u2728 if I could.. yes, it&#39;s a lovely head high + pain reliever, but w/o any real flavor &amp; aroma, it sorta feels like only half of an experience. \u2022 \u270c&#127997;

VI finally got my hands on an 1/8th of GTH after searching for months! I picked up a gram earlier in the year and have been trying to get more ever since. The nugs are super rezy and have a strong lemon-jack smell to it. The first inhale is like a punch to the throat. After exhaling, I felt like I had just stepped on a bullet train to ghost hell. There was a heady rush at first and then it settles into euphoric bliss. All my social anxiety was gone and I felt like a boss.

VI gave GTH five stars, but in advance. This review is to update the listing for it, since it says it&#39;s not available near here. Not only do I have it growing right here, I took my clone cuttings from a neighbor. I know two others who also grow it here in southern Colorado. I&#39;ll update when she goes to bud.\u000a\u000a...updating, she merited her five stars. Tough plant in the garden, and a must try even for those who don&#39;t grow.

Idk if I stressed them somehow or what but around week 3 they were vigorous and happy. That&#39;s only for growing as for the high it&#39;s exactly as described and very potent. A tad overhyped but what great strain hasn&#39;t been to some extent. Very pleasant high a must have strain.. Top 10 all time for me and am now a rare Dankness junkie after TGAs stuff.

Vtried this strain as a &quot;cake icing&quot; ( texture of concentrates; not actual cake icing) and it was amazing. extremely heady with tingles through the neck followed by spinal relaxation while promoting an upbeat buzz. Very stimulating for the memory (contrary to common consensus) while offering a clearing of the mind and thought processes for those with add and adhd tendencies and ailment. minty in scent the taste is almost floral like, with undertones of spicy haze. Very good.

When you first open it up you are greeted with a sweet orange citrus smell that only gets better when ground. When you start smoking though is when you can feel the difference with this one. This is a strong and fun strain that lets you think and feel with a strong cerebral feeling that hits you quickly and strongly like a train along with a happy and euphoric feeling that will make you take a deep breath and smile. It also has a nice buzzing kind of feel to it that feels great. Overall, it&#39;s a great sativa with a great feeling that I always want to save some of to experience when I really want to feel great and have a wonderful time. I highly recommend this strain to anyone that can handle its strength, it&#39;s absolutely wonderful!

VGhost Train Haze may be my favorite smoke ever. I am a big sativa guy and this is as good as it gets. DEFINITELY the best smelling weed I ever smelled. Everytime before I smoke I can&#39;t help but just sniff it multiple times. Such a perfect smell. Can get whatever you want to do done and makes you extra creative. Just makes everything more enjoyable. Highly recommended!

Vim sure most would give a 5 star, due to mental issues, i can not recomend  this to any who suffer from anxiety, panic or those types of problems. this is powerful, i took a one hit and got twisted. effects felt instantly, very headzie, semi dizzy, and if you use buds that make you feel that way, dont check this one out. i wouldnt say it brought panic, but very close. Anyways i got an eighth so hopefully i can smoke it , because the late end buzz is not bad. i did hit some cbd kush, so im not sure. Has that funky chemical smell, and the hit i did take was harsh. Some times after i hit the bud for a few days, it mellows out, but i will only take a one and done. and the person who smoked 3 and a half joints, what were you thinking? wow 3 doobs? you may be puffing too much.

I have diabetes and hoping it would lower my glucose and decrease appetite.  It did both.\u000aIt made me relaxed, but not sleepy.  However, the next day, I was pacing the floor with anxiety, which I am prone to in the first place.  Not fun.

VI love this strain. GTH is the most useful thing I have come across in the MMJ world. I was terrified to try it, because reviews about it made it seem that this would cause so much paranoia and anxiety. I suffer from 3 painful autoimmune disorders and two mental health conditions, one which is PTSD. But this really did not impact those. I love GTH because it actually makes me want to leave the house. I feel completely normal on the strain, like I used to feel before I got sick. I am so regularly fatigued that I don&#39;t even feel overtly high on this in small doses, which is ideal for me. I recommend this highly to anyone dealing with tiresome illnesses, GI issues and fatigue, because this will knock them out of the park. The taste is pretty unremarkable but not the most offensive. I don&#39;t vape this at night, but it&#39;s a favorite morning or weekend strain. I am a fully functional working individual and this is perfect for my days off when I need to get things done. My favorite so far.

VI use this in the form of kief from my dispensary and love it. Another uplifting, energizing yet relaxing strain that has been in my daily lexicon for a while. I put the Ghost Train Haze kief on all kinds of flowers and it changes most flowers to a more energetic mind space. I don&#39;t like Indica&#39;s. The make me groggy and unhappy. So I stick with 90% hybrids and sativas. This helps with pain and mood. Does not knock me out and I am using kief at about 40% THC. I have used this in conjunction with CBD flowers and it gives them the THC sativas energetic high and you can still use CBD rich flowers that are typically lower in THC.

Vi like this strain preferably vaped. the taste is impeccable. when smoked as a joint, a few tokes will do you for a more creative and sativa light high. \u000a\u000aif you&#39;re like me and never quit a joint once it is started, be prepared for a mind-wandering day. you may want to top off the evening or follow up with an indica when you smoke again.\u000a\u000achoo-choo!

VI keep getting this as free pre-rolls at my spot (h4l) and it is very good. it has a light, nearly tea-like flavor and it seems like it was made to last. two hits and I am pain free and productive, four hits and I am sleeping.

VIn my home grown stash I am running out of Trainwreck and Gorilla Glue#12, and only have Blue Dream to use as a day time sativa, I like Blue Dream as medicine, but I crave more energetic sativas for recreation. As I was headed out on a short camping trip up the North Umpqua River, I stopped at my favorite local dispensary and picked up this little gem. My nose is insensitive to many aromas in cannabis, only skunk and chemical/fuel smells come through much, this bud had flavor but I couldn&#39;t detect it clearly enough(not unusual for me). The initial effect was fast, uplifting, but mellow. As the buzz built I found myself sitting on a rock with my feet in the river. Osprey circled overhead, the river rapids thundered relentlessly, I found myself in traced with the beauty around me, and had about as close to a out of body experience as one could have on Cannabis. I would love to try this strain again, and I&#39;m even more enthusiastic with trying the parent plant Nevilles Wreck.

VI waited about a week before I reviewed this strain. I have only gotten the opportunity to smoke maybe a few different strains.... Like maybe five. Before this- I always wondered what type I liked. Do I like sativa, indica or hybrid. Well after this amazing weed I&#39;ve come to decide I like all three. Each has a place in the day. This one is great for getting shit done. If your tired- this one is like a cup of coffee. If you want to have sex/ this one is WONDERFUL for this. Would treat a poor mood!! However if you need to fall asleep probably not the best choice. However- I still don&#39;t have issues when I do smoke it at night- just keeps me up a few hours longer. I really enjoyed getting to try a sativa because I wasn&#39;t sure what I liked! Now I know it&#39;s all for me- just have to learn to smoke each strain differently.

Thinking about stuff that doesn&#39;t make sense. Made me chill instantly... But then the sativa kicked in for like 15 mins. I have anxiety but idk my tolerance to the feeling in strong sativa doesn&#39;t  trigger it anymore wouldn&#39;t recommend it to those who can&#39;t be chill on pot. (move to a legal state and the anxiety of smoke pot blows out the window &#128521;)  knocked out my back pain. And I&#39;m still high that&#39;s most important.

Real strong and works pretty well in small doses, but if you&#39;re not careful, this thing will just pin you to the couch or bed and your mind will just feel super loose. Not a negative if you&#39;re looking for that. Gives me mild paranoia if I use too much, so if you&#39;re susceptible to that and your tolerance isn&#39;t that high, this might not be for you. It tastes good and gives a nice starting head and body buzz at least. It&#39;s good but not something I&#39;ll be prioritizing to get.

VI really have nothing critical/negative to say about this strain.  This is my third time having some and as far as Sativa goes I would consider this a mainstay strain.  It smells of both citrus and pine and really has a great flavor profile on the exhale.  Always exhale through the nose and you will really taste the flavor profile the way your supposed to.  Stings the nostrils a bit in a good way and really reminds me of an orange coated in pine needles sitting on a freshly cut stump of cedar log.  For me, I require very little of this strain to get to my own personal ideal high.  Qualities I note are focus, energy-or at least a mental sharpness-it isn\u2019t heavy, not in small doses at least.  It really gets the creative juices flowing and makes you sort of want to engage in your environment.  It makes me crave to do something whether it be a physical activity, running an errand, internet research, drawing, play with my Amazon echo dot, etc...I would also describe the high as clean, sharp, and airy.  Overall this is a great strain if your looking for something for the daytime that will allow you to be high but still function at a high level if need be.  Again, I haven\u2019t had a really \u201cheavy\u201d session with Ghost Train Haze so if you plan on taking dabs or bong rips the strain will certainly affect you on a different level.  I think all sativa smokers know a little goes a long way and a lot can make you edgy or paranoid.  Try it out! You won\u2019t be disappointed.

Vtried this strain as a &quot;cake icing&quot; ( texture of concentrates; not actual cake icing) and it was amazing. extremely heady with tingles through the neck followed by spinal relaxation while promoting an upbeat buzz. Very stimulating for the memory (contrary to common consensus) while offering a clearing of the mind and thought processes for those with add and adhd tendencies and ailment. minty in scent the taste is almost floral like, with undertones of spicy haze. Very good.

VThis one doesn&#39;t disappoint at all had some troubles with first few weeks of seedling phase b4 veg they kept collapsing from what I thought was under watering but would get over watered even worse. Idk if I stressed them somehow or what but around week 3 they were vigorous and happy. That&#39;s only for growing as for the high it&#39;s exactly as described and very potent. A tad overhyped but what great strain hasn&#39;t been to some extent. Very pleasant high a must have strain.. Top 10 all time for me and am now a rare Dankness junkie after TGAs stuff.

Good yields and easy to trim. \u000a\u000aAfter drying and curing for two weeks I sampled the first nug. Very earthy on inhale and smooth on the exhale. I let it sit for a few minutes and felt a slow buzz coming on. Time for hit 2. I do one hitters so each bowl is fresh. Sampling plant B same earthy taste in and smooth out. After a couple of minutes the full buzz kicked in. \u000a\u000aVery nice relaxing high more like an indica in some ways washed my stress away and my back pain was reduced considerably. The buzz lasted a couple of hours and was thoroughly enjoyable. \u000a\u000aI would recommend for stress, anxiety, and pain. A top notch Sativa!\u000a

VI literally just smoked some ghost train haze for the 1st time. While i have smoked for a couple of decades (wow I&#39;m aging myself) regardless i know nothing about flowers or anything really about weed except whetheror not it did what it&#39;s supposed to and this 1 definitely does. Iam on Disability due to  chronic back pain and nerve damage among other things i also have really bad panic &amp;anxiety attacks. This has not made me anxious and my body feels like a big bag of wet laundry but my pain is so much better so while it&#39;s working I&#39;m going to eat some Cheetos and watch t.v . So in conclusion If you deal with chronic pain or really anything you just want to relax from you have to buy this &amp; smoke it but don&#39;t go slow it only took me 6 tokes feel like this.

V\u2022 &#161;this one has me perplexed! \u2022 \u000a\u000aWhen I first opened the medicine bottle of this-CT Pharmaceutical Solutions&#39; thc-26% sativa &#127802; , I flashed-back to 7th grade &amp; thought I was buying dime bag-material.. it&#39;s all stemy, dry, teeny-tiny buds (or shake) smaller than a dime, with nary an aroma at all! Needless to say, my expectations were minimal when it also burned quickly bc so dry. Surprising head-to-toe euphoria with every blast of my bong, but sadly flavorless too -- in spite of its&#39; 4.71% terpenoids. It&#39;s a smooth, earthy, appetite-inducing smoke, likely good for Any + All w/o MJ-induced anxiety... So it&#39;s a tough call \u2014 I&#39;d give it 3.5 \u2728 if I could.. yes, it&#39;s a lovely head high + pain reliever, but w/o any real flavor &amp; aroma, it sorta feels like only half of an experience. \u2022 \u270c&#127997;

VI&#39;ve only had this strain twice but both times it was amazing. The first eighth I had of this definitely leaned towards the Neville&#39;s Wreck side more (Sativa pheno) and had a heavy mind ripping psychedelic high to it. This time around it seems to be leaning towards the Ghost OG side of things (Indica pheno.) The cerebral high is muted compared to the Sativa leaning pheno but the body high/stone is off the charts intense. After taking only 4 hits of it and THEN having walked a mile I was still so stoned when I got home that I took a 3 hour nap. Woke up to catch the bus, smoked another small bowl heading to the bus, and fell asleep on the bus lol! Now THAT&#39;S some serious Indica leaning stuff right there, I&#39;ll tell you what! \u000a\u000aAs for bag appeal it didn&#39;t have much. Buds are on the wispy side and are dark green, almost brown, with dark dark orange hairs. No trichomes sparkling on the bud (which isn&#39;t necessary in order for it to be good but it&#39;s always nice to get saturated bud.) The taste was very spicy and earthy but surprisingly it wasn&#39;t that harsh of smoke. I&#39;ve barely coughed off of any of the bud I&#39;ve smoked from this eighth. \u000a\u000aAll in all I&#39;m definitely going to have to get it again because both pheno&#39;s are awesome and shine bright in their own unique ways.

VI picked up a 16th of this beautiful bud up from L&#39;Eagle LLC in Denver. I saw it on Leafly and was immediately intrigued by the incredibly high rating. I have PTSD and usually with that sativas are a bad idea, but this one was a perfect day time strain for me. I was able to go to a job interview and preform all my daily duties after a medium sized joint of GTH. I immediately felt a head rush of creativity and i was super focused as well.  I will definitely be buying this one again.

But the sweet diesel smell smacks me in the face every time I open the container. This was very sticky, you could use this stuff to stick a paper to the wall. The effects of Ghost train Haze are very intense and borderline psycodelic. My thoughts are racing, my body tingles, ocular pressure and very euphoric. Sativa lovers, if you see it get it.

Piney , gasoline , heavy nice smooth inhale and pleasant.. Boom , your high ! However your active , man your mind is racing a little bit until it hits your body , then you feel the effect of happiness and &quot; I Feel Good &quot;. If you get a chance try this out and enjoy !

Smoking or vaporizing this at any temperature you never get couch locked with the ghost but it hits you hard in the get off your ass and make something area of the brain.  \u000a\u000aYou will want to build stuff, don\u2019t care who you are find some legos or prepare some home improvements because you will be excited about the possibility of even creating something from your imagination.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t smoke or vape this at night, as noted above it makes you think and you\u2019re energized to do new things; if you suffer from ADHD or Anxiety then you\u2019ll sit in bed and your mind won\u2019t shut off.  Smoke a good indica to counter this late in the evening.\u000a\u000aYou can and will be able to work on this strain but at higher dosages you may be less inclined to do things other people want you to do and more wanting to do only things that interest you.

Vim sure most would give a 5 star, due to mental issues, i can not recomend  this to any who suffer from anxiety, panic or those types of problems. this is powerful, i took a one hit and got twisted. effects felt instantly, very headzie, semi dizzy, and if you use buds that make you feel that way, dont check this one out. i wouldnt say it brought panic, but very close. Anyways i got an eighth so hopefully i can smoke it , because the late end buzz is not bad. i did hit some cbd kush, so im not sure. Has that funky chemical smell, and the hit i did take was harsh. Some times after i hit the bud for a few days, it mellows out, but i will only take a one and done. and the person who smoked 3 and a half joints, what were you thinking? wow 3 doobs? you may be puffing too much.

When you first open it up you are greeted with a sweet orange citrus smell that only gets better when ground. When you start smoking though is when you can feel the difference with this one. This is a strong and fun strain that lets you think and feel with a strong cerebral feeling that hits you quickly and strongly like a train along with a happy and euphoric feeling that will make you take a deep breath and smile. It also has a nice buzzing kind of feel to it that feels great. Overall, it&#39;s a great sativa with a great feeling that I always want to save some of to experience when I really want to feel great and have a wonderful time. I highly recommend this strain to anyone that can handle its strength, it&#39;s absolutely wonderful!

VVery very nice strain. Doesn&#39;t hit you straight away thou. It takes a couple of minutes. It&#39;s a really fun high, giving you that uplifted &amp; euphoric feeling. It&#39;s a pure sativa, it goes completely to your head. Not recommended to anyone who is starting out. this stuff is no joke!

VI finally got my hands on an 1/8th of GTH after searching for months! I picked up a gram earlier in the year and have been trying to get more ever since. The nugs are super rezy and have a strong lemon-jack smell to it. The first inhale is like a punch to the throat. After exhaling, I felt like I had just stepped on a bullet train to ghost hell. There was a heady rush at first and then it settles into euphoric bliss. All my social anxiety was gone and I felt like a boss. I&#39;m def a weed snob and this is the best haze I ever blazed &#128536;&#128168;&#128168;&#128168;

My pain was a distant memory and I felt happy happy happy. I wanted to hang out and talk but hell if it was 1am. Then I had to go hit up those red velvet cupcakes in the kitchen. Ahh.. the munchies.\u000a\u000aSo, considering my chronic pain, depression, and trashed stomach with zero appetite I say this strain has its perks. I felt great!

Not only do I have it growing right here, I took my clone cuttings from a neighbor. I know two others who also grow it here in southern Colorado. I&#39;ll update when she goes to bud.\u000a\u000a...updating, she merited her five stars. Tough plant in the garden, and a must try even for those who don&#39;t grow.

VI gained altitude before I finished my first draw.  The effect came on quick and powerful and left me spaced for about 30 minutes.  Afterward, I was relaxed but aware and alert.  Went out for a while and enjoyed sunshine on the deck watching the river roll by.    Not a strain for beginners.  Sample carefully until you know your tolerance.   Try it with a friend.

GTH was very typical of haze type strains it has an original burst of energy giving way to a nice relaxing upbeat high. This one deffinetly stands out for it&#39;s complexed strong flavor profile and it&#39;s classic Sativa high. I will deffinetly be on the lookout for more of this.

However, in a personal sesh, in a loose packed bowl  after a few hits it wasn&#39;t as potent. After twenty minutes the potentcy effects wore off and I wanted to relight.\u000a\u000a-Slow, deep couchlock\u000a-Very potent\u000a-Deep-Focused Thinking\u000a-Strong, relaxing body reverberations\u000a-Forgetfulness is possible\u000a-Earthy, herbal taste with a sweet exhale\u000a-Sweet, burnt chocolate aromas \u000a\u000aI thinks it&#39;s a good potent strain more for laid back social gatherings, unless it&#39;s me myself and I not very plausible.

Vloooovveeee this! couple hit of this I was already feeling heaviness and being in slow motion and soooo relaxed but I&#39;m focus and I was watching a horror film at the time and I noticed that I was more jumpy than usual haha. More hit I took, more sinking I went. Once I fall asleep I stay asleep all night so it&#39;s pretty good strain for whoever has a flip. it&#39;s definitely good strain for falling asleep fast.

VKnockout strains are few and far between in this day and age, with all the new strains popping up around Las Vegas. I purchased my Ghost Train Haze from Inyo Fine Cannabis here in Vegas. Its rated at 25% THC and 31% total Active Cannabinoids! The flavor was Heavy with a citrus,lemon flavor on the tongue followed by the OG Kush dankness... This is some of the greatest flower I have ever tasted. And as for the high! I am very clear headed and energetic after smoking two bowls out of my spoon pipe. I highly recommend this strain to anyone that needs pain and discomfort relief or for anyone that wants a killer strain to keep you going through the day, and at $11 a Gram? Cant go wrong.

V[Super Silver Haze X Train Wreck]\u000a\u000a\u2022 Process\u2014Steep rate of onset. Also lasted a while. //\u000a\u000a\u2022&#160;Stoniness\u2014Strong. Was driving to run errands and time was passing very slowly within and between tasks. Attention switching was also effortful. I described myself as &quot;fucking bricked&quot; and that felt pretty on point. //\u000a\u000a\u2022 Somatic\u2014Very droopy and red eyes, moderate dry mouth (I continuously had to drink water). I definitely looked stoned. No hunger pangs related to consumption, though, which was nice. \u000aNot sure if also because of allergies, but my voice was hoarse and congested. //\u000a\u000a\u2022 Mood\u2014Slightly paranoid because I thought everyone could tell I was high (probably true) and was judging me for it (probably not true). Otherwise, I was really zoned out. Some combination between socially hyperaware and mentally floating around. //\u000a\u000a\u2022 Fx\u2014I was able to drive and run shopping errands but with considerable effort involved. It was moderately effortful to compile a shopping list to remind myself what I had to buy from Sprouts. Engaging in each task (what to buy next; where to drive next; what steps were involved in paying for things) was also effortful. I felt flustered when talking to the Sprouts and Target cashiers. Really did not like and would have not preferred social interaction with this strain.

VI took a 1.8 year break from Cannabis after giving up growing and moving to a medical state.  Well in that time frame this strain has changed from a delicious \u000a citrus haze with amazing soaring high, in to a fermented grape smelling, vomit inducing bitter taste &amp; a dirty &quot;just smoked a plastic bag&quot;  high.  It didn&#39;t even seem like weed..i guess Im going to have to change this one from 9 stars to negative 500 stars.. Not sure what could be making the plant change so much.. \u000a\u000aI bought it from a medical dispensary in Az so I know it must be clean and legit, right?

VGood strong sativa high. But I couldn&#39;t get used to that taste in a million years. Like chewing on a raw ginger root. It&#39;s just one of those crosses that didn&#39;t work out too well IMO. Worth trying I guess. But not worth more than 1.5 stars due to the way-to-weird-and-intense flavor. If it tasted better...5 stars for sure. So sad...:(

VHopped on the bus went to Arizona  Selections and just snatched a g, rolled it in a white owl, lit it and...1puff...2puff...none....3 and what the fuck am I hearing? Sounds like, a freight train coming, kept smoking, and all of a sudden I started getting choked by 2 big ass hands only, for real for real . Then I hear the train stop in front of me, by that time  my shoulder spasm starts getting numb and then it spread to the rest of my body my god I did not know whiplash lasts 7 whole days of pain and finally something REALLY WORKS FOR PAIN. Wait, and the smoke flavor is nice, smells woody, and when you inhale it&#39;s smooth also exhaling oh wow, oh wow, so fruitful.

V2.5/5. I have no idea what the hype about this bud is about. I got an 1/8th of this for $15/g &quot;tested at 32.8% THC&quot; from Green Life in Bellevue and let me just say I must&#39;ve got a terrible batch because this is the worst flower I&#39;ve had in a while. It wasn&#39;t terrible, just terribly misleading, which I think honestly killed it for me, and this is all after I let the dude know that I&#39;m going to be reviewing the bud. I got one big fluffy nug sealed in a plastic pouch that off the back didn&#39;t look like it was anything thing close to 32% let alone $15/g (i have a pic uploaded for reference) but I know appearances can be deceiving so whatever. The smell was disappointing, it smelled very aged and earthy with a touch of spices and lemon, upon breaking into the buds it had a much fresher sweeter smell that made me think that maybe it could of lived up to the stats... A year ago. Really not much there at all. The burn was smooth and tasted very earthy but the taste didn&#39;t linger so it was ok. The high was mild, not to intense, I stayed awake and active mentally for the most part until the later half where I was just couchlocked, burning away trying to keep my buzz. I would love to try a better quality version of this product, but after an experience like this I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going out of my way any time soon for it.

It&#39;s one of only 2 strains I&#39;ve ran across in the last 15 years that are enough to make me gag from the disgusting flavor it. The other being GSC.
