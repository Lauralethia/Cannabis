VOverall sick bud. More of a never-ending  uplifting high but still nice body-relaxing/pain relieving effects. Has a funky nutty note to it but smokes with a cool menthol-like taste and scent of strawberries.

VLos Angeles Kush did well again with LA Kush. My eighth was beautiful to look at. One bud alone weighed 2.5 grams! The bud had two different shades, medium to darker green that looked much lighter because of all the fine clear trichomes &amp; burnt orange pistils everywhere. Buds super dense. The taste &amp; smell i got was that of pine. The effects made me VERY happy and then VERY relaxed. An uplifted body high. What you expect from a top shelf product. PEACE &amp; LOVE

VFelt more like a saliva than indica. Was able to carry on a fun, pleasant convo and really enjoyed the primarily head high (with a tinge of tingle in my toes) UNTIL the unbearable dry mouth came on. Seriously one of the worst I have experienced.

VBought at &#39;1ste Hulp&#39;, Amsterdam. Very good hybrid. Uplifted, giggly high with a relaxing Indica-like body experience. Ideal strain if you want to get some work done (not physically demanding).\u000aCoordination is a bit off sometimes, complex tasks may seem slightly overwhelming. Not very strong visuals but strong auditive experience.
