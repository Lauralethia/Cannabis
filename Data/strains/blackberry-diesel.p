VJust so-so for me. I&#39;m a sativa girl and this one just didn&#39;t pack the punch of euphoria and energy I was expecting. Not much in the way of relaxation for me either. One upside-it&#39;s delicious and beautiful bud-light greens and purples blanketed in crystals and with a taste exactly as its name, blackberry with a hint of diesel. Maybe it just wasn&#39;t the right strain for me, and you&#39;ll like it better-doesn&#39;t hurt to try! I just know I won&#39;t be picking this up again :/

VHas a wonderful flavour and aroma. The high begins in an uplifting satisfying buzz which quickly turned into a couch session. \u000aWonderful balance of sativa and indica characteristics.

VMe personally,I was not a big fan of this strain. The taste was good but, the very heavy side affect of being anxious gave me a panic attack. I have friends with this same problem as me where I get panic attacks or anxiety attacks from strains with high negatives in; paranoia and anxious that it is really hard to enjoy the high. Good strain but just not for me
