VIf you want a great almost Orange tasting strain this is the one!also great producer not super potent but tastey my buddy picked a pack of this up from the Crockett fam it was like 80$ for a 10 pack I believe so he popped them all we were looking for the best phenos of the 10 seeds and one plant he grew from all of the 10 seeds was labeled the Clementine #4 and I swear this pheno of Clementine is super lemon tasteing almost reminds me of the Lemon tree strain if you&#39;ve ever had lemon tree and I mean the real lemon tree the taste is unforgettable and this pheno almost reminds me of it so anyways we have crossed this pheno with other stuff and well see what it brings to the table first cross is Clementine x animal cookie A.k.a the cleminal..... lol

VNot smoking on this strain exactly but rather a hybrid of it.\u000a\u000aThe strain is Mimosa (cultivated by jungle boys)\u000aIt is a cross between Clementine X Purple Punch\u000a\u000aThis strain is fantastic! A couple tokes of a joint of this gets me mad lifted. The high is nice. It feels incredibly euphoric and uplifting. Very chatty on this strain lol. But also a creative aspect to this. I can get work done and brainstorm well on this strain. I&#39;d highly recommend Clementine or a hybrid with it!

VAre you tired? Are you lacking the energy and focus you need to get things done? Do you still need to paint your house, build a deck, run a marathon and babysit a small energetic child? Then let me tell you, this is the strain for you! I was focused, calm, but an energy producing machine! Every time I knocked something off my list, I was ready to tackle something else. I wanted to jump a mile high and walk around the sun, but the level headed feel of this strain kept me from making those bad decisions. If you are looking for a good, clean head high, with strong effects in the motivation department you will not be disappointed!

Vclones well, trains decently and grows short enough for a sativa. smells like someone left a box of lil cuties in the grow room! one of my top five desert island strains. nice anxiety free focused effect (in light doses) that&#39;s an absolute pleasure to vape. even when smoked in a joint you can still taste it, just not as sweet. this is my rotating sativa along with Jack herer. just smooths out my anxiety disorder, social discomfort and depression.

VI just tried this strain for the first time in a Pax Era Pod so I can&#39;t speak to the flower, but I&#39;m loving this as a daytime strain. I was a little nervous because sativas tend to give me anxiety, but Clementine made me feel alert yet super chill with no sleepiness. It&#39;s energetic in that I&#39;ve gotten a lot done on a day where I was generally feeling pretty sleepy and achey, but it&#39;s not the racy, caffeine-like energy rush/crash I&#39;ve experienced with other sativa strains; it&#39;s very even and brings you down slowly. Also, it tastes great. The only downside is that it&#39;s not super focused; I found myself energized and inspired to start a bunch of different things only to get distracted and completely forget what I was initially doing -.-

VI have a lot of different types of Sativa. Clementine gives you lots of energy even late at night. It does reduce stress and keeps you calm and focused even while running all over the place from the Sativian effects. No let down after and high lasts about 2.5 hours. No paranoia or anxiety great strain

VThis strain packs a sweet citrus taste that fills your mouth. Immediately I was left with a light and euphoric feeling of content. As someone who suffers with anxiety I would say this strain didn\u2019t trigger it, or at least not noticeably to me. Great for focus or a day of errands to give you a nice relaxed awake feeling to get your shit done. One critique would be that this definitely isn\u2019t a weed with high psychedelic effects, it\u2019s definitely more of a get up and do strain with a small smile plated on your lips all day.

VClementine is a day time winner. A wonderful Sativa that tastes like its name. Excellent strain for ADD/ADHD. Clementine is great for mornings and use throughout the day. Helps with clarity, focus, staying on task. It helps me have patience enough not to rush my work. I give it an 8 out of 10 for help with ADD/ADHD. Clementine is a happy, energetic, and content buzz.

VSuper sativa. I&#39;m more of an indica hybrid kind of guy because sativas are usually too heady for me. However this strain even testing at 29% total cannaboids is smokable without any anxiety. This is my strain if I need work done. Just got done cleaning my whole house while jamming to pandora. I love this strain for its uplifting happiness! It smells just like the clementine oranges. A must try for any seasoned smoker!

VThe third strain I&#39;ve tried, the first true sativa, and oh BOY is this a good one.\u000a\u000aBefore anything else, I have to comment on the taste: the flavor of this strain is A++ AMAZING! When I got this, it was in concentrate form in a vape cartridge from Timeless Vapes. They were having a 15% off sale on vapes at the dispensary I got this from (Nova Dispensary in Mesa, AZ). I told my budtender I enjoy sweet, fruity, floral flavors, and was looking for a strain that is great at relieving severe pain (my menstrual cramps have been AWFUL this time around and I was in desperate need of something other than a heavy indica to smoke for the following reason), while also either not making me any more tired, or even better, LESSENING my fatigue. (I am always tired and run down, I haven&#39;t been diagnosed but I&#39;m almost positive it&#39;s Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I plan to see a doctor about it once other more pressing medical issues are addressed.)\u000a\u000aHe suggested a cartridge of Clementine. I had never heard of this strain before, so I asked him what it tasted like, and he said it was like eating those little mandarin oranges, or like biting into one of those sweet little Halo/Cutie oranges. He was TOTALLY right! This strain is like inhaling the freshest, sweetest orange you&#39;ve ever tasted. Also a few other citrus/tropical flavors: some hits taste faintly of lemon and/or grapefruit (mainly in the  form of a sweet-and-sour accent), and I picked up on a few spicy, herbal, earthy notes as well. I can&#39;t speak so much to the smoke from the flower-form of this strain, but the vapor produced by the concentrate smells AMAZING. Even my grandmother, who&#39;s newer to the whole idea of medical cannabis use and previously never much liked the smell of cannabis products, said that the vapor smells great. I&#39;m almost tempted to sit in my car and vape on this so the interior of my car smells all tropical and fruity.\u000a\u000aNow onto the effects. When I asked what symptoms this strain helped to relieve, my budtender used the information from good ol&#39; Leafly&#39;s strain page: stress, depression, fatigue, pain, headaches. Sounds like me in a nutshell. I was a bit concerned because pain was the 4th out of 5 symptoms listed in terms of what the strain popularly helps with, but I decided to try it anyway... and oh my GODS I&#39;m glad I did. First of all, this is a great wake-and-bake strain. Just a couple good hits off this concentrate and I was motivated to leap out of bed, make a decent breakfast, and hop right into the shower. I even took a &quot;full&quot; shower (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shaved everything, and lotion afterwards), which I usually only take once every one to two weeks or so simply because I so severely lack the energy to take anything but a quickie. Now I&#39;m chilling out on the couch, waiting to go out and get my nails done, all nice and clean and smelling sweet and fruity (just like this strain) with soft, clean skin and hair. I feel GREAT! As someone whose depression can destroy motivation and the will to get out of bed in the morning, this is WONDERFUL medicine. Then there&#39;s the pain: two hits and I was feeling happy, energized, and motivated. Four hits? My killer menstrual pain? GONE. My pain is often worse in the morning right when I wake up. I rolled over and toked on this, and within minutes, the pain was bearable. A few more minutes and it was gone. Simply amazing.\u000a\u000aThe only thing that gets this strain docked a star has to do with some of the negative side effects. Granted, I did get a little TOO stoned on this yesterday (I mean, it was Stoney Saturday), so it could have simply been because I just partook a bit too much, but after a while I started to experience a pretty severe headache. I know &quot;headache&quot; is one of the symptoms this strain was listed to help, but maybe after a certain amount of it, its effects sort of start to contradict itself. (Or maybe it&#39;s just one of those cases of &quot;every person experiences it differently&quot;.) In any case, the headache was bad enough to where I had to actually try to take a nap. I slept a couple hours but the headache came back later and I ended up just going to bed early. After a while I also started to notice some dizziness, blurred vision, and disorientation. My eyes also got SUPER dry and burned a little; just really uncomfortable.\u000a\u000aOver all though, in moderation, this strain is awesome. It provides great symptom relief for both pain AND fatigue, and is a great &quot;get up and go&quot; strain for those who may struggle to get out of bed in the morning. It&#39;s not something I would get totally baked on, but a few hits here and there would definitely keep me bright and active throughout the day. I have a feeling this will DEFINITELY remain one of my favorite wake-and-bake strains!

VI really, REALLY like this strain. It doesn&#39;t really come off as citrusy to me when I vape it (I have the PAX pod with clementine distillate in it). The taste comes off more herbal or lavender than citrus, but it&#39;s a delicious surprise! I got it for my issues with attention and it has helped immensely in the one day I&#39;ve been using it!

V\u2022 Process\u2014Lovely. Gradual onset that was very energetic, but if not acted upon then it eventually faded to a heavy body high that left me unmotivated to move. // \u2022 Stoniness\u2014Moderately strong. // \u2022 Somatic\u2014A lot of initial energy (urge to socialize, get outside, etc) that faded to laziness (laying in bed, taking a nap) if not utilized. I did get the munchies. // \u2022 Mood\u2014The energy came with euphoria. // \u2022 Fx\u2014Initial burst of energy was very productive and motivating for errands or activities, such as hiking, longboarding, driving errands, class.

It&#39;s a great flower don&#39;t get me wrong but it made my heart racy and mind run. Great for vacatiins I woukd say and days off. Thus is also by far the most appitite stimulating strain I&#39;ve ever had, and like it&#39;s name it smells just like some halos or cuties clemetines you&#39;d buy from the store with some skunk funk.

Vthis is specifically for the Clementine at Nature&#39;s AZ medicines. Look good, butt was bleeding a little bit into the wax paper. The wax paper looks wet. I put it in my vape and took a hit, and oh my God it was horrible. so I set it aside for a couple of weeks, and recently Revisited it in a vape pen. taste horrible. I paid half as much per gram for this stuff, and it taste twice as good as this. I don&#39;t understand what the deal is with this live resin. I will revisit it again, but I will only buy it if I can smell it, and it smells awesome. This doesn&#39;t.

VI chose clementine because of the reviews and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. This was my first strain from smoking over 5 years. And it was the perfect strain to help blend you back in. \u000a\u000aMakes me feel euphoric with giving me a nice buzz head feeling. Also has a nice distinctive smell when you blaze. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe reason for the 4 starts was because I got it for the active and focus description. Although it makes me focus,I get &quot;couch locked most of the time. I don&#39;t think it would be well to use before work.\u000a\u000aAwesome strain and will get again for the days you want to just chill and smoke.

Smells mostly of oranges and tangerines that have just been cut open and it has the taste to match too! You pull this flower out and it will be known. The high is a nice mello ride making it perfect for the day. If you love this strain try Tangilope also :)  PEACE

We put on some classic rock, we were incredibly relaxed, and we had moments where we were giggling uncontrollably. Throughout the night we kept saying how fantastic this strain was, and how much we wanted to smoke it again. The only downside was that we did encounter some paranoia. I had not experienced paranoia before with a strain, but it might have been because we smoked quite a bit and we hadn&#39;t smoked in a while. We may have just overdone it. But I do know that if I see Clementine in the dispensary again, I would immediately pick it up.

VLiked this a lot. Nice sativa high that made me talkative and a bit nicer. Was able to smoke a bowl and get busy with chores or just sit and sort magic the gathering cards. Also good if you want a little pick me up after waking up. The buds were a little dry so they burned up quickly and were a bit harsh with a strong hit. The taste had a bit of citrus and skunky. All in all a nice sativa with no paranoia and enjoyable for a light smoker.

VI give this three stars bc with its parents, it should have smelled and tasted a lot better. Once you have *ideally grown and nurtured* Tangie, you have high hopes! With that said, I really enjoyed the buzz. In the yard taking deadheads off flowers after smoking this, was like morning meditation! The flavor grew on me, since I had half an oz to smoke...it does get better. I also put weed in glass with a bodeva asap and it often improves taste and smell.

VTheres a reason everyone keeps talking about that smell and it carries over to the taste. Very similar to to the bright orange you get from Tangie but with even more heavy citrus funk to it. Definitely shows that it&#39;s a hybrid though after the initial energy burst it gives me from the taste, leaves me more happy and relaxed than anything before too long. 4.5/5.

VThis sativa is one of the tastiest strains i have tried by far. Tried the live resin of Clementine from natures az medicine and it takes your breath away literally by one hit. No complaints whatsoever very potent very clean. This is the happy medicine for you &#128539;

VI wish this strain was more available. I got Clementine when I first got my medical rec. A couple of hits and I was out in the back yard cleaning up my vegetable garden, very energized. I love the huge citrus/sweet flavors too.

VI got some Clementine from a very reputable dispensary in Denver and it is definitely top shelf. The name is quite appropriate. It tastes and smells just like a Clementine oranges. Nice body buzz and fairly clear headed, but it did make me a bit anxious. Definite appetite stimulant.

VClementine:\u000aPicked this up in Olympia, WA. You guys, the smell! Straight citrus punch right to the nose! Totally dig it. The hit has delivered a little bit of spice (hitting off a bong). Not a super heavy high nice and light. Definitely still getting stuff done. I organized my laundry, painted my nails, brushed me dog, and cleaned out my fish tank. This strain let&#39;s me feel high without stopping me from being productive. Love it. This strain would be awesome before working out or maybe a little nature sesh. Not the highest high, but sometimes that&#39;s a good thing.

V&quot;She&quot; is my darling CLEMENTINE! The buds I had were nice and packed with plenty of trichomes but, I didn&#39;t even notice that because the smell is so heavenly you lose all of your other senses. Smells mostly of oranges and tangerines that have just been cut open and it has the taste to match too! You pull this flower out and it will be known. The high is a nice mello ride making it perfect for the day. If you love this strain try Tangilope also :)  PEACE

VThis is a great strain if you need to be focused on any type of task. I tend to get lost focusing on minor details that don&#39;t actually need my attention (due to my MS) and being high usually makes that worse. My personal experience with this bud actually improves my ability to stay on task and not get lost in the details. The head high is always pleasant and relaxing for me so no worries of things like anxiety or racing thoughts. It&#39;s rare for any strain of weed to give me any kind of anxiety, but it sucks out loud when it does. \u000aI smoked this for the 3rd time this evening and I was listening to music and reading reviews of Clementine when I read a review that mentions how good music is with this strain. I decided to write my first review because I&#39;m sitting in my dining room, kinda dancing in my chair and grooving to the music I have on and didn&#39;t realize how into the music I was until I read that review. So if you&#39;re alone or somewhere you can; I&#39;d recommend listening to your favorite upbeat music.\u000aThis Clementine is listed at THC: 29.10  CBD: 0.08\u000aI love the earthy flavor with a bit of citrus. Bright earthy notes are one of my two favorite marijuana tastes.\u000aThe high came in fully about 5 minutes after I finished my last hit (2 full bong bowls/about 6 hits for me).\u000aGreat head high with energy, focus, warmth, relaxing, and overall I&#39;m feeling happy and positive. The downside is the high doesn&#39;t last more than an hour  and you start feeling like you need to take a couple hits every hour to 90 minutes to stay in the sweet spot.\u000a

VI&#39;m sorry for this but, this weed is by far the worst I have ever had. I would honestly prefer to have a corner piece of mexican dirt weed instead of this. soon as I smelt it the very first thought I had of it was alphapha being cut. it does not have a citrus smell. everyone saying how good the high is as well has to be a sale gimmicks because it&#39;s nothing special, again, mexican dirt weed. I see why this strain was discounted so much.

Pull in a gas station, some goofy broad, head band on, cig hanging, comes rolling back , i dont know if she tapped my car, i looked and say the smallest white mark, she floors it, and she drives off. Ok. so im pretty pissed, but dare not go to the police station. so i leave, i stay in the end lane, some ole grand dad almost cuts me off, im like these knuckle heads out there need weed, what ever they are using aint working#thisbudisgood. #powertotheheads

VMediocre... Little to no effect. Then again I did a small preroll from the dispensary. Anyhoo, I felt maybe 10 percent more energetic for about 20 min. I really barely noticed a difference, no real high or euphoria or anything else. One preroll to me was equivalent to drinking half an energy drink. Meh. Don&#39;t think I will get this Again.
