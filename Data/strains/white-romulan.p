VThe bag appeal is amazing on this strain. It should look like a gleaming white blanket is covering the bud. The taste is very clean and has notes of berry on the exhale. If you smoke enough of it you should feel its indica genetics quite heavily.

VThe first time I smoked it , I smoked too large of a quantity to be able to do a review. I will say I was quite stoned for about 5 hours.\u000aOn my second  smoked, I smoked a more reasonable amount, like 5 or 6 hits instead of 25-30. \u000aThe high comes on pretty fast and strong. I found it uplifting and I was motivated for activities like car washing and hedge trimming. :-D\u000aThis has a bit more of a body buzz to it than  most sativas that I have tried.\u000aI guess I really like the name because when I smoke this strain that keeps coming into my head...

VSmoked via pen, this strain has a great flavor with a bit of a spicy/herbal after taste. Great when you need to be productive, focused, or functional. Provided a nice head buzz and light body relaxation that won&#39;t weigh you down. I only give it a lower rating because the high was consistently light and faded fast.\u000a

VI&#39;m giving three stars because I love the way I feel during the high  (relaxed, happy, talkative), but for some reason, this strain leaves me extremely anxious the following day. It happens so consistently that had to stop smoking it. It seems to have the same effect on my fianc&#233;, but our roommate is fine on it (it&#39;s his favorite), so probably just different people having different reactions.

VThe flower has a slightly earthy aroma, yet the nugs were very frosty and eye appealing.  The smell when ground up was fresh and slightly sweet.  The smoke was smooth but the after taste was slightly a little earthier than I probably would&#39;ve preferred.  I should say I prefer sativa strains snd love the citrus flavor.  I am very pleased with this strain nonetheless.
