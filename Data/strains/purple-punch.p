VNot sure what to make of this guy.  It&#39;s an Indica which to me says body high and couch lock and, even though I felt both, neither were too intense.  PP is mild and not very effective for insomnia, my reason for choosing it.  So I&#39;ll smoke it happily but it&#39;s not in my top ten.

V10/10. Dense bud structure with hues of green and dark purple and ridiculous trichome production. This strain is literally caked with frost and it smells incredible. The high creeps up on you with a wave of body and mind relaxation with a euphoric head buzz. One of my top 3 favorite strains!

VPurple Punch or &quot;Purple Sticky Punch&quot; as I would like to call it COMPLETELY pulled ataraxia out of he dog house with me. at a point I felt all their products smelled and tasted the same but I will say as of lately ataraxia has KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK with purps like this and mag mile &quot;landrace&quot; it&#39;s a true shame purple punch is only seasonal because with the amazing double indica it definitely is an amazing &quot;dessert&quot; strain. with its nice sweet, pungent, amazing tasty strain and it REALLY helps with my back pain and at almost 30% Total cannabinoids content it really knocks my socks off. and I personally feel this can be used as a day OR night strain. it also really helps depression, anxiety, stress, and as per usual appetite stimulation. if you&#39;re in the Joliet area stop in Midwest Compassion Center Romeoville and see if they have it in stock.

VFor my first Leafly review, I want to share my experience smoking Purple Punch from the Bloom Room in San Francisco.\u000a\u000aA disclaimer, I will judge this strain and all future strains based on three categories - Physical Appearance, Taste, and Experience.\u000a\u000aPurple Punch looks like it was harvested from an alien world. The flower is intoxicatingly purple as the name implies and it&#39;s covered in sparkling white trichomes and orange hairs. Pulling apart the bud to load my grinder was a highly enjoyable experience. Overall, I have no complaints at all with the physical appearance, and you will love admiring this beautiful bud. Therefore, I rate the physical appearance a 5/5.\u000a\u000aOnto taste, as soon as I toked the first hit, my mouth was hit with the pungent taste of sweet berries. Purple Punch is easily one of the tastiest strains I have ever tried, and if you guys pick it up, you will have no choice but to agree with me! In the category of taste, Purple Punch easily deserves a 5/5.\u000a\u000aI would like to start by stating that Purple Punch isn&#39;t a strain I would recommend to beginners. This strain (that hails from two esteemed parents: Larry OG and Grandaddy Purple) should be reserved for experienced smokers. This strain, when smoked, will melt the pain and aches in your joints via an intensely strong body high that will definitely send you to another world. I personally felt incredible waves of cosmic, bubbling energy flowing through every part of my body that made me feel like I was floating. When you pair the intense body-high with a pleasant, creative head-buzz, Purple Punch will offer users a unique and powerful high that will, without a doubt, send you on a magic ride you won&#39;t soon forget. When pairing Purple Punch with the psychedelic music of the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, you&#39;re going to undertake a sonic voyage across space and time. Purple Punch is one of my new personal favorites, and I look forward to many more adventures with it. In conclusion, this easily gets a 5/5.\u000a\u000aOverall, Purple Punch is a fantastic strain for people who want to have some fun and trip out to music while also having their worries and pain float away into the ether. I highly recommend this strain!

VThis strain is Undoubtably one of the best strains I\u2019ve smoked in a while. I had work today and unloading and packing up all the things I took with me consisted of A LOT of walking. I was diagnosed with Gion Barre Sydrome as well as Meningoencephalitis which subsequently led doctors to put me in a drug induced coma. I\u2019m 21 now and have made what I consider a full recovery. I still have Peripheral neuropath in my legs and left my back really jacked. Had a slipped disk in this coma( I\u2019m still not sure how that happened) So all that walking really f**** my knees. It\u2019s a constant pain, which sucks. All this to say, I found myself saying \u201c my knees hurt like hell\u201d. This bud really takes that pain away. I actually feel a sensation in knees- oddly enough- which lets me know that I\u2019m really baked. I feel no pain and my limbs super loose. Flavor is amaze balls. Has a very berry tinge to it. Its kinda harsh on your lungs. Made me cough 3 drags into a cone. Nice ,tight, sticky buds makes it hard to break them up with fingers (found this out first hand). All in all, an amazing strain for chronic pain, appetite, or things like arthritis.

VThere aren\u2019t many strains I would say that I\u2019d keep in my stash on a regular basis, but Purple Punch is one of them. It\u2019s certainly a five star strain that seems to have been sweeping the market for about a year, but now it\u2019s saturated the market. Luckily, however, it\u2019s such a great high in any form in any quality, that that\u2019s a good thing. Unlike Girl Scout Cookies and it\u2019s phenotypes, which are everywhere but rarely have any real potency (maybe that\u2019s just the strain not being reactive to my genetics). Anyway, I think I wrote a review months ago about how good the flower is. Well this time it\u2019s in wax form. And wow I\u2019m blown away at how much more potent it is. In flower form it\u2019s a great evening smoke, very gentle, like Grandaddy Purple, but not nearly as sedating. The wax though, shatter in my case, will totally floor you. I went to pick some up the other day and got a gram of honey looking shatter for $15. I tried it right there and couldn\u2019t refuse for the price. Ten minutes later I get in my van and have to sit for an hour to get past the peak so I can safely drive. I haven\u2019t been knocked on my butt like that in ages. Also currently dabbing on Royal Kush, White Fire, Candyland, and Banana OG. This Purple Punch might as well be called One Punch (for any of fans lol). Don\u2019t pass it up, great classic indica stone, and psychoactive enough to enjoy media and giggle but gentle enough to curb anxiety. Just don\u2019t try to do anything with this strain. You\u2019ll end up planted wherever you are. Happy toking &#129305;&#127995;

VThe grand union between granddaddy purple and Larry og was brought to me in part by the jungle boyz, or should I say a version of it that would call purple punch. Am I right guys? Branding for profit is the worst these days. The purple punch I picked up at TLC smelled like sweet delicious grape sour gummy straws that had grape generic-aid sprinkled all over it and I&#39;m not exaggerating here. The flavor profile is sweet definitely, terpenes are up there and when you smoke it? Imagine granddaddy purples sedating high with Larry OGs euphoric head high packed into a beautiful hybrid

It&#39;s super sweet, with a prominent grape note, but I also get spiced cookies from it as well.\u000a\u000aAnd pretty quickly after you enjoy the taste this thing really will punch you. It&#39;s a super relaxing strain that will take away all your cares and worries and inoculate you from pain and tension. At high doses it can feel like an out of body experience, because all the tension and pain of your body is so foreign it feels like you must have left it. It&#39;s fairly couch locky, but not as bad as some.\u000a\u000aThis strain is a great strain for sleep. Not because it will make you sleepy, but the intense relaxation makes it easy to sleep and I get the most restful sleep I&#39;ve ever had on it.

VPurple Punch is a delightfully delicious Indica strain that works wonders in curbing symptoms of Anxiety and Depression. \u000a\u000aThe flavor, for me personally, is a bit difficult to nail down. It is VERY strong, both in taste and in smell, and while it certainly has elements of grape/grapefruit/citrus-y flavors, it&#39;s hard to say which one takes over. Imagine blending up a handful of skittles and trying to describe the flavor. It&#39;s not a bad flavor by any means, just complicated to describe. In fact it&#39;s to this day the best tasting herb I&#39;ve ever had. \u000a\u000aI think the best way of describing the high you get from Purple Punch is medicinal. Suffering from pretty severe depression and regular panic attacks, this strain is a godsend. The most prominent effects I noticed were Euphoria and the giggles. While under the effects of this strain, I was incredibly jovial and found even the most mundane of topics both enthralling and hilarious. It should also be noted, however, that this particular strain can make you considerably aroused at times. \u000a\u000aIn terms of visual appeal, this strain is absolutely loaded with trichomes. To be frank, it looked almost like someone covered my buds in sugar it was so prominent. Furthermore, the buds were a lovely compliment of interwoven shades of purple and green. Certainly this is a strain you could feature on a magazine cover.\u000a\u000aWhile there were practically no negatives, there was bit of the high that, for me personally, was just a bit &quot;off&quot; of the whole experience. More-so at the beginning than at any other point during the high, this gets you right in the head, for an albeit short amount of time. I think it&#39;s potentially enough to put people off to the strain as a whole, but for me personally it was more of a speedbump, if you will, than anything really negative about the strain as a whole. To elaborate a little, I could definitely feel the high, relatively heavily at that, right in the front of my face for what I would equate to be maybe 15 to 30 minutes after smoking. Once that initial &quot;Punch&quot; from the Purple Punch wore off though, it was definitely one of the most pleasant Indica highs I&#39;ve ever had the fortune of experiencing.

VWhat an awesome strain.  Smells like Grape and fruit flavored Flinstone vitamins, and tastes grapey.  Effects lean heavily towards Indica, but starts out pretty balanced, with a mental awareness that separates it from heavy indicas.  Even when the full body effects kicks in, there is a mental clarity absent in many Indicas and indica hybrids.  Eventually, it will ease you into relaxation and easy sleep. A true winner.

VWow. Incredible. First off, anyone TRULY hating on this strain obviously didnt get what they were asking. This is one of the best buds ive ever smoked. Beautiful dense nugs , greenish/grey purple buds with tight orange hairs and frosty thrichomes everywhere honestly a really good looking bud. The smell is straight citrus with a grape undertone that makes it super tasty when you start taking some tokes. Such a perfect indica feel, relaxed body, mild sedation, but also leaving you with a clear head, and ready to do anything you arent too couch locked but as you keep smoking it will put you straight on your ass.. in the best way .  This shit does your lawn work man. If you can ever pick you a few zips of this stuff or even an Eighth it be worth your while!! 9.5/10 . Id put this bud over forbidden fruit which is my second favorite purple cannabis .

Buds were nice &amp; packed yet slightly squishy when pinched causing the most beautiful aromas to be released &amp; the fine clear trichomes to be stuck to my fingers. The smell &amp; taste was a super fruity grape. Lineage of Larry OG &amp; Granddaddy Purple (both must try strains) makes this uncommon strain a must try if you come across it. Enjoy my friends!

VMy first review...purple punch did what it was supposed to. My experience was a very strong initial head high and felt heavy. That mellowed our quickly and I had to smoke more to get it back. The whole effects didn\u2019t seem to last too long for me but another rip or two and i stayed mellowed but functional. Didn\u2019t knock me out as I expected but was able to peacefully fall asleep quickly for the first time in quite awhile. Not my favorite but quite a bit more experimenting to try.

VYUM YUM YUM! Easily in my top three tastiest strains, this outstanding flower from Ataraxia is purpleness incarnate, offering a feast for all five senses and non-sedating, floaty tranquility with a side of tender cranial pressure. The cultivar&#39;s high-definition, can&#39;t-even-be-captured-on-my-shitty-ass-Android-camera bud structure borders on the pornographic, with lush, amethyst foliage generously caked in key-lime trichomes. And lets talk taste; can we talk taste for just a second [*Charlie Kelly voice*]? The Larry OG side of the family tree lends simple sweet and skunky layers while GDP imbues delectable hints of blueberry baked goods and deep purple grape (Manischevitz, anyone?) so vividly abundant in the flower&#39;s smell, all balanced in sophistication by a mild, floral edge. Generosity being one of my highest-regarded virtues, I&#39;m ashamed to admit I have trouble sharing this strain when I have it, or even putting down a joint of it! Best for keeping pain and stress at bay on weekend afternoons.

VThis strain is what I like to call &quot;picture weed.&quot; This bud is the kind of frosty purple goodness you see gracing magazines like dope and high times front cover. Once you get past the sparkling good looks you can expect a very sweet slightly stinky aroma that definitely transfers almost exactly into its taste. Relaxing effects best suited for the evening night cap. 9/10 would smoke again

VI was recently diagnosed for fibromyalgia, but have been dealing with constant pain and fatigue, along with insomnia for a number of years. I use marijuana to try and ease my symptoms. I got this as a vapor cartridge and use a pen vape with it. My tolerance is high, but my state only recently legalized mm so previously it was hard to know what you\u2019re getting strain wise. I\u2019m so happy I can pick and choose my strains now! Two or three hits and I feel gloriously relaxed and it helps my pain and insomnia so much. If I smoke it during the day I\u2019ll limit my hits bc it will make me drowsy if I over do it. But 1 or 2 hits helps me get stuff done without focusing on my pain. It blisses me out without making me slow or dull. I\u2019m in love. And it\u2019s so effective for what I need that I\u2019m smoking less than I did prior to smoking this bc it gets me where I want to be real quick. The taste is also great.

Va great tasting strain with pleasant knockout effects beyond belief.\u000a\u000aa lovely purple cross strain with a sweet grape syrup like taste. this strain achieves a sleepy true eyes closing stoned effect within mere moments of taking. then proceeds to creep stronger in a comfortable way that just is on the edge of becoming too much leaving you in a warm comatosed state.\u000a\u000awouldn&#39;t recommend if you want to get much done but if netflix and chill is on your agenda; then smoke up just don&#39;t underestimate this bud or you will miss the ending

VThis strain was akin to galavanting the skies of Asgard, absurdly astonishing views that challenged every imagination whilst soothing all anxiety into a blissful drone. Like placing in the top tier of the hardest difficulty setting possible racing for your honor on Rainbow Rd...and winning by bewildering tactics that defy the physics of thumb and eye coordination and response. Pretty much feel like a leaf wandering a winding stream in the wooded pastures of a mountains shade, just enough streams of light peering through upon dusks rays of golden gleam and glint.
