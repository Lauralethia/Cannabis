VPineapple Thai is one of the best medicinal strains I&#39;ve ever had.  I was in a lot of pain the first night I tried it, back and neck, smoked a bowl and right away could feel the pain and stress related to said pain releasing and vanishing which allowed me to not toss and turn all night, sleep in a good position, and feel wonderful the next day.\u000a\u000a  Continued smoking of this great medicine with a very high CBD % leaves one feeling almost as if there is a protective layer all around you, almost like you are insulated from the pains that might bother you in your knees etc.  Although initially it really does feel like a Sativa after another hit you will see that its definitely an Indica. Its probably best smoked at nights. Taste is earthy and pineapple.

VThis strain is one of the most relaxing I&#39;ve smoked in quite some time. The effects are very light and calming on the head high, just a peaceful wave of drowsiness, almost. I&#39;ve still found the ability to have energy even after smoking this suddenly surprising. I can still go about my daily routine even while on a high from this strain. It&#39;s just as nice to experience relaxing on a bed while high from this as it is to work at school or a job. It&#39;s also helped my common cold symptoms quite a lot lately!

VThis is a very effective strain for pain relief and mood enhancement. There is a euphoric feeling that starts almost immediately and then it peaks about 1/2 hour later, combined with an overall tingling body sensation.  It is a good daytime strain but it can make you feel a bit groggy when wearing off, so beware of that. Overall a stellar strain for pain management!!

VPineapple Thai isn&#39;t as hazardous for your psyche as higher THC carrying Sativas, but the high will put some pep in your step; creativity abounds and stress will definitely dip after puffing this sweet tasting selection. So, not super sativa, but will get up and active. I enjoy the mild sedation after the initial effects no longer persist. I recommend for any one looking to replace stimulants such as caffeinated coffee and energy drinks; this can replace your pre-workout supplements. Something&#39;s to consider &#128170;&#127997;. Color varied but mostly light green with orange pistil, and liberally covered with tricomes.

This one is not for parties, but this one is definitely *definitely* good for medical use.

VA sweet, lingering, robust flavor tasted through a solar toke leaves an almost overwhelming taste of pineapple, along with a bit of pine and a slight hint of citrus.  The flavor through a charred up corn cob pipe (the nice plus is you look like an old timey sea captain) tastes like something that must have been genetically engineered by a mad scientist at Nabisco, having nearly a candy-like smell AND taste if smoked under the right conditions (it\u2019s harder to get it through the butane).  The high is clear enough to still write elaborately, with a certain motivational quality to it that doesn\u2019t quite go far enough to paranoia, but may interfere with sleep if you were lazy all day

VVery flavorful smoke - I smoked it through a glass pipe.  I did two hits and then another 15 minutes later.  Just enough.  It&#39;s definitely a head-high sativa.   Very easy, very light, very simple - but at the same time -- has a very relaxing effect but awake relaxing.  Not sedative at all.  So, you can very much take this to work.\u000a\u000aI liked it a lot - and would recommend it, if you are fighting fatigue, but it&#39;s not going to get you up and moving like say Blue Dream or Jack Herer.  \u000a\u000aIt seems like a nice simple sativa.

VNormally I don&#39;t come across strains that I dislike this vehemently, but then I got some of this stuff, and REALLY didn&#39;t care for it (definitely won&#39;t be getting it again). To me it had an overly &#39;engineered&#39; taste and didn&#39;t taste natural enough to me--it almost had a &#39;soapy&#39; taste that I didn&#39;t enjoy (makes me think of the unnatural smelling and tasting Chemdawg which I also dislike). While the smell of PT is pleasant and &#39;fruity&#39; enough, the taste and the actual high weren&#39;t pleasant to me. Speaking of the high, it had a spacey kind of high, and didn&#39;t make me feel too great (the high reminded me of Trainwreck, another strain which doesn&#39;t do it for me). I prefer the old school strains, the natural, earthy stuff--this is why I particularly enjoy kushes.

VSweet, fruity aroma and flavor. The sample was very multi-colored, ranging from light to dark green, and even vivid orange. The smoke was easy on the throat, and not harsh at all. It was a very peaceful, almost spiritual high, very quiet, and very withdrawn and introspective.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m surprised to see it classified as an indica. It was sold to me as a sativa, and all evidence, including physical appearance and subjective psychedelic experience point seem to support this claim. This strain is almost definitely sativa dominant.

VAlex: Me and my buddy Chris smoked a spliff of this with a blunt and a joint and we felt very chill, we could hold a good conversation, we also felt very uplifted and positive it gives a really good head high and if you&#39;re smoking a spliff it adds that relaxed body high.

VThis is a really nice Sativa. Great taste and fast hitting effects that left me feeling uplifted and happy. Burned perfectly and left my mouth with a pleasant pineapple-ish taste in the exhale.

VA sweet, lingering, robust flavor tasted through a solar toke leaves an almost overwhelming taste of pineapple, along with a bit of pine and a slight hint of citrus.  The flavor through a charred up corn cob pipe (the nice plus is you look like an old timey sea captain) tastes like something that must have been genetically engineered by a mad scientist at Nabisco, having nearly a candy-like smell AND taste if smoked under the right conditions (it\u2019s harder to get it through the butane).  The high is clear enough to still write elaborately, with a certain motivational quality to it that doesn\u2019t quite go far enough to paranoia, but may interfere with sleep if you were lazy all day
