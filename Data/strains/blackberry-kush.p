VI just want to fill a swimming pool full of BlackBerry Kush and dive right into it! I am not exaggerating this has the be the best indica I have ever smoked. After two pipe bowls I immediately felt all my muscles and joints completely relax after a long 10 hour shift. Nothing compares to the smooth, ever so relaxing high this bud has to offer. Wonderful strain for those who suffer from muscle/joint pain, insomnia, and anxiety. I&#39;m not giving this 5/5...no I&#39;m giving it 10/10. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

VNow this kind of bud here is why I started in the 1st place. Pain relief and a complete elimination of anxiety. It does a lot more than that but relieving the pain and anxiety so I can exercise &amp; stick with my Drs plan has been a game changer for me. This one and ghost train haze at least for me demolishes the pain. And both put a Cheshire grin on my face. Happy, happy strains. My BP was the best it&#39;s been in 4 years according to the dr &amp; my A1C is finally back to normal. Without it I would not be able to do what I&#39;m doing now, I&#39;ve tried. Only solution I&#39;ve found that really works to kill that pain &amp; get me thinking positive again.

VI would have to say this probably one of the best Indica strains I have ever tried. It has a wonderful balance of a happy and uplifting mentality along with a very relaxing and pain-melting body stone.  Crisp, dense buds with semi-dark green and dark purple coloring, along with a forest of beautiful trichomes. This strain literally smells like fresh blackberry jam, while the taste is like a mild kush with a hint of berries. The effects hit you fairly quickly, but you may not even realize it right away because the mental high is so subtle and uplifting. You will definitely realize it when your body starts to have a tingly and vibrating feeling to it. This bud makes me feel very content and blissful while my body is pain-free and relaxed with a whole body buzz, but make sure you don&#39;t have shit to do because this strain can make you pretty sleepy, and you might end up sitting down for a while or taking a nap. All in all I have to say this particular strain is exactly what I had imagined a Blackberry Kush to be like; amazing high and very positive experience, definitely a favorite of mine!

VThe kind of medication I am looking for is something that can balance treating my insomnia, anxiety, and pain all at the same time. How it looks and how it smokes comes secondary, but in this case, Blackberry Kush is the best of both worlds. Not only does it offer that perfect balance that I am looking for medically, but it looks, smells, and tastes better than any Cannabis I have ever experienced in twenty years. \u000a\u000aI have absolutely no anxiety when I medicate with this flower; I can fall asleep, and it helps my pain, although there are better strains for pain out there. \u000a\u000aAppearance: 10/10\u000a\u000aBlackberry Kush is stunning to look at as it&#39;s absolutely covered in sugary looking crystals, and as soon as you see it, you can tell instantly that this is a grade A product. \u000a\u000aTaste/Smell: 10/10\u000a\u000aIt tastes and smells sweet like berries, it&#39;s as smooth as anything I have ever smoked (I use a one foot water pipe) and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. \u000a\u000aOverall: An easy 10/10\u000a\u000aI love the way I feel when I am on this flower, and on top of all of the medical benefits, I feel very happy and uplifted. I am not depressed, but I believe Blackberry Kush could potentially help for depression as well, so pick this up immediately if you see it.

VBlackberry Kush is one of my goto nighttime strains. It goes down sort of earthy and slightly harsh, with a sweet berry aftertaste. It provides a nice clear focus to organize a few priorities and get some fairly easy but important stuff done. It gently eases you into deeper physical and mental relaxation for the night. It&#39;s not a real stony body high like a lot of indicas, just sort of a mellow &quot;all is ok with the world, now I can relax and get some sleep.&quot; I&#39;d recommend it for stress, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and pain.

VBlackberry Kush is what cannabis is supposed to be! I&#39;m usually a Sativa afficianado, but I looked for a good strain (available in my area) that was good for pain - I&#39;m having back pain and some spasms this week. Blackberry Kush was a delightful high. Slight leg tinglies, great sense of feeling okay, and sorta masked my back pain. YMMV. I will probably always have some of BK around. Not highly recommended for day time use, IMO.

VI tried Blackberry Kush, hoping it would help me with insomnia and some body stress from seizures. It was great for the insomnia. The smoke is a little harsh, even in a vaporizer, but not intolerable. The taste is Earthy and a little spicy (not at all fruity.) The effect began with just making me relaxed, not too lazy though, and then moved into a kind of dreamy relaxation slipping in and out of mildly euphoric day dreaming, and then a very satisfying sleep about two hours after the first hit. it did not make me super couch locked, but enough that I could sleep well. A friend vaped with me and enjoyed it as much as I did. Overall, this is a great strain, and useful for insomnia, mild pain relief and anxiety.

VWonderfully tight dense nugs. Highlights of purple braided throughout the nug, with some, more intense in color. Had a &quot;good&quot; amount of frosting from trichomes. After grinding had a rush of berry fruitiness with a heavy following of that Kush smell. Last thing I smell is the slightest bit of gasoline to trace the prior scents. \u000a\u000aWithin two inhalations you feel a great rush of numbness flow over the back to the front of the head. Then 15 minutes in, you feel a lightness in the shoulders, almost as if a weight has been lifted. Then comes the heaviness in the back of the eyes that permeates to the bottom of your feet. If you continue to smoke after this feeling then......... Sleep .....z.z..z.z.zzzzz......

VPurchased from Dr. Jolly&#39;s in Bend, OR. Tested at 22% THC and 2.5% CBD, I&#39;ve got to say, this has become one of my favorites recently. It smells and tastes delicious (sort of a sour diesel smell with berry and pine in the background).\u000a\u000aThe effects, for me, lean a little more to the dreamy/stony/sleepy side...but there was just enough of an uplifting stimulation to balance it out very well. I am someone who suffers from anxiety, and certain strains have caused some panic attacks in the past, but this stuff OBLITERATES my anxiety with NO paranoia to be found. Really euphoric, relaxing, and uplifting at the same time. Heavy cerebral bliss, amazing for anxiety without knocking me out, and good pain and tension-relieving effects as well (for my mild-moderate pains).\u000a\u000aThis stuff rocks. It is an absolute classic and go-to in my rotation. And I&#39;ve gotta give props the grower(s), they did a great job on this flower. Love everything about it. If you are sometimes prone to anxiety/paranoia and need to just relax and live in the moment, definitely try Blackberry Kush. Even if you aren&#39;t, you&#39;ll probably love it anyway.

VI recently picked up a Sol Vape Cartridge for my vape pen. I got it at White Mountain Health Center. They had several different flavors available and I decided on the Blackberry Kush. I like Sol products because they are a little less expensive for the amount you get. So if you&#39;re short on funds this is a good way to go. The high is very nice. Very relaxing, perfect for stress and pain relief. Good way to end a long day. The taste is very smooth with a hint of citrus. So if you are short on funds and only like to vape I would definitely recommend this brand and flavor.

VGot some of this about two months ago from a local dispensary.\u000aI still remember the moment I saw the buds, to this day.\u000aThey could&#39;ve been the most beautiful buds I&#39;ve ever seen. COVERED in trichomes. It looked like a tiny Christmas tree, covered in snow.\u000a\u000aThe first hit of this stuff was what sealed the deal.\u000aIt.\u000aIs.\u000aDANK.\u000aI was pain-free, depression-free, eating, and had no anxiety or stress on my mind whatsoever.\u000aNighttime strain for sure.

VI&#39;m seasoned at producing high quality herb. This takes time,passion,more time  and more love than you&#39;d give Kate Upton during a 1 night stand. I&#39;ve been testing the recreational market here in WA lately and honestly I&#39;m not very impressed. Most producers seem to all have 25% thc on every strain which is a good marketing strategy but not TRUE at all. The leafy buds and lack of proper cure is highly noticeable to a trained pallette. I get properly trimmed nugs that have a slow cure which makes a monumental difference. I&#39;ll put my homegrown up against anything I&#39;m seeing in the majority of recreational shops! That said the BBKush I got yesterday grown by Seattle Private Reserve was so far the closest thing I&#39;ve seen that comes close to my personal BB Kush. Keep in mind I don&#39;t care if the package says 45%THC I care about the cure, the taste,and overall the effectiveness of the product. This BB KUSH was the best rec gram I&#39;ve got so far and was surprisingly tasty and was a good indica with relaxing qualities. It wasn&#39;t Deep Couch City like my own DJ Short Blueberry but it was acceptable. The Gram of Blue Dream on the other hand was almost schwag..no wonder they don&#39;t let you open your package and get a closer look. Anyways Seattle Private Reserve Blackberry Kush for $18 a gram was 8.3/10 so about a B+.\u000a

Relaxes the whole body, with some couch lock but enough energy to hold a conversation. Definitely helped me sleep but not a strong enough indica to totally knock me out without me being already tired. Was great for my insomnia because it mellowed me out enough to still chill with my roommates but get the sleep I needed too.

VI bought four pre rolled joints from the dispensary, was blown away. The aroma first was incredible, sweet and earthy, and the flavor was just as good. It came on a little slow at first but when the effects peaked it was a very relaxing and put me at ease. I was able to fall asleep almost immediately. Helped my anxiety and insomnia, was also a very euphoric high, very happy and content. Would definitely get again.

VFuck me, this strain will sure knock you on your ass real quick. A minute or two after I hit this my brain completely leaves my head and every ounce of stress in me melts away. I remarked to my partner, &quot;I do not think I&#39;ve ever been more relaxed in my life&quot;. Shortly after the mental effects hit me it vanquishes pain and makes my body tingle for a couple minutes.\u000a\u000aAbsolutely perfect for melting away anxiety, stress, pain, and muscle tension but good luck having any coherent thoughts or being productive on it.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s strong stuff through, so as crazy as thing sounds the first time I had it I almost panicked about how relaxed I was. However, once I knew what I was in for that never happened again.\u000a\u000aIt only sometimes makes me sleepy, but it will always give me couch lock. Also dries my eyes quite a bit more intensely than some other strains.

VI&#39;m seasoned at producing high quality herb. This takes time,passion,more time  and more love than you&#39;d give Kate Upton during a 1 night stand. I&#39;ve been testing the recreational market here in WA lately and honestly I&#39;m not very impressed. Most producers seem to all have 25% thc on every strain which is a good marketing strategy but not TRUE at all. The leafy buds and lack of proper cure is highly noticeable to a trained pallette. I get properly trimmed nugs that have a slow cure which makes a monumental difference. I&#39;ll put my homegrown up against anything I&#39;m seeing in the majority of recreational shops! That said the BBKush I got yesterday grown by Seattle Private Reserve was so far the closest thing I&#39;ve seen that comes close to my personal BB Kush. Keep in mind I don&#39;t care if the package says 45%THC I care about the cure, the taste,and overall the effectiveness of the product. This BB KUSH was the best rec gram I&#39;ve got so far and was surprisingly tasty and was a good indica with relaxing qualities. It wasn&#39;t Deep Couch City like my own DJ Short Blueberry but it was acceptable. The Gram of Blue Dream on the other hand was almost schwag..no wonder they don&#39;t let you open your package and get a closer look. Anyways Seattle Private Reserve Blackberry Kush for $18 a gram was 8.3/10 so about a B+.\u000a

VI&#39;m currently going thru the most terrifying &amp; painful problems of my life. What I experienced was the worst pain of my life &amp; I&#39;ve given child birth without any pain meds/epidural. They think I had an aneurysm, or I have a ciafi malformation. Either way it&#39;s the most painful headache I&#39;ve ever experienced.\u000aBlackBerry Kush helped that pain. During these painful attacks the back left side of my head pounds with my heartbeat. Then it remains sore in that area for a few days after. Dabbing BlackBerry kush got rid of that soreness. And I&#39;ve been trying to not move too much, I&#39;m terrified I&#39;ll trigger another attack. This had me moving around and laughing my butt off. Completely forgot I even went thru the most painful experience of my life. Marijuana&#39;s a miracle. It doesn&#39;t do anything for the pain while I&#39;m having these attacks, but then again not even methadone can relieve any of the pain. \u000a\u000aI will be keeping Blackberry Kush in my stash box from now on. \u000aThe look &amp; taste are amazing, the high is obviously indica. Has some antidepressant properties.\u000a\u000aIf you don&#39;t get this strain you&#39;re really missing out.

VThis is a review of Blackberry Kush water extracted (38 micron screen,) hash. \u000a\u000aThis one is a bit of a mystery to me. With the eye, this blond hash looks like any other nice blond hash, but at 30x, 60x, and 100x magnification, this sample looks absolutely stunning! About 95% unbroken trichrome heads with a very small amount of plant material mixed in... Looks like 4star. It has a very grainy texture, also consistent with 4* hash. This granular hash does NOT press well in the hand. It may just be too dry for that, but it is a little strange. I expected this granular hash to melt, it does not. It barely even bubbles, but does leave a nice, white ash when completely combusted. I also expected the flavor to be predominately hashy and was surprised to find a full, complex, sweet blackberry with a hint of hashiness on the tongue. Full body effect with plenty of headiness. An excellent, relaxing indica high with a nice 3-4 hour duration.

VIf you are looking for a strain with ultimate medicinal benefits, you may be ready to give Blackberry Kush a try. After the first puff I instantly had a tingly, soothing feeling in my body where pain was once present. As the effects begin kicking in you will begin to feel stress and anxiety melt away. Blackberry Kush leaves users feeling relaxed and calm, but in lower doses does not leave user couch-locked. As the dose begins to increase, the user feels a comfortable heaviness in the body as to begin to become one with the ouch or the bed. As the effects begin to pass the peak, the user may feel a little sleepy, and even more relaxed. \u000a\u000aAs someone with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and arthritis, this strain is a one hit wonder. One puff is my optimal dose and I am left feeling relaxed, happy, creative, calm, but still awake.

VI woke up in the morning on my day off with a migraine level 8 on a scale of 10. I did a little research on a good strain for migraines on Blackberry Kush came up. Not ever having this strain before I thought I&#39;d give it a try. After one bowl of Blackberry Kush within 20 min the pain had disappeared completely! Great strain!

VThe phenotype for my batch was beautiful. Fluffy nugs covered in chocolate brown hairs. Purple showed up when I broke the nug up. Smoking this strain was... intense. Very strong indica high. You know that feeling when you take the sheets out of the dryer and you wrap them around yourself ?? That&#39;s what the high feels like with this strain. You&#39;re not gonna really wanna do much with this strain. I recommend smoking this strain if you&#39;re trying to stay home, be lazy, and enjoy your day. Amazing for a good nights sleep &#128564;

VAs soon as I got this I rushed to write this review--this strain is incredible for stress, insomnia, depression, anxiety and gives you a nice body buzz that tingles your face and lingers behind your eyes. You just feel your body melt into a relaxed state of pure bliss and contentment. The CBD helps ward off any anxiety or paranoia-which I&#39;m prone to with cannabis. It has a kind of peppery tinge to it with the berry which is absolutely intoxicating; my new favorite! You don&#39;t need to much of this to feel like your lulling on a cloud. Very relaxed and uplifted. Kinda hungry but not ravenous. Check this strain out, a must try.

VI have to admit that I was a little apprehensive about trying this since my dispensary sells it for 25.00 an eighth. (Their eighths normally go for around 35-45). So I was wondering to myself  what could possibly be wrong with it?\u000a   On the way home I cracked the pouch just to take a whiff, it smelled like a fruit bowl, nothing amazing, not pungent and overbearing but not bad. But very beautiful, dense purple and orange tinged buds.\u000a\u000a  After the first hit of this I realized I had made an excellent selection. Very smooth yet powerful fruity diesel taste and aroma. Almost instantaneous relaxation. Nice spacey high. A little of this goes a long way. I normally smoke Indica dominant strains such as Sour Grape, Gorilla Glue, Girl Scout Cookies etc...and will be very happy to add this strain to my list.

VWhen I smoke I usually have some short of hybrid, predominantly Sativa, or a full Sativa strain. Having a entirely Indica strain for a change was awesome. This strain makes you feel like your body is floating on a cloud as you let your head droop onto your shoulder. I personally zone in and out of conversations with friends as I go on my own train of thoughts.  Super relaxed and chill overall. At the end of the day, you&#39;ll fall asleep peacefully and quickly.

VI&#39;ve been a recreational user for over 40 years and now, unfortunately, am a medicinal user. I think it&#39;s a shame that this wonderful strain isn&#39;t rated more highly than it is and think (as is the case with other strains) that many of the ratings that bring down the overall score of this beautiful strain are due to less than optimal harvests by growers who are not attempting or are unable to grow any particular strain to its full potential. When properly grown and harvested, Blackberry Kush is a remarkable strain that belongs on every top ten or better list. The only thing I could wish for in this strain is longer duration. While having some couch-lock properties, mental clarity and alertness are not unduly compromised. The sativa effect of this strain provides the perfect balance to its outstanding indica dominant properties.

I personally zone in and out of conversations with friends as I go on my own train of thoughts.  Super relaxed and chill overall. At the end of the day, you&#39;ll fall asleep peacefully and quickly.

VThis strain is definitely now in my top five all time faves. \u000aTasty and hits like a dream. Instant pain and stress relief and the perfect Netflix strain. I feel super relaxed and happy and don\u2019t feel super couchlocked (but definitely still enjoy sitting on the couch haha). Smoked this during the day but can\u2019t wait to really smoke this tonight and get some great sleep! Love this strain already

VThe Blackberry Kush was extremely uplifting. It got me inspired, relaxed and focused! If you\u2019re looking to do some studying or cleaning or writing then Blackberry Kush needs to be in your rotation. Even after multiple smoke sessions the uplifting effects stayed with me and continued to fuel my creativity never turning into a heavy couch lock feeling. As if it needed to be any better the kush smells like the most bomb blueberry pie you could imagine. I found myself opening the jar throughout the day just to take a whiff of that sweet aroma. The cherry on top of all of this is that because Blackberry Kush is an Indica heavy hybrid it doesn\u2019t make ya all paranoid and anxious.\u000a\u000aI could seriously go for a giant pile of this stuff! This was my first time smoking anything from Phat Panda and it definitely won\u2019t be the last! I think it\u2019s safe to say that if you see anything from Phat Panda at your local i502 Recreational Marijuana retailer then you should pick up a few grams and blaze up!

You know that feeling when you take the sheets out of the dryer and you wrap them around yourself ?? That&#39;s what the high feels like with this strain. You&#39;re not gonna really wanna do much with this strain. I recommend smoking this strain if you&#39;re trying to stay home, be lazy, and enjoy your day. Amazing for a good nights sleep &#128564;

VThis is a review of Blackberry Kush water extracted (38 micron screen,) hash. \u000a\u000aThis one is a bit of a mystery to me. With the eye, this blond hash looks like any other nice blond hash, but at 30x, 60x, and 100x magnification, this sample looks absolutely stunning! About 95% unbroken trichrome heads with a very small amount of plant material mixed in... Looks like 4star. It has a very grainy texture, also consistent with 4* hash. This granular hash does NOT press well in the hand. It may just be too dry for that, but it is a little strange. I expected this granular hash to melt, it does not. It barely even bubbles, but does leave a nice, white ash when completely combusted. I also expected the flavor to be predominately hashy and was surprised to find a full, complex, sweet blackberry with a hint of hashiness on the tongue. Full body effect with plenty of headiness. An excellent, relaxing indica high with a nice 3-4 hour duration.

VFucking delicious. I ground some extra for on the go, packed a small bowl, and put all the keif on top (more than my usual amount, this bud was frosty). I think I hit it too hard or just fast. I coughed bad. This didn&#39;t really start to take effect till almost 35 minutes. Woah. Pain free, a bit limp, couch locked high. good thing I tried this at home first, can&#39;t do much on this. Would buy many times, and have chillin sessions with the lady.

VThe first thing I noticed about Blackberry Kush is how it looks.  The buds tend to be dense and beautifully well-formed with little sparkly crystals all over.  It smells like slightly sour blackberries.\u000a\u000aI loved the effects of this strain.  It has a delightful sleepy-heady heaviness to it I&#39;ve come to associate with kushes.  I found it quite intoxicating and helpful for relaxing after a stressful day.  It definitely helped with my insomnia as well.  \u000a\u000aOverall I&#39;m glad I tried this tasty, potent strain.  It&#39;s just the thing for taking a break from the world a bit.

VThis is one of my favorite strains. I am a big fan of Afghan, and this had the hashiness of Afghan but still a good fruity flavor that resembled cherry more so than blackberry to me. Helped a lot with migraines and overall pains but I did find it is not a strain you want to smoke if you are trying to be productive in any way other than catching up on sleep and eating.

You know that feeling when you take the sheets out of the dryer and you wrap them around yourself ?? That&#39;s what the high feels like with this strain. You&#39;re not gonna really wanna do much with this strain. I recommend smoking this strain if you&#39;re trying to stay home, be lazy, and enjoy your day. Amazing for a good nights sleep &#128564;

VWhen I smoke I usually have some short of hybrid, predominantly Sativa, or a full Sativa strain. Having a entirely Indica strain for a change was awesome. This strain makes you feel like your body is floating on a cloud as you let your head droop onto your shoulder. I personally zone in and out of conversations with friends as I go on my own train of thoughts.  Super relaxed and chill overall. At the end of the day, you&#39;ll fall asleep peacefully and quickly.

Minimal anxiety nice and tingly all around the body especially neck lower-back and shoulders. Nugs are nice, dense and fat but lack the super dank smell/taste (Acquired at Greener by Nature: 18/35).

VThis is a review of Blackberry Kush water extracted (38 micron screen,) hash. \u000a\u000aThis one is a bit of a mystery to me. With the eye, this blond hash looks like any other nice blond hash, but at 30x, 60x, and 100x magnification, this sample looks absolutely stunning! About 95% unbroken trichrome heads with a very small amount of plant material mixed in... Looks like 4star. It has a very grainy texture, also consistent with 4* hash. This granular hash does NOT press well in the hand. It may just be too dry for that, but it is a little strange. I expected this granular hash to melt, it does not. It barely even bubbles, but does leave a nice, white ash when completely combusted. I also expected the flavor to be predominately hashy and was surprised to find a full, complex, sweet blackberry with a hint of hashiness on the tongue. Full body effect with plenty of headiness. An excellent, relaxing indica high with a nice 3-4 hour duration.

VThis strain did what I expected it to, and then took it an extra mile. For me, the high from BBK started  as a typical high-tier indica body feel. As the first four or five tokes kicked in, I braced myself for some serious couch-lockage; it never happened. That indica melty chillness was extremely prevelant, without the usual drowsiness and general sluggishness. As I slipped into a deeper high, no couch lock showed up. Instead I found myself focussing intently on my surroundings and zoning in rather than out. This bud presented me with a deeply chilling, calming, and focussed high. The high was as enjoyable as a high can be, and lasted for about 3.5 hours until the burnout threw me into a wonderful sleep. This is top notch bud as far as im concerned,

VI&#39;ve been surprise by this strain. It is supposed to be about %90 indic a yet it has sativa like growing properties with lateral branches and a total height of about 5 feet(indoors) growing under about 500 watts of LEDs. I also thought it would be a faster grow.  I&#39;m approaching week 12(from seed) and the plants are only starting to have significant bud development.  It&#39;s a pretty large plant. I kept one of my plants relatively unpruned to see what it&#39;s natural development looked like. It&#39;s about 3-4 feet wide by 5 feet tall. All of the lower branches maintain a J shaped growth with the outer bud development reaching for the light. The one mistake I made with this plant was putting them into a 12-12 too early. At about 36&quot; and 6 weeks from seed, I changed the light cycle. Their was some leaf curling and probably the only period in which they didn&#39;t seem robustly healthy. They haven&#39;t had a really great nuts cycle either. I started them off on bud candy at about 4-6 weeks. And having been out of nuts for about 2 weeks, I just got some gen. hydro FloraBloom. \u000a If I let these plants grow to full maturity, they will be a cash cow. It already appears that the various buds growing on a stalk bare going to grow into each other. The unpruned plant has about 20-25 stalks which are developing buds. I was really surprised to see how well the led light penetrates the canopy. I&#39;m not sure if that is because of the layout of lights or them being led. What I diid is, I kept a 300 watt full spectrum led about 6&quot; above the canopy from tyne start and once I started flowering, I introduced several 10 watt single chip LEDs on the walls at about waist height with their light being pointed at the lower branches. At like 8 weeks I added a 100 watt single chip led that i got on ebay for about $60 including the cost of a fan and heatsink. That is when I started  to notice that the bud growth is really evening out throughout the entire plants. \u000aThese ares the 1st plats that i HAVE GROWN WITH LED lights and I have been very happy with how they work. And I haven&#39;t had a single electricity bill over $100

VI would give this five stars for pain but other than that, it did nothing for me. It was recommended to me for sleep and panic attacks. I would not recommend this strains for that.

Vmild, yet sweet taste of berry which doesn&#39;t match the smell which, while also mild; is much more hash like. in my experience that is common among Kush strains. \u000a\u000athe effect is slow but potent and works great to bring you down at the end of a long day. \u000a\u000amy batch was a bit leafy but had a nice frosted green color tinged by dark purple sections and a good amount of orange hairs hidden within the dense buds. \u000a\u000aif you&#39;re a taste lover like me, it&#39;s worth a try but, it&#39;s not as strong in taste and smell as it is in effect. 4 stars for a solid strain.

I guess that is true for just about everything tho.\u000a\u000aEffect: Full body stone with a pleasant amount of headiness. Relaxation and stress relief comes on quickly. Where most strong strains will make me a bit paranoid, this strain actually relieves anxiety.\u000a\u000aMood / Activity: Equally good for unwinding after a day of work or relaxing under a tree on a beautiful fall day.

Vreally good potent strong indica, I usually pick up an eighth of a sativa for my daily routine and a good indica for my end of the day pain relief and a sleep aid and this is definitely doing the trick for my back and I can tell it&#39;s going to be a good sleep, poten from the flower and the smoke gives off this real pungent oder. recommended for night time use and for all my indica lovers!\u000a

VOne of my top 5 favorites.\u000a\u000aFlavor: When vaped the berry flavor really shines. When smoked it is far less flavorful. I guess that is true for just about everything tho.\u000a\u000aEffect: Full body stone with a pleasant amount of headiness. Relaxation and stress relief comes on quickly. Where most strong strains will make me a bit paranoid, this strain actually relieves anxiety.\u000a\u000aMood / Activity: Equally good for unwinding after a day of work or relaxing under a tree on a beautiful fall day. Puts me in the mood to just relax and enjoy nature.

Vi dont see any purple or black... just dark green with orange hairs.  smells a little skunky, along with rotten fruit/vomit (especially when broken up) - but in a positive way.  always works wonders for me.  \u000a\u000athe initial body stone and euphoric feeling of any indica that&#39;s present in this hybrid strain helps a bit, but what really gets me in bed is BBK&#39;s unusual effect that has me both mentally and physically dizzy.  To elaborate, I cannot keep thoughts together long enough to reach an answer or memory, but i also cannot mechanically coordinate my body as my mind sees/saw fit: rendering me grounded out of fear into the bed; your head and neck feel like an ejected jack in the box that can&#39;t seem to keep straight, but leaning to either shoulder.\u000a\u000aalso found at Elemental Wellness 2 weeks ago, which was less ammonia smelling and not as potent, but with dense, frosty, purple buds (more bag appeal).\u000a\u000a~40 passed now.  I had difficulty typing this message.  When I look back at this message tomorrow, I&#39;m probably gonna compare my grammar and sentence building to how I type sober or with another strain; I feel as if my usual grammar isn&#39;t second nature - requiring extra contemplation on what the next word in my sentence would be. to top it off, my eyes are getting even more dry, suggesting closing my eye lids.  having a snack and some milk or tea to wash it down, and lay in bed listening to LSD til I doze off sounds like a good plan.  =)\u000a\u000ahappy medicating

In low dose, it helps me drift off and helps release muscle tension in hamstrings and gluts.  In higher doses it makes me a bit randy, which can be fun at the right time.

VThis strain is my go-to for insomnia.  Got it on a bud-tender reccomendation after 3 Days of no solid sleep.  Have used for periodic insomnia for a couple months.  In low dose, it helps me drift off and helps release muscle tension in hamstrings and gluts.  In higher doses it makes me a bit randy, which can be fun at the right time.

VThis is my absolute favorite strain for Chronic back pain and being able to go to sleep in minutes without the tossing and turning. BBK has an awesome chemistry with my body and mind. It&#39;s not too much of one thing and just enough of everything. I usually can&#39;t sleep all night, with tossing and turning from back pain. With a few hits of BBK out of my little water bong, it goes down smooth just before I go down smooth to sleep. Excellent evening strain to wind down and truly just take a load off. I would strongly advise this strain if you suffer from pain and want to couple that with a chill night playing video games or listening to music. Stellar!!

VPreviously reviewed 6/22. After increased use, found this to be a creeper!\u000a\u000aDeceptively smooth, and with a solid hour+ delay on its sedative effects, you can hit this several times before you really start to feel it. Then you get HIGH for an hour or two, then you&#39;re knocked OUT for an hour or two.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a great high, don&#39;t get me wrong - still voted 5 stars. But it&#39;s easy to get higher than you intend while vaping this. Do not take 2-5 hours before operating heavy machinery ;)

A very balanced high, doesn&#39;t leave you wanting more, nor does it render you unable to complete tasks. \u000a\u000aI received it from Highlands Health and Wellness Center  in North Highlands, CA but it is not listed on the dispensary database.\u000a\u000aThe website for it is HHWCC.com

VThis is another strain that is great for treating a mental health disease, such as depression, anxiety, etc.. I specifically used this strain to treat depression and anxiety; it did very well. I took one hit and in about 15 minutes I felt a very euphoric calmness. I then started listening to music and enjoyed the next 2 hours of controlled high. Compared to other strains I&#39;ve reviewed, this is definitely in the top 15.  \u000a\u000aGood strain. Definitely has a fruity taste. Used it to roll a joint and had a pleasant after taste. It burned well, and smoke was smooth.

VVery nice. Picked the wax/blonde crumble version in slt at twc. It&#39;s a little harsh, definitely has a jet fuel/diesel flavor with a touch of a sweetness at the end of your hit. Ihis one was a fairly balanced buzz, head and body. The head kicked right away with a very calming sensation followed by a moderate to heavy body relaxation. It&#39;s really calming and I&#39;d give the pain relief a 5/10, may be a 6; it&#39;s decent for muscle arthritis and back pain, and great for my mood swings after the hysterectomy last year. Highly recommended :)

VI decided the best time to write a review for this would be while high on it. I feel fucking amazing. I literally made an account just to review this. i have bipolar disorder among other mental illnesses there fore my highs are usually very intense and result in me twitching  and telling my friends how amazing i feel. this sho,,, none of that i feel like this is what being a high school kid and stoned is all about. i read other reviews talking about how the high hits you quickly boy they were right. i took like 3 small hits from a one hitter and im gooooone (baseball) I cant weight to go lay down and waytch the office. dudner mifflin for life jan. I fell off of a ladder earlier bc i have a loft bed nd i was like &quot;whered my phone go i feel like i haven seen it in like 10 minutes and then i was like &quot;nah like 5 maybe and i turned around abd wasy like &quot;oh there it is and pointed and the i was on the ground.

VThe first initial smell is very sweet, and it made me that much more HYPE to finally try it! To be honest, it smelled like a sweet berry Sangria &#127863;with an earthy under tone, and if that doesn&#39;t make you drool than you probably won&#39;t appreciate this bud as much. Lol. The bud wasn&#39;t as dark as I thought it would be, but the taste made up for it. The flavor tastes super tart at first and than it gets sweeter and sweeter as you exhale. SO GOOD!! &#129316; The hit is semi-harsh but let&#39;s be real I&#39;d be upset if it wasn&#39;t lol. Good for relaxation, insomnia, and pain. After 30 minutes my eyes got pretty heavy so if you plan on a productive day, this one won&#39;t be your go to. More of an after dinner or work day or just to relax. I wouldn&#39;t smoke this before tanning on a beach lolol &#127774; because you will wake up a vibrant red lobster. 10/10 would smoke again! Cheers

VBlackberry Kush, when grown right, is my all time favorite strain.  You can recognize real Blackberry by its smell and color. Tinted with purple, this strain truly should smell of sweet blackberries. It helps with sleep, appetite, anxiety and pain or chronic pain.

VGot this as promo item an OZ for $99. I was so amazed at prices compared to back in the day $280. But this is not your ordinary kush.  A subtle not to strong of a strain great for beginners cause of the low THC content. Even though I like the 20% range. Not so strong of flavor but seems like as if you can smell the thrichromos on it. Very fluffy not so dense nugs. Pale lemony yellow with subtle hints of over curing. The batch I had received from, were not the best a trimming as there were still allot of shake was still on it.

VI&#39;m an outdoor grower and grew BBK for the first time in the summer of 2012.  I became a fan of this one pretty quickly.  Super easy to grow and looks beautiful when at its peak.  Looked like someone threw sugar all over the nugs and leaves.  I won&#39;t comment on the flavor, as I may have possibly not flushed it as well as I should&#39;ve.  Making sure of that this time around.  While it is an indica dominant hybrid, it has just enough of that &#39;stoned&#39; feeling without making you feel too lazy.  One of my friends tried some of mine from last year.  She later referred to it as her &#39;Happy Weed&#39;.  If you ever see this, I highly recommend you try it or, better yet, grow it!

VBeing a heavy Indica lover this packs a major punch. I love the skittly taste and smell of this strain. Smoked a j packed full of some of the blackberry and it made me oh so merry. Smoke this after a long day before bed and sink into your mattress and drift away. This knocked me out and is perfect for someone struggling with sleep. Major munchies as well. Perfect relaxer. If you like your indicas definitely give this strain a smoke.

VIt&#39;s a good strain but not the best. I&#39;d give it 3.5 if I could. \u000a\u000aBlackberry kush boasts dense dark green nugs, bright orange hairs, and a heady coat of crystals ripened to an amber color. \u000a\u000aIt smells of berries and earth. \u000a\u000aThe smoke is very smooth, berries on the inhale and fuel notes on the exhale with a mild earthiness. \u000a\u000aThe strain is relaxing but again, for me, it doesn&#39;t knock me out. :) I feel uplifted and a little Stoney but not too bad. \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re prone to migraines or cluster headaches I don&#39;t recommend this strain.

Right after the first hit the high hit me like a brick 3 bowls later me and 3 friends destroyed 4 pizzas and like 6 two liters of soda I was couch locked as hell and started watching movies. As we watched the movies I couldn&#39;t follow the plot of the movie. This would be a 5 star strain but I&#39;m giving it a 4 because while coming down from the high I was pretty nauseous and paranoid but besides that it was a great strain

VI love this strain, for me this is a creeper. with the first bowl I start feeling the tingles which is the first step to getting pain free. by the end if the second bowl I&#39;m in heaven and pain free. not to mention how much better I sleep with this strain as well. \u000a\u000aI am recommending this strain to anybody who likes to have such a euphoric and pain free with well rest

VThey dont call it Blackberry kush for nuthin... Shits dark!! Some of the darkest, purple buds i ever grinded up. When grown right there should be a nice layer of shiney,trichromes and a little orange hairs around the bud. Nice dense indica buds. Sweet, skunky kush smell. Earthy taste, not as harsh as some kush strains. Kinda of a crepper, full effects take hold in about 10 mins or so. Lingering high,a bit hazy at some points. Great for sleep or overall relaxation.

VWhat a well-proportioned combo of euphoria and body high! \u000a\u000aI usually go for sativas, but I picked up this BBK specifically to help with my insomnia and knee pain. After the first night of chiefin&#39; on some of this, this strain became my go to bud for late sessions. After a long day of work, a couple puffs of this sent pulsing vibrations throughout my body, fully distracted me from the sharp pains in my knee, and skyrocketed my thoughts into the upper atmosphere. Above the clouds I floated, heavily in the cool, crisp air.\u000a\u000aOverall, a very heavy, positive, and entrancing smoke for me. Picked it up at The Joint in Seattle!

VI was a bit disappointed at the taste, as I was expecting more of a berry (Berry/grape aromas and tastes are my favorite) and got more of a gas/fuel taste that wasn&#39;t too smooth and was harsh on the lungs. But the high was not too overwhelming and it helped me relax into the night.

VThe first initial smell is very sweet, and it made me that much more HYPE to finally try it! To be honest, it smelled like a sweet berry Sangria &#127863;with an earthy under tone, and if that doesn&#39;t make you drool than you probably won&#39;t appreciate this bud as much. Lol. The bud wasn&#39;t as dark as I thought it would be, but the taste made up for it. The flavor tastes super tart at first and than it gets sweeter and sweeter as you exhale. SO GOOD!! &#129316; The hit is semi-harsh but let&#39;s be real I&#39;d be upset if it wasn&#39;t lol. Good for relaxation, insomnia, and pain. After 30 minutes my eyes got pretty heavy so if you plan on a productive day, this one won&#39;t be your go to. More of an after dinner or work day or just to relax. I wouldn&#39;t smoke this before tanning on a beach lolol &#127774; because you will wake up a vibrant red lobster. 10/10 would smoke again! Cheers

I literally made an account just to review this. i have bipolar disorder among other mental illnesses there fore my highs are usually very intense and result in me twitching  and telling my friends how amazing i feel. this sho,,, none of that i feel like this is what being a high school kid and stoned is all about. i read other reviews talking about how the high hits you quickly boy they were right. i took like 3 small hits from a one hitter and im gooooone (baseball) I cant weight to go lay down and waytch the office. dudner mifflin for life jan. I fell off of a ladder earlier bc i have a loft bed nd i was like &quot;whered my phone go i feel like i haven seen it in like 10 minutes and then i was like &quot;nah like 5 maybe and i turned around abd wasy like &quot;oh there it is and pointed and the i was on the ground.

VI really do believe this is one of the best strains and I\u2019ve studied and smoked at least 50 with in-depth knowledge of the lineage. \u000a\u000aFirst - my experience is mostly with the ABX cartridge but I\u2019ve smoked the flower too.  My review would be geared towards ABX Blackberry Kush. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s truly a wonderful strain because the indica effect in this 99% of the time is all there except sleepy. In fact, if I want to stay up I reach for this!!\u000a\u000aThis will totally chill you out beautifully without the sleepy ness.  You will be hungry but the chill and relax is there - but the crawl into bed is not even hours later.  \u000a\u000aI highly recommend this if you use ABX cartridges to always have in your inventory.  I have bought and use this strain more than any other.

VVery low yields, sweet-earthy flavor when smoked, berry aroma, those are the most beautiful looking buds but not dense ... Personally: sleepy relaxing high, not too lasting, not too visual. I just give it 3 stars because some people around me got super-high with this, but not me.\u000aRare, I did feel very emotional with this strain.

VThis strain is my go-to for insomnia.  Got it on a bud-tender reccomendation after 3 Days of no solid sleep.  Have used for periodic insomnia for a couple months.  In low dose, it helps me drift off and helps release muscle tension in hamstrings and gluts.  In higher doses it makes me a bit randy, which can be fun at the right time.

VOne of my top 5 favorites.\u000a\u000aFlavor: When vaped the berry flavor really shines. When smoked it is far less flavorful. I guess that is true for just about everything tho.\u000a\u000aEffect: Full body stone with a pleasant amount of headiness. Relaxation and stress relief comes on quickly. Where most strong strains will make me a bit paranoid, this strain actually relieves anxiety.\u000a\u000aMood / Activity: Equally good for unwinding after a day of work or relaxing under a tree on a beautiful fall day. Puts me in the mood to just relax and enjoy nature.

Vmild, yet sweet taste of berry which doesn&#39;t match the smell which, while also mild; is much more hash like. in my experience that is common among Kush strains. \u000a\u000athe effect is slow but potent and works great to bring you down at the end of a long day. \u000a\u000amy batch was a bit leafy but had a nice frosted green color tinged by dark purple sections and a good amount of orange hairs hidden within the dense buds. \u000a\u000aif you&#39;re a taste lover like me, it&#39;s worth a try but, it&#39;s not as strong in taste and smell as it is in effect. 4 stars for a solid strain.

VI&#39;ve been surprise by this strain. It is supposed to be about %90 indic a yet it has sativa like growing properties with lateral branches and a total height of about 5 feet(indoors) growing under about 500 watts of LEDs. I also thought it would be a faster grow.  I&#39;m approaching week 12(from seed) and the plants are only starting to have significant bud development.  It&#39;s a pretty large plant. I kept one of my plants relatively unpruned to see what it&#39;s natural development looked like. It&#39;s about 3-4 feet wide by 5 feet tall. All of the lower branches maintain a J shaped growth with the outer bud development reaching for the light. The one mistake I made with this plant was putting them into a 12-12 too early. At about 36&quot; and 6 weeks from seed, I changed the light cycle. Their was some leaf curling and probably the only period in which they didn&#39;t seem robustly healthy. They haven&#39;t had a really great nuts cycle either. I started them off on bud candy at about 4-6 weeks. And having been out of nuts for about 2 weeks, I just got some gen. hydro FloraBloom. \u000a If I let these plants grow to full maturity, they will be a cash cow. It already appears that the various buds growing on a stalk bare going to grow into each other. The unpruned plant has about 20-25 stalks which are developing buds. I was really surprised to see how well the led light penetrates the canopy. I&#39;m not sure if that is because of the layout of lights or them being led. What I diid is, I kept a 300 watt full spectrum led about 6&quot; above the canopy from tyne start and once I started flowering, I introduced several 10 watt single chip LEDs on the walls at about waist height with their light being pointed at the lower branches. At like 8 weeks I added a 100 watt single chip led that i got on ebay for about $60 including the cost of a fan and heatsink. That is when I started  to notice that the bud growth is really evening out throughout the entire plants. \u000aThese ares the 1st plats that i HAVE GROWN WITH LED lights and I have been very happy with how they work. And I haven&#39;t had a single electricity bill over $100

VThis strain did what I expected it to, and then took it an extra mile. For me, the high from BBK started  as a typical high-tier indica body feel. As the first four or five tokes kicked in, I braced myself for some serious couch-lockage; it never happened. That indica melty chillness was extremely prevelant, without the usual drowsiness and general sluggishness. As I slipped into a deeper high, no couch lock showed up. Instead I found myself focussing intently on my surroundings and zoning in rather than out. This bud presented me with a deeply chilling, calming, and focussed high. The high was as enjoyable as a high can be, and lasted for about 3.5 hours until the burnout threw me into a wonderful sleep. This is top notch bud as far as im concerned,

I definitely recommend this strain to those who need pain relief, have insomnia, or appetite issues. Definitely will buy this strain again!

I personally love the cut that Allgreens grows - the bud structure is so chunky and beautifully coated with trichomes.

Took a few bowl hits.... and slept for 4 hours. Very relaxed, very sleepy, and not too bad on the paranoia.  One good hit should be enough to help you fall asleep.

VStrong strain. Berkeley Patients Care Coop lists this as a &quot;clear indica&quot; with an &quot;easy on the head&quot; effect, but I found this to be the most head-heavy strain that I&#39;ve tried. I barely felt a body buzz at all. Initially energizing, then I felt a pressure in my head and a definite dampening down or dullness that crept up about 30 minutes in. It wasn&#39;t a bad experience, and i would definitely try it again to see the effect on a headache. I&#39;m not big on mental dullness, though I shouldn&#39;t be surprised to experience this with a heavy indica strain. No anxiety from it.

Ihis one was a fairly balanced buzz, head and body. The head kicked right away with a very calming sensation followed by a moderate to heavy body relaxation. It&#39;s really calming and I&#39;d give the pain relief a 5/10, may be a 6; it&#39;s decent for muscle arthritis and back pain, and great for my mood swings after the hysterectomy last year.

VThis is another strain that is great for treating a mental health disease, such as depression, anxiety, etc.. I specifically used this strain to treat depression and anxiety; it did very well. I took one hit and in about 15 minutes I felt a very euphoric calmness. I then started listening to music and enjoyed the next 2 hours of controlled high. Compared to other strains I&#39;ve reviewed, this is definitely in the top 15.  \u000a\u000aGood strain. Definitely has a fruity taste. Used it to roll a joint and had a pleasant after taste. It burned well, and smoke was smooth.

VThis is my absolute favorite strain for Chronic back pain and being able to go to sleep in minutes without the tossing and turning. BBK has an awesome chemistry with my body and mind. It&#39;s not too much of one thing and just enough of everything. I usually can&#39;t sleep all night, with tossing and turning from back pain. With a few hits of BBK out of my little water bong, it goes down smooth just before I go down smooth to sleep. Excellent evening strain to wind down and truly just take a load off. I would strongly advise this strain if you suffer from pain and want to couple that with a chill night playing video games or listening to music. Stellar!!

VThis strain definitely gives you a nice long, lofty, and euphoric high, as well as having the hashy/jetty smell and taste as its description mentions, both through smoke and vaporizing. Although the berry notes come with the exhale and stick around for a little which is a big plus. But as others have said its isn&#39;t a strain to smoke if you have anything important to do for the rest of the day, but it is a great wind down in the evening or even better it makes those vacation days at the beach seem even longer and more relaxed than usual. Not an every day bud for me but it certainly has its places in the week

Vi dont see any purple or black... just dark green with orange hairs.  smells a little skunky, along with rotten fruit/vomit (especially when broken up) - but in a positive way.  always works wonders for me.  \u000a\u000athe initial body stone and euphoric feeling of any indica that&#39;s present in this hybrid strain helps a bit, but what really gets me in bed is BBK&#39;s unusual effect that has me both mentally and physically dizzy.  To elaborate, I cannot keep thoughts together long enough to reach an answer or memory, but i also cannot mechanically coordinate my body as my mind sees/saw fit: rendering me grounded out of fear into the bed; your head and neck feel like an ejected jack in the box that can&#39;t seem to keep straight, but leaning to either shoulder.\u000a\u000aalso found at Elemental Wellness 2 weeks ago, which was less ammonia smelling and not as potent, but with dense, frosty, purple buds (more bag appeal).\u000a\u000a~40 passed now.  I had difficulty typing this message.  When I look back at this message tomorrow, I&#39;m probably gonna compare my grammar and sentence building to how I type sober or with another strain; I feel as if my usual grammar isn&#39;t second nature - requiring extra contemplation on what the next word in my sentence would be. to top it off, my eyes are getting even more dry, suggesting closing my eye lids.  having a snack and some milk or tea to wash it down, and lay in bed listening to LSD til I doze off sounds like a good plan.  =)\u000a\u000ahappy medicating

VPossibly for sleep after a while from the time you first took it.  When I first took it I did both smoking and vaporizing tests. Vaporizing is great for medication that is flavored in some way, not just smell it but taste it when you take the dose and when you take another one and you can taste the berry taste very well it seems to leave a strong berry type taste left in the back of my throat. But it is still a great medication in helping pain and stress very well. I like it from the vaporizer best for the great taste you get it each dose or hit however you want to look at it LOL. This also seems to have some type of earthy taste but I haven&#39;t quite put my finger on it yet but I am thinking maybe a pine hint in there. This is a great medication. It works very well for my pain and stress so it works for a couple of the conditions you have to take pills with bad side effects trust me this is a lot better then taking pills, well until next time take it easy! :0)

VMy budtender described this strain as a smoker&#39;s glass of wine at the end of a long day. The smell is wonderful. Very fruity and juicy. The flower is dense and dark with purples and oranges throughout. The taste isn&#39;t super great and the smoke is harsher and more intense than other strains. As for the high, at first I felt awake and energized which was strange due to the fact that this is an indica. It was pleasant, though. Then, I felt like I couldn&#39;t necessarily think of much, my mind was empty and peaceful like a good meditation. My body was tingly and relaxed, all my muscles were fluid. My head felt big. The high continued to build as the minutes passed. This is a nice strain for before bed and camping trips with friends. It slowly and easily clears your mind and numbs your body.

VI&#39;d purchased this to try, without knowing it&#39;s powers.  I read from this site how strong a medicine this is, especially when it comes to insomnia.  At the time I bought this stuff, I didn&#39;t realize that I was coming down with a terrible flu with body aches, diarrhea, and the stomach cramps that are associated with that.  I decided to take some of this just before bedtime and soon I was asleep... for two hours.  I woke up in pain and eventually, I decided to take some more and was amazed to have the cramps lessen and lessen, and me then falling asleep again.  Very nice.

VI loved this beautiful stuff I got from Nodak in Eugene.  It was 22% THC and gave a nice, quick head high. After enjoying smooth ramping up, my body was at ease and some chronic pain melted away for hours. It can be a bit of a couch-lock but if you make yourself get creative, there&#39;s a really subtle boost of focus.  I look forward to getting some more.

After increased use, found this to be a creeper!\u000a\u000aDeceptively smooth, and with a solid hour+ delay on its sedative effects, you can hit this several times before you really start to feel it. Then you get HIGH for an hour or two, then you&#39;re knocked OUT for an hour or two.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a great high, don&#39;t get me wrong - still voted 5 stars. But it&#39;s easy to get higher than you intend while vaping this. Do not take 2-5 hours before operating heavy machinery ;)

Hunger inducing, pain relieving and even a slight wave of energetic boost before settling into a very relaxed indica feel. Only downside other than the Sahara Desert-esque dry mouth would be the difficulty in finding this strain. Stock up if a good batch is found.

VYet another very solid indica with classic indica traits and a good level of potency.  Bud looks beautiful and smells like someone threw blackberries in their diesel engine to make it run.  The high is potent and pretty relaxing, though I&#39;d say there&#39;s a touch of sativa in this one ensuring a more balanced experience than a pure indica.  This is potent and pleasurable pot, though perhaps as I&#39;ve mentioned for some other strains, not quite as singular and unique an experience as things like Lamb&#39;s Bread, Girl Scout Cookies or Black Tuna.  Still an excellent go to indica that won&#39;t just knock you out.

VSo this made me feel like I was on auto-pilot.  I can function, but no one is driving.  Totally shut my nerves off, perfect for neuropathy!  Did absolutely nothing for my muscle/back pain, went straight to my head.  Very strong head high.  It was a new experience for sure.  Light tasting, berry notes, but also tasted like soil/dirt.  If you could mix a berry smoothie and add soil, you got this strain.  I&#39;d still try it, it did help with mood swings - I wasn&#39;t angry or frustrated.

VExcellent flower! Very pretty buds. Nice dark green color mixed with dark purples and fatty orange hairs. My bud isn&#39;t super dense. More open and fluffed in appearance. Very dense with thc. She smoked very very good. The bud was cured perfectly and burned perfectly and wasn&#39;t any kind of harsh even on the really deep lung hits. The high crept in slowly and lasted only an hour and a half or so. But the high was very pleasant. I could probably be perfect for the entire afternoon of a gram joint to myself or a real good vape session. Love the strain. Love the looks of the flower. Love the taste and smoothness of the smoke. Very good strain. Lots of bag appeal.

V80% Indica 20% Sativa 19% THC \u000a\u000aThis one is a good starter weed for beginners I think. also it is great at eliminating pain and inflammation.  Doesn&#39;t taste like blackberry at all, but great flavor, sweet and great smell. not much of a head high at all though, and coming down brings a shity headache, but drink a couple beers and eat some food and it&#39;s gone.  overall pretty good, only bad experience once when I got really stoned on this one every second felt like an eternity, didn&#39;t dig that to much but it wasn&#39;t terrible. overall good w&#232;ed, right now between the two this and girl Scout cookies girl Scout cookies wins easily... but the BBK does have a better taste. And if u don&#39;t like much of a head high this is the stuff.

VVery potent. acts fast, no doubt about it. Very dense, compact nugs that break up nicely. Don&#39;t expect the pleasant blackberry undertone in the aroma to translate to the flavor when smoking - it&#39;s somewhat harsh, even from a water pipe, and a biggish hit can send even a seasoned smoker into a sustained coughing fit. Of course, once that ceases the high is even more prominent. Blackberry Kush definitely lives up the old &quot;cough and get off&quot; refrain. A worthy contender, a few good bowls worth will definitely put you on your butt if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, but not a kush I&#39;ll turn to very often given the abundance of other varieties available.

At 7 watts it produces nice clouds of relaxation mixed with a shoulder and neck deep tissue massage thrown in for extra measure.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t suggest this strain for daytime before 4  use because you&#39;ll want to Netflix and chill by yourself.

VBack with another review. Sorry I have not put out a review in a while. I bought some of the stuff I had already reviewed. So Blackberry Kush, this is some good stuff. It is grown from Treehawk Farms. I think they are more of a top shelf farm. But it was $50 for the 1/8. But this stuff was worth it. First off, the smell. Oh god, the smell. I need to figure out how the hell they get the weed to smell like fruit. Blows my mind. And it is a nice high. For me, it sits right in the front of my head. Kinda a fuzzy feeling there. Definitely felt mellow after smoking it. Made me feel good, and it put my wife to sleep. She has a hard time sleeping, so this is a bonus. Decent THC, I would definitely recommend this to you. If you come across it at 25 Trees, get it. It is worth it.

As amazing as that sounds, I feel that I have not yet found an indica strain that has helped me in ways that I need. Blackberry Kush is a strain you want in your cabinet ALWAYS!!

VWow. I can&#39;t say enough about this stuff. I got a sample from a friend and as soon as he handed the bag over I knew it was good. The scent is enticing and aromatic - you can smell it right through any container it&#39;s stored in.  The buds are firm, sticky, and quite dense. Nothing like the dry, crumbled texture of lesser goods. Wonderful bag appeal as well.\u000a\u000aThe smoke is rich, strong, and has a delicious earthy sweetness. It produces a very soothing euphoric buzz with few side effects. It&#39;s the perfect high for listening to some chill beats or watching a good movie. You will love this strain if you just want to lounge around and unwind. Don&#39;t forget the snacks. You&#39;ll need them ;)\u000a\u000aThis strain has quickly become one of my top ten faves. I smoked a huge bowl with my mom and I think she loved it just as much as I did.

VInteresting taste, not sure if I like it or not, time will tell.  Good body high, but a little more cerebral than I expected.  Might be better for netflix and chill than for sleep.

VWonderfull strain that if moderated, creates a chill and relaxed evening. In higher doses, it puts me right to sleep and keeps me that way for most of the night. I don&#39;t sleep well due to my back pain and anxiety but BBK does the trick. It has a very &quot;fumey&quot; smell that is slightly sweet in the mouth with a slightly piney exhale.

VOh man, Blackberry Kush. One of the alright strains I&#39;ve smoked in the while&#39;s I&#39;ve been smoking. Me and my buddies matched up and got a dime(The dealer skimped us so I handle him the way anyone should.) Me and my buddy broke up the buds &amp; I rolled it in a hemp paper. It&#39;s one of the ones you get like this nice purple tint off of I can&#39;t say how weird it was just smoking it, I got UBER-high off of 3 hits. The high barely lasted 2 hours. Maybe it&#39;s my tolerance but it&#39;s something you want to smoke believe me.

VWithout  a doubt this strain is a top 10 contender.\u000a\u000aFirst thing you will notice is the skunkish aroma.  It very nice but not as strong as skunk.  It smokes smooth and tastes like candy.\u000a\u000aEffects are felt after a few seconds and last for 45 minutes or so.  \u000a\u000a-There is no stoned feeling.  \u000a\u000aNo head high such as experienced with headband.\u000a\u000a-Great during the evening time or when relaxing relaxing\u000a\u000a-Increases sexual arousal.  But not as much as blue dream.\u000a\u000a-Increase appetite slightly\u000a\u000a-Does not upset stomach\u000a\u000a-Makes me lazy and want to sleep\u000a\u000a*-A great strain for pain relief.  However, you must smoke frequently for the pain relief benefits.
