VA fruity bud that will leave you uplifted, subtly energized, and mellowed out all at the same time. Great strain for shooting some hoops and finding that zone where you&#39;re simply doing instead of thinking.

VJust smoked this strain for the first time like 10 mins ago and I am goooone, this is one of the best strains I&#39;ve ever had. Literally just wanna go to the park and swing on in the swings. This has put me in such a good mood and it smells super nice too. Definitely buying more

VOhana Gardens \u000a\u000aPineapple Punch is a new favorite. I grabbed a 1g pre-roll, which was well crafted. Smoked beautifully - very little babysitting needed. By the end of the joint thick resin could be seen seeping through the paper.\u000a\u000aBefore I finished smoking it, I could clearly feel the cerebral effects kicking in. Fifteen minutes later, I&#39;m felt clear-headed and could feel the body effects kicking in. A half-hour later my appetite was growing and my hand tremors were quieting. Now, 40 minutes later and I&#39;m wrapping up this review so I can eat.    \u000a\u000aFlavor was good. While my wife called pineapple, I smelled just dank tropical fruit. (If you&#39;ve ever been to the tropics, you know that sweet/ripe/funky smell...). Pre-dominant fruit notes, with an undertone of skunk. The smoke was smooth with moderate expansion. \u000a\u000aHarvest: 5/30/18\u000aTerpenes: 2.4% (predominantly alpha-pinene and myrcene, then beta-pinene, caryophyllene, limonene, humulene, linalool, and terpinolene by percentage). \u000a\u000aThis one turned out to be an equally enjoyable day-off morning smoke and beneficial medical toke.
