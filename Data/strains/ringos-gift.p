VI have undiagnosed crippling anxiety. I have been meaning to try out a new strain that is high in CBD and low in THC. This strain has a total of 1.58% THC and the total CBD is 25.5%. This strain has made my anxiety manageable without the high of the THC. This is amazing!

VCame back to God&#39;s plant after not smoking for ten years.(too long) came back for medicinal purposes,(pain from competitive sports, ankle, back, and neck. Also go through bad cycles  of inflammation.) that being said, heard about the wonders of CBD oil and after obsessive research, decided to try it out first in a tincture. Talk about a miracle for me, wow, so good. Shortly after went out and got me a Pax2 vaporizer and happily went down the cannabis CBD rabbit hole. It has been truly life changing, my quality of life has improved drastically. I believe everyone should be on this as a preventative and a cure. If you have any sort of chronic pain or inflammation CBD strains are the cure. Which brings me to one of my favorites thus far. Ringos gift is a great day time smoke because your clear headed to get your work done while also feeling uplifted, focused, and very relaxed. Takes the pain away. Has a taste I love sweeter where as AC/DC which is an other favorite is way earthy, so it&#39;s a good contrast. I will do a review on AC/DC soon but don&#39;t hesitate to pick up either. I&#39;ve been lucky with the Ringo because I heard it&#39;s hard to find. Whoever out there, PLEASE keep growing it. Peace.

VI am fairly new to using cannabis as medicine. So I don&#39;t have a lot to compare Ringo&#39;s gift to. But here it goes. \u000a\u000aI went to Essence dispensary in Vegas and got Jonathan as my consultant. He was extremely knowledgable about all the different strains and made my first trip to a dispensary a great experience. \u000a\u000aI told him that I was looking for something for pain and inflammation (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS because of my peptic ulcers), that won&#39;t cause anxiety. He highly recommended Ringo Gift concentrate. \u000a\u000aI love the fact that I am able to use this at work to help relieve pain from my carpel tunnel syndrome and rotator cuff tendinitis. It didn&#39;t make me feel like a space cadet like all the other strains I&#39;ve tried. Now I wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s quite as effective as Advil, but it doesn&#39;t cause ulcer pain. So I say it&#39;s a winner!\u000a

VThis is the strain for anyone who suffers from rapid thoughts or anxiety because of weed. CBD strains fill your brain receptors with CBD rather than THC, meaning you get relaxed as hell and just feel good as fuckk, then the THC goes in but with less strength. The CBD pretty much counters the THC anxiety. You can mix this strain with pretty much any other strains, even strong sativas, and as long as you smoke this one first, the second strain you smoke shouldn&#39;t result in as much anxiety because the receptors are occupied.

VThis is by far the best strain I&#39;ve tried for anxiety. I have used it when I am having a full blown panic attack and it melts the anxiety away as fast as you can smoke it. You have to smoke a ton of it to even feel high if you&#39;re experiencing any amount of anxiety. \u000a\u000aWhen I feel anxiety coming on, I smoke it until the anxiety goes away, which is always within a few short minutes. And then I just feel relaxed and calm and not stoned at all. It&#39;s incredible. I cannot say enough good things about this strain for treating anxiety. It is second to none. \u000a\u000aI wish it was easier to come by in Michigan.

VThis was the first CBD strain I have ever smoked. I always felt that CBD could end up being a waste for me due to the fact that many reasons I use pot is for mental stuff. I gravitate toward heavy psychoactive indicas, and didn&#39;t think the CBD would affect me in any pleasurable way. \u000a\u000aThis strain is everything physical. When I take it, I am covered in a warm blanket, relaxing even the little muscles in my body I did not know were tense. Medically, this strain will do great for those with chronic pain. Recreationally, smoke this alone on a day off when you are doing house chores or reading a book. Even though the psychoactive affect is not there, it is worth every dollar &amp; gram.

VIm so happy because of this strain. I&#39;ll tell you why.\u000a\u000aFrom since I can remember I have always suffered severe panic attacks and dealt with anxiety. I suffer from a fear of throwing up, called emetophobia. It has caused a lot of my anxiety and is the reason that triggers my panic attacks most of the time.\u000a\u000aI have had many unpleasant experiences with cannabis causing me to stop using it for a while. Each time I would use it, I would start to overthink about my fear and would cause me to have a panic attack while high which is one of the worst feeling ever. Believe me.\u000a\u000aHowever I discovered this strain, one with high CBD instead of THC. After doing much research about CBD, I decided to give this strain a shot. And let me tell you, it was one of the happiest decisions I have made. \u000a\u000aI no longer get too focused on the high causing me to panic, yet I get the happy, good, relaxing sensations that I have wanted with cannabis for so long without panicing. I feel free of panic on this strain, not something I would get with any other strain.\u000a\u000aAnyways, sorry for long review, just wanted to share my happiness with everyone!

VThis is my go to strain for something in the low THC and high CBD category. I&#39; m very lucky in the fact that I live next to a dispensary that carries Ringo&#39;s Gift grown at Marigold farm. It&#39;s always consistent and leaves me with a slight head change but nothing drastic and relives all pain within the first or second toke. It has a sweet earthy smell to it, with a crunchy out side and soft inside. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a instant pain relief, with little to no &quot;high&quot; feeling.

VA great CBD strain for daytime use. I&#39;m very prone to panic attacks from THC, though I do enjoy it, and that&#39;s the downside. I have been looking for a good 4:1 strain, CBD to THC, but came across Ringo&#39;s Gift, a 2:1 CBD to THC. The high was slow acting, peaceful, and euphoric. I kept thinking &quot;oh no here comes a panic attack&quot; but it never came. There is enough CBD in this strain to mellow out the anxiety, but I would say the sativa genetics still stand out with a slightly racy mindset. Overall, a nice, relaxing experience that will leave the body pain-free, and the mind slightly lifted.

I&#39;ve been smoking this strain with 18%CBD and less than 1%THC every morning for about a month and it&#39;s been a total game changer for me! I&#39;m able get up at 6am and go about my day like a normal, functional human. I can drive every day without having panic attacks, and it keeps me level, happy, calm, and relaxed for the entire morning. Highly recommend!

Don&#39;t worry you still get thc with this strain to get a high, just smoke more.  I experimented, and find that 1 gram smoked over 1 hour period gave me a nice mellow high for 2-3 hours.

VI have Fibromyalgia and was looking for something that would take effect quicker than general CBD oil (I&#39;ve been taking over 200mg with minimal results)I should also say I do not like smoking pot, at all, never liked it. It always made me paranoid and anxious.\u000a\u000aAnyways, back to review, I was advised to try a CBD heavy strain as it takes effect much quicker. After a lot of trial and error, I read about this strain and picked up a few pre-rolls to see. I love this strain! No throat hit or harshness. Takes away so much pain and leaves me alert and in a great mood! This has replaced all my scripts and is doing such a better job! Definitely recommend!!

VThis strain is interesting in its digression from the characteristics of its parents, both buds I&#39;ve smoked, a pair of really intense, really racy, burly sativas. In union, they produce a flower which smokes with in fact a  deeply indica persuation; it hits heavy and low, floating \u000aalong the floor, a true full moon kush. Fully dank. Whew. Who Knew? Genetics.\u000a\u000aNow, my guess as to what went so right in this strain perhaps has something to do with compounds present in the plant like cbd and thc, and the ratios of the of their quantities present. Of course there is also the potential of forms such as kief, hash, and oil, but these have yet to be explored for this strain by this author. However, I can also personally confirm that the medical claims of this strain are legitimate, as I have now met multiple people who are in their words &quot;successfully&quot; treating a massive range of symptoms across a range of maladies and ill affects which are pharmaceutically and or otherwise untouchable without this particular plant. I find this massively compelling.\u000a\u000aAnd so to many, this becomes a fully medicinal, holy bud, and I&#39;d agree with them!

VI am not a smoker so I have pretty much no tolerance . I dab CBD daily. My Ringo\u2019s Gift tops out at .6%. THC. I can have a few hits and my body feels warm and snuggly. About four big rips from a bong and I get a decent head high. Very mellow. I could go to sleep or I could fiddle around the house. Looking to get a dry herb vape. Does a decent job with pain. Perhaps it\u2019s more muscle relaxy than analgesic. I will make sure I have some around.

VThis is very good at getting rid of pain. I woke up with a headache and have been sneezing. I think I\u2019m getting a cold or something. It IS that time of year (November). Either way, I took 500mg of Tylenol upon waking to see if that would help. It didn\u2019t. I thought having a little coffee would help since I\u2019ve been cutting back on coffee intake. It didn\u2019t. We had an appointment for the dispensary at noon and we picked up this strain in an oil cartridge. I tried two hits of it and I could feel the pain in my head dissipate in radial waves. Like Ringo\u2019s Gift was a pebble that you drop into a pool of water and the pain relief effects were the ripples of water spreading. Good stuff.

VI&#39;ve got bone spurs and arthritis in my ankles and it&#39;s becoming more clear that I need surgery to correct this in my left ankle and tighten my ligaments. There&#39;s a lot going on in there and my ankle is inflamed and painful. I&#39;m not able to take NSAIDs and I don&#39;t really like the risks of taking acetaminophen. I decided to try cannabis to relieve pain and to help with my mood as this much pain also has a great impact on it. I really appreciate this strain. It&#39;s not that my joints are not painful, it just keeps the pain from cutting right through me. In addition, I&#39;m able to function during the day, and feel relaxed and focused. Ringo&#39;s gift is great. I&#39;m so grateful for it!

VA staple in my medicine cabinet. Ringo&#39;s Gift is my go to CBD strain. When the muscle spasticity gets really bad, one bowel and you can feel your body unwind almost immediately. This is a body relief strain so not a lot of head change. You get couch locked but that might be what you need to take the pain away. I haven&#39;t needed to take my prescribed muscle relaxer as often because this strain really does the trick. I would recommend this strain for the first time user. Great introductory strain for those that have pain and muscle spasticity.

VI&#39;m admittedly a &quot;lightweight&quot; smoker. A huge reason I got my card is due to anxiety related issues.  So, I generally ask my budtender if they have a flower they would recommend that&#39;s a &quot;Mild Indica, and CBD is a huge bonus.&quot; So I decided to risk this hybrid on his recommendation... I have never smoked anything so calming as this strain. While not &quot;super high&quot; - I feel incredibly medicated after even one hit. It crushes anxiety. Starts fast and holds steady.\u000a\u000a5/5 - will buy again.

Smell is not too pungent, what I do get is maybe a little citrus swirled in a deep earthiness. Taste is pretty flowery and earthy. Right off the bat I notice my lower back pain is completely gone, I can do sit ups without yelling &quot;MOTHERF*****!!!!!&quot; Got pretty tired quickly, mostly from the abundance of relaxation and euphoria shooting through my body. Mixed with some ATF and got really happy and wanted to take a walk. Great spirits in the air and the joy of love. Definitely gonna try some more cbd strains

You do get the familiar relaxed and mellow feelings associated with CBD, but you can get a bigger bang for your buck elsewhere.
