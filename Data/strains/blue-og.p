VThis strain was produced by the Wasatch Seed Co by selecting a male Bubba OG, (pre bubba 98 x Og kush) x ( bubba kush) and a very potent fragrant Blueberry female to create this flower that looks like it was dipped in sugar. A very high calyx to leaf ratio, medium yields indoor and large outdoor and grows just like a christmas tree. Users cannot get enough of this flower constantly wanting more and loving the fruity yet pungent smell of this beauty. Light green and white from the large trichomes. Makes a powerful lung expanding smoke from flowers and extracts. Potency and terpene profile to come. First of man y to come from Wasatch Seed Company. Indoor flower time 8-10 weeks outdoor 1st week to mid October

VBlue OG is a very niche strain in that it is a hybrid but it feels like a pure, strong indica. I go to class high most of the time and the weed I smoke before usually doesn&#39;t matter, but this stuff will knock you on your ass. Don&#39;t plan on doing anything for at least 4 hours. Great before bed.

VMy recent G13 Blue OG harvest has given me the best yield to date and my new all time fav, so happy I&#39;ve kept clones! A lovely low odour medium height plant, she finished 8 weeks from first flowers with impressive foxtailing and resin production. I had no small buds anywere on this plant, all lovely and dense buds with a diverse range of bright colours. The smoke is berries, white widow and a hint of blueberrys. Very smooth great tasting smoke with a great balance of High and Stoned. Very creative thinking with a complete muscle relaxing background. As others have said she&#39;s a creeper and go easy on how much you smoke as she will put you to a beautiful  sleep (tastes so good it&#39;s very easy to smoke too much, i had this problem with G13 Purple Haze haha). This is my first Kush and i can understand what all the hype is about, shall keep my pheno going. I have an outdoor cloning perfoming very well, so shall report back on how she finishes! ^_^

VThe form I tried was an oil based tincture made by a local group. The packaging didn&#39;t say what the strain was, so wrote to them and asked. They said it was based on Blue OG, but could contain various others that they choose for effect. Wish they&#39;d label it.\u000a\u000aEither I overdid the dose (25 drops) or the strain isn&#39;t suited to me. Lots of motion sickness, head buzz, and uncomfortable mask feeling in the face and lungs felt heavy. Breathing was shallow unless I focused on deep breathing. I started to wonder if there was a chemical contamination or something. The effect didn&#39;t totally wear off until the next evening. Interesting colors and textures when I&#39;d close my eyes. A lesser dose (10 drops) the previous day only yielded a head buzz and sleepiness. With indicas, I typically have a buzz, a bit of motion sickness, then some really nice fantasies kick in for a few hours. :-) But this one was a real problem.

VI got mine from a shop in bay area. Has a nice og taste with blueberry underlined in it. As for the effect, its really uplifting, kind of a creeper. I wasn&#39;t couch locked and it wasn&#39;t too much of a head high either. I just feel really happy and smiley on blue og. In my opinion this is a good day smoke. This will help depression mainly, may help your anxiety also. I use it for day activities and homework. Not the strongest og but it&#39;s worth grabbing if you haven&#39;t tried it. I&#39;ll reach for a heavier Indica if I want to get real stoned.

My partner and I got deep into conversation, and yes we did forget where we were at times in it but! Making deeper connections that I didn\u2019t necessarily make while sober is a cool factor for this strain for me! Gives munchies but not extreme munch needs.

I would say it would almost be impossible to have an attack even if you have a panic disorder that\u2019s how chill and relaxing this smoke is.... the looks and smell can be deceiving bc it looked like shit and didn\u2019t smell that great.

VThe form I tried was an oil based tincture made by a local group. The packaging didn&#39;t say what the strain was, so wrote to them and asked. They said it was based on Blue OG, but could contain various others that they choose for effect. Wish they&#39;d label it.\u000a\u000aEither I overdid the dose (25 drops) or the strain isn&#39;t suited to me. Lots of motion sickness, head buzz, and uncomfortable mask feeling in the face and lungs felt heavy. Breathing was shallow unless I focused on deep breathing. I started to wonder if there was a chemical contamination or something. The effect didn&#39;t totally wear off until the next evening. Interesting colors and textures when I&#39;d close my eyes. A lesser dose (10 drops) the previous day only yielded a head buzz and sleepiness. With indicas, I typically have a buzz, a bit of motion sickness, then some really nice fantasies kick in for a few hours. :-) But this one was a real problem.

Vok so i recieved this strain and just like the the name it holds both strains characteristics to a t the thc on this flower was very appearent all the way down to the stem and the smell was earthy with a touch of citric fruit the buds were nice and condensed and had decent bag appeal now to move on to the preperation of the flower it was was on a scale of 1/4 resin was 3/4 on the finger tips and smelt quite good i used a pax vaporizer and the vapor was smooth and almost tasteless on inhale and exhale was quite smooth moderatly thick and cant really tell if its a sweet fruit or sweet citric flavor as i neared the end of the consumption theres a expanding sensation of euphoria and as it starts to build up momentum theres a relaxing sensation to my muscles no doubt from the indica side for this as it continues i become lost in thought not strong enough to say couched locked but definatly distracted all in all worth while as pm
