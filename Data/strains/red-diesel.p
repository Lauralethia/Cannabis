VAs far as commercial growth goes, Red Diesel is an outstanding mix. The indica added to the NYC definitely increases weight and density to the buds. The smell is emphatically chemically, at least the batch I acquired, giving the diesel taste character. It&#39;s not a flavor I prefer and not one I mind. It knocked me out and I experienced minor couch-lock and a severe case of the munchies during the comedown. Best for insomnia or eating disorders.

VIt has been quite a while since I enjoyed this strain, but when I was last in Amsterdam, Barney&#39;s had this one and it quickly became one of my favourite smokes.\u000a\u000aThe taste was amazing, a little fruity and the effects were perfect for walking around Amsterdam. I combined this herb with some dutch water hash and was stoned to the point I felt like things were getting psychedelic. I truly enjoy this strain.

VGot an 1/8th of this and I&#39;ve only smoked it twice, which is enough to know I probably won&#39;t be smoking more of this. Although it was suggested to me as a good strain based on my condition, I&#39;ve found this is a strain does the opposite. \u000a\u000aI was smoking this one night while home alone, my my mom had taken my brother out driving, and since I have a tendency to worry about losing my family a lot (due to separation anxiety and I have difficulties depending on myself), being on this strain elevated these feelings and made the high pretty uncomfortable, like I wish I hadn&#39;t smoked. \u000a\u000aSo, this definitely isn&#39;t a strain to smoke if you&#39;re in a panicked or upset state, cause if you react like I did in front of others, this will falsely prove to them cannabis can be bad for you.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be getting this strain again, if anything I&#39;ll use it as back-up weed if I&#39;m ever out, if it&#39;s still fresh, or I&#39;ll use it for social smoking since I don&#39;t believe any weed should go to waste.\u000a\u000aThen again, maybe the dispensary I picked it from had a bad batch, but who knows.
