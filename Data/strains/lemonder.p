VThis is the best strain I&#39;ve yet to try! I am in love &#128525;. \u000aI have dry mouth and eyes when I&#39;m not high, and this doesn&#39;t give me cotton mouth and make my eyes hurt when I blink! It must be witch craft &#128514;

VI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a luxury candle maker tried to make candles out of it. I would probably buy some. When you smoke it there\u2019s a pleasant aftertaste that reminds me of yellow skittles. The high is relaxing and fun but not very affecting of the mind. It\u2019s great for hanging out with people who aren\u2019t smoking with you, so it doesn\u2019t put you too much in a different headspace from them.

VPicked up an 1/8 about 3 weeks ago and now that I\u2019m all out I have to ask if I want more of it. This batch was so sticky! Probably one of the stickiest buds I\u2019ve ever come in contact with. It\u2019s smell is what really brings this strain home. It fully embodies both its lemon and lavender parents. It\u2019s affects hit me hard and had me thinking I was a space ranger for a good portion of the day. It earned its top shelf price of $45 for me but is definitely worth savoring for special occasions

VRelaxing along with a rush of happy thoughts. :) Picked this up at The Gallery by Seattles Private Reserve!! Smells like lemons and pine needles, smooth smoke with a citrusy flavor! Definitely going to buy some more
