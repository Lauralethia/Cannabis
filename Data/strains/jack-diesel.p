VWhat a killer strain of two of my favorites NYC Diesel and Jack Herer. Through my Arizer Solo vaporizer ground medium, this blend tastes mostly fruity and light followed by a pleasantly mild diesel taste. Initially it produces a strong, clean head high inviting creativity and thought. Later you will be left feeling good, happy and ready for your day! Hats off to TCC in Mesa for carrying this (and many other) killer strain!

VDabbing some shatter. Takes like car oil, tree bark and lemon verbena. \u000aDon&#39;t plan to do anything important or play any games, you couldn&#39;t focus on a train wreck if it was happening right in front of you. I am all over the place, mentally and physically. I just can&#39;t get my shit together.\u000aI feel like I am floating around the room which is totally fun, lots of Euphoria hangin on for a while now. \u000aNo strong urge to snack BUT candy tastes even more amazing.\u000aCognitive skills are horrendous, don&#39;t even know how I&#39;m typing this review... \u000aWait... what is the point of this strain?? Oh yea, I&#39;m floating.\u000aI give it a 4 because it&#39;s a Sativa that has the effects of an Indica. I want sativa effects from a sativa!\u000aThis is a great strain if you are bored AF doing something because I am staring at the 4 little stars and my mind is just all sorts of day-dreamin!

VThis is a fantastic strain here folks! I waited too long and was only able to get popcorn nugs, but they were very very tasty. By adding Jack H to this diesel it seemed to take the intensity down a couple notches, providing ample energy but feeling nice and relaxed for a long time. I can&#39;t wait for this one to roll around again, it&#39;s a new favorite for sure! Thanks to TCC in Mesa for another quality flower.

VBy far my favorite one sativa strain.    Make you feel happy and relaxed and after some time you feel the energy and ready to do things.    Pretty recommendable to use since early morning to afternoon, some time at night will give you to much energy if you want to sleep soon.

VI LOVE LOVE LOVE this strain!! It leaves you talkin up a storm so it&#39;s great for shy people in social situations. Be careful, it&#39;s almost like being drunk, you&#39;ll say and do basically anything. Also got very aroused on this strain. Everything you touch feels like magic! Doesn&#39;t make you nervous or anxious one bit. It&#39;s actually amazing for people with anxiety like myself. The taste is brilliant!

VThis long lasting strain affected me differently than what most people are reporting. It makes me very relaxed and calm with couchlock. It feels more like an indica than a sativa or at least an indica dominate hybrid. Either way, this strain is fantastic.
