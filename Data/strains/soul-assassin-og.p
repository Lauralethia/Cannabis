V&quot;Most people when choosing their medical marijuana generally find a specific species and experiment with strain variants to find what works best for them. For me, Indica dominance for my nighttime medication needs is generally the species I go fo. Sometimes I do prefer a Indica-dominant hybrid, but pure Indica\u2019s tend to work best.\u000a\u000aOG\u2019s are known for their heavy stone and couch lock capability, and Soul Assassins is an OG variant from a localized grower that does not disappoint. Soul Assassin has typical OG traits\u2014very dark buds with spots of green foliage and dark orange hairs protruding from everywhere. However, even without looking, the typical flavor of an OG is impossible to mistake. With a piney taste with a hint of almost a peppery sensation, Soul Assassin creates a powerhouse stone in the front portion of the face near the nasal cavities, creeping around behind the sides and back of the eyes. Slowly fading from the nasal cavities and settling finally in the eyes, this strain is perfect for those wanting a heavy stone to produce a rapid and powerful sleep.\u000a\u000aThe only problem I have with these &quot;heavier&quot; Indica\u2019s is that unless that with so much strength, you can wake up the next morning feeling groggy and or still a little &quot;off.&quot; That, of course, defeats the purpose of a good night&#39;s sleep. I do still recommend Soul Assassins for those with severe insomnia issues and insomnia issues resulting from pain or injury. Otherwise, the feeling in the morning simply isn\u2019t justified.&quot;

VThe OG that\u2019s not too OG.\u000a  Most OG\u2019d hit hard, knocking you to the couch and or bed. Leaving you sleeping well into the night without even knowing it. S.A isn\u2019t that in reality. Smoke this and you are relieved of stress as you feel relaxed. But sleepy is not what you feel. At least not with the flower I am smoking. Still a good flower to relax to. As for me, it didn\u2019t hit hard enough for an indica.

VGreat general mood-lifter. Not immediate or intensely so, like Maui Wowie, but in a gentler, more profound way. \u000a\u000aLittle to no clouding in thinking. Not what I&#39;d consider an intensely psychoactive strain. Fun for creative work or easing social stress.

VI got a batch of smaller, medium density buds lab tested 25% THC. The smell is diesel. Beautiful purple calyx with deep orange pistils. Totally encrusted with trichomes. Effect is clear headed and relaxing. Great for winding down at night.

VThis is one of the first strains that I tried with my fiance. I don&#39;t know if it was because I tried sungrown or if it was just a bad batch but I didn&#39;t get high... The taste was like I just drank pine sol. The buds were embarrassing ugly little fuckers that were literally like porcelain marbles. I shoulda checked the harvest date but I was highly disappointed. \u000a\u000aThis experience is why I don&#39;t trust testing numbers. This was testing at 25.6% THC and I was no where near high not even like low grade bottom of the pot high... Just nothing &#128528;
