VThis stuff is really good. So far the best weed me and my lady have come across. Really good for a bowl. Easy to hit. And really hard hitting saliva. Makes us silly. Good times Buddy Boy Farms. Keep it up\u000a

Vreal potent weed. I got really high off this really quick because of how strong it is! I love this weed I can get things done if I get up and do stuff but this weed really really relaxes you so it will easily couch lock you. love this weed because it&#39;s everything I look for in a strain...it can get me to do stuff or put me right to sleep while being really dank

Vok so i picked up 2G of Dutch Queen and it was 25.16% and it was enjoyable the aroma coming from the buds are very pungent.. smoking the buds when the high hits you it is pretty mellow and calming, you definitely will get couch locked and then if you listen to music the euphoric energy takes play and i spent an hour just rocking out and lost focus of what i was even doing great weed loved it bought another 4G today

VI thought it was actually a really good sativa. Really long lasting. No fancy aroma. It is a piney earthy but very effective for active smokers. No mind fog. Good one for a good price.
