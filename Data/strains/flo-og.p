VI will say Flo OG gets a 5/5 regarding easing my tense muscles and cramps. It helped me sleep. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, it totally gave me the weed chills.  That usually makes me feel somewhat  anxious until I sleep it off.\u000a\u000aIt isn&#39;t my favorite weed, but my girlfriend loves it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VThis is some sweet dankness!  We vaped and immediately felt effects ... euphoria, body buzz, and relaxation.  What a nice high!  I was energized and totally chill at the same time.  Tasted notes of berry and citrus as we smoked.  Flo OG just became one of my faves.

VFlo OG will hit in such a way where the first 10 minutes after a puff are a bit anxious, but this is worth the slight discomfort as it quickly passes and becomes the complete opposite, the most calming and medicating feeling takes over and it&#39;s really the best strain I&#39;ve ever experienced. It&#39;s my favorite.

VDeep forest and dark pine green dense nugs with flecks of purple and rich orange threads, completely dusted in powdery white frost.  Sweet berry taste, a little earthy, great flowery aroma.  Very solid pain relief, quite powerful but workable, primarily body with a nice euphoric onset.  \u000a\u000aAnother excellent NETA strain, stats from batch 718, TAC 28.9, THCA 27.3, D9THC 0.4, CBDA 0.1, CBC 0.2, CBGA 0.9

VDefinitely an Indica, Flo OG gets the body feeling good! It&#39;s stank is probably the first thing you&#39;ll notice with this bud, like Mary Jane ripped a weed fart for real! LoL The strain description says functional but if you don&#39;t HAVE to do anything, then you&#39;re probably not going to WANT to do anything LoL...aaand now I&#39;m all stoned and I don&#39;t want to type anymore sooo\u000a

VBeautiful big sticky buds that will rock your world. This strain has legs that will keep you going for hours. Nice stony euphoric buzz, with some serious couch lock. If you have anyone to do, do it before you smoke. Some of the best I\u2019ve ever smoked. Too sticky for joints, so you\u2019ll need a pipe.

VThis one is an interesting combo of a over-hyped mediocre strain (Flo) with a great Indica (Rare Darkness). It&#39;s most definitely an Indica dominant strain but the Flo adds in an airy almost dreamlike quality to the high while simultaneously eliminating the bogginess one can get with Indica&#39;s. As someone who doesn&#39;t really care for Flo (I&#39;ve only ever had ONE batch that actually blew my socks off) I really enjoyed this strain because the Flo head high was more prominent with the heavy body high to accompany it.
