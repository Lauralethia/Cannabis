VI was in a car accident last year, and this really helps with my muscle spasms and it keeps me relaxed. It helps me feel less anxious and more relaxed. Great strain.

VI like to smoke just a couple hours before going to bed. It&#39;s name really fits. I sleep well and have pleasant dreams and awake feeling fully refreshed and ready for another day. Being a relative light weight, I only need a couple of hits.
