VBrandywine has a really good taste and smooth. A little on the weak side for me but I still love it just for the taste and the effect. I will use it more for a day smoke. I tried it because it said the effects were like Grandaddy Purple strain (I have been wanting to try that &amp; still haven&#39;t yet).The effects were very mellow and relaxed without feeling like you wanted to sleep. Took away all the pain and headache. Definitely a good strain to put on your list that you&#39;ve tried. I would buy it again.

VA friend recommended this strain, so I tried it before reading reviews... And hoo-eee it was a body tingling, face melting, diesel-tasting, warm blanket of indica love. When I later learned it has recently won the Seattle DOPE Cup, I wasn&#39;t at all surprised. I hope we start seeing a lot more Brandywine on shelves, this is pure fire, great for pain, stress... perfect for Netflix and bed.

VNada. Zip. Zzzzzzzz.\u000aI understand that different strains effect people in different ways,  but c&#39;mon.\u000aNo body melt, no mood alteration. Just immediate onset profound sleepiness. But I soldiered on...smoked at least half a gram. Still nothing. Sorry to be the dissenter among the ranks :(
