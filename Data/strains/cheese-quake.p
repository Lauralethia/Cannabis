V3.5 stars for this relaxing Indica with a secret Sativa side. Was a recommendation from the Herbal Wellness kid and I was skeptical, but it is not terrible. Euphoric and easygoing. Also can build high with subsequent smokes - no plateauing of the high. Cheese is gross, but these effects are smooth like Brie.

VI liked this but it didn&#39;t totally take away the pain in my left leg. Daily,  I get chronic pain &amp; it alternates sides but yesterday was a worse day. For a while there I couldn&#39;t even be weight-bearing on it.  About 3/4 of the way into my first FAT joint of this, it hit me that it was going to be a creeper weed. Also, it has a weird sushi odor/taste about it... (not a BFD if you&#39;re a regular sushi-eater like me)...which I don&#39;t know if that came from the packaging or something went wrong with the grow, but hey, I only paid $40 for my eighth &amp; it got me high, so I&#39;m not complaining.

VGreat mellow head high. Fairly happy and uplifted. Find this to be very sedating, but not in a heavy couch lock kind of way, more of a &quot;happy and melt your pain away&quot; kind of a high. Good body feel.\u000aThe flavor profile and taste are great as well, you get the earthy cheese flavors come up.\u000aGood for nausea and general pain.\u000a\u000aWould buy again!

VAmazing kick! Terrible flavors. This bud is so dense. One chillum full will stone this 35 year plus smoker of indicas for 4 hours! IMHO it&#39;s way too strong to taste so bad.

VCheesequake arrived today. And now I\u2019m impressed. This stuff smelled wonderful, was completely coated in crystal and tasted great.  21.2 THC. \u000a\u000aAgree with previous \u201cgrape\u201d flavor descriptions. This was delicious. Smooth flavor inhaled and exhaled.\u000a\u000aPast the googly eyes, medically it did as it was said to do. Numb my pain. And it did, quickly. No creeper here. Quick and potent. Very impressed as this is what I need. Relief from 20 years of back related arthritis pain.\u000a\u000aDefinitely an Indica effect. Complete zen and relaxation.\u000a\u000aThis is officially on my list of Budds to Buy. Ha ha.\u000a\u000aThsnks Redecan!

VCheese Quake is by far, the BEST I have tried for Migraine pain relief.  I felt part of my brain actually lift up after I tried it, and its relaxing qualities calmed me down almost immediately and made me pain-free and relaxed.  The buds burn smoothly and the flavor has no after bite as some of the stronger varieties of Indicas.  I would highly recommend Cheese Quake for those with migraine, insomnia, and seizures.

VI picked up some cheese quake from Smokey Point on a whim, and I wasn&#39;t expecting much because I find Cheese to be a bit meh. But, I love it! I felt it in my face and head first... warm and tingly and then nice and relaxing. Body high wasn&#39;t too strong, which was good, because it was mentally invigorating. One of the reviewers said that her brain got behind whatever she was doing, and I so totally agree... I watched TV, had some conversations, did some internet shopping, and I got 100% into whatever I was doing. Then, after awhile, sleepiness. A couple bowls of Bubba and I was out like a light.

V    ah, the cheese quake. actually, shes not an indica. but, close. \u000a55% sativa &amp; 45% indica, just to clarify. \u000a\u000atga did me a great kindness making this strain. in fact it is one of my top 3 favorites. \u000a\u000athe smell is very a louring and sweet. the scents of berries, lavender and of the skunky cheese. it smells like a desert. great after dinner smoke. tga&#39;s website&#39;s discretion is spot on.\u000aand may have been the best tasting stain i have ever had the pleasure of.\u000a\u000athe taste is as good if not even better then the scent.\u000avery potent strain. very hard to stop smoking this one, and there seems to be no ceiling. there is no peak on this one. you can keep smoking till your in space. could go even higher, but at that point you fall asleep.\u000a\u000ashes lucky and a keeper, more so if she is from a sativa pheno.\u000aone should always have it on hand. also, a great day off smoke.\u000a\u000aif you like cheesse you will like this. keep up the great work tga\u000a

VFluffy Phat nugs covered in crystal and Orange hairs, carrying a potent pungent fruity scent. Produces a light smoke that tastes just like an exotic fruit mixed with cheese. With strong hits this weed gives a steady high that&#39;s easy on the brain, body and mood. Instant pleaser with its euphoric and pain relieving effects with the bonus of a sweet taste. Make any party a good one with Cheese Quake. Thanks CannaFarms!! 80/100

VAny strain with cheese in the name, I have to give a try.  I love the actual food, and it brings back memories of my cannabis smoking youth.  Let&#39;s see how good this stuff is!\u000a\u000a-Smell:  This has a rich aroma of a nice cheese with the nice earthiness of a good strain.\u000a\u000a-Look:  It was a green nug with orange hairs like standard bud tends to be.  What I found to be amazing was that there were hints of purple and as you made it to the inside of the bud, it becomes more prominent\u000a\u000a-Taste:  Definitely has a nice, balanced earthy note.  Other than that, not much going on in the flavor category.\u000a\u000a-Feeling:  It took a few moments for me to notice it, but when it did, I noticed I had a lovely head buzz.  It feel like whatever I choose to do, my mind would get behind.  That is great, because my pain is gone so I can work out as hard as I need to!\u000a\u000a-Conclusion:  Really love this strain, Cheese Quake is definitely something I&#39;ll most likely get again once it comes back into stock!

VOne of my new favorites strains since being a tester in Denver.  Amazing flavor and great after taste.  Super for pain and relaxation.  Works well for curbing my social anxiety.  Great life saving strain that is underrated I feel.

VLook I bought twenty three grams of this stuff and I\u2019ve been smoking it for a while and I\u2019ve been very pleased. It elevates my mood cheers me up motivates me to participate in life and it also relieves nausea. Food tastes really good on this strain but I am not always hungry for it. I do sometimes get a slight headache with the high but it isn\u2019t to disruptive. The taste could be better but maybe that is just do to the quality of my herb. The aroma is quite nice though and smells piny and sour. Also heightens pleasure activities.

VEasy to grow , great tasting and smelling of grape and cheese that packs a heavy punch for me anyways. Almost to strong for my liking but is social enough to use at parties etc.. Awesome looking plant from veg to bloom. It&#39;s a beast of a plant but not too tall and some phenols shorter like the Querkle in it. Big wide fan leaves that need thinning in flowering. Tastes outta this world made me smoke too much every time I pull out a bud I find myself digging back in the Quake jar lol. My favorite smoke by TGA so far haven&#39;t tried many of the newer hybrids yet they sound great though

VThis is based on my first use of this strain, so my opinion will likely evolve over time. Having said that, the first impression of Cheese Quake is that it begins with an Earthquake. Within a few minutes of vaping I was feeling deeply, heavily, and pleasantly numbed to the core of my being. Of course, having to walk up a flight of stairs was not necessarily the best choice, but I survived. This is an excellent strain for general body pain, particularly that associated with Fibromyalgia. It is also working really well on my Migraine, but it isn&#39;t doing such a great job on a persistent spasm that I&#39;ve been having in my right shoulder. Other than that, I&#39;m looking forward to using this lovely strain again. I would have given it 5 Stars except for the persisting shoulder pain. Hindu Kush, Master Kush, and Girl Scout Cookies all address it quite well, so I do know it is treatable this way.

VTried the Cheese Quake by Voodoo...smoked a 1/4 gram joint and it made me feel as chill as I ever do.  Sold as a hybrid this particular strain and brand gave me much more of a head high than any feeling in my body.  Definitely makes you want to quit whatever you&#39;re doing and just watch YouTube videos.\u000a\u000aTaste reminds me of shortbread cookies and the smell is equally as inoffensive.  Great weed if you just want to forget what&#39;s on your mind and lay back.

VPTSD, anxiety, depression and bpd.  \u000a\u000aTo say I have to be careful when selecting meds is an understatement.  Too much sativa or indica and I throw it in the toilet. Can&#39;t find a good concentrate right now that is nug only rosin or resin.  Went over to Valley of the Sun and was steered to Chews Quake after narrowing down several recommendations.  Flower was the only option.  Tried a small bowl...just a little too pwerful.  Garcia Vega green...leveled it out perfectly.  Wondering how a concentrate that you can limit intake of would be.  If you have issues like myself...this may be a 24 hour a day go to.

VCheesequake by grower Heavenly Buds listed as a indica dominate hybrid with a total cannabinoids 19.7% and converted thc of 17.4%\u000aTastes sweet and earthy with a bit of pepper. A light head high with a better body high makes it feel pretty relaxing. It makes watching movies more fun and its effects are low anxiety.

I do sometimes get a slight headache with the high but it isn\u2019t to disruptive. The taste could be better but maybe that is just do to the quality of my herb. The aroma is quite nice though and smells piny and sour. Also heightens pleasure activities.

VTried the Cheese Quake by Voodoo...smoked a 1/4 gram joint and it made me feel as chill as I ever do.  Sold as a hybrid this particular strain and brand gave me much more of a head high than any feeling in my body.  Definitely makes you want to quit whatever you&#39;re doing and just watch YouTube videos.\u000a\u000aTaste reminds me of shortbread cookies and the smell is equally as inoffensive.  Great weed if you just want to forget what&#39;s on your mind and lay back.

VThis is based on my first use of this strain, so my opinion will likely evolve over time. Having said that, the first impression of Cheese Quake is that it begins with an Earthquake. Within a few minutes of vaping I was feeling deeply, heavily, and pleasantly numbed to the core of my being. Of course, having to walk up a flight of stairs was not necessarily the best choice, but I survived. This is an excellent strain for general body pain, particularly that associated with Fibromyalgia. It is also working really well on my Migraine, but it isn&#39;t doing such a great job on a persistent spasm that I&#39;ve been having in my right shoulder. Other than that, I&#39;m looking forward to using this lovely strain again. I would have given it 5 Stars except for the persisting shoulder pain. Hindu Kush, Master Kush, and Girl Scout Cookies all address it quite well, so I do know it is treatable this way.

Awesome looking plant from veg to bloom. It&#39;s a beast of a plant but not too tall and some phenols shorter like the Querkle in it. Big wide fan leaves that need thinning in flowering. Tastes outta this world made me smoke too much every time I pull out a bud I find myself digging back in the Quake jar lol.

It&#39;s a good numbing feeling in the body, kinda spacey in the brainy, but it doesn&#39;t do much else. Some times I&#39;m oddly hyper, others I can&#39;t keep my eyes open. Not enough consistency to warrant a second purchase.

VOh My God! this stain in crazy good! the batch I received has a good frosting going on and a pungent smell of cheese with a  sweet aroma. packed a full bowl in my bong and lift off! the smoke was surprisingly thick(so thick I didn&#39;t clear the chamber even though I usual clear it with ease). a sweet flavor lingered after exhaling! Half way through the session I noticed a very strong tingly feeling throughout my body( almost as if I were in a earth quake because my balance was off when I stood up). apparently my pops was going through the same thing. afterwards we both ended up with the giggles! very strong high! possibly the strongest I&#39;ve come across this year!

VPTSD, anxiety, depression and bpd.  \u000a\u000aTo say I have to be careful when selecting meds is an understatement.  Too much sativa or indica and I throw it in the toilet. Can&#39;t find a good concentrate right now that is nug only rosin or resin.  Went over to Valley of the Sun and was steered to Chews Quake after narrowing down several recommendations.  Flower was the only option.  Tried a small bowl...just a little too pwerful.  Garcia Vega green...leveled it out perfectly.  Wondering how a concentrate that you can limit intake of would be.  If you have issues like myself...this may be a 24 hour a day go to.

VISO-HEX super refined pharma grade oil from THC Pharma. 80% THC .12% CBD. This extract is very strong. I took 2 dabs of the oil over about an hour, and I got very stoned. It has a very nice sleepy, dopey, euphoric high. Heavy in the eyes, and body. Great for pain, and depression. Great for migraines. Also a very good nighttime strain, of course. I highly recommend this in extract form. I&#39;ve not tried the flower, but I&#39;m quite sure I&#39;d enjoy it.
