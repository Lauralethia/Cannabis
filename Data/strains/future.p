VThe product of two rockstar parents Gorilla Glue #4 and Starfighter, this strain is a stunner. It hits with a deep body relaxation almost instantaneously. She provides a very nice body buzz and a deep euphoria. The flowers are a beautiful bright crystally green, with little bits of orange. They are compact, but break up very nicely. The aroma is earthy as hell, with some lime and fuel undertones. The flavor is as earthy as they come, with a tiny bit of citrus. This strain can instill a crippling couchlock for novices or if over indulged.

I can feel my muscles relaxing and my pain is much better. The only negative is that I&#39;m a little dizzy. Since I have no desire to get up I don&#39;t mind so much.

VThis strain was purchased at my local Harvest dispensary. Was on sale for $20 an 8th and I have to say that the buds were very Soft and not all dry and crumbly like old bud is. Once you take that first rip, you&#39;ll feel a rush of euphoria, but what I love most is that it is not over whelming what so ever. Great strain for anxiety, and those with nausea.

VFuture has been one of my favorites since I first tried it @ Greenpharms in flower form over a year ago. In flower form the amount of trichomes is ridiculous when I put some in my grinder it took me 10 minutes to get everything back out of the grinder. The trichomes were stuck to the grinder almost like a glue, that gave me my first clue how potent it was. \u000aThe smell is like kush &amp; GG4 so is the high.  But with a unique twist. The Starfighter adds a hint of lemon &amp; makes the high amazing.\u000aI&#39;ve been on the look out for the Future wax &amp; scored me a gram of &quot;taffy&quot; (concentrate) by OG Extracts.\u000aIt&#39;s everything I hoped for and more, the best part is I got it for $30. The only negative side is there is no THC % shown. But one dab &amp; I&#39;m toasted. I usually destroy a half gram if shatter in 2 days.\u000aMame sure to try this strain I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be amazed.

VPicked this strain up at \u2018Green Pharms\u2019 in Flagstaff, AZ - \u000a\u000aReally great daytime strain! After the first couple of hits, all my fatigue seemed to disappear and I felt like I had just woken up from the greatest night\u2019s sleep &#128564; I haven\u2019t had this kind of experience with a strain before so that was definitely memorable. This is also a good thinking strain and I was able to focus and easily continue on in a conversation. \u000a\u000aI only grabbed a gram of this but I\u2019m definitely going to pick up more next time I hit up the dispensary &#127807; this stuff IS the future.

VThis strain is wonderful! It is a great way to end the day. You get a great feeling of relaxation and euphoria right away. It really helps my back pain and muscle tightness. Then later as you are relaxing you start to feel a nice comfortable sleepy feeling allowing me to fall into a nice deep sleep (with a big fat grin on my face). This is one of the few strains that covers all of my medical needs. Thank you Harvest of Avondale for carrying this at a great price!

VHave only tried in a concentrate(shatter wax) but I absolutely love this particular strain. It&#39;s a 50/50 hybrid that&#39;s both intense and bold feelings and flavors. It is wonderful for pain and anxiety. So far my favorite hybrid because it literally treats all my symptoms and get it regularly for that very reason. Definitely recommend anyone try it in any form of use you can get, best strain I have come across period.

Vthis strain makes me a little crazy- but in a fun way. My brain is all over the place but I\u2019m still 100% in control. Things are funnier, I make puns in my head throughout the high, but I definitely have trouble focusing on one task at a time. Super fun for hanging with friends during the day time. Also great for cleaning my apartment. Not the best for chilling solo.
