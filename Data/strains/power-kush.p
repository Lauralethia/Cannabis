VPower Kush is an excellent, easy strain to grow and a true pleasure to smoke. With the right grow setup, you can get some real resinous monsters out of this strain. Its effects are mostly indica but still balanced enough to provide immense creativity and euphoria without too much couchlock. I grew this side by side with Blue Rhino and found them to be really similar in all aspects, although Blue Rhino performed better in terms of yield, potency, and flavor complexity. One thing Dinafem got right with this strain is the pure sweet, sugary candy smell and flavor that makes Power Kush unique and distinct from any other strain bearing the Kush name. This is one truly under-appreciated strain that I wish was a lot more common.

Husband and I smoked just a half of a cone of this and I&#39;m nice and relaxed but not couchlocked or starving.  This does have a little bit of sativa in it... just enough to balance it out and keep my head nice and clear.  A top 10 favorite, will get again!!

VI am more of a sativa man, as I like to stay busy and active with our N2Hemp projects.  This is not the cannabis for that.  However, My wife has MS and days when her leg nerve pain is acting up, she take a couple of puffs of the Power Kush before bed.  It certainly aids in sleeping and the falling asleep process, but with my wife it dulls the nerve pain and almost resets and/or properly rests her system where the MS nerve inflammation seems greatly reduced in starting the next day.\u000a\u000aMy personal take:  A nice one to have for a few puffs before bed for a great nights sleep...   A natural ZZZquil.

VI was happy with this strain. It was a very subtle high. It taste delicious and doesn&#39;t make you completely couch locked. It was very balanced on both highs. The Indica high was just enough to allow to to melt into the couch, but with enough of a sativa high to make you not pass out. The only negative I have on this one was that the munchies were very extreme for me. Thanks Goodness for Tostitios. I would recommend this to newer, or lower tolerance tokers.

VPower Kush is a decent strain.  Tastes like coffee and berries with a dirty aftertaste (that was enjoyed, much like patchouli).  A little bit of burn in back of nose and upper throat area on the exhale at times.  The buds were small to medium sized lighter green than the usual hue with pretty orange hairs woven throughout.  Most of the buds were small breaking up into joint material which I personally have come to favor.  The buzz def had a warm body wave that settles into moderate pain relief. Leans more toward the hybrid middle ground which did not appeal to me so much.  Great for some moderate pain relief where there is still a need to concentrate or get things done.

VVery relaxing, and gives a nice head buzz thanks to the skunk no 1, definitely a nighttime smoke, fairly dense, frosty, with hues of different dark greens and a little bit of purple here and there. Not too strong, not too weak. A solid indica strain fersure.

VThis has to be the worst strains I have ever had. I found a few seeds (yes, I am keeping them). The high was literally about 60 minutes, give or take 10 minutes. I got a headache within an hour of smoking it. I will never buy it again, such a waste.

VTastes like a light vanilla creamy taste, very light but an aftertaste at that, the buds smell pretty stinky almost cheesy with a hint of like fruit.

VI personally do not enjoy the high of this strain as normally I prefer an uplifting sativa or a heavy body high that soften my muscles.\u000aThe high is somewhat similar to my favorite Orange Skunk very detach and spaced out. You don\u2019t feels like to socialize with people but minus the excitment and happiness compare to OB.\u000a\u000aHowever, the strain soften my back muscles to reduce the pain contrast to Orange Bud/Orange Skunk which cloud my judgement. \u000a\u000aOne interesting effect is this can get you aroused in high dose or having a low tolerant.\u000a\u000aThe smell and flavor is sweet and oily. One of my friend cmpare it with dog poop. They do smell weird but no awful. \u000a\u000aThis strain does flower fast and give decent yield.

VUsing the vape I take two pulls and am ready for bed. Makes me very dizzy but has a pleasant effect on body and mind. I get paranoid on most strains, but not this. Can still focus but mainly the focus is on what sugary snack I want to eat next. Serious munchies. Helps me forget my pain issues. Have tried from different dispensories with same results. If they can breed the dizzy out of this, it  would be perfect for me.
