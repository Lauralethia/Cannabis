VAs a rookie to this strain I was unsure as to how this particular flower would effect me.  Sure I had read the reviews and several articles prior to inhaling, but I still wanted my first at bat to end with me on first base and not walking back to the dugout.\u000a\u000aUsing a small glass pipe as my weapon of choice I stepped up to the plate, inhaled, then slowly exhaled.  I experienced a tingling sensation from head to toe after I had completed my first (and only) bowl, I felt relaxed, contemplative and - surprisingly - not hungry.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed this strain (Oregon Rasberry Kush produced by Green Rush) and recommend it.  Not a home run perhaps, but definitely and RBI Triple.

VRaspberry Kush is a huge hit with all of my patients. The deep hues purple leaves are a sight for sore eyes. The buds are coated with a dusty glitter, much like that of frozen morning dew. The orange hairs set the plant ablaze like orange lightning bolts against a stormy purple sky. My patients report decreased nausea, insomnia and anxiety as well as temporary relief from arthritis, joint pain and muscle aches. 4.9 rating to be precise.

VThis stuff is amazing for a Kush, it&#39;s a hybrid indica dominant strain. There is some Sativa in the hybrid. And you can feel it a strong head high that creeps into a strong body stone. Yet you are able to still function, a bit of couch lock in the picture though. Not that you cannot manage do things . Gaming is excellent, Music is orgasmic, And all your pain is gone. This is a 10/10 in my book, my new favorite strain of all time!

VFirst time I had this strain was with my second mom in the backyard. She told me she got it in a mystery pack from her dealer. It was visibly purple, it smelled sweet, and it tasted absolutely amazing. It made me relax and feel at ease. The second time I had it was two hours later when her son and his friend brought 5g of RK and oh my gosh it was heaven. I am very happy with this strain. By far my favorite indica.

VThis stuff is really good for muscle pain and anxiety! No couch lock but really relaxed. It&#39;s nice if you&#39;re around friends, because you can focus pretty well and it makes you social.

VAbsolutely love this strain. It helps me a ton when I am experiencing gastrointestinal cramping from my condition. I highly recommend this strain, especially if you are prone to anything that involves physical discomfort or pain. I smoked a single bowl and felt not only the immense physical relief from the flower, but a surprisingly strong feeling of euphoria. It is a relaxing bud that doesn&#39;t leave you blurry-eyed or too sleepy- good for focusing.

VI used a Mighty and a bong with extra filtration. The flavor came through so beautifully. The effects are extremely relaxing.  All of your stress will just melt away. I have a panic disorder as well as Ehlers-Danlos and the pain just melts away.  I am using this as a daily medicinal so what ever you do, do not drive impaired on this strain while on blood thinners or without, your vision will get a bit blurry so beware.  Also the headache is there but really mild.  Awesome strain!!!

VAwesome strain. Incredible smell..will not be easy to hide (if you need to).  It has &quot;that kush smell&quot; along with bits of skunk and if you inhale slowly, but deeply you can smell a hint of berry. So good. The buds themselves are covered in trichomes. It looks like it snowed all over them. The buds are green with hints of purple. It tastes just like it smells! And the high is nice. No couch lock, but you still feel relaxed.

VThis is a strain I was given when I asked for an upbeat indica I could dab. Raspberry Kush is a great daytime indica. Even though this thing packs full body relaxation, it has enough energy to make you want to be up and moving. I absolutely loved a bit of this on my lunch break, plenty of energy to finish the day,  really nice flavor too. The stuff was by Dab Dudes it was 88.8 % total, was a sparkling amber butter that looks almost jucy, it&#39;s very easy to handle, and had a nice earthy flavor that really comes out at low temps. Dab Dudes can be hit or miss in the flavor dept. but there usually pretty damn good at between $30-$40 a gram! This is a really good deal, at $35 for the whole gram pick some up.

VExcellent strain if you&#39;re looking to chill with friends. The cotton mouth is hell but well worth it. Pretty good body high that works well for pain relief if you don&#39;t have any plans.  Kept me awake but very very relaxed. I felt talkative and creative. Great Strain to break out of writer&#39;s block.

VAwesome strain. Incredible smell..will not be easy to hide (if you need to).  It has &quot;that kush smell&quot; along with bits of skunk and if you inhale slowly, but deeply you can smell a hint of berry. So good. The buds themselves are covered in trichomes. It looks like it snowed all over them. The buds are green with hints of purple. It tastes just like it smells! And the high is nice. No couch lock, but you still feel relaxed. I also get a little bit of energy from it. Great for relaxing and getting things done (for me anyway).

VThis is a strain I was given when I asked for an upbeat indica I could dab. Raspberry Kush is a great daytime indica. Even though this thing packs full body relaxation, it has enough energy to make you want to be up and moving. I absolutely loved a bit of this on my lunch break, plenty of energy to finish the day,  really nice flavor too. The stuff was by Dab Dudes it was 88.8 % total, was a sparkling amber butter that looks almost jucy, it&#39;s very easy to handle, and had a nice earthy flavor that really comes out at low temps. Dab Dudes can be hit or miss in the flavor dept. but there usually pretty damn good at between $30-$40 a gram! This is a really good deal, at $35 for the whole gram pick some up.

VJust got done dabbing a beautiful piece of Raspberry Kush Rosin.  I put about .3grm ball of it in my Kandypen and went to the beach yesterday.  Awesome!!!!!  \u000aHad no prob blasting away on it in public In fact the taste on the exhale is so much like Raspberries and Cream I couldn&#39;t believe it.  \u000aI Came home and dabbed a nice .3 grm scoop out of my rig.  The flavor of Raspberries &amp; cream is much more pronounced doing it this way and the high is more powerful.   I have to say though that my Kandypen blasts hits almost as strong as my rig and it&#39;s portable.  \u000aFYI I get about 7 -10 huge pulls on my Kandypen with .1 grms of Rosin.  After you blast up about a full grm you should alway clean it the burner on the pen.

VThis strain is a strange one for me. I was hoping it would be good for my insomnia and it does make me fall asleep. After smoking this I am quickly overcome with heavy eyes and body melt. I was quickly swept off to sleep but then the upbeat nature of this strain kicks in and I would wake up with my mind racing many times throughout the night. For me this is a useless strain, too tiring to be a useful daytime smoke but too uplifting to be used to sleep. Tastes amazing however and smokes great!

VGood solid Indica, mellow, probably great for first time/new users.  I found it great when I was using a sativa blend for pain....it softened the sativa hyperactivity that tends to happen with me and painkillers of any sort.

VI love the taste of this one! It was really nicely berry tasting on the exhale. It also dealt with pain moderately well, it also helped me sleep but didn&#39;t give me uncomfortable couch lock. Munchies were moderate, no notable cotton mouth or dry eyes. I did experience some pretty strong paranoia as the high wore off, which is why I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars,.

VAcquired this strain for the first time  at $14.00 a gram from Cougar Cannabis.  The budtender directed my attention to this beauty and I am hoping he is there the next time I stop in on a Thursday evening. :)  This flower purchase was a toke that went straight to the middle of my brain.  Instant relaxation and euphoric feelings were the result of only one bowl hit.  The product was tested by 3BAnalytical. And purchased within six months of testing,  with a test date of 4-1-16.  I gave 4 stars because I would like to make another purchase of the same strain from another dispensary to compare before giving it a 5 star rating.  Very nice, me want more, please! Thanks Cougar Cannabis Budtender!

V\u2b50\ufe0ftastes just like it&#39;s named with a pucker and licking of lips to follow there is a second round of uber sweet fruity flavor. This strong &amp; unusual taste overwhelmed the Kush side of this strain. With the Kush adding the creamy, smoother side to taste giving it a yummy dessert like palate there was a need for more balance.  Not sure if this is common in the strain or if it was just the way it was grown?\u000a\u000a\u2604\ufe0fThe smell on the other hand did have a beautiful balance between the splendid raspberry tartness meshing in perfect orgy with the musky, smooth Kush taste.  Smell was phenomenal only leaving a strong desire for the taste to match which lost points when failing to meet that criteria. \u000a\u000a&#128171;Sight was not much to look at with hairs &amp; green of flower blending together to make an unremarkable shade of meshed brown with puke green.  \u000a\u000a&#128165;Medium to dense buds that were moist which made them burn a little unevenly. Contemplating this flower a little further it is suspected to be good for baking for cooking sweets. \u000a\u000a&#127775; Up until this point amidst the few other negative aspects this flower could have still earned 4 points knowing there are ugly tasteless throat burning strains out there that offer quality heady highs with medicinal qualities.  For me, much of the time, the high is the sugar that helps the medicine go down if you know what I mean?  With this strain it could be said the opposite for the body got the message of relaxation &amp; warmth while the head went in the other direction unable to shut down. Felt claustrophobic &amp; confining which was a consistent feel every time partaking in this strain. This is a reaction usually following a middle ground hybrid which is caused me to steer clear of them, but was not expected here so it is specific to my chemical nature so should not steer anybody away from trying it themselves Being a strong Kush fan (in fact Hindu being my favorite) there is a strong hesitance in writing this review so in all fairness would like to try some Razzberry Kush edibles which my gut tells me would enhance the flavor to many sweets also creating a more favorable restful buzz for me. Surprises like this are part of the adventure of being cannabis crusaders opening our minds to learning about, experiencing &amp; sharing with other like minded folks. \u000a\u000aNot giving up on you Razzberry Kush, but for now my greatest apologies three stars \u2728

VThis strain is a strange one for me. I was hoping it would be good for my insomnia and it does make me fall asleep. After smoking this I am quickly overcome with heavy eyes and body melt. I was quickly swept off to sleep but then the upbeat nature of this strain kicks in and I would wake up with my mind racing many times throughout the night. For me this is a useless strain, too tiring to be a useful daytime smoke but too uplifting to be used to sleep. Tastes amazing however and smokes great!

VJust got done dabbing a beautiful piece of Raspberry Kush Rosin.  I put about .3grm ball of it in my Kandypen and went to the beach yesterday.  Awesome!!!!!  \u000aHad no prob blasting away on it in public In fact the taste on the exhale is so much like Raspberries and Cream I couldn&#39;t believe it.  \u000aI Came home and dabbed a nice .3 grm scoop out of my rig.  The flavor of Raspberries &amp; cream is much more pronounced doing it this way and the high is more powerful.   I have to say though that my Kandypen blasts hits almost as strong as my rig and it&#39;s portable.  \u000aFYI I get about 7 -10 huge pulls on my Kandypen with .1 grms of Rosin.  After you blast up about a full grm you should alway clean it the burner on the pen.

VI love green that taste of sweet, flowery, and pine flavors so when I saw it&#39;s supposed to taste like Raspberries and a creamy vanilla I swooped up a gram of flower. The taste is hard to describe, but I don&#39;t get the raspberry or vanilla at all.. It&#39;s not bad, just not amazing. I feel like this indica strain does a great job with pain and discomfort. Minimal cognitive impairments and doesn&#39;t make me want to pass out. I struggle with weight so it&#39;s hard to find strains that don&#39;t hit you with the munchies and this was perfect. Hubby and I went to freak town and the green added an extra layer of magic. Over all, I would buy again and highly recommend.

Vcouch session\u000a\u000a-charlie-\u000aI feel like I have a lot to say a lot but i have no idea what to type because i can&#39;t keep focused enough to have a single thought.  It honestly is really hard to type any of this shit out.  Dominic and I hit three bowl packs from the bong of this Raspberry Kush.  and jesus fucking christ man.  this shit is like 24% THC.  Im pretty sure thats the second highest out of all of the stuff I&#39;ve tried.  I was supposed to do something in this whole paragraph but I honestly have no idea what that is.  All i can think about right now is how fucking hungry I am.  That and that I know ill smoke more tonight so I don&#39;t know how high I&#39;m actually going to be tonight.  I might not come down.  Straight up cloud 10 shit.  but ugh It&#39;s Dominics turn to write a review so here.   \u000a\u000a-Dominic-\u000alet me start out with this, bought a G of pre measured and to be honest looked liked i got shorted. that being said I&#39;m not that mad since it got me so high. smoked 3 bowls outside with charlie and i could taste the raspberry cream flavor when i exhaled. after 2 hits i could feel it starting to creep up on me and started noticing that both myself and charlie kept pacing and talking non stop and we got to be almost shouting without evening realizing it. and i also started to realize that i wasn&#39;t sure what we were talking about... or what i said... or what i was gun say. this is a very upbeat indica! talkative and upbeat that flows into a relaxing couch lock that consists of awesome music and writing strain reviews. this is perfect for when your hanging out with friends. would recommend smoking and hanging out outside to really make the happy euphoric feeling peak. would defiantly recommend and would buy again. maybe not from the same place but defiantly again.

VRaspberry kush is one of the strains  all my friends always talk about. It&#39;s one of the super flavorful strains that makes your mouth water and you brain melt (when grown well). I thinks its one of the true to kush strains that really keeps Kush&#39;s name a trustable and respected goto. I personally find that a lot of strains have tons of flavor but tend to be lacking in Thc raspberry included but there&#39;s no denying when ground and rolled you will understand why people love it. -Budsey

VI had a good body high  and was able to study for a math exam. Anything that can curb the hell of cramming  for an exam is  a necessity. A nice smooth exhale is the creamy part of the raspberries and cream taste. Nice dense crystal covered flowers. Just another great kush.

VRaspberry Kush is such a delicious smelling and tasting strain. It&#39;s also great for anxiety. I found it made me feel very comfortable socially. There&#39;s an intense body relaxation, I breathed so deeply while medicated with this. Surprisingly though it didn&#39;t make me necessarily want to sit down. I wanted to talk and do things. It eventually does taper off into a good sleepiness. Very effective for insomnia.\u000aFollow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.

VI as afraid from the description this might be an energy draining strain but, fortunately, I didn&#39;t find that to be the case at all.  You may not want o run out and do errands but it&#39;s very upbeat and creative. Creative is an adjective I use sparingly in my reviews but this one will make you want to write, read, play an instrument or something or at least appreciate the work of others. Physically, it is very relaxing but again, not in an energy-vacuuming sort of way. I didn&#39;t feel tired or drowsy at all.\u000aVery nice strain.

VWhen the young man from Mobile Meds showed up I found he had an outstanding selection of flowers. I bought the Raspberry Kush on the basis of its intense fragrance. After grinding I found this intense to smoke, felt nice going down, and had a nice gentle effect that lasted a good long time. This helps to control my pain and eases the PTSD I deal with on a daily basis. This was a good choice for me!\u000a\u000aKudos to Mobile Meds!

VThis RAspberry kush will knock you on your ass. When smoked out of a bubbler the high comes on real strong. The buds are covered in crystals and have some colorful streaks through them. The producer was Seattle Private Reserve with a THC level just over 23 and half % I picked this up at White Rabbit
