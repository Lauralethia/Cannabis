VGreat flavor I think it feels like more of an upbeat strain. I mean there&#39;s flavors of pine, earth,  both of which are pretty relaxing and euphoric but there&#39;s still an energy that get you up and going. There&#39;s a pleasant pressure in the temples and a heaviness to the eye lids but no real body buzz. I got a really good deal on some Frisian Dew crumble that came in at just about 90% it had nice flavor and cost 25$ a gram in the Seattle area. US Cannabis definitely worth the price for me this was a nice all day strain it feels more like what people think of as a classic Sativa but with some extra euphoria and muscle relaxation. I approve &#128077;.

VJuniper.  Tastes and smells like juniper.\u000a\u000aFrisian Dew makes my body tingle all over, right down to my naughty bits.  Also produces ridiculously heady concentration, bordering on zoning out, great for very long meditation...but BEWARE of the paranoia!  This strain often awakens demons I had long forgotten, and can escalate a trivial worry into a looming crisis.

VThe batch I had the pleasure of smoking/vaping came from TCC in Mesa. The flat buds were a dark forest green with a few seeds in each one. Not much to look at, but after vaping a bowl in my Arizer Solo I was high high high! Oh man, no lie this flower is Very potent! It has a clean piney, slightly fruity flavor and leaves you with a powerful head high, loads of creative thinking and tons of energy.  What a sleeper she is!! Don&#39;t miss this one (maybe you&#39;ll get lucky and find some seeds too!) Thanks TCC!

VImpressed by the quality and potency of this outdoor strain. Nice green/purple looking buds, mine room will fill up with a lovely citrus/skunky smell when I open the jar. The smoke is good, It tastes like fresh pine with skunky and citrus undertones. The effects are on your body as well on your mind. Makes me feel happy and relaxed, great for the evening while watching a movie.

VI can&#39;t even imagine what would have been my life today if I didn&#39;t grow this strain... It helped me a lot dealing with depression.\u000aNot to strong, colourful strain with a summer taste, if you suffer from depression you can stop here, it&#39;s in my opinion one of the best strains to fight against lack of happiness.\u000aCombine it with a physical activity is what saved me :)

VOne of the best strains for outdoorgowing in northren climates. Especially bred for the wet climate in the &quot;frisian landscape&quot; in northern Netherland/Germany near the north sea. Finisches ealry with massive yield and the best bud to leaf ratio i&#180;ve erver seen outdoors. \u000a\u000aThe High is strong for outdoor weed  - no wonder it&#180;s a super skunk cross. At frist the indica hits you, later on you will enjoy a nice mellow uplifting and funny high. Taste is very mild, pine fruity...\u000a\u000aHighly recommended if you grow outdoors in nothern climates

VCheap where i got it from $20 for an 1/8 and you get a bang for your buck. It taste alot like Black Licorice which i really like but not a popular flavor among most people. Really made me relaxed but also Focused. Only Issue i Had were some Muscle Spasms in my legs. But overall I really Liked this Bud.

VFor pain, particularly crohn&#39;s and MS, this variety can&#39;t be beat.  Any bowel or nervous systems disorders. Frisian will first give you a buzz and about 15 minutes later produce the pain killing effect. I don&#39;t mean you can deal with the pain...I mean it REMOVES the pain.  It it euphoric and good for sleep, but functional too so good for day or night. This is hands down my favorite cannabis ever. For growing, it prefers the outdoors. Very tall so if you are trying indoors you would have to top it and it does take a bit longer to mature than more popular varieties but it&#39;s SO worth it.
