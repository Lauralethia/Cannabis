VI had a low tolerance at the time I last smoked it, had half a G, filled the bowl, and 1 hit and I was out had it for about 3 months and 1 deep bit held in for about 10 sec. Tons of smoke left a very nice pine/mint/citrus like flavor, bit of diesel, and I didn&#39;t see it comin, almost fell out of a car, completely blowed, 3 hrs of euphoria, and feeling like I was in space, I was even tripping a bit (for about 10 min.), double layered vision and everything was distorted, some colors when I wandered off into thought, and entire body went numb completely, and when I did regain feeling, I felt my body was in pieces and separated, it was amazing, got a lot of work done that I didn&#39;t remember doing... But that&#39;s cool, I&#39;d recommend it to anyone, but watch how much you take in, very strong, and the smell is very pungent and very noticeable, lingers around for about 20 min. I paid $20 for 1 G gives ya stick fingers, one of my favorites!

VLiterally my favorite strain. Super relaxed but extremely energetic, creative, and loving life. I had been up for about 12 hours when I got it and started smoking, I have insomnia and am usually up at night, I took over and hour to make a playlist of Fleetwood mac, bowie, pink Floyd, zelplin and many more. I lit incense and enjoyed the music, cleaned the house. At 6am I made coffee, grabbed Thoreau&#39;s Walden pond and smoke my cigs watching the sun rise over my trailer park, classy i know hahaha regardless best weed of my life, so productive and happy on this stuff.

VI tried this strain for the first time and I can honestly say that this was one of the strongest strains I&#39;ve ever had. It gives a real heavy medicated high. I smoked a gram and I was messed up. I was walking slow, a bit disoriented, and I couldn&#39;t seem to focus much. I started feeling anxious and kept breathing hard so that triggered some paranoia. My body felt heavy and I couldn&#39;t eat anything because I had no appetite what so ever. Through it all I started feeling good once the high settled in and I got a grip on myself. I was really happy, my body felt like if I was floating and drifting in water, pretty chill. I started drawing and ended up sketching a couple of awesome characters. I was a bit lazy after, I had a minor head ache but ended up sleeping like a baby. Overall it was a good strong strain. I would definitely recommend it to people that can handle their ish, and let them know this is a strain you would better off enjoy indoors in the comfort of your home.

VI got this strain of Chemdog 91 in shatter form, and smoked it with my Dr Dabber Aurora pen. I was sitting on the back porch, enjoying a beer and smoking in my anti-cannabis area of the globe. The effects were immediate. My depression, anxiety, and pain in my legs (I\u2019m a runner) went away. Only some faint glimmers of my aliments. I went inside and the movie \u201cInside Out\u201d was on the tv. I have never been so in touch with my emotions...this is the greatest movie of all time!! Or....perhaps it\u2019s this awesome strain of Chemdog 91 that The Green Joint- Parachute CO provided me. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the Chemdog.

Vhd, not sure what stories you heard, but you are correct. This is the strain that started it all! The original Diesel of NYC. There are only two people that I know/knew that could know what the original strain is. They might not be alive at this point. I know because I was there for all the different versions of the stories and earlier. We started calling it the&quot;leather bud&quot; until &quot;chem&quot; took over and someone added the &quot;dawg&quot;. Thank god this strain survived. Some strains from back then were lost or kept in the closet. Hope the latter is true

VChemdawg 91 is possibly my favorite strain, of all time. It has the most amazing flavor, which I liken to chewing Juicy Fruit gum.  I grew it for 3 years and just sent a new plant to flower, because I want some more.  Terrific morning strain due to the Sativa aspect but,  I also got a lot of body relaxation from it, as if it had a good amount of Indica, in it.

VI was surprised by how much I liked this strain, as at first glance it looked a dull green color and the buds appeared too light and airy. However, once I broke open a nug, I was satisfied with its&#39; sticky texture and strong odor. Smoking this provided a very nice euphoric feeling and a light lemon taste.\u000a\u000aThe label lists the terpenes as follows: \u000a\u000aMyrcene: 2.723 mg\u000aCaryophyllene: 4.519 mg\u000aHumulene: 1.556

VOverall a pretty good smoke. Tasted pretty sweet and tangy with a hint of berry. A little bit of a metallic/chem aftertaste; kind of like if you touch the end of your tongue to a battery. I feel like it leans indica heavy quite a bit - 70/30? It&#39;s a pretty relaxing clear headed high - one similar to what Golden Goat gives me. At heavier doses it could be quite psychedelic. Not triggering the munchies either. Cured my symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis immediately. Kills pain well. God bless this plant and that now I can live a normal life.

VI&#39;m a HUGE Chem Dawg (or Dog) fan to say the least. IMO you can NEVER go wrong with a Chem strain. That being said, Chem 91 is my least favorite of the Chem strains. Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this strain at all; I just think it&#39;s too balanced. The high sits smack dab in the middle between the Chem 4 high and the Chem Dawg high in intensity and in effects; not too Sativa yet not too Indica it represents the middle ground in the Chem strains. Still a winner but if I had a choice I&#39;d grab a different Chem strain over this.

VThe nugs are beautiful almost an amber green color due to the red hairs. I got a FREE eighth of this for a first time patient deal. I wasnt expecting much as they only had 2 to choose from so Chemdawg 91 it was. Mine did not smell at all so again I was not expecting much but the high was great. I believe mine came in at 22% THC. It a good relaxing calm high with a great head high. You can definitely feel the indica in it as well but not overwhelmingly so. Good for getting stuff done during the day or relaxing. The choice is yours with this strain.

VI&#39;m a HUGE Chem Dawg (or Dog) fan to say the least. IMO you can NEVER go wrong with a Chem strain. That being said, Chem 91 is my least favorite of the Chem strains. Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this strain at all; I just think it&#39;s too balanced. The high sits smack dab in the middle between the Chem 4 high and the Chem Dawg high in intensity and in effects; not too Sativa yet not too Indica it represents the middle ground in the Chem strains. Still a winner but if I had a choice I&#39;d grab a different Chem strain over this.

VMy first step into the deep end after an 18 year hiatus. I had just previously been using my training wheels (Jamaican brick bud) to get back in the game when this came along. The first thing I noticed was that aside from looking, smelling and tasting better, the high felt identical to Jamaican landrace, just a little over twice as strong. Fine by me. I get anxious easily and this strain didn&#39;t give me any problems.

VOverall a pretty good smoke. Tasted pretty sweet and tangy with a hint of berry. A little bit of a metallic/chem aftertaste; kind of like if you touch the end of your tongue to a battery. I feel like it leans indica heavy quite a bit - 70/30? It&#39;s a pretty relaxing clear headed high - one similar to what Golden Goat gives me. At heavier doses it could be quite psychedelic. Not triggering the munchies either. Cured my symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis immediately. Kills pain well. God bless this plant and that now I can live a normal life.

V1 of the most racy and energetic sativas I have ever tried. It also is the PERFECT strain to use when crossing strains to make strong sativas like sour diesel for example. I was reading about chem 91&#39;s lineage and it said that breeders argue amongst eachother as to what it&#39;s true lineage is and I read 1 part that said it is believed that chem 91 is chemdawg crossed with skunk or super skunk but that clearly can&#39;t be the case because sour diesel is chem &#39;91 x super skunk. I personally don&#39;t know what chem 91&#39;s true lineage is either but I do know that chem 91 and sour diesel are not the exact same thing which is what was pretty much being said as to what I was reading on here. If chem 91 came out in 1991 u have to start by thinking about what strains were popular around that time and would&#39;ve been around for chemdawg himself to use to make a super potent strong sativa and if he already had the original chemdawg strain to use to cross into another or possibly more than just 1 other strain, I would imagine or possibly even SPECULATE, PURELY GUESSING HERE OUT OF WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO ME, but personally I think he made chem 91 by crossing the original chemdawg and crossed it with something like green thai, I do know that in some of the semi newer strains that his brand has came out with use alot of old school sativas such as Acapulco gold, Columbian sativa, Mexican sativa, and even Maui wowie! And these were used in strains that have been coming out starting around 2011 they were brand new and coming out Humboldt and Mendocino, I live in Sacramento but I tried this 1 strain that I haven&#39;t seen since or heard of even but it was at a dispensary in 2011 here in sac, it was called grim dawg, it was part of the chemdawg line and OMG as a seasoned smoker,grower, and major connisuer, I cannot stress how energetic and racy and perfect this sativa was. It made J1 look like an indica, but anyways it had chem 91 x sour diesel x Acapulco gold x chemesis x lemon thai. It was top shelf, $60 for an 8th but well worth it.

Needless to say, I have a lot of chronic (lol) back pain and severe depression/anxiety to work through. This is my go-to-strain. It used to be Gorilla Glue #4 (a close 2nd), but Chemdawg91 makes me happier and seems to alleviate my pain quicker. I\u2019m just happy when I\u2019m high on this strain (like right now). However, not for the novice-smoker. This gal done hit hard and quick.

VA happy and euphoric favorite sativa with uplifting, happy, creative results with the tendency to enhance arousal. This strain has an obvious terp profile with the diesel really popping out.

VSmells sour, like skunk.  The high hits on an uplifting note and finishes on a drowsy one.  Good evening strain, giving enough energy to enjoy the night before nodding off to sleep.\u000a\u000aEffects were almost psychedelic at peak and very very dissociative.  It was easy for to focus on one thing, but be impervious to any distractions, including more important ones.  Fun for when your responsibilities are nil. Time felt slow\u000a\u000aWas not creative enough for me to work, but it was a lot of fun playing GTA Online.  Chilled out and relaxed, but I can still drive like a champ in-game, so not too much actual slowing of my reflexes.  Though it felt disconnected as time moved slowly (perhaps my reflexes were even hightened).

VFresh smelling, fresh tasting crumble of top quality.  For only $20 at Delta  Health Center, this concentrate packs a punch.  Great for afternoon or evening seshes.  Maybe too uppy for late night seshes, depends on your preference.
