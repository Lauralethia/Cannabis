VGrape God is an Indica dominant hybrid (70% Indica x 30% Sativa).  It is excellent for relieving stress and has a nice body high.  The buds are incredibly sticky, very dense, and long lasting in the bowl.  The taste is very fruity and pleasant with no bad after taste.  Everything about is is &quot;grape&quot;; grape taste, grape smell, and grape flavor on exhale.

VOne of my favorite Indicas!  Wonderful taste and overall experience.  Grape God relaxes me, and I can still focus on it while reading.  I also noticed it makes me sexually aroused far more than any indica I&#39;ve tried.  Huge plus!  No munchies, just the bliss I desire for a balanced night of chillin&#39;, good lovin&#39;, and sound sleep!  Yes, I can see why this strain has such a mighty name!

VFeeling pro this morning, I put up Grape God for a wake and bake review sesh. I paid for my hubris; Grape God turned the wake and bake sesh into a wake and snake when my skeleton came out with the smoke on my first exhale. I&#39;m stretched out writing this, Money Trees in the background. \u000a\u000aVisual: Frosty little bud. Trimmed up fine since everything on it is sugary. \u000a\u000aSmell: I was disappointed with the scent at first, even after busting it open it was only mildly fruity. Nothing specific. But after I grinding it up it was almost identical to Grape Skittles. It smells amazing, I want some Skittles to go with this now. \u000a\u000aI loaded it in my just cleaned Silika beaker and proceeded to take a mighty chief. And mighty it was, because I can&#39;t open my eyes. Feeling clear and stoned at the same time, which may be an effect specific to me because of me medicating for anxiety. I smoke up the rest and now I&#39;m here writing this. Not couchlocked exactly, very close though. I&#39;m super relaxed, not sleepy though which is great since it&#39;s just 10am. I would love this in the evening or even as a emergency joint for panic attacks. Grape God crushed my morning anxiety, and this morning was the first morning in about a week where I didn&#39;t start the day throwing up.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s been about an hour since I finished up, and I&#39;m up feeling really good. Ready to go with my eyes low.

VThis strain is overall a fair pain reliever and kind of fun as its main effect is happy, carefree, and rather pleasent but not overpowering.  The only downside is the effects hit pretty good at first, levels quickly, and fades away sooner than you would like.  I hit this a bit harder than other higher level THC strains as it is only moderately strong.  Pain relief is ok but only dulls but not nearly knocking it.  If you are looking for a fun, pleasant, slightly euphoric high this will do.  But if you are looking for a more effective pain reliever or strong body buzz, keep looking.  Taste is smooth but I did not pick up any strong grape flavor or did my bud have a strong grape smell.  Mostly earthy but smooth with slight citrus notes.  Inhale smooth with minimal irritation, and exhale smooth and pleasant.  I would get it again to add to the mix.

Body pain and mental frustration are gone now. when you attempt to stand to go grab some snacks to cure the munchies  and a beverage to cure some mean cotton mouth, a dizzy spell hits you.

VMigraine pain 5; nausea 7-8 when I medicated round 1300 or so? Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. No anxiety/paranoia (an absolute must for me). Body high allowed me to eat which was very much needed. Head high allowed me to enjoy Sunday afternoon with my family which was also very much needed. High lasted bout 4 + hours which was killer for (I think) a Sativa dominant? I&#39;d highly recommend for daytime/after work use for pain/nausea/anxiety! Top notch meds from dis dispensary! :-)

VBought this recently and just now vaped a full bowl. Dispensary lists it as indica dominant. It is dense and sticky. I want to add the smell of over-ripe cantaloupe to the list. Pretty strong pain med. Sativa focus with body buzz. Music CEV was really nice.  So was watching the movements of water. Buzzy and subtle shivers of euphoria bubble up, but other than that senses of feeling are not enhanced. With the excellent pain relief and bonus music appreciation, I have to list it as a medicinal favorite.

VStrong smell when dry, but very mild smell and  taste once lit. Great for those suffering from nausea or epilepsy as some smells may be triggers. I had almost instant muscle relaxer type relief. Headache gone next. This gave me a total body and head high. It started in my chest and moved its way to my limbs and head. It definitely has a relaxing effect, but gives me a happy carefree type vibe instead of just sleepy. Could probably be used for daytime pain and depression, or social anxiety, but may need to be mixed with a little something to help tone down the sedative aspect. This is officially one of my favorite top 5!!!!

VJust picked up a quarter from the dispensary of Grape God and at first was marveled by the earthy, strong scent of the bud. Upon closer inspection, the bud was glittered with trichomes and orange hairs. Bright green in color as well. Dense, but very soft in consistency. Smokes well with a hint of grape, as it is Grapefruit crossed with God Bud. \u000a\u000aAs for the high, it&#39;s what you&#39;d expect from an Indica dominant hybrid. Minimal body high, but it&#39;s more prevalent in higher doses. Nice head high that helps relieve stress, pain, and allows you to enjoy your day. The high lasts for around 2 hours (after 3 bong bowls) and is a nice strain to reward yourself with.\u000a\u000aOverall, I&#39;d say an 8/10. Very nice strain I would look into again.

VOmnipotently Grapey goodness! Great in all aspects. I wish people could get, taste and feel the mmj that I&#39;m rating. It all starts with good genetics and a commitment to excellent gardening. The grape god I smoked was grown by an older gent that has over 20yrs experience as a marijuana farmer. He is committed to the cultivation of high quality cannabis, and as a result his yields are large and his buds are conversation topics. His Grape God is sensational. Pleasing to the palate like a big ole pink grapefruit! Nice heady effects after a few tokes. I must admit the effects lasted for 4+ hours and there was no crash, no munchie attack, and no need to take another toke, it was all about rest, relaxation and sweet dreams.

VI acquired this strain from Planet Joe in the NW Cannabis Market on Rainier. The buds are full, and firm but not hard. The somewhat fluffy buds are grey with trichomes.  The aroma is quite pungent, I am able to smell it a few feet away in a sealed baggie. The aroma is a delicious blend of grapes and grape skins. There is a sweet hint of grapefruit to make one want to just chew on the buds! The buds, as usual are perfectly cured and trimmed. The grape is a bit sibdued in the flavor compared to the aroma but still very present. The sweet grape quickly fades to a pleasant gritty earthiness that is a wonderful smoke. The effect begins in minutes, with a firm puffiness behind the eyes, and a tingling weight throughout the body. The mind subtly calms, and almost before one notices, relaxation sets in. A happy, mellow, stoney energy kicks in. Grape God is an amazingly flavorful strain, described by what surely sound like exaggerations but are truths. One of the most flavorful and aromatic strains I have ever found. With the very substantial body high, and blissful head effects, this is a perfect anytime, anyone strain. I continue to enjoy a 1.5g cone this am, and I can think of nothing better to start a morning.

Bud looks more similar to grapefruit than god but has far greater tricome production, smells sweet and citrusy.

VFlavorful and powerful asf. The flavor is super sweet and it tastes of grapes. It comes on right away but it\u2019s gradual. I smoked a 1g pre-roll that had 19.97% THC and .04% CBD and I feel a tiny bit tingly in my arms and legs but the high is mostly in my head. I\u2019d definitely pick it up again if I got the chance.

VGrape God in flower is very CHILL, yes but it is entirely different in concentrate and by that I mean like it owns up to the name of a God bud type. I used to think Grape God was the weakest God Bud variant but it turned out the growers named Regulator&#39;s grew it specific to being an India strain and less hybrid with less Indica-dominant compared to it in concentrate as India is way better! The Euphoria of Grape God originally is CHILL in flower but WILD in concentrate along with sleepy which was the whole idea behind the strain to begin with expect no one ever did it right, but Regulator&#39;s came in and did what they did and regulated like no other!

VI&#39;m normally an indica guy, so switching over to a 1/4 of Grape God was interesting. I just got it the other day and of course the dude forgot the name or mixed it up or something. Anyway it&#39;s really chill. It&#39;s a low key high (at least for me atm). It&#39;s great for relaxing and relieving some pain and stress while moving or working. It&#39;s a great strain--taste, color, density (lovely for grinders), and smell. Not to mention it has tons of trichomes. Overall I&#39;d say this is a great body high that allows your mind to function normally.

VMellow and calming indica from 14er Holistics in Boulder. It was the most indica dominant hybrid on their menu, and I&#39;ve enjoyed my times with it. Definitely has a subtle grape-y or purple-y taste, with an earthy sweetness to the sticky buds. \u000aIt&#39;s calming, grounding, mellow, and lowers my anxiety. It&#39;s a nice strain for being able to take a leisurely and creative time with your day and relieve mental stress.

VMellow and calming indica from 14er Holistics in Boulder. It was the most indica dominant hybrid on their menu, and I&#39;ve enjoyed my times with it. Definitely has a subtle grape-y or purple-y taste, with an earthy sweetness to the sticky buds. \u000aIt&#39;s calming, grounding, mellow, and lowers my anxiety. It&#39;s a nice strain for being able to take a leisurely and creative time with your day and relieve mental stress.

VMy Favourite!\u000aI can&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve found this amazing strain. \u000aI have been suffering from fibromyalgia, migraines, kidney stones and depression. I&#39;m on so many meds and I hate it. I can barely sleep at night because I&#39;m in too much pain. When I do get to sleep it&#39;s because my body gives up. This strain is amazing. within 5 minutes, I&#39;m pain free and completely relaxed. Only downside is that it puts me to sleep. It isn&#39;t something I can take to get me through the day but it is amazing for at night.

VI&#39;m normally an indica guy, so switching over to a 1/4 of Grape God was interesting. I just got it the other day and of course the dude forgot the name or mixed it up or something. Anyway it&#39;s really chill. It&#39;s a low key high (at least for me atm). It&#39;s great for relaxing and relieving some pain and stress while moving or working. It&#39;s a great strain--taste, color, density (lovely for grinders), and smell. Not to mention it has tons of trichomes. Overall I&#39;d say this is a great body high that allows your mind to function normally.

Vsmoked this one night with a group of buddies, along with some purple kush. Considering I smoked the purple kush as well my rating might not be 100% accurate ;). I have smoked a lot of purple kush and I gotta say grape god easily contends, the two highs blended very well imo. I felt pretty euphoric, and was heavily stoned. I give grape god a solid 8/10.\u000aSmoke easy friends :)

VGrape God is a sweet smoke. This indica dominant strain helps to knock out stress, anxiety, and alleviate pain. The smoke itself can be a little harsh, but it is definitely worth a little coughing. Watch out for dry eyes when smoking this sweet flower, and keep a drink on hand. This is definitely an evening smoke as once the effects are felt the best feeling is sinking into your couch with a fluffy pillow and warm blanket. Be ready to relax with a permanent smile on your face while enjoying some delicious Grape God!

With that said it does not lack in any other aspect, smell is incredibly pungent but oddly i would get a woft of onions sometimes and sometimes strong grape. Taste wise was very strong in grape flavour making it hard to stop at one bowl but after having that first bowl you will hesitate a bit. I found the effects onset was fairly immediate and a strong talkative sativa, something i would smoke in social setting or a good daily driver.

It had a grape flavor at first then in the middle a pungent tea type flavor then earthy while the tea was continuing on.. then after it ended.. while i breathed i had a minty feeling and on the tips of my teeth.. it was really cold.. like drinking very very cold water while the water rushed pasted your teeth.. i do suggest it very much... if your looking for the calm relaxed feeling.. this is usually what i look for... but in other news im new to the site and i hope to post alot more reviews... this is my first after all..

VI got this strain because my friend wanted to try getting high after only having bad experiences in the past. So I did of a lot of smoking myself and research on what strain would be good for him. I and ended up with 7 grams of Grape God two weeks later on a late Saturday morning. I decarbed it and made coco-cannaoil to use in some pot brownies.\u000a\u000aThis is the strain that gave him his first good experience with weed. When ingested, the high comes on slowly. It&#39;s like gently rising to the clouds slowly, and gliding along them. Finding joy in the little things is easier. Having a good time is promised.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend giving Grape God a try.

VWhat a nice strain to smoke on those lazy days. It has a very sweet and grape/grapefruitish like taste. I found the high a little different though. Hit like most strains would but instead of being high and forgetting to do things, I would do things and forget how high I am. So this is a very helpful strain on days off when you just need to get something done around the house. This grape god was not organic like the last grape god I had, but definitely go organic. It seemed to be tastier and more of a kick.

Movie can wait....lol. Smell was just as described as most say with the grape, earthy tones. Mine had a cheesy smell to it, which I like anyways...lol. So ya, got me motivated and had my movie snacks organized, a canna tea made and my spot on the couch all ready to go. HaHa. You def gotta try this strain!

VThis flower is for me a mid day smoke. The best I can describe the high is cerebral with a noticeable stony brain effect. Relaxed body and spirit sensation. The smoke was so pleasant and tasty. Not so &quot;clean&quot; on the inhale, but the flavor came through on the exhale with an almost sourish hint to it. It was very pleasant. The high has been going strong for 1.5 hours. Not one yawn. Not a lick of fatigue or tired eyes has accompanied the noticeably strong relaxation brought on by this wonderful strain. I think for new users this would be an excellent first smoke. A few hits would surely do you really good. For me I wish I had a blunt to roll up this whole 1.5 grams. I know this stuff would have me in the clouds. It&#39;s just that kind of stony ganj. haha Dense thc coverage. 24%+ THC tested. Excellent stuff.

VGrape God is a sweet smoke. This indica dominant strain helps to knock out stress, anxiety, and alleviate pain. The smoke itself can be a little harsh, but it is definitely worth a little coughing. Watch out for dry eyes when smoking this sweet flower, and keep a drink on hand. This is definitely an evening smoke as once the effects are felt the best feeling is sinking into your couch with a fluffy pillow and warm blanket. Be ready to relax with a permanent smile on your face while enjoying some delicious Grape God!

With that said it does not lack in any other aspect, smell is incredibly pungent but oddly i would get a woft of onions sometimes and sometimes strong grape. Taste wise was very strong in grape flavour making it hard to stop at one bowl but after having that first bowl you will hesitate a bit. I found the effects onset was fairly immediate and a strong talkative sativa, something i would smoke in social setting or a good daily driver.

The taste is very interesting, earthy and floral notes were what I noticed. It was hard to taste because the smoke was kinda harsh and sharp. High was stoney and goofy. Definitely not something to smoke before doing anything that demands attention. More of a daydream and doze off strain. Good for nights or days relaxing in the sun &#128261; made me feel like a cuddly kid and had me wishing I had somebody to nuzzle at.

When first upon opening the gallon size cure jar and taking a Giant whiff of this amazing green one will notice definite hints of what ALMOST seems like Grape Big League Chew Bubblegum. The hints of grape are by far undeniable, you can also smells hints of the God Bud coming threw the tasty grape smell!!! The flavor is a tasty mild grape/earthy flavor!!! Just looking at the beautiful buds in their Gallon Cure Jars are a major sense of inspiration to anyone who&#39;s had the chance to have a glance or pleasure of smoking this strain, i HIGHLY recommend this strain for anyone&#39;s garden indoors or out!!!! Yields for this strain are the larger side of the scale, should finish in 8-9 weeks indoors!!!

It had a grape flavor at first then in the middle a pungent tea type flavor then earthy while the tea was continuing on.. then after it ended.. while i breathed i had a minty feeling and on the tips of my teeth.. it was really cold.. like drinking very very cold water while the water rushed pasted your teeth.. i do suggest it very much... if your looking for the calm relaxed feeling.. this is usually what i look for... but in other news im new to the site and i hope to post alot more reviews... this is my first after all..

OMG....  \u000aI could feel the migrane (head splitting pain) disappearing from my head with each puff of this wonder strain. Two puffs and it was half way gone, another 3-4 puffs and it was gone completely, my head ache was gone !!!!!!  \u000aBesides the medical part it brings a very nice body high, night time stuff for sure. O, and make sure u have some snacks around :)

VWhen I first came across Grape God, I thought it&#39;d taste a lot like grape kool-aid... don&#39;t know why. Sadly, it didn&#39;t taste like it though. It did have the pleasant scent of sweetness and even tones of grape were noticeable! It&#39;s crazy to think how certain strains will have scent attributes associated with berries and fruits,   always a bonus when you taste it too. The high was a euphoric indica based feeling mixed with the sativa state of mind. So in a sense you get the best of both worlds, relaxation and hoppy positive mind activity. I&#39;d recommend to try this strain at least once in your lifetime, not uncommon so shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find!\u000a\u000aLook: 5/5\u000aScent: 5/5\u000aHigh: 5/5\u000aBurnout: 5/5\u000aOverall: 5/5

VNice High, you don&#39;t need much of this tasty flower. Very fruity. Again, if you are new to flowers, this is a powerful, &quot;heady&quot; high. This is also a long-lasting high, helped with my anxiety and stress. A great flower for meditating, will put your body  in a relaxed state, readying you for an open mind. Try this with a Guided Meditation...awesome way to achieve the benefits of meditation.

VI absolutely love this strain.  The grape aroma  is very distinctive. The taste is very sweet and kind of  tropical with a grape and earthy  undertone. This is a very sticky smooth strain however it will expand your lungs a bit on inhale due to its heavy body. The high is very powerful and potent. It&#39;s a great all around smoke. It definitely will leave your mouth watering wanting more and more.

A few puffs gets me focused, positive and feeling that body/mind euphoria where you inhale deeply and feel all of your stress leave your body very quickly.

Nice fruity scent..smelled way more like grape at the dispensary then it does with my bud..but still great.. nice fruity taste up until the popcorn taste hits. Would highly recommend this strain.

VGrape God has become one of my favorite strains. Smoking this will put you in a tranquil state of mind. The worries go away, and your mind peacefully meanders through your imagination. You will be comforted by a warm buzz, making it a perfect bed time strain. Grape God will let you peacefully reflect on your day, without the racing thoughts or anxiety. I would think this strain is not only perfect for those who suffer pain and insomnia, but those who seek a comforting end to their day.

VThis is an EXCELLENT strain. Very Euphoric and relaxed, but I still have enough energy to go do things if I needed to. This is actually the strain that has made me decide to be VERY strict on my strains, because comparing it to this, other strains I&#39;ve given 4 or even 5 stars on seem pathetic. It&#39;s a potent, powerful strain with a lovely high to it. However, there are some negatives. A strong, uncomfortable behind the eyes buzz, paranoia, headaches and dizziness. They aren&#39;t all too bad, but I felt all of these while smoking Grape God, even if only minorily \u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain, for sure :)
