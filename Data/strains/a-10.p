VI liked this one, alot. With it&#39;s orange/green coloured leafes, I didn&#39;t have too much munchies, only ate a bag of crisps during the high. It though made me very thirsty, fanta exotic tates like heaven during this high, lol. Funny thing though, I was riding my bike down a road just after smoking, I saw the same houses over and over again, roads started bending as I was riding my bike down them, even though they seemed straight to me, the wind from the ocean was scary as hell though, and I experienced a slight fever-like-condition during the high, and while being indoors, perhaps from wearing too little clothes. Overall, extremely enjoying high. Go for 50/50 with tobacco for a more relaxed high, that being said still being an energetic high with tobacco. Got 1/10th left, gotta go.\u000a

VOne of the best strains I have ever had. I had the opportunity to grow this strain and so far, it is by far my favoriate PM smoke. One bowl of good strength white widow (or a cross, like OG White Widow) should put even the most experienced smoker to sleep.

VThis is probably one of the most potent strains I have ever smoked. Definitely not for the novices out there, this stuff has a hard hitting, long lasting body high, that can seriously knock you on your ass if you hit too much of it. \u000a \u000aBut when you smoke the perfect amount, the feeling is incredible. It&#39;s truly a wonderful high.

VThis old school indica packs a heavy buzz. The nugs are pretty dense and not too sticky-lots of crystals stAnd out in contrast to the dark buds. after smoking (in my case vapeing) you can expect a solid 3 hr buzz. Would not recommend repeated daily use. I had 1/8 (lasts about 10 days) and the deep lethargic high made me lazy with a little paranoia. Awsome nug tho for nightime.

VSubjective notes: Uplifting cerebral head high that lasts for a few hours.  Energenic high as well; can function during the day with no &quot;couch lock&quot; after the high wears down.\u000a\u000aMedicinal value: good for appetite and some pain.  I had cancer and this helped with eating as well as pain. Very sociable when communicating with others as well as an uplifting mood.\u000a\u000aGrower evaluation: Great yielding plant with a very short flowering time of about 6-7 weeks.  Has tight branching with lots of flower sites which produced nice kolas which were very dense. Grew in hydro with a bcnl producer grow box with great results.  Can get over a pound with two 400 watt hps lights.  A little bit finicky to clone at times but worth the smoke. I would give this a 9 out of 10.

VDefinite indica strain. A total head high, no body effects compared to a sativa. After a few hours from smoking it, it made me tired and cranky. My face went numb at one point, but I have nervous system issues so I can&#39;t say it was necessarily the weed. The nuggets are very dense so you&#39;re only getting about 4 regular little nuggets in an 8th. I haven&#39;t geeked out so hard in years after smoking this stuff. Made me laugh. Indica strains rock.
