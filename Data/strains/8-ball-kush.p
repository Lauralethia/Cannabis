VOne of my favorite strains recently. I figured a strong indica like this would have me locked. Its a super pleasant high and isnt too strong. I dont feel totally stoned. Muscle soreness from workout the previous  has completely gone away. Very clear and clean high.

VI was looking for something heavy, so Nick recommended the 8 Ball Kush. Can&#39;t go wrong with a sweet afghani. The perk to this Barney&#39;s Farm beauty is that head high. It really seals the deal for a funky fun indica. Go for the 8 ball, go for the win.

VA very tasteful bud that is effective even in small dosage. A good daytime bud if in smaller amounts, couch lock guaranteed in moderate to large amounts. Will get you  to that effect you love in a good indica strain. 8 ball kush is a bud I will never say no to.
