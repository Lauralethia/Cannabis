VA nice balanced hybrid with a smell true to it&#39;s name. Has an old school vibe, like a good friend is there to ease your worried mind. A most enjoyable strain to Netflix and vape.

VAfter ingesting this strain you will be transported to a euphoric place. Very much a head high that slowly advances to the rest of the body. perfect strain to use for productivity which is unusual for an indica. very good at treating insomina, loss of appetite etc. recommended &#128526;

VI dig this stuff.. so far the smoothest strain I&#39;ve tried. no harsh burn or coughing urges which I love. Completely dissolved my terrible anxiety, while giving me energy at the same time. I like that I can use this during the day without worrying about being in a couch-lock state.

VI just tried a bowl of this for the first time, and I can tell you, this is amazing.\u000a\u000aI have extreme anxiety and  within moments of smoking this I was sitting and smiling at the moon - not a care in the world.  It feels like all your stress floats away and is replaced with a light peacefulness unrivalled by any strain I\u2019ve ever tried.  I immediately felt as though I had entered a hallowed place - there was a cool cleanness that washed over me.  Wow.  Wowow.  \u000a\u000aAlready ordering more.

The intractable headache is what I&#39;m looking to treat.  Very, very relaxing.  Would be good for hangover days or rainy nights.  Also a good romantic bud *wink wink*

Lower back pain... gone. Anxiety... gone. Work brain... still there. I can see why she&#39;s a widow. I&#39;d kill to be with her.

VThen this is the best strain of MaryJane among all according to me. To be honest I&#39;m sure than in 10 years there will be a lot of better strains in the world but for the moment nothing is better than this absolutely perfect blend between the sour and pungent taste of the smoke and this big stone on the forehead which lasts for the maximum time possible (!). Honestly I don&#39;t expect much for a MaryJane strain than what the Sweet and Sour Widow provides by the best process possible. Totally wonderful. I love the strain.
