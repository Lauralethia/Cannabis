VHad 20 grams of this strain a couple of weeks ago and let me tell ya, it&#39;s prettay, prettay, prettaaayyy good. Nice initial head buzz. Almost a little too much at times; especially after your first J of the day. Once you settle in, it&#39;s smooth sailing. Great for migraines, anxiety, and sleep. At 22.29% Thc, the cerebral was definitely felt. Recommended.

VThis strain really shows off the benefits bestowed on it by both parents. I was not sold on the smell, which fortunately turned in to a more palatable taste of pine, but the promise of pain relief with mental alertness and energy was more than I could resist. I am glad I went for it. This batch had not been tested, but was supposed to be about 20/1 THC/CBD. I am surprised that a 20/1 ratio did so well at pain relief without gluing me to the couch.

V4.4/5 Smoked from a small bubbler. Smell is average skunkiness, nothing particularly unique. The high is just the opposite though, and truly does stand out. It is one of the few &#39;sativa&#39; indica&#39;s in that is produces noticeable head effects while still having similar body loads of an indica. The head high is slightly foggy, but it creates a large shift in visual perception and focus that can best be described as fish lens or tunnel vision. Very fun to look around at things with this high, and doesn&#39;t leave too much lethargy like a typical indica. Definitely funner than most, and a showcase in the variety of cannabis in its intoxicating effects.

VJust got back from Colorado. Went for 420 Cannabis Cup in Denver cancelled it at the last moment because they didn&#39;t want the same people who got them Rich partying in town all weekend. What hypocrites. I got to try 38 different strains of marijuana while I was there because there was three foot of snow and nothing else to do except smoke out. One of the top 5 we experienced was alien dog. Very fruity flavored, and had a great kick. One of the favorites of the party. You&#39;ll enjoy this one but make sure you&#39;re about ready to go to bed because it will knock you out.

VInhale (pipe): good earthy flavor with bright finish.  Made me cough a lot though, leaving my throat a bit raw.\u000aHigh: quick floating sensation followed by gradual onset couch lock/body high.  10 minutes to mild visual effects (enhanced 3D vision).  Continued increase in couch lock to the point of reduced pain perception (muscle soreness).  Moderate anxiety reduction and significant increase in apathy to perceived threats.\u000aSide effects: instant munchies, dry mouth, slight nystagmus

VAlien Dawg is a good strain for use in the evening and/or nighttime. It&#39;s effects are relaxing, leaving one feeling mellow and eventually sleepy within about an hour. It is not IMHO an outstanding strain but certainly a pleasant one to treat stress and insomnia. The pain relieving properties are quite good too :o)

I notice everything in greater detail. Vivid colors, and intense musical interpretations. Happy the entire time. One of the more enjoyable strains. Inhale was smooth and very earthy...dirty, similar to GG#4. Took only a small amount to get high, 2 solid tokes. No dry eyes or dry mouth. Munchies are there, not intense, but there. I give it a 4.5 star. I\u2019d buy it again.

VI picked this up from my dispensary new years eve, and my budtender said this is not for beginners and will definitely put you on your a**. but i have been smoking everyday for the past three years so i figured i would be fine. after me and my buddies returned from a wild new years night out, we decided to bust out some good ol&#39; alien dawg and test our limits. now when i smoke i usually feel a mild body buzz and some mild euphoric effects. but after just one bowl of this crystally goodness i found myself being thrown into multiple dimensions at once. i have never been as high as when i smoked alien dawg. i ended up passing out after the second bowl. i would highly recommend this strain to anyone who can get their hands on it. just make sure you are ready to be tossed out of this world. into a the filled realm

VI vaped some of this and listened to http://unisonicascension.com/variousmp3s/#tibetan-bowls-floating-in-dreamtime, and it was an amazing, almost out-of-body experience.  If you&#39;re not familiar with binaural beats or isochronic audio recordings, they&#39;re both a way to entrain the brain to induce sleep, relaxation, or focus and alertness depending on the frequencies  used.  There are a bunch of free ones on YouTube -- search for &quot;binaural meditation&quot; or &quot;isochronic meditation&quot; and give it a listen (headphones are important).

Vthis strain is freakin great but vary vary strong. this aint for beginners . but if your looking for a high that will just make you feel great and lazy but not not sleepy unless used at night befor your bedtime if you have one. if not its the perfect weed to light up and go have night on the town and it has an insain duration like damn near 6 hours like I said all night. by far my favored strain of almost any mornings wake and bake. and it is a good pain killer. it gets you high enough top forget about your aches and pains.\u000a

VI&#39;m a sativa connoisseur, yet I always make sure to keep indica or hybrid concentrates on hand. I used this in a very pure bho shatter form first thing this morning. Came in at 85% total thc. Normally indica&#39;s put me to sleep. Not in this case. It&#39;s more of a trainwreck feel, gave me tunnel vision pretty good. Good for focus and stress/pain relief. Great overal warm body feel that last quite a long time! That is this strains best quality its duration and focus effect. Enjoy!

VSlight lemon zest until cracked open then it was pretty earthtastic. Good stuff but it was kind of light on the taste which i&#39;d probably attribute to the alien side. Effects were classic chemdog cerebral but not full on get &#39;r done.

VAlien Dawg is a good strain for use in the evening and/or nighttime. It&#39;s effects are relaxing, leaving one feeling mellow and eventually sleepy within about an hour. It is not IMHO an outstanding strain but certainly a pleasant one to treat stress and insomnia. The pain relieving properties are quite good too :o)

VThis was my first try of the fabled Dawg line and it was good. Very pungent in the jar, and while smoking and very nice flavor profile. Skunky when hit with a smooth and sweet exhale. For an Indica,she is very sativa like. I experienced very little lethargy and felt very mellow and relaxed, but not to the point of wanting to take a nap. I will be getting more of this lady soon.
