VPicked up an eighth of Chiesel from a new dispensary, Desert Rose, in North Phoenix. The buds are beautiful. Wonderful green hue with purple mixed in. Also the buds have a very healthy dusting of tricombs. The buds are also very dense. The strain has a very dank smell. With strong hints of both diesel and cheese. The high is your classic 50/50 hybrid. Nice and energizing high that kills depression and also euphoric to kill any anxiety. Also the Indica properties that offer relaxation and pain relief.

VMy favorite thus far, this strain seems to be unique not only in its pungency, but also in its ability to help one focus on a task. I&#39;m not a fan of  tagging Medical conditions (I&#39;m not a doctor, simple as that), but this one urges me to promote this to those suffering from ADHD symptoms or attention issues. Completely off ADHD meds and functioning fine if not better, and attribute my progress to this strain.

Von appearance under 30X mag -many large headed cloudy trichomes and slightly spongey but somewhat tight bud structure. properly dried but needs more cure. smell has a dank bottom end and an initial chem/diesel flavor which is just average but the high is great. a bit of lost motor functions.  little bit of face head centered body high- relatively strong as in 3 or 4 hits are good enough for a daily smoker.

For me it really gives me a tingly feeling and heavy in the eyes at first, then slowly goes down my body and relaxes me.  I enjoy this because it takes my anxiety and stress away.

VTwo reviews in one, one for the flower/effects, one for growing/ and cloning.\u000a\u000aFlower:  nice heady up buzz, not too heavy and doesn&#39;t seem to last long.  The taste is interesting, in my case not too diesel-y, and mellow on the Cheese.\u000a\u000aGrow:  grows well, strong.  Stretches for up to 4 weeks once you flip to 12x12.  Takes nutes well, ph 5.9 and she was happy.\u000a\u000aClone:  not recommended for clones. I get almost 100% of my clones from other strains (LA Woman, Holy Grail, etc.), but Chiesel was lucky to do 25% success rate, several runs we got 0% to root.\u000a\u000aOverall a nice strain to try, but due to not being a hearty cloner, she&#39;s already lost her place in our garden.

VI tried some Chiesel last night night is was great. I bought some\u000aon my 2nd trip to my favorite dispensory (PSSA in Palm Springs).\u000aThe 1st time I went there I saw the Chiesel but didn&#39;t buy it\u000abecause the THC was at 17.9%.  I was looking for 20% or above.\u000aThe 2nd time I was there the budtender suggested the Chiesel so\u000aI gave it a try. Like I said before, it was great (it&#39;s NYC x Cheese, it&#39;s got to be good).  \u000aThat got me thinking. THC % is important but it&#39;s not everything.\u000aA lot of things affect your smoking session: How you feel, how you ingest,\u000ahow much you ingest and so forth. So don&#39;t pass up a great strain based\u000asolely on THC%.

VChiesel was one of my first consistently used strains, and though I typically see it with lower THC concentrations than some of my other favorites, it&#39;s still a great high and a favorite for when I need to remain productive or focused after a sesh. \u000a\u000aThis strain is relatively smooth and easy to slide into. The effects can be slow-moving at first but 15-30 minutes is typically enough time to really feel the effects. I think this hybrid is perfect for people who are just getting started smoking, or don&#39;t want to be completely blitzed.

VA great strain for daily activities, pain, and stress relief. A thick, dense, pungent strain that requires only 1 bowl to achieve amazing results. Neck pain, tooth ache, cramping, migraines, joint and muscles aching, all just a whisper in the back of your mind. Novice smokers be warned, as most diesel strains are, this strain produces thick clouds that are rather harsh and will leave you in a coughing fit if you over do it. I recommend snacks too, because this will give you the munchies for sure.

VBeautiful smell. Beautiful high. This strain made me feel more productive at times but was also a great head high. If I chose to sit back and relax and let my mind wonder it could get quite intense. I&#39;m an avid music fan and download music daily, and I found some great music while smoking this. I&#39;d recommend hanging out outside for the sitting back and relaxing option. Probably my favourite strain so far

VThis was a surprisingly good strain. The break up was great, not too dry, a grinder will be needed. The smoke was quite smooth and the flavor was full cheese on the exhale. The strain initially had me couch locked, but after 15 mins that full &quot;clean up the house high&quot; kicked in. It was a great hybrid, I would definitely recommend this to any connoisseur.

VI was born with Muscular Distrophy. I medicate every day for the past 2 and half years. I have to smoke 2 blunts to kill the pain. I got this strain from sunflower meds as soon as I got home I grabbed my bong packed a bowl. I took only 3 hits and within just a few minutes it creaped up and I felt the full effects of the Chiesel. I would recommend this strain to everyone. 1st time users beware!!

V8/10 for the effects alone very nice sample I received as a FTP gift, nice trim job and plenty of trichomes throughout the bud, only smoked a gram and I must say even that was bit heavy due to the raw power of this strain. Fantastic flavor especially for those into the diesel strains (:  or if your a fan of cheese and uk cheese \u000a

VChiesel smells dank, in a good way. I switched from Sativa strains to this Indica and have found it much more calming, allowing me to focus and be creative. I went through acute trauma and the lingering PTSD symptoms include over-activation and intrusive painful memories. This strain has been excellent in calming me, suppressing the intensity of the memories and allowing me to focus on positive things. \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re not dealing with PTSD or anxiety, this bud is very chill and I agree with other reviewer, great for artists and musicians.
