VAlbert Walker is my favorite strain by far, Blue Dream is a close second but AW is some next shit. It&#39;s lemon pledge-esque scent caught me off guard, I didn&#39;t think that I was smelling bud. As soon as I hit the joint I immediately started feeling high, and was completely dumbfounded. I didn&#39;t think it was possible. That&#39;s AW&#39;s charm. It makes the impossible, possible.

VGrower:  Doc Croc\u000a\u000aThis Indica dominate hybrid is a heavy hitter.  It&#39;s got a very nice flavor--lemon-fruity? The first hit off a fresh bowl is amazingly flavorful.   It&#39;s got a pretty dense flower with lots of rust colored strands (?)\u000a\u000aThe smoke is silky.  Milky? \u000a\u000aIt causes heightened creativity and the musical colors are amazing!! (Paint with this)\u000a\u000aSilence inside your head is equally as pleasant as music.  Profound thoughts which are good for most people but some who may be in a foul mood may focus on those issues which could lead to anxiety for them.

VNo better strain overall.  I do not know of any strains crossed with Albert Walker, but why would you?  True Albert Walker buds (usually Northern NorCal or south Oregon) is a clone only pheno that hopefully is still ALIVE!!!  The buds are not huge, but can get long, I think is from the sativa lineage.  If properly flushed and cured, this is such a unique smoke.  The flavor is of the smell are of diesel fuel, a compost pile and Candyland!  \u000a\u000aOK- the high.  Albert tastes totally different than it smells, like heaven in the form of smoke.  Enjoy the walker slowly, enjoy the taste.  Soon it feels like a blanket wrapped you.  Then you cannot be not happy.\u000aYou are perfectly balanced, I am a med user, so that helped sooo much.\u000a\u000aIf you find albert walker, taste and store him.\u000aHe always solves a rainy day.
