Vthis strain is great for wanting to have energy. I also was having a terrible headache and this strain helped tremendously. I&#39;m a person who regularly gets migraines and I find that not every weed strain can help my headaches but I found this strain to get rid of my headache supper quickly.

VOk update to my other previous review on this strain. Check my account to view it. Anyways it\u2019s been a couple hours since my review, and I definitely feel like I\u2019m more energetic. I\u2019m usually more on the lazy side and I hate it and I try to change it this definitely helps. It got me out of the house, and I started playing with my cousins pit bull.

VI smoked this two years back. loved the peppery taste and smell,  very well balanced. the sample quality was a B grade, visible crystals and great look to the buds. great high definate ranges of 17-20% but it could be better. now after two years i am growwing this strain. noticed she dislikes heat over 29/31 as other strains in the same tent don&#39;t stress. her heat stress during early flowering had started black diesel herming. i plucked male pollen sacs. this is due to be a diesel strain weakness. futher more shes abit slow during flowering but after 4th week crystals exploded. great strain. sativa high with heavyness of an indica

VThese buds are dark purple with tones of black throughout.  The taste is sour and fruity and has quite an intense smell.  Overall, I thought this strain was okay.  I smoked it in the morning to help me with my energy but I didnt experience any sativa affects, and instead, was couch locked most of the morning.  Listening to people speak was a tedious task.  I also didnt get the overall high I needed to help with my pain and moods.   I wont try this strain again.

VI love this strain. for a while now I have been strictly an Indica guy, but wanted to give the Diesel name a try, and wow am I impressed. you definatly feel the floaty uplift in the begining, then it slowly fades into a very calm, and &quot;heavy&quot; feeling just like most Indica&#39;s. the high then slowly fades away as you find you start to feel the thick blanket around your body start to go away.

VI have a monstrous tolerance, but this stuff has got me high af. it has all the effects of a strong sativa, but with the dreamy, spaced out effects of an indica or indica dom hybrid. I don&#39;t think it has the &quot;medicated&quot; effect of an indica tho.

VI picked up a gram from votsmd today.\u000a\u000aIt was very fresh and had a large dense bud.  Smelled like fresh cut grass and black pepper.  The smoke has a black pepper taste also.\u000a\u000aI think this would be a good strain for headaches during the day.  Its very refreshing and did not leave me tired at all.  Black Diesel made my head pretty numb which is what I look for treating my migraines. \u000a\u000aI will probably get some more if its available.
