VI&#39;ve smoked my fair share of strains and I remember this one in particular, for good reason. It only smelt and tasted with slight undertones of orange but I could still tell. I remember saying though after 4 large hits on a blunt I didn&#39;t feel too high, for me the initial head high wasn&#39;t powerful at all. But give it fifteen minutes afterward and it came on me like a right creeper, true euphoria. I suddenly felt a rush of happiness and made me want to talk and talk and laugh, my worries at the time seemingly forgotten. It is defintely a social strain and provided a powerful uplift for hours after. Trip Hop is especially good on this type of high I find. Would deffo recommend 9/10

As a veteran smoker, the high is perfect for me because I can still go about my day; it has a nice energetic, happy high. The buds are very dense. The green is a nice bright, beautiful color and the orange/copper hairs are perfect. Under a 10x magnification, the trichomes are the icing on the cake...or should I say &quot;the frosting on the bud&quot;.

VOrange Haze is an awsome sativa dom perfect for day time use smells sorta skunky but really piney and citrusy, its an Uplifting energetic buzz for about a half hour and then it slows you down a bit but doesnt knok you out, (but you can still fall asleep on it). For medical use it would be good for all day pain killing effects but still alows you to stay alert and focused through out the day

We have stuff to do today, and had never tried this strain so I was being careful. Definetly made me energized, focused and creative. The only negitive effects were :dry mouth, and slight paranoia.

VLoaded this right after my roommates and I finished a bowl of Black Widow. This particular strain most certainly made up for what Black Widow lacked, and that&#39;s a more prominent body high. Cannabis is no good when the effects are 100% in your head and 0% anywhere else. Even if you prefer Sativa strains, they at least still have a small effect on the body. This is what a hybrid is suppose to feel like.
