VCannabis is very subjective so what I experience may be completely different from what you experience while medicating. Using a volcano I was just introduced to this strain. You can definitely pick up the citrus notes. In a perfect world I would have a higher percentage of GDP in this end product. GDP great for pain, so this strain does help with pain. The Lemon haze comes through with a nice head high. Great for starting the day, but novice beware. By my 8th volcano bag got sleepy!\u000a
