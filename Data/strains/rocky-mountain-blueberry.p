VSo happy to be indulging in the feelings of this strain! It&#39;s a very sweet smoke that supplies a hefty body buzz accompanied by a lofty head high. It had me giggling and tripping over my words while in conversation with friends. Relaxing and spacey, still functional for an Indica, and not too heavy. Smell, taste, and high are all a wonderful treat.

VI&#39;ve heard that this is a pretty popular strain and I see why! To begin: the flower is covered in pretty orange hairs and crystals. The smell is fresh and fruity. This was by far the smoothest smoke I&#39;ve had, but that may be because I&#39;m a new stoner or because I smoked it with my bubbler. The smoke also tastes really nice! It&#39;s clean and has a hint of berry at the end. The high is really relaxing and sedating. Tingly in the body but still able to have a clear mind whether you want to be daydreamy or empty minded. Definitely good for after a long day of work. Really works out the knots.
