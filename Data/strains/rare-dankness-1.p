VLove this strain. This strain is a parent plant to so many of my favorite strains such as Rare Darkness or 501st OG. Anytime you see this strain as a parent plant to any other strain I would recommend getting it, though of course getting this strain itself is always a better option if possible.

VWow -- 2nd favorite strain so far.  Within a few minutes I was slammed with a heavy duty floaty overall body high.  30 Minutes later it really kicked in...but allowed me to remain clear thinking the whole time.  Definitely a potent strain for when you have no driving or serious work to do.  No couch lock, no anxiety or paranoia...just absolutely relaxed with no thoughts of pain.
