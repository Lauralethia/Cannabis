VThis is a fantastic strain! Great taste of sweet pine with a little earthy undertone. The effects were outstanding! Immediately got a happy, euphoric, and tingly head high. The body high crept up on me. Even though it was relaxing, I felt Buffalo Bill was functional. Great for some daytime pain relief. It was pretty uplifting. So, was good for depression too. Doc and Yeti grew this amazingly crystalized, and tasty cross of William&#39;s Wonder and Killer Chem. I love those guys! They really grow some great weed. I&#39;ve tried many of their strains and all have been top shelf stuff.

VYeesh.  Over rated.  The main problem I had with this strain was that it was annoyingly heady and after the main rush came on, felt like a cat had crawled on my head and refused to leave.  Very annoying and very long lasting head high.  Think hours and hours.  Not my idea of fun but it may be for you.
