After a good amount of time  of staying productive, I sit for the rest of my high and play video games. I don&#39;t think as much like other strains make me, but I do space out a little.

VFirst off this strain is &quot;POTENT&quot; as well simply you may identify OG hints. 50/50 hybrid leaves you with a high that for myself lasts 2-3 hrs, for myself an everyday user, not that we&#39;re all alike (take into account and use with ease.) Great taste of citrus, berry comes on strong but easy on the exhale.\u000a\u000aA strain I would not hesitate to smoke again.\u000a   Props to: Golden Tree Productions - Lake Stevens, WA
