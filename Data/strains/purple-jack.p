VI find this strain to be outstanding! I have smoked all my life and this is by far one of the best I have ever tried. .on exhale is real hard on lungs if you hit it too hard , but then your freak blowed out your gourd \u000a

VSmoked from a bong using hemp string. Provides a nice steady high that makes we want to be active and makes everything funnier. You can really see the purple in the bud and the smoke is sweet and fruity.

VThe essence of my favorite hybrid - Saturday morning coffee with \u201cPJ\u201d and the vacuum looks like fun again! The porch floors have been rid of all winter\u2019s debris and now resting comfortably with my second cup-a coffee - feeling HIGHLY accomplished.\u000aAwesome lift with a couple of senior citizen sized hits - and an easy, anxiety free, muscles relaxed morning...

VThis is an exceptional hybrid that is flying under the radar. In my opinion its more practical than GDP bc of the sativa balance. Yet it maintains the purple hue and crystal aesthetics.

VPurple Jack is a well designed hybrid. The Indica and Sativa parents seem to compliment one another with the combined idea of a mind and body high. Tasting of grapes, and an obvious Herer flavor which I describe as dark, smokey, and roasted. Dry mouth side effect is well earned.

VThe aroma that first hit my nose was very piney. This is one of my favorite strains because of the uplifting euphoric effects but also brings in the mellow, don&#39;t work too hard today effects. Great for anxiety and relaxation.

VJust smoked this purple jack. I was interested in it because my dispensary listed this as having 25% tch level. I agree with others when they said the smoke was harsh on the exhale. It is very much worth the harsh smoke tho. Feel very high, relaxed, fixated, gazing warmth. It&#39;s a winner.

VExcellent strain. Crazy pretty to look at, very nice aroma, kind of piney but very sweet. The high is euphoric but calming. It relaxes me without making me feel heavy and it&#39;s damn tasty. I didn&#39;t really get a harsh smoke though, I did use a water pipe so that may have smoothed out the smoke.

VStarts with heady sativa effects similar to Jack Herer, and eventually the effects tapper off and you feel relaxed in the body. Overall not a bad strain, taste is superb for vaporization and smoking.\u000a\u000aNeeds lower tolerance revisit.

VWonderful sativa dominant hybrid, if you like Jack Herer but want a more mellow experience this is for you. You\u2019ll feel the sativa heady effects initially and eventually soon after the comforting body relaxation sets in. Appearance &amp; taste are undeniably great as well.

VPurple Jack,\u000a\u000a Offers a really nice feeling of euphoria and the occasional buzzing sensation. A little disorientation is to be expected but, not too bad. However, the chills and some dry mouth may cause a few drawbacks... \u000a\u000aMy over all the experience of smoking Purple Jack is a good one. \u000a\u000aA 7of10
