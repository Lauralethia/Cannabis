VNew favorite indy. I picked up a little sac of this with a buddy not that long ago and didn&#39;t know much what to expect. It hits HARD we lit up the first bowl with a third friend who had never smoked before and got a good light toasting in. After say 20 minutes we decided a second bowl was needed as we wanted to try and get out friend high her first time. Once we packed that second bowl it was all over, the maybe 40 yard walk back to our building felt like more that a mile. Our friend the first timer was giggling by the we made it up the stairs barely able to lift her feet each stair step. Afghani provides an all over relaxing, couch melting, heavy ass high. It was almost a little like being drunk without as much sloppiness. The indica body high is so strong it lulls your mind into a cozy little realm of relaxation and overall calm. I would 10/10 smoke and buy this  again.

VEveryone grows this around here so I smoked good Afghani and shitty Afghani. I think It&#39;s no need to write long description about this. Smoke too much and you&#39;ll wake up the next day without any idea of how you fell asleep or take a one huge hit and you&#39;ll feel like a Terminator. And if I can help you, NEVER smoke this from Hookah, it will destroy you like a lil&#39; bitch. It&#39;s classic for me and I recommend this to everyone. This strain is a real Killa.\u000a\u000aTaste - I don&#39;t like this kind of taste but still it&#39;s weed so np with that.\u000aSmell - Always blow my nose.\u000aEffects - Best painkiller I&#39;ve ever smoked.

VOut of all the strains I have had so far for my insomnia, this is by far the best. I started vaping about an hour before I went to sleep. Normally I suffer from restless leg syndrome from a medication I take, but with this.. I just felt my whole body relax and felt my head just melt into the pillow. I woke up this morning feeling very well rested! I only woke up once during the early morning hours (Thanks, to my jerk cat) but I was able to go back to sleep instantly. Love this strain! Highly recommend.

VTo me, this is definitely a quality strain, and the first 100% Indica strain I&#39;ve had. The high is pretty heavy and it takes over the body, so I use this strain after work or before I go to bed. However, if you&#39;re smoking this strain, be warned that too much in one sitting can be a bit much (for me it was); standing up I got extremely dizzy and had to stop smoking, sitting down I drift off for what could be a few minutes, so just know this is definitely a relax-type strain. \u000a\u000aI also get EXTREMELY hungry on this strain, so I use it to treat my nausea/digestive issues, which is the reason I got my medical card.\u000a\u000aAs much as I love this strain, it is a bit strong for me to smoke on a regular basis, as I&#39;ll usually fall asleep and won&#39;t get to enjoy the high, so this will be a strain I&#39;ll only go for on certain occasions.

VThis is the best I&#39;ve had so far for insomnia. It&#39;s a heavy indica, excellent for sleep, also helped relax muscles tight from a back injury (smoke this plus IcyHot = heaven for pulled muscles!). It&#39;s very good for people suffering from high anxiety who carry a lot of their stress around in the body. I did have some dizzyness from it but nothing severe. I wouldn&#39;t smoke this as a day-time weed unless you want to sleep. It&#39;s not good for getting stuff done.

VI am so thankful I got to try this when a little bit rolled through my town. The leaves were an orange-brown colour, the bud was practically orange and yellow, and the trichomes were green and whitish/yellow. Very sexy looking ! I had 2 large bong hits and a small joint .. it wasn&#39;t long after until I passed out. All I remember was that it was potent as fuck, reminded me of how I felt on codeine, and that it was going to be perfect for my insomnia and moderate pain I was experiencing. It was awesome

VFirst observation is that it\u2019s absolutely stellar for video games! Initial part of the high is very strong and almost overwhelming in a good way (like Fire OG). Where it really excels is by dialing up how fun and engaging gaming is - it\u2019s an utter blast! Separately, watching a Seth Rogen stoner comedy on this made me feel like I was in their exact same mental state. Strong, trippy disassociation while your sense of humor and enjoyment are heightened. I\u2019ve tried hundreds of strains with movies and I wouldn\u2019t choose any other for this genre.

VIt was during a pilgrimage through the Hindu Kush Mountain range when I met an old mystic. He taught me the art of telekinesis and told stories of the ancient ones. We entered the main temple room. Seated in the lotus position, standing 45 feet tall was a, no not &quot;a,&quot; &quot;the&quot; statue of the Green Goddess. The same goddess who traveled from the  Sirius to Earth with an experimental herb capable of positively affecting the evolutionary path of mankind.  \u000a\u000aThe mystic and I sat in meditation before the giant organic being. A wooden pipe appeared from the old man&#39;s hemp sleeve. He handed me the pipe with two hands and a bow and said, &quot;The spirits, they are in the smoke. It is they, who will take you to find what you seek.&quot; We each took three ceremonious hits. The mystic continued, &quot;You are starting to feel relaxed and sleepy.&quot; &quot;Yes, yes I am.&quot; &quot;Trust that you will not fall asleep and miss the experience. The euphoria will soon set in. It&#39;s there to remind you to smile, fore life is a dance and Cannabisia is wherever you want it to be.&quot;

VRelaxing without being sedative, a great combo. Feel I can smoke and smoke and not get sleepy. Very clear-headed and focused, but a creative free-associative headspace is still accessible. Took 7-8 small bong rips, went for a run, ended up going longer than expected. Headspace became very altered. Took another 7-8 small bong rips, did some work with a repetitive strain injury. The Afghani gives me a clear body sense, easy to work with pain/injury.

VNow we are getting to my favoured Landrace strain of pain numbing Cannabis.  I first had grown my first Afghani in 1980 in North Vancouver where I had a one of my latest indoor grow of the time with 60 plants equally divided between Afghani and Skunk my original favoured to this day.\u000aThe Afghani I grew to seven feet as my roof was twelve feet then I was then vegging nearly three months to get the height wanted as C. Afghanica is usually about a six footer, but very bushy three plants finishing per light. \u000aI used my Afghani as a hash maker yielding black goodie super yummy hash, which I was rare to share this treasure. This remains on of the most tricombed striants of Cannabis I have ever known!

VThis strain was very popular years ago in my area (and in high school iirc..) before I used Leafly, and was such a well known and ubiquitous strain I just never really thought to bother with a review of this particular strain- until, a recently gifted specimen of some delicious, beauuuutiful, indoor Afghani was gifted to me by my Pops.\u000a\u000aNow I have a lot of anxiety issues and panic attack type of problems, and sometimes heavy (and rather embarrassingly on occasion, even NOT that heavy sometimes) Sativas and Sativa-dominant strains will often rocket right into being \u201cUncomfortably Numb\u201d in a big way.\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019m just very big into that super cool, far out, stoney, groovy, righteousness is Indicas. Ahhh hells yusssss. \u000a\u000aAnd man this was the first time in a LONG time since I\u2019d had some good, purple, STICKY Afghani, and it just really reminded me everything I love so much about Indica strains. Not quite couch locked, just... relaxed, feelin\u2019 smooth, feelin\u2019 goooooood maaaan. Like I\u2019m sinking into a warm jacuzzi or something like that. \u000a\u000aHad some gnarly ass munchies, killed an obscene amount of fuggin\u2019 milkshakes... I regretted that in the morning but hey, the future\u2019s uncertain and The End is always near! \u23f3&#128065;\u2620\ufe0f\u26b0\ufe0f&#128511;&#127761;\u231b\ufe0f

Pain all but gone (3). Sucked that some of it was still there but o boy was there wonderful pain relief! Dis one definitely a sleeper. Don&#39;t expect to get much done but sleep! Body high &amp; head high were very nice. But not the best; may have a pretty good tolerance goin on by now. I would recommend for lighter use peeps for nighttime use for pain/nausea/insomnia.

VRelaxing without being sedative, a great combo. Feel I can smoke and smoke and not get sleepy. Very clear-headed and focused, but a creative free-associative headspace is still accessible. Took 7-8 small bong rips, went for a run, ended up going longer than expected. Headspace became very altered. Took another 7-8 small bong rips, did some work with a repetitive strain injury. The Afghani gives me a clear body sense, easy to work with pain/injury.

It was a body relaxation but not sleepy or couch locked.  Within about 30 minutes I felt ready for bed, again not crashing tired just that it was time to get ready and go to bed.

VA true delight from the east, Afghani will not disappoint those looking for a soothing, blissful relaxation. After being a lover and regular consumer of strains like King Louis XIII and Northern Lights, which are descended from Afghani genetics, I felt I needed to try the real thing. My experience exceeded my expectations. Afghani packs a sedating heavy indica punch that will obliterate pain and anxiety..Mannnn I&#39;m thankful I found this. Smoked before writing this, and now I&#39;m ready for a rejuvenating night of deep sleep. I feel like a bear in hibernation tucked away cozily deep within the mystical mountains of ancient Afghanistan. I had some valuable self reflection/introspection while on this strain as well, uplifting my mindset with positivity before lulling me to sleep.

VNow we are getting to my favoured Landrace strain of pain numbing Cannabis.  I first had grown my first Afghani in 1980 in North Vancouver where I had a one of my latest indoor grow of the time with 60 plants equally divided between Afghani and Skunk my original favoured to this day.\u000aThe Afghani I grew to seven feet as my roof was twelve feet then I was then vegging nearly three months to get the height wanted as C. Afghanica is usually about a six footer, but very bushy three plants finishing per light. \u000aI used my Afghani as a hash maker yielding black goodie super yummy hash, which I was rare to share this treasure. This remains on of the most tricombed striants of Cannabis I have ever known!

VThis strain was available for a limited time at one dispensary in town and was described as a relaxation strain with little to no head high.  The first time I tried this, about 1 hour before bed time, was amazing.  I truly did not feel much if any head high but immediately felt relaxed.  It was a body relaxation but not sleepy or couch locked.  Within about 30 minutes I felt ready for bed, again not crashing tired just that it was time to get ready and go to bed.  Got ready, went to bed and fell asleep easily and slowly.  Slept probably the best I have in years!  This strain, although not available anymore, is one that I will stock up on next time I can get it.  It was truly the best bed time, sleep aid I have ever had.

I&#39;m a Washington medical patient. I&#39;ve been smoking daily for a little more than a year now and this has to be my least favorite strain i&#39;ve ever tried. May just be a bad batch but it made me feel like shit. Staying away from Afghani from now on. 5/10

VI have low tolerance and one toke of this was pleasant. I would say it is medium in strength. It made me feel cerebral, contemplative, and calm. Good for relaxation and currently one of my favorites.\u000a\u000aNot a strain to take in at large doses at a time, but small doses make for a nice experience that can really be felt in the calming of the body. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for doing work. It seems to lean more towards the lazy side.

VI love the smell.. Very deep hashish. For those that aren&#39;t familiar with hashish, then I would compare it to some kind of dark coffeish smell. The buds are themselves very dark, and could be mistaken for schwag if not for the exotic smell. The buzz is very relaxing, and puts you in a good mood. Not exactly the best for going shopping at the mall, but excellent for playing video games. And you can still enjoy conversations with people on it, just as long as your butts glued to the couch : )

Va little goes a long way, it&#39;s super strong, so start small. it takes a bit longer than other strains to hit me, a full 3-5min, which tempts me to smoke more, but I get nauseous and anxious if I overdo it, so just be patient! it&#39;s both a cerebral and body high that makes you happy, carefree, sleepy, and a bit horny.

VSmell is very distinguishable. Taste is interesting and smoke is fairly thin. Due to the density, bowls tend to last a lot longer than expected and due to the high THC content, it is a resin producer. Great for any kind of chronic pain or just to relax after a hard days work. Looks great, very distinguishable crystals, especially if grown with limited mold or indoor.

VI&#39;ve been slowly acclimating myself to indica&#39;s over the past couple of years after staying in the sativa camp for most of my stoner career. Afghani is one of the indica strains that has stuck out to me as it has a very unique taste/smell and heavy sedative effects. This is one of the most unique smelling flowers I&#39;ve had; nothing smells quite like it. It&#39;s taste is predominantly earthy with just a tinge of menthol and sweetness in the background. I really can&#39;t compare it to anything else out there, other sweet, earthy strains are much more candy-like than this is. The bud is fluffy, fat and pale with some orange hairs. The heavy effects will creep up on you. It brings about a pronounced sense of meditative relaxation with just a hint of euphoria to keep you focus. This is a fantastic all around strain and I would highly recommend it for someone who needs something heavy but still relatively functional. This strain adds to my perception that some of the best cannabis strains in the world are what mother nature provided herself.

VBy far my favorite Indica. Me and my friend bought an eighth of it this last week and we smoked one bowl and I got hit hard. Got a very substantial head buzz and directly went inside. \u000a\u000aAfghani seems to me like a very powerful sleep-inducing strain and it also makes me pretty hungry. \u000a\u000aWe smoked with our friend who had never smoked before and she got quite high and we all enjoyed the fuck out of the Babadook. Afterwards we all passed out heavily and I was still tired when I woke up the next day. I wouldn&#39;t recommend smoking the night before you have to wake up early, but overall a very nice, buzzy high.

VJust used this one for the first time a few hours ago and it was pretty good. Just remember that it&#39;s very high in THC, so if you have a bad tolerance like I do, expect it to hit you hard. Otherwise, it worked really well with making me sleepy and was okay for pain relief. \u000aI also have severe social anxiety, typically after I use cannabis I will seclude myself in order to avoid said anxiety. However with this strain it didn&#39;t amplify my anxiety like other high THC strains usually do. \u000aI rated 4 star simply because I don&#39;t enjoy being high and with something this strong it&#39;s hard to gauge how much to take. \u000a\u000aTLDR: If you enjoy being high, need help sleeping and / or have a substantial amount of pain, consider this a five star product.

Rolled it up with some white-grape, white owl tobacco wrap and man... damn, is all I can honestly say. Definitely did the job, I&#39;m so mellow and any physical pain has been sedated. Not to mention the sweet euphoric effect that accompanies the strain. If you can locate a strain with -AFGHANI- in it, get your hands on it! You won&#39;t regret it, trust me[:

VThis is on the weaker side of what I&#39;m used to. That being said, it is great to gradually intake over time to counter anxiety and paranoia that can come from the stronger stuff that can clobber you over the head. If you are trying to condition yourself to get past becoming paranoid and anxious when you smoke weed, this should help nicely. Smoke a hit or two , wait 10 mins, rinse and repeat until you are where you need to be. SUPER low anxiety strain if you do it this way. But for seasoned tokers, there are much better strains than this one once for ounce. \u000aOk, I have to add to this review after giving it another week or so...especially since this is too much to ignore. Not only does this strain actually make me horny, but it physically makes me tight in the bathing suit area. Like middle school math class. As in, I&#39;d rather take an &quot;F&quot; than walk up to the board right now.

Scent reminds me of a Christmas tree. Deep indica high, and strong at 22.4%. More than the usual amount of CBD also, at 0.41%. Good price, just $37 for a quarter after the tax...The only tax I don\u2019t mind paying. Recommended. #IndicaStrainOfTheWeek #WeedPorn

VBody buzz?  I\u2019ve been reading about different strains causing a body buzz, so I\u2019d try them and...nothing.  Well, fast forward to yesterday when I FINALLY found some afghani here in Denver.  Smoked one huge hit from a bowl (I\u2019ve a very low tolerance) and HOLY CRAP!  I\u2019ve never feel like that before!  It seriously felt as if I was on a boat amid small waves.  My body literally felt like it was bobbing up and down in the water.  Very little paranoia, which I am prone to.  Extreme couch-lock.  I slipped into one of the deepest sleeps of my life.  I\u2019m headed back to the dispensary today to pick up more of this before it\u2019s gone.  Wow!  Definitely give this a try if you\u2019ve the chance.  10/10

VI&#39;ve been slowly acclimating myself to indica&#39;s over the past couple of years after staying in the sativa camp for most of my stoner career. Afghani is one of the indica strains that has stuck out to me as it has a very unique taste/smell and heavy sedative effects. This is one of the most unique smelling flowers I&#39;ve had; nothing smells quite like it. It&#39;s taste is predominantly earthy with just a tinge of menthol and sweetness in the background. I really can&#39;t compare it to anything else out there, other sweet, earthy strains are much more candy-like than this is. The bud is fluffy, fat and pale with some orange hairs. The heavy effects will creep up on you. It brings about a pronounced sense of meditative relaxation with just a hint of euphoria to keep you focus. This is a fantastic all around strain and I would highly recommend it for someone who needs something heavy but still relatively functional. This strain adds to my perception that some of the best cannabis strains in the world are what mother nature provided herself.

VI have been using various strains to treat my chronic insomnia. I have used PK, BSR, KOS, and a few other heavy Indica&#39;s. This AFG has been the best so far. I highly recommend it for treating insomnia. \u000aThe flavor is mild, classic, no cough at all. I use it in CO2 oil form.\u000aGreat strain!

VMy favorite MaryJane origin. The ideal strain to sedate efficiently for a moment with nothing much to do than be very quiet. To be honest this is perfect if you want to stare at your bedsheet or maybe your wrist... Or your hand. Anyway don&#39;t worry it&#39;s ok, it&#39;s pungent, you are well, hold o... Zzzz.

Va little goes a long way, it&#39;s super strong, so start small. it takes a bit longer than other strains to hit me, a full 3-5min, which tempts me to smoke more, but I get nauseous and anxious if I overdo it, so just be patient! it&#39;s both a cerebral and body high that makes you happy, carefree, sleepy, and a bit horny.

VOK... Here&#39;s the thing: I vaped this after a long plane ride hoping it would knock me out and take away the symptoms of jet lag. It kind of did. I felt like I had popcorn cooking in my heart and my swollen ankles were like... pulsating in a good way. I give this 3 stars because while it did eventually knock me out it did not take away the body pain I was experiencing.

VI have low tolerance and one toke of this was pleasant. I would say it is medium in strength. It made me feel cerebral, contemplative, and calm. Good for relaxation and currently one of my favorites.\u000a\u000aNot a strain to take in at large doses at a time, but small doses make for a nice experience that can really be felt in the calming of the body. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for doing work. It seems to lean more towards the lazy side.

VI use cannabis primarily for managing my anxiety, atopic dermatitis (eczema) and insomnia. This strain has proved to be amazing at helping me relax and get to sleep. It has an amazing calming earthy smell and as soon as I got a whiff I knew I was going to like it. I mainly vaped but I also used the ABV to make a tea with milk and honey and the tea proved to be absolutely amazing at helping me sleep. This strain is definitely for chilling out, if I vaped and then continued to try and focus hard I&#39;d get a headache.

I smoke a little while watching the tube which relaxes me and really helps with pain management and helps me get a good night&#39;s sleep. I use this and Northern Lights for my insomnia.

Due to the density, bowls tend to last a lot longer than expected and due to the high THC content, it is a resin producer. Great for any kind of chronic pain or just to relax after a hard days work.

VGreat for relaxation and pretty heavy effects come along with it. Get ready to chill on the couch or bed after a session. Definitely helps with pain and insomnia and the taste is awesome.

VI love the smell.. Very deep hashish. For those that aren&#39;t familiar with hashish, then I would compare it to some kind of dark coffeish smell. The buds are themselves very dark, and could be mistaken for schwag if not for the exotic smell. The buzz is very relaxing, and puts you in a good mood. Not exactly the best for going shopping at the mall, but excellent for playing video games. And you can still enjoy conversations with people on it, just as long as your butts glued to the couch : )

V5 yrs since I broke my neck * and this strain helps most of the time with calming down my mind so I can lose the tension in my shoulders. It has a warming effect for me, right where my inflammation is. Not sure if that&#39;s good or bad. It is usually slow-acting for me, and I have to either vaporize or smoke at least 2 rounds to get positive effects. \u000aIt&#39;s not too strong like other Indicas can get. No buzzy, vibrating feeling in the limbs. No tingly sensations. No arousal or spike of creativity. No overwhelming slam into the forehead. It can help with nausea by smoking, but not often. It is actually one of the only strains that helps me with nausea sometimes by just smelling the pressed buds. It is great for PMS. Helps cramps and pissed-off babes.\u000aOthers and I&#39;ve only had a few negatives with Afghani. One, it doesn&#39;t numb the pain enough for my situation. Two, it gives my husband headaches most of the time. And finally, it&#39;s just not the heavy hitter I was expecting.\u000aStill a great strain, especially for a social and night-time medication.

VI agree with the current average of this strain, 4.2. If you like hard-hitting indicas that have a tendency to put you on the couch, then this is definitely your baby.

VI find this strain makes me lazy if I&#39;m already resting; but on the move, it takes on a much &quot;dreamier&quot; high. Reminds me of stop-frame animation; or looking through serious fisheye. Almost like your floating. It hits in the forehead/upper lids region, making your face seem weighted with eyelid droop. Make sure you&#39;ve got a great beverage or snack as it&#39;s got a harsher taste with resulting drymouth. Not a great social strain, but the difference between movement and resting make it worth trying.

VTilray patient review here. This strain tastes awful. I tried the CBD variety of this strain. The effects were good. Nothing spectacular. It&#39;s more of a CBD high than a THC high. Mellowed me out a bit, killed some body pain, and reduced stress and anxiety. The reason I rated it so low wasn&#39;t because of poor quality. This strain tastes awful. I used a good quality vape and it doesn&#39;t matter. It tasted like bitter scorched earth, tar, fecal matter, and skunk (if that&#39;s your thing then I highly recommend it). If it wasn&#39;t for the terrible flavour I would have rated it higher. I enjoy the effects but I&#39;m glad I only purchased 5g to sample. It&#39;s going to take a while to get through it. I&#39;m probably going to have to blend it with something to cut that awful taste.

VI just gotta say about this strain it is a RESILIENT plant. I have grown it multiple years and it always does good. I had thieves nearly rip it out the ground, mess up its light cycle before taking it outside and it grew and grew great. Others i messed up the light cycle became worthless and had to replace EXCEPT afghani. Probably excellent for beginning growers or growers in not so great growing locations or climates

VThis is the first MJ I ever grown from seeds. It is a landrace from Afghanistan. Very dieases resisitence compare to other MJ got their leafs eaten by grasshoppers. But this is catepillar favorite weed in my case. Sensitive to bubs rot if flowering in moist late seasons (morning dew and raining in SoCal). This mature in about 60~90 days. Sweet Cedar/Pine like odor. Thick woody smoke/smooth taste. Compact buds with large sepal but the actual bud r small compare to SFV OG Kush.\u000a\u000aStrong body high. Always want to go to sleep after 90 minuate or so. Slight head high and tingling on my face. This is the usual stone strongness I like. Very good for pain relief for my back inury.

VDepending on who the grower was or if they cured and grew properly. Assuming they have and have a good pheno this can be some of the strongest Indica ever! Each dispensary seems to have different levels of it depending on the grower like with any strain still hard to mess this one up. Very easy to grow , short stout plant very vigorous. Needs at least a 3 week veg imo. Grown organically with a 10-15 day dry with 55 % relative humidity then cured for a minimum of 15 days, best around 45 days. It&#39;s hard to rate these landrace bred strains because of all the variations out there today. It&#39;s a stable strain so the norm should be a 5 star rating. Good for beginners or novice grower(not toker) lol. If you suffer from any type of pain this is good medication very narcotic has to be a top medical strain and breeding strain

VHad a few bowls of this along with some Blue Oyster. One of the best highs I ever had. Got me super giggly along with some munchies which I think were more from the Blue Oyster. After I got home from Subway all I wanted to do was chill on the couch. I didn&#39;t get much cottonmouth at all which was pretty awesome. This is a must try strain.

VI wasn&#39;t too impressed with this strain. The buds looked great, but upon opening the container I was first disappointed by the smell. The scent was nothing more than a faint spice. Not a trace of dank aroma whatsoever.  Not what I would expect for $15 per gram. The smoke was a bit harsh, and the taste was virtually nonexistent.  The effect was a fairly relaxing body high. Minimal, if any, head high. I purchased 3 grams of Afghani. Minus one bowl full, the remainder will sit in a glass jar to be saved for hard times. I would not recommend this strain to anyone looking for more than a moderate body high.

VPersonally, I smoke both medically and recreationally. I have came a-crossed Afghani on two different occasions and both times were very different from one another. The first time I smoked afghani it was a very well grown and potent batch. Tested at around 28% and it smelt up the whole house the millisecond I cracked open the jar. The second time I purchased Afghani it was like a totally different strain. Tested at 23% which is still really potent but the buds were fluffy and smelt like a ordinary plant not even how bud usually smells. This strain during the day is very relaxing and is good for anxiety and depression. But, this strain during night is a one punch KO. Don\u2019t expect to be doing anything productive besides having the best nights sleep of your life. I rated this strain a 3/5 only because how much of a indica it is (95/5 or 100) and trust me I\u2019m a indica lover but sometimes smoking a full indica during the day isn\u2019t the best idea lol night time use only.
