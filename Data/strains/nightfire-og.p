VLet me level with you for a sec, so I&#39;m home alone, got the blunt and the Night Fire. The guy I got it from was mentioning other strains when all I could see was &quot;Night Fire&quot; I&#39;m thinking this is the stuff 007 blazes before every mission. So, I do what I do I light up that dank weed o&#39; mine and turn on some wu tang. By the time I got to Brooklyn Zoo it hit me. The cosmos extended it&#39;s hand to me and I said, &quot;no&quot; and flew away. All in all, I was satisfied immensely. The taste wasn&#39;t my personal favorite, but the high more than made up for that.

VA super crystally, sativia dominant conversation starter that works quickly.  This is a great strain for social settings or for a long list of to-do&#39;s!  Tasty sativa that smells like citrus girl scout cookies.  A perfect morning strain, even better when I mix a high CBD strain such as AC/DC to take the edge off.

VThis is my first review ever as a medical marijuana patient. I am prescribed this medicinal plant for chronic pain. I purchased this at a top shelf price and expected a lot out of it. At low doses it definitely helps with pain and can be a bit much in the category of cognitive function. I just smoked a really large joint of it mixed with something with common lineage to blue dream and dear god.. At large doses it is near psychedelic.. I also use cannabis to assist in meditation practice. My body has been buzzing for 30 minutes after just 20 minutes of meditation. I feel renewed. This is definitely in the category of antidepressant / stress relief

Vthe strain i received is from sirius. states it is an indica with 22.6% thc. slow high. did not feel the body high of an indica so i believe sirius might have mislabelled, possibly a hybrid.

VNightfire og by trail blazin isn\u2019t for me. The name got me excited and didn\u2019t bother to look at it. When I did I was surprised how weak it looked. Barely any visible trich, dull greenish beige loose nugs with dark orange scraggly hairs. A bit leafy and the dark green leaves are scraggly as well. Smells very spicy with a hint of lemon and wood. Taste is bland, mostly woody with a hint of pepper. Effects are slightly relaxed at first and then a short lived blast of euphoria. A slight happiness replaces the euphoria as the relaxation becomes sedation. Over doing it, i felt tingly in my head and really dizzy. My vision had tracers going on, something I really dislike. I don\u2019t recommend this cut. I\u2019d like to try another growers nightfire og.

VYes please... Wow, picked this up in a $50 an 1/8th tin. I hate to spend that much on reefer, but , i hate to say it, its the best bud ive smoked in some time. Heavy head hitter after 1 hit out of a small bowl. Great taste great smell, i grew up on 35$ oz&#39;s, so paying 50 for 3.5 grams is hard, but hey, it aint 1980 anymore. \u2714 it out
