VHarlequin is a great strain that is high in CBD&#39;s. It quickly alleviates the pain in my body (knees and lower back) and allows me to function at 100% without the cloudiness of other strains. It has also helped with nausea. I highly recommend everyone have some in their medicine cabinet.

VHarlequin* loves the gym!  I just got done with leg day, and let me tell you: fantastic.  I didn&#39;t lift as much as I normally do because my heart rate was elevating more quickly than I&#39;m used to.  However, my post-lifting yoga routine was EPIC.  (skip to the end if you aren&#39;t a yoga enthusiast) I locked into a great prana unusually quickly and maintained it throughout the routine even though the gym was playing rap music and gym music in general is a huge distraction for me.  \u000aI feel like a Dr Bronner&#39;s soap bottle right now.  All full of calm energy and fucking love, damnit.\u000a*This is my second review of this strain.  This Harlequin was purchased from Portland Best Buds and is far, far superior.

VMy grandma tried different pharmaceuticals, different types of medicine nothing was helping her with bone and nerve pain. Trying Cannabis was a BIG No No for her as she grew up believing that cannabis was known to be a drug that kill humans...anyway her pain has been so extremely that she decided to give it a try, she tried a few different strains but she found the psychoactive effect to strong she decided to stop UNTIL this magical Harlequin strain, she was so happy because her pain disappeared and she didn&#39;t feel &quot;dizzy&quot; and she was in a good mood all day she went for a walk and that is a big thing for her.

VSo I have Bipolar 2 Disorder and I use marijuana to help ease the anxiety and depression I get from my bipolar. It&#39;s been really hard for me to find a good strain because THC kicks ass as an antidepressant but gives me anxiety and it also makes it to hard for me to think and stuff. On the other hand CBD destroys benzos when it comes to relieving anxiety, but it doesn&#39;t really give you the feel good feeling you need for lifting a depression. This strain is kind of the best of both worlds because the THC will work on my depression and the cbd will work on my anxiety at the same time and the CBD cancels out almost all of the negative cognitive effects that usually accompany THC. Overall this is by far my favorite strain and I really just can&#39;t comprehend how some people are still against using marijuana medically. This plant has given me my life back from bipolar disorder and has allowed me to work  a part time job, go to school full time (I&#39;m a pre med student at UCSD), and have a completely normal social life and before I could have none of these things.

VThis strain is primarily used for pain management - not getting high. However, I find that I get really high when I smoke enough of it; and the high is really euphoric. It has a higher content of CBD than THC. CBD&#39;s act on a different brain receptors than that of THC. It&#39;s an antagonist of a protein receptor called GPR55, which is found to be associated with memory; therefore you will not have the usual memory loss that comes with THC. It also acts on Serotonin so its good for depression as well. Studies have also proven that CBD&#39;s reduce the growth of breast cancer cells. I don&#39;t mean to get all science-y but if your interested..

VBrief history of myself and marijuana before I begin with the review.\u000a\u000aI started smoking cannabis Junior year in High School.  We probably smoked every other day.  This was with close friends.  We smoked A LOT!  Usually blunt size cigars filled with cannabis.  We usually had a good time.  Laughed, got hungry, socialized etc.\u000a\u000aHowever, soon after high school was over, the high started effecting me differently.  Unfortunately, in a bad way.  I started getting anxiety, paranoia, sad thoughts about life changing, loosing friends etc.  It didn&#39;t happen every time I smoked but started happening more regularly.  Same with some of my closest friends.  They started not enjoying the high.  Would make them uneasy with themselves.  Insecure, anti-social etc.\u000a\u000aLong story short, I quit smoking weed because of this.  Years went by.  I would occasionally smoke when the opportunity prevented itself to give it another shot but it would always bring me back to the bad high.  \u000a\u000aI didn&#39;t understand what had happened.  Was it the weed?  Was it me?  Was it just life?  What was going on.  I was almost certain it was the weed because a lot of my friends also gave up the habit because it gave the same effect on them.  \u000a\u000aI didn&#39;t want to give up.  About the time I turned 25 I looked into getting a weed card.  Because I have a history of right knee-pain, it was quite easy to get.  After getting the card I hit up a couple dispensaries.  Never before had I seen such a selection right before me.  I was excited because I thought this will definitely help me track down the right stuff if anything would.\u000a\u000aWell, unfortunately, the high on all the stuff I tried was again, the same.  Gave me a super head high with unstoppable negative thoughts.  You see, I kinda think too much as it is, so when I smoke weed that is highly psychoactive, it really puts me in hyper mode of thinking, which overwhelms me, them brings me to anxiety.  I needed a weed that brought me down.  I tested and smoked indica&#39;s, sativa&#39;s, hybrids.  All with pretty much the same results.\u000a\u000aI still like to go out and socialize at parties, bars etc.  But I kinda want to get away from alcohol.  It&#39;s really not good for you and always give me a hangover the next day.   BLAHHHH\u000a\u000aI&#39;m 28 years old now.  I started doing some research about marijuana and stumbled upon CBD&#39;s.  Never heard of it before.  I only knew of the main ingredient THC.  I read that almost all the breeders that grow marijuana today, grow it for maximum THC.  The problem is by doing this it almost eliminates all the CBD content.  CBD&#39;s, I read, are responsible for cancelling out the negative effects of THC...like anxiety, paranoia etc.   It&#39;s sort of a Yin Yang relationship.  You kinda want a 50/50 match of both in your strains.\u000a\u000aI read Harlequin was a good strain but very rare to find.\u000a\u000aEven with my cannabis permit, I had to search many dispensaries up here in Seattle, until I found one that had it.  I shot up there and bought a couple grams.\u000a\u000aI rolled a couple small-medium size joints out of it.  The joints were sitting in my house for a good couple weeks.  I couldn&#39;t really develop enough courage to smoke them because I was afraid it would bring me right back to the unwanted feelings.  \u000a\u000aWell last night I met up with a close friend that I&#39;ve known through the years since high school.  He was actually one of my old pot smoking friends.  \u000a\u000aWe went out to a bar in Des Moines, WA.  After a couple drinks (beers) I asked if he wanted to try a rare strain that is suppose to not produce anxiety.  He was a little reluctant but I talked him into it.  We went out to my car and lit up the joint I had prepared.  We smoked the whole thing.  Probably got 5 good hits each.  \u000a\u000aWalking back into the bar I could feel a little bit of the unwanted feelings coming in, but it was different.  It was easier for me to dismiss them.  We went back to our seats at the bar top and started sipping the rest of our beer.  Over the course of the next hour I must say we had quite the good time.  We had some good laughs.  Me, at times, came to tears with laughter.  I&#39;m pretty sure everyone at the bar top knew we were high.  Actually, I know the bartenders did, because she said &quot;you guys smell good&quot; and gave us a little grin.\u000a\u000aI can&#39;t say I really cared though.  Like I said, I could feel a slight feeling of the bad side, but it was easy to push back.  It must of been the high CBD content.  I can&#39;t say I was overly open to strangers but I did engage with the bartenders and the few people I did talk to, I jived with.  \u000a\u000aAt a couple times, I said a joke, and I guess I was either the only one that got it, or the only one that thought it was funny.  I laughed...and I laughed HARD at my own joke.  But other people didn&#39;t.  But again, I didn&#39;t care.  I was sorta in my own world and didn&#39;t get effected by outside input.\u000a\u000aI am excited to try Harlequin again.  Next time, I&#39;m going to smoke maybe just 3 good hits without the alcohol before hand and see where it puts my head.\u000a\u000aBut for the time being, I like the results we got from Harlequin :-)\u000a\u000a

VIf your looking to get high this may not be the best choice.  When it comes to relieving pain and being clear headed this is perfect!  This strain has replaced over a dozen pharmaceuticals taken for a spinal injury.  my pain level on narcotics stayed at a 9, with Harlequin only the pain is consistently down to a 3 or 4.  The best strain for migraines as well.  I used to require a walker or cane to walk 100 feet at a time.  With Harlequin I no longer need assistance in walking back to work again walking miles every day.  I now grow my own Harlequin making up most my plant count as its very hard to find sold in dispensaries.  I have not seen Harlequin in any local dispensaries.  best used as a concentrate.

VI made an account just to write this. I have had too many bad anxiety related panics with too many flowers in the course of my life. Harlequin is nothing like any other flower. No panic, no anxiety, just relaxation without that lead-limbed, can&#39;t move stone every other bud delivers. \u000a\u000aI can usually only take one hit and I have to lie down (super lite weight). With Harlequin, I took three and walked about a half a mile and listened to podcasts and never once felt nervous. \u000a\u000aLove this strain, will definitely purchase it again!

VMinty fresh buds enhance my morning dose of CBD so I can focus and get things done. A bit of pain killing thc allows for a productive day where three months ago I could barely walk a mile and now I walk five, come home to work on my home renovation which includes managing over a decade of neglect. This while losing weight and having a social life free of post traumatic stress, social anxiety and deep depression. Type 2 diabetes is compromising my vision, hence a residual motivation for cannabis. Clear mind elevation bordering on glee, especially if enjoying this prior to physical activity, especially sex. Cerebral activities are well enhanced with this wonderful &quot;thinker&#39;s weed&quot;. EV\u000a

VI was told that I should try Harlequin, by my brother who like me has Epilepsy. and for the first time in my life I had an Aura before having a grand-mal seizure this Strain has helped me more than any that I have ever tried to date.It is the main pain killer I use for my migraines since I can no longer take over the counter, they no longer work on me. My migraines get so bad that the pain was lasting all day long and nothing would stop it. the first time I tried this for one of my migraines the pain was gone in 5 min. if you need a good pain killer and can&#39;t take over the counter stuff I would definitely suggest this one.

VWhen I first read about Harlequin I knew I wanted to try it for my bipolar disorder. I have never tried a high CBD, low THC strain before this one, so I didn&#39;t know what to expect. Now that I&#39;ve used this strain for awhile, I can definitely tell you that it is amazing! I can see now how CBD and THC work together to help a range of illnesses. \u000a\u000aWhen I smoke Harlequin I feel very clear headed, focused, energetic (not too energetic, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend this before bed), uplifted, happy, relaxed, no anxiety whatsoever, and stress free. I don&#39;t have physical pain, but I can see where this would help with that. This strain definitely helps me with my disorder and I love everything about it. If you want stronger effects, just consume more of it. You can still get a great high with it if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for, only no anxiety associated with it, and added benefits. Harlequin might not have the best taste to it, but that doesn&#39;t matter to me. I want something that works and this is it! I have found a great addition to my other medications. Thank you, Harlequin!!

VHigh CBD strain. This is not your average high. It is more like taking a vicodin. One of the best CBD strains I have tried. Great for pain and sleep. I have heard CBD is what cancer cells have receptors for in recent research and they are finding can help cure some forms of cancer. These CBD strains you have to try, but expect a mellow different kind of high. Makes you horny too :).

VFinally got my hands on this wonderful flower.  I am a lightweight smoker and THC hits me very hard.  So I&#39;m always looking for a light herb to help with pain, stress, and anxiety.\u000aHarlequin does the trick.  It&#39;s not very heady at all and takes care of the conditions listed above.  As others have said, if you feel anxious or paranoid before you medicate, you won&#39;t, I didn&#39;t feel that way after.  Enjoy!

VI was introduced to Harlequin not too long ago, and I have to say that I&#39;m extremely impressed. My job basically consists of me working out for hours on end. A  bowl or two definitely helps with fatigue or the irritating feeling of lactic acid build up without feeling very much in the way of mental effects. I would recommend this strain to pretty much anyone who does manual labor for a living. :-)

The taste is mildly sweet and somewhat floral but the great hippie dippy CBD high is why Harlequin is always in my medicine cabinet.

VIf your looking to get baked this is not for you. However this is a focused relaxing not overwhelming herb. Almost zero psychoactive properties in harlequin and or harlequin tsu. I mix it with other strains that I like the good feelings but may not like the anxiety or other negative feelings they may cause. Ive found that mixing it takes the edge off of some other strains. Cbd seems to be a miracle if you like to smoke but cant handle the new high thc designer strains. Not the best tasting but a great filler for other strains. Also it does well by itself.

VHaving several dx causing severe chronic cervical pain, including pinched nerves, herniated C6, degenerative disc disease, cervical spinal stenosis and arthritis, I have been taking opioids for 2 years to control the pain. Currently on a 100mcg/hour Fentanyl transdermal patch and 20mg oxycodone for breakthrough, I really needed to find something safer that also worked.\u000a\u000aI researched for a week before deciding which strains to try and was very happy to find that Mother Earth carried the high CBD strain Harlequin. This plant is almost a perfect match to my ideal. Having very low THC content, I felt the tiniest bit in my head after smoking, but experienced a significant reduction in pain originating from my neck (at C6), through my shoulder, into my elbow and hand.\u000a\u000aIt bears noting that I have not smoked marijuana in 20 years so all strains effect me pretty strongly. However, Harlequin was very smooth and, while it didn&#39;t effect my head too much, it also didn&#39;t cause me to drift off to sleep. I was able to just relax without being distracted by pain. This will be a very nice strain to smoke during the day because it allows me to have pain relief without fogging my brain.\u000a\u000aThere are two things that I wasn&#39;t too happy with, but they are not deal breakers for me. I normally require 2 medium hits and Harlequin required 4 to achieve pain relief. Also, it only lasted about an hour and a half. Since it worked so well, this will be my go to herb until I find something that might last a little longer.

VThis strain is great... it&#39;s almost like smoking anti-dope. The buds themselves are tight and compact, with a piney smell. It&#39;s incredibly smooth to smoke. Where I might cough after big hits of something else, this stays down and does not irritate your lungs. Letting out that first hit, you can feel it creep across your jaw and head with almost a heat flash. This passes, and the focus sets in. It always clears my head. If have been smoking quite a bit of a high THC strain, this will pull me out and give me a great balanced high. Tons of focus and energy, and the painkilling qualities are pretty amazing. Great for a wake and bake and all day functional buzz.

VI absolutely love this strain. I searched all over to find it and try it out after reading all the reviews I&#39;d seen about it. I suffered a back injury about 14 years ago. I have blown discs, scoliosis, fusion of my lumbar vertebrae, and SI joint instability along with arthritis, and I was just recently told I may actually have rheumatoid arthritis, all of this in my lower back. I&#39;m only 36. I am typically a very active person. Hiking, running, etc. In the last few years, the pain has worsened and taken these things away from me. I have began to develop anxiety and depression with wondering how I am supposed to live with such debilitating pain. Does this strain take away all of my pain? No. Nothing will ever take it all away. But does it take enough of it away for me to take my dogs on walks or keep up with my two kids? Yes. It absolutely does. I have cried tears of joy over this amazing strain. Thank you to the creators of this wonderful strain.

VThis was a very clear headed, warm and tingly sort of high. There was a little bit of disassociation but it was not that bad at all. I had a good time on it. The loss of pain is fantastic. I was able to pick up 24 packs of coke and puppy chow -something that would normally be excruciating. It lasted around 4 hours for me the first half hour was a bit hazy, the second half hour my heart rate was elevated, the next two hours were pain free and very clear headed, then it tapered off nicely over the next hour. Wouldn&#39;t exactly call it a creeper though. Really liked this.

VHarlequin is high in CBD which is fantastic, but I personally sometimes don&#39;t mix too well with sativa-dominant strains. For the first 30 minutes Harlequin has a head high that can sometimes spin me into my anxiety, but once it moves into the body high, it&#39;s actually great. I have also wondered if cannabis is sometimes meant to help us dive down into some of our fear/anxiety to heal it. In any case, there&#39;s always a little &quot;processing&quot; for me at the start with Harlequin. Not my first choice high CBD strain, but I&#39;ll smoke it if it&#39;s around.

VA friend of mine grew this for some cancer patients he knew. They unfortunately all died within months of each other and he had a few pounds left over so knowing I was suffering from poverty brought on by disability, spinal cord injuries, PTSD, clinical depression, and that never ending pain from my back he gifted me a sizable portion.  It was such a blessing. It smokes smooth it doesn&#39;t smell up the place like a pine forest stuck in a skunks butt, and I can function on it. It gets me just high enough, smooths out the pain issues so I can function without aggravation and relaxes me when I start to have a panic attack. Truly a wonderful medicine. Not for stoner bros looking to chill and get wicked fried. This is an adult weed like a fine wine that is made to be savored and pleasing not a bottle of Ripple to get you ripped.

VMy friend grew a lovely variety of Harlequin. I have bi-polar disorder, depression, anxiety, and a fairly stressful life situation presently. This strain really calms me down and helps me feel at peace. After smoking about 3.5 bowls in a medium size pipe, my boyfriend and I were very playful, giggly, comfortable, and we had huge munchies. We also felt quite lovey-dovey touchy-feely. Surprisingly we weren&#39;t as horny as we are on some other strains, we were more playful, and we sat down and watched Smiley Face (which is an amazing movie when you&#39;re baked btw).   I love this strain. The munchies are so good that as I chew gum it is absolutely bursting with flavour long after the initial mint flavour has worn off; I can actually taste Harlequin very strongly, even after a very powerful mint. Highly recommended strain for stress/anxiety because it doesn&#39;t make me too goofy or philosophize until I&#39;m paranoid (which can, at times, admittedly be fun).

VGreat for anxiety! I can&#39;t handle THC due to it causing massive paranoia and anxiety for me. A few years ago I developed moderate to severe anxiety and depersonalization which can be very terrifying. It was hard for me to go out in public or hang out with friends sue to the anxiety. I just started vaping this strain after trying Cannatonic and Harlequin beats it for anxiety easily. \u000a\u000aAs soon as I start to feel an anxiety attack come on, and I feel like I don&#39;t have control over my body, I vape some of this and within minutes I&#39;m relaxed and back to feeling like me. This works faster than any conventional medication and is so much safer to use. if you have anxiety or panic attacks, please try this strain. It&#39;s a life saver!

VThis is EXACTLY what I&#39;ve been looking for!!!! Excellent pain relief and a wonderful body high from the neck down! No couch-lock, no la-la land (although that&#39;s great sometimes), no paranoia. Great earthy flavor but not too strong. This is real medicine for people who want relief while keeping their head on straight and want to be productive or carry a lucid conversation without getting stuck on the amazing sound and meaning of the word &quot;quench&quot;. Absolutely my new go-to!

VNew fave new fave NEW FAVE!  The best strain I&#39;ve tried in awhile.  The effects are marvelous - relaxed but not sleepy, calm and happy, uplifted and euphoric, but no paranoia (like a lot of sativas out there).  Harlequin is a keeper - if you come across it, buy some and then buy some more to keep in stock in your medicine cabinet because it is a pain reliever to the max. (If I could marry this strain....I probably wouldn&#39;t, but I&#39;d SERIOUSLY consider it)

VFinally this wonderful strain showed up in the retail weed world in Washington state.  The ratio was 5.75% thc and roughly 11% cbd.  This particular cut did wonders on my knee and shoulder post op scar tissue, arthritis and general aches.  It did possess a good enough sativa buzz to energize; which I assume is great for retail.  All and all great strain!

VEasily in my top 3 favorites for high CBD strains. Hell, let me rephrase that... Top 3 strains period! I suffer from extreme anxiety/ paranoia and this is the best I&#39;ve ever felt off of cannabis Rx . I was surprised to find this was more of a sativa base then Indica since most strong THC based sativa&#39;s just add to the paranoia. \u000a\u000a My particular lab tested batch is a whopping 18% CBD which was impressive to say the least.  This stuff is insanely sticky! Nice earthy smell and taste with a hint of pine and citrus notes. The head high is mild yet powerful. Very creative thought process and happiness seems to be never ending. The body high is almost euphoric...  My joints feel looser, Cramps and aches from work are diminished severely! Great for after a long day on the job or after a stressful day period. If you suffer from Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, Paranoia and Pain, I would be a horrible person for not recommending this strain! Kinda hard to come by in my area but 1,000X&#39;s worth it!

VAlthough this strain is not strong on body effects that you can feel immediately because of the high CBD content, I get a strong sense that it is helping me heal from inflammation over time. It does take quite a bit to bring on the subtle mind and body effects, which feel pleasant but not overbearing and provide some pain relief, but it was not a good choice for migraine relief. It did very little to relieve my migraine pain, and simply took the edge off rather than making it go away. It also made me feel incredibly sleepy and while sleeping I had a sensation of feeling my head pulse and pound from my migraine for a bit while in a semi conscious state. It was an insight into the way my migraines work because of the primal sort of awareness I had of my own body while I was high. \u000a\u000aI plan to continue to take this medicine because I am hoping it will help me keep my migraines in check as a preventative measure, but not a treatment for a flare up. As a side note, I didn&#39;t know the healing effects of CBD until I started researching it on PubMed and saw all of the studies verifying that CBD helps your body tremendously. I am taking this medicine as a preventative measure, and to feel an overall wellness effect. I could swear that its kept my appetite in check, and that I am losing weight because my body is less inflamed and overall happier since I started taking small puffs of this once a day.

VThis is a hard strain to evaluate the strength of, because it isn&#39;t that conventionally stoney.  Mentally, there&#39;s not that much of a sense of being &#39;high&#39;.  Coexisting with that, though there&#39;s some bodily sense of being completely blasted.   It&#39;s like there&#39;s a CBD aspect of a conventional weed&#39;s effect, and a THC aspect.  Harlequin has the CBD aspect beat all to hell, and is an utter wimp in the THC aspect.  So smoking this for the first time might be a strange experience, like it was for me.  \u000a\u000aThe effect on pain is really remarkable for something that feels like weird junk weed.  What&#39;s great about it is after the weenie little head high has petered out (maybe 15 minutes) the CBDs are still going strong for a couple more hours.  \u000a\u000aSometimes though I&#39;ve had Harlequin not work on pain at all, until I have a whiff of something higher in THC.  Then the pain relief will come in.  That&#39;s worth trying if Harlequin isn&#39;t making it for you.\u000a\u000aI haven&#39;t had this as a medible, tincture, or topical (or better yet RSO), but I think it would be fabulous this way.\u000a

VI am someone who frequently experiences anxiety and paranoia when using cannabis. Now that I live in a legal state I&#39;ve been able to try many different strains to figure out which ones I can and can&#39;t tolerate. After much experimentation I&#39;ve concluded that Harlequin is the ONLY one that I&#39;ve had consistently positive experiences with. Some others are hit and miss and some induced such awful anxiety the first time that I never tried them again.\u000aI highly recommend this strain for anyone looking to relieve anxiety. It&#39;s amazing!

VOk.  The Harlequin I have is from Ganja Goddess and was tested out at 7.3% thca and 10.7% CBD.  If it as listed on Leafly is 75% sativa dominant, in my strain it is more strongly indica.  \u000a\u000aSo I had just 2 hits from a rolled joint ( I&#39;m in the process of calibrating what&#39;s what for me) because previously I have had Schrom, Hawaiian dreams and some indica hybrids that I don&#39;t know as they were 2 years old and the label came off the cannister.\u000a\u000aHarlequin on 2 longish drags produced a high from 4:30 in the afternoon to about 9:30.  You can basically do what you want with Harlequin unlike some strains that control me like Hawaiian Dream (4% thca;14%cbd smoked waay too much)\u000a\u000aYou can go spacey like to the other side of the  universe stuff or watch TV while talking to yourself..  I practiced Qi Gong for what seemed like an hour with my eyes closed lying on a bed.\u000a\u000aI didn&#39;t really get a big sense of pain relief however, more like forgetting about it but nothing like nitrous oxide for example where your brain simply can&#39;t focus on pain.  With Harlequin it is still there just not as noticeable.\u000a\u000aI have had different strains that effect my sense of time either by making time quicken or slow.  With Harlequin you do something for what seems like an hour but if you check the time, only a few minutes have passed.  Harlequin slows down time. \u000a\u000aAlso no real appetite surge.  Not sleepy, very cerebral kind of high.  Just 2 hits.  No idea what planet I&#39;d go to on more but I&#39;m probably too new to weed after many years without to have much tolerance to it which I&#39;m trying to develop.\u000a\u000aMy favorite strain so far, many more to try.

VFirst and foremost, Harlequin is a purely medicinal strain, so if you&#39;re wondering why you aren&#39;t getting high it&#39;s because there ain&#39;t no THC in them nugs. Now, for those of us who happen to enjoy high CBD to THC and have a little more feel for the highly complex interaction between these two principle cannabinoids and their effect on our personal endocannabinoid system \u2013 gotta say, Harlequin is pretty rad! While sharing subtle similarities, it is also much different than something like Cannatonic. Last night I had a full Arizer Air bowl of pure Harlequin turned to the 2&#39;nd level heat setting of 374 degrees and noticed the muscle relaxation effects kick in almost immediately. Although, I will admit that knowing that I wouldn&#39;t get high whatsoever and not having a problem with that because I wasn&#39;t really in a getting-high kind of mood I started to feel bummed that I wasn&#39;t feeling high about halfway through the bowl. So, just now I mixed a half-and-half bowl of Harlequin and White Dawg and it was a whole different and very awesome experience culminating in the best of both worlds, high CDB - and high THC ratio! seriously, check out these test results from the labels on the bottles.\u000a\u000aHarlequin (Native Roots Edgewater): CBDA: 7.4% - 8.9% THCA: 4.43% -5.02% THC: 3.95% - 4.52%\u000aWhite Dawg (Lightshade 6&#39;th Avenue): THC: 0.56% THCA: 29.11% CBDA 0.94%\u000a\u000aIt is cool to feel how the high CBD has a regulatory checks and balances effect on THC. One minute you feel high, then the next you feel relaxed and completely sober; but still kinda high, but not high. It&#39;s a stoner&#39;s version of Schrodinger&#39;s cat, paradoxically you feel both high and not high. Oddly enough I&#39;d say that the THC has the better general anesthetic properties while the CBD has the better muscle relaxant effects and that you notice with a strong Indica. Typically something like White Dawg leans towards the kind of awesome paranoid/racey/spacey/creative kind of high that people can find unpleasant. With the inclusion of Harlequin this mystical effect was almost completely blocked in favor of a completely lucid sober yet still relaxed and stoned sensation of the White Dawg subtly below the surface.  What has sold me on the high CBD strains recently is for the past few years I&#39;ve dealt with TMJ issues from getting socked in the jaw during various forms of MMA training, snowboarding, and longboarding; plus a whole long list of sports injuries going back to childhood. Long story short,  sports beat the hell out of you and eventually you have a long list of kick-ass injuries. This is where high CBD strains happen to shine; old, nagging injuries tend to leave you in a state of constant tension and muscle guarding to avoid new injuries. CBD allows you to relax and let your muscles recuperate for a deliberately planned rest day and not another impromptu trail run or workout sesh.

Vvery underrated at anything under 4. never would have expected to even try a strain that did not brag of high THC levels, but was curious to see just how much &quot;pain relief&quot; a high CBD could offer. Happened to be a day of extreme lower back pain (more than the normal everyday pain) and was recommended by the tender to try this oil. Enjoyed a bit thru the day, chased it with Rare Darkness shatter, napped (after the darkness set in). When I woke after 45 minutes, my back felt better than it had it months. I will definitely buy this strain again. Very pleased with every aspect from taste, effect, and noticeable relief from pain. A winner in my opinion.

VI haven&#39;t been able to handle cannabis for a decade, as it makes me anxious, nauseous, paranoid, and gives me headaches (including CBD without THC.) Harlequin is my medicine. I never thought I would say that about cannabis or a Sativa. My symptoms: anxiety, depression, migraines, allergies, panic attacks, PTSD, neuropathic pain down my leg and foot from HSV, coccyx and pelvic pain. I recently followed inituition and asked a friend to smoke. Using muscle testing I picked out Harlequin. I&#39;ve been smoking a hit or two each day since. It reduces my anxiety and pain, it relaxes my whole body and mind, I have energy to stretch and practice yoga. I don&#39;t feel high or lose track of time. I&#39;m so excited about this medicine, and I look forward to acquiring a vape for this, to smoking before going running, and to see how my overall mind and body health is in a few months with daily use. Something interesting is that I lose my appetite with this.

VI just finished my first turn of this high CBD strain and I could not be happier. I have buds that were harvested early, just as the trichomes were reaching full cloudiness and others that were harvested when the trichomes were 30% amber. The differences are noticeable, but less so than I expected them to be. The playful energy this strain exudes is absolutely amazing. As it finished [growing] the smell was light with citrus tones that, in it&#39;s last days turned devilishly sweet. A smell not unlike being in a white grape vineyard just before harvest. The lab results on the buds harvested earliest show a 2:1 CBD to THC ratio and I don&#39;t expect that to change too much when I get the mature buds tested, though they will likely be more potent. When smoking this strain I have had a tendency to do chore-like activities that I would normally put off and, as an extension of that, people have noticed that I have become more thoughtful of them. For someone who typically has to fight through social anxiety and other pitfalls that come with having an above average IQ I, so far, find these qualities to be extremely helpful in my daily routine. Add in the inherent clear-headedness of a strong Sativa, this strains energetic and playful buzz and a lower psychoactive (THC) content and I think I have found a great daily driver here. Something I have found interesting is the amount of arousal this strain/phenotype is causing. As a dude I have never previously experienced a strain that has made me so... horny (sorry, but I want to alleviate any possible misconception of what I am talking about). After smoking for years and reading about lowered &#39;swimmer&#39; count and loss of desire I honestly didn&#39;t think marijuana was supposed to do that to guys.

VSome good recommendations pointed me to this medicine. I noticed from reviews on leafly that when a plant treats anxiety and depression I can be left with anxiety rather easily as a side-effect. This kept my head clear and in the game and removed that weight on my chest without leaving me anxious. It feels designed to handle anxiety for my body and affects very little else. I took up more space in the world as I relaxed. I&#39;m not sure how well it would treat depression since it didn&#39;t make me overly happy but not being anxious at all has to be a positive thing for depression sufferers too.

Keep in nind not many years ago 10% thc was cuting edge, and cbd was a usual byproduct of seeded commercial mj.  I&#39;m listing this as one of my favorites because I can actually smoke it without fear of psychosis as with higher potency strains. Btw the flavor is great as is the aroma and bud structure. Bottom line:it does get you high just mellowed down from the 30% crap over abundant on the market these days.

VTested this before giving it to my daughter and was very happy that there were no psychotic effects.  I haven&#39;t had any weed in years because I don&#39;t like the effects anymore.  But I wasn&#39;t going to give any to my daughter before trying.  I experienced just an overall relaxed feeling.  I still felt like myself, just relaxed and my sore back suddenly melted away.  I am comfortable making edibles for my little girl and that it will allow her to come off clonazepam.

VGREAT for a functional high if you have shit to do, I can&#39;t pin-point the taste but its soft and sweeter. I vape on a portable one, it burns REALLY fast so maybe lower the temp, if you can. Its nothing out of this world if you&#39;re looking for your mood or perception to be altered too much, but again, great functional high, still able to focus and everything. Mood was uplifted but not happy, I also have depression though so it basically made my mood feel more of a normal zero, than a negative.

VI suffered from the worst case of depression in my life recently, and decided I wanted to come off my antidepressants. well, let me tell you coming off them is not easy, I had extreme nausea and headaches, as well as bouts of anxiety. \u000aI bought harlequin before I came off, and decided to try it to help with the nausea. MAGIC. \u000ait takes away my nausea almost immediately, and keeps my head clear &amp; gives me every so I get things done. \u000aI tried this strain for my cramps too, and it helped too. I love Harlequin.

VI tried Harlequin again tonight as I really like the effects. This was the fourth time I&#39;ve tried it. I have chronic pain from degenerative arthritis, along with muscle aches. The Harlequin totally wiped out every single ache. It also brightened my mood and gave me a nice burst of mellow, happy energy. \u000a\u000aI will say, though, I haven&#39;t liked the taste of any Harlequin I&#39;ve tried so far. Perhaps there&#39;s some out there that tastes better. The first buds I bought  last week tasted like those green Japanese incense sticks, sort of perfumy. It also gave me a dry feeling in my sinuses. This batch tonight tasted kind of musty and dusty- I guess some people would call that &quot;musk.&quot; I think I&#39;ll try mixing it with a bit of the strain that tastes better to me, like CBD Girl Scout Cookies or Cannatonic. Or I might make some glycerin tincture with it.

I was jittery most of the day and it lasted around 5 hours. The pain relief is wonderful but a little too high for me. I&#39;ll have to get creative to fix it.

VAlmost magic effect on my benign essential tremor! Tincture leaves almost no head high at all, but vaping got me fairly high. Had a vape hit before bed and was really very restless trying to sleep--definitely a daytime strain for me. I&#39;m seeking a clear-headed treatment, and this one seems to be exactly that. In terms of pain relief, I&#39;d say it was moderate to very good--aware of pain but didn&#39;t care. Didn&#39;t do much for my methadone-induced nausea, however. After trying about 10 different strains for medical effects, this is by far my favorite!!\u000a\u000aThanks to The Standard in Holistic Medicine in Graham, WA

VThis is a decision you\u2019ll make once ya try this.

VA lot of people misjudge this strsin. This is a high CBD strain. It&#39;s not grown to get you high, It&#39;s grown for the CBDs, not THC; but this strain is really great as far as marijuana&#39;s medicinal effects go. If you want to get really high, just incorporate this strain with one bred for its THC. Great medicinal properties with this strain, good flavor, nice taste, good look. I highly recommend this strain to people with any kind of pain, and it is a great strain to mix with others. Take a few hits of this; relieve your pain; then take a few hits of a high THC strain and get the best of both worlds.

VWhen I first got this strain I was concerned because it had THC and I&#39;m not a recreational smoker. I started with 2 good rips and waited 15minutes to see how I felt. After the 15minutes, I felt calm and with a clear mind, I did get a head change but, nothing to throw me in a panic or get me all paranoid. I actually, ended up taking another rip to boost the chillness of the feeling. I have neck problems and the pain wasn&#39;t completely gone but, it did relive about 70% of it. I believe this strain will be beneficial to anyone that has moderate pain, had a long day (stress) and gets anxious (anxiety). I also like the fact that I don&#39;t feel high as a kite. I will definitely pick this strain up again. Also, the strain I got was a 2:1 CBD/THC ratio with 8.14CBD and 4.33THC.

VRating this strain is difficult for me because I have heard nothing but good things about it; so I&#39;m sure Harlequin is wonderful- however, for myself, I found that it brought about some intense anxiety and uncomfortable introspection. Physically, my heart was racing way too fast and all around I just felt BAD, and I was praying for the effects to wear off. Now, I suffer from PTSD, and certain strains are capable of throwing me into anxiety, paranoia, uncomfortable self-consciousness and hyper-vigilance. I have seen that after discussing with a budtender that I have PTSD and am prone to the symptoms mentioned above; alot of budtenders, in their recommendations, tend to gravitate towards high cbd strains- generally also low in thc. Well, what I have figured out about this is that a strain high in cbd low in thc does NOT automatically make it appropriate or compatible with someone suffering from PTSD and/or anxiety, hyper-vigilance, social-akwardness whatever etc. I hope more budtenders learn to identify compatible terpenes and cannabinoids and make recommendations that way. I have found high thc strains, sativas, and sativa dominant ones that do wonders for me,(Bruce Banner3) though indicas and indica dom. hybrids carry the majority of my favorites (Obama and Apple Kush, and GSC for example)and i believe its a matter of the particular strains having specific traits that complement my psychology and physiology and are just generally compatible. To be fair, though, everyone is different. Everyone&#39;s experience is different; so it&#39;s very difficult to guess what will happen between a specific strain and person. You&#39;ve pretty much got to try it out... Hope this helps somebody out there! And again, I chose 3 stars because it didn&#39;t agree with ME, but I know that Harlequin deserves her 5 stars with other patients. Thanks!

VOh Harlequin, how I love thee! \u000aI&#39;m the type of smoker who is very sensitive to the effects of THC. I tend to get anxious and paranoid more easily than other smokers. When I discovered Harlequin, I didn&#39;t know what a CBD strain was, I only knew there was something different about it. Now, it is my most important strain. This strain gives you great pain relief. I suffer from stiffness in my muscles and this helps me feel more limber. It&#39;s also great paired with an edible!  I mix it with any kind of weed and can now enjoy the effects of all the best sativas, indicas and hybrids without fear that I will suffer an anxiety attack. CBD has changed the way I view cannabis and I find that the remedy it provides to take the edge off THC is just what the doctor ordered for me.

VI have tried LA lady, harlequin, king kush, bubba kush &amp; cheese master kush.  King kush is the only one that helps me.  It subtly eases some pain, but makes me a little spacey w/very little anxiety.  It does help me cope with my 24/7-30yr pain battle with fibro ( just a name but so much more complex disease) lots of different pain and other symptoms. You feel like someone is beating you with their fists nonstop. Then there&#39;s the allodynia of which no dr. Seems to have knowledge of.  That&#39;s when your skin is so hypersensitive the hair on your arms is irritating, \u000aSheets are irritating, lose clothing or the lightest \u000atouch makes you cringe and cry out.  This is the worst. My feet feel like they&#39;ve been stung by bees all the time and my arms feel like they are covered in paper cuts.  After 30 yrs., I&#39;m surprised I&#39;m not locked up in a loony bin.  The harlequin magnified my pain to an in bearable level.  I was considering going to the er if it didn&#39;t calm down.  It also made my legs very weak and trembly.  All I could do was lie down.  I had to take medication to put me to sleep to get over it.  So far, I don&#39;t trust anything but king kush but it doesn&#39;t do much for the pain, just helps me tolerate it with less stress.  Because I have had such non- stop intense pain for so many years, my coping skills are worn out and the stress is causing problems of its own.  I&#39;m 66 and hope to find some relief soon lest I get put in a nursing home.

VI am a newbie mm patient. i suffer from chronic back pain. this was great! i really liked that it does not have much of a mental high, more physical pain relief. \u000ai took it just as i would if i was taking pain pills. i medicated every 4 hours. i actually called my husband later in the day to announce: &quot;i had my first virtually pain free days in years!&quot; \u000ai highly recomend medicating every 4 hours. do not chase the pain. do not smoke just when in pain. you want to be one step ahead of the pain :) \u000ain closing, if your looking to trip out this is not the strain for you. if you are looking for something to smoke during the day to knock out the pain yet you can be out and about without anyone noticing, then this is for you! cheers!

VI believe to have finally found the strain that best suits my lifestyle.\u000a\u000a I only really started consuming marijuana in my mid-thirties. My work can be a major source of stress and anxiety and I found that marijuana helps me relax and go to sleep. The caveat however was that I would frequently suffer from grogginess and a foggy mind the next morning, what I imagine people commonly call a &quot;weed hangover&quot;. \u000a\u000aHarlequin CBD relaxes my mind and body and despite the lower THC levels, still gives me a nice high. The difference compared to the stronger strains I have tried is that you can easily snap out of that altered state and keep paranoia at bay. Most importantly, the next morning I feel fine.\u000a\u000aThe only unavoidable side effect is the dry mouth it causes, so I drink lots of water and eat some fruit after a session. I vape the product in my MFLB, a fabulous device, so a little goes a long way. \u000a\u000aWith the legalization of cannabis in Canada on our doorstep, I look forward to trying other CBD-dominant strains, ideally grown organically.

VThis is an interesting strain to say the least. It&#39;s difficult for me to rate because it deserves a bit more exploring due to its low THC - high CBD ratio and it functions a little differently. I want to rate it sort of lowly because it doesnt really do what I am usually on the lookout for, but I certainly want to rate it highly because I believe other patients might find it exceptional.\u000a\u000aI would have to say that it does very little in terms of getting me high, which is perfectly okay with me. It seems to be intended as a functional daily use kind of marijuana that you can use all the time. Because of this I&#39;d say most may find it to cause very little paranoia or anxiety. It is supposed to provide a lot of pain relief. I broke my wrist last year and I have some residual pain. This strain didnt particularly treat that any more than any other cannabis out there, but I&#39;d have to say the pain relief effects lasted much longer than any other weed i&#39;ve ingested. That&#39;s why i put 120 minutes on this review.. it would seem that the cbd in it lasts longer than thc? And it has a particular characteristic tingly feeling in the body and head that is unlike anything else, it&#39;s very interesting.\u000a\u000aIn terms of smokeability and how it looks, this may have been the most top shelf well cured bud I have gotten yet. Incredibly easy to pluck little bits.. grind up.. and just look at without bits getting everywhere. Snaps off stems with a satisfactory noise each time. I was impressed. Burns VERY cleanly and evenly. I found that the best way to use this strain is to grind it up and roll joints (or perhaps blunts!). I experimented with mixing other strains into my joints to boost whatever effects I wanted and that was awesome. My girlfriend also has tincture of this stuff and several dropperfulls of that was excellent for a day&#39;s relief of the &quot;normally awful day that follows adderall use&quot;.

VA great happy, clean high that melts away pain and anxiety.\u000a\u000aMy wife and I fired this up after a trip to the Denver Zoo. We&#39;re still getting used to the altitude, so we were pretty exhausted after a full day of walking around. We picked up an 1/8th from Good Chemistry and went home.\u000a\u000aThe first few hits from a bowl produced a quick relief to our minor aches and fatigue. Further hits increased euphoria, as well as made me more and more focused (tunnel vision).\u000a\u000aWe kept smoking all night while watching Amadeus. It made a 2 hour movie engaging and relaxing. \u000a\u000aDefinitely recommended for a social experience and for pain relief.

Relaxing, mellow, calming, very nice mild high with body relaxing tones.\u000a      I had been medicating with mostly sativas, green crak, sour diesel, jack herrer , blue dream...harlequin wont get you HIgh like those, but it will mellow you and make your pain not seem so bad...

VI have had severe anxiety coupled with major panic attacks on a daily basis that has been so crippling, that I have lost several jobs and risked just about loosing everything. This strain has been a true god-send. This seems to actually work against the anxiety directly, allowing me to focus and feel normal for the first time in my life! It does get me a little euphoric if you I do enough, but its a very subtle nice high. Its really good when I mix it with my other strains like a local one called ANS that has a 1:1 THC/CBD ratio.\u000a\u000aOverall, if you have anxiety, depression and or panic attacks, give this strain a shot!  its truly a miracle drug!

VWhat a find! This is the first strain I had ever tried. The high CBD allowed me to function during the day, and yet, allowed my severe Neuropathy to dissapear. \u000aIt gives a small,  almost untraceable head high that basically leaves you feeling like you didn&#39;t smoke anything.\u000a\u000aIt made me extremely talkative, without physical pain, and allowed me to feel happy, and excited to be alive. I have PTSD, anxiety, and Panic disorder, which seemed to slip away amidst the use of Harlequin\u000aI would suggest this to anyone who may be looking for a &quot;Starter&quot; for first time CBD use.

VO my, Harlequin may be my fav strain to date. Burning migraine pain; mostly facial involvment. Not too dizzy. Pain scale 6-7; nausea 4-5 when I medicated @ 1530 or so. Hits ya hard &amp; doesn&#39;t take too long to start working (bout 5 min). Pain/nausea gone. Dizzy bout a 5-6 bu totally ok. Heavy head buzz but not a couch planter. NO ANXIETY PARANOIA. Body high dang near pefect. Relaxed to where I don&#39;t wanna do a whole lot but totally awake. Could probably be an awesome worker bud if I had something I needed to do. Will have to try this one again to gauge how this&#39; gonna affect me over a longer period of time.

VAcquired a cross of Harlequin and Very Berry done by Fire Bros. at Fremont Gardens in Seattle. 12% CBD/ 4% THC. Smells strongly of hazelnut, almost like Nutella, with a hint of strawberry jam. Like a PB&amp;J sandwich. Looks very golden with ruddy orange hairs and moderate trichome coverage. Smoke from a bong is very smooth, no irritation in the throat. Tastes earthy, nutty, and woodsy, with strawberry coming through on the exhale. Has a super functional CBD high, lightly energizing with increased focus, great for starting your day. I have serious chronic pain due to repeated motion injuries, and about 10 minutes after consuming this, the pain is almost gone completely. I also suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks, and this puts me in a very calm state, acts as a bufffer against things that would normally send me into a spiral of negative anxious thoughts. Being so naturally tightly wound, I can&#39;t enjoy many high THC/sativa leaning strains, but if I smoke this as a precursor, the CBD mellows out their high THC content without detracting from their unique effects. This is a valuable flower, truly medicinal. Big ups to Fremont Gardens for carrying this, you guys are the best!

VI\u2019ve never been a MMJ enjoyer but I have suffered from Fibromyalgia, Lupus, Arthritis, edema, migraines, cluster headaches and much more for a long time now. I was getting tired of all the medications that I was on and that they were constantly going up in dosage and I still wasn\u2019t able to get under a 4-5 (on a good day) on the pain scale level. \u000aSo I began my research. I literally spent a day going through the strains, reviews, effects etc and writing down which ones were 1st or 2nd in the pain relief and low to none on the euphoria end (with Fibromyalgia and Lupus you already have a \u201cfoggy\u201d head similar to being high and I didn\u2019t want it worse). \u000aThe first one I decided to try was Harlequin. So, I purchased some that was produced by Fat Daddy Sacks. Has a CBD of 13.15 and THC of 11.19 (more THC than I originally wanted but the reviews made me try it).\u000aSo, I went home and my husband rolled me a joint (like I said I wasn\u2019t a smoker). I had IMMEDIATE relief from the headache I had that was trying to go to a migraine, the Fibromyalgia pain, the arthritis pain and I was (for the first time in a LONG time) at a 2 on the pain scale (I was carefully smoking because I wasn\u2019t sure about the effects it\u2019d have on me). \u000aThe benefits of this strain is amazing for me. It doesn\u2019t make me hungry, it is literally the ONLY thing that takes away the arthritis pain and I don\u2019t have to take any pain meds while smoking this strain. It has made my life so much better.\u000aIt\u2019s smooth to smoke, tastes good upon exhale, doesn\u2019t give me cotton mouth, too much give me some euphoria but it\u2019s not like you\u2019d get couch locked and your mind is still clear. Well, as clear as us Fibro/Lupus peeps get. \u000aI totally recommend this to all my friends who have chronic pain (and anyone else I come across).

VGreen Crack (Sativa): Rare Stone CA\u000a\u000aTime consumed: 3:35 PM  4/27/15   First of the day\u000a\u000aAmount:  1 scoop approx.  &#188; gram\u000a\u000aGrinder: Simba four piece\u000a\u000aMethod of Consumption: About two Full Pulls from the Vapor Tower, Vaporizer, run through a KONG bong\u000a\u000aReview:  I\u2019ve been a medical cannabis user for treatment of severe pain and anxiety.  So many strains help in their own way, others not so much at all.  High CBD potential marijuana like this particular cut when grown to their fullest potential, and this one was is a true dream.  From time to time we need medication that is quiet yet effective.  Then when by some miracle a grower lets it go and you are able to get some, say goodbye to the dr. pills and hello to mellow-yellow-focus in-no stress-EASY like Sunday morning (not the Lionel Ritchie version, but Faith no More version).  Worst part about the strains is the availability and associated higher costs.  But if you can find a way to jump that hurdle then by all means you should check out these frosty conical, dense, shiny nugs of earthy goodness.  Think Lambs bread without the heady \u201cjah man\u201d aspect and you\u2019ve got the picture.  While I find the taste earthy and woody, there is supposed to be some pine in there, this did not but you\u2019ll not miss it if you were not expecting it.  Sum it up, KILLER CUT, METICULIUSLY trimmed and cured.

VI&#39;ve been very skeptical of the idea that 3 parent sativas would have such wonderful relaxing and pain killing affects. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a great balanced sativa. I&#39;m just more partial to the higher traces of terpenes more commonly found in indica dominant strains. In my opinion Harlequin has taken full advantage of the 5:2 CBD dominant ratio. The euphoric feeling actually hits with this strain. I take oxycodone for severe back pain and Harlequin is the only strain to come anywhere close to that kind of euphoria. My pain levels were at a 7 earlier. A half hour after smoking it dropped to a 1. And I&#39;m still awake to enjoy it!

VI consume bud at a rate of an eighth to a quad per month. In my college days that was a weekly rate. I by no means consider myself a big smoker, but I&#39;ve certainly tried a lot of varieties. CBD strains like Harlequin took me out of a long, long break from smoking. I had become paranoid or anxious from basically any strain, indica or sativa, for something like 2 years. The CBD strains have eased me back into the joy of THC strains and let me experience the medicinal effects of marijuana. Harlequin is especially fun because it never makes me lazy (often yields productivity), promotes creativity (e.g. I produce music and technical knowledge seems to come out of me more freely), and makes sweet love making even sweeter : )

As someone who is sensitive to THC because of anxiety it works wonders. \u000aI suffer from BPD and OCD, this helps me a lot with my disorders. Definitely a new favorite strain!

VAfter smoking hella Indicas and hybrids lately, I\u2019ve been feeling mentally exhausted. I saw great reviews how it\u2019s a strain high in CBD and lower in THC. so had to try some. I packed a fat bowl and hit it and wow instead of making me feel like my body is melting into wherever I\u2019m sitting, it lifted me up and put my head way above my body. and the best part was I could still function. 3 hits I\u2019m good to go . Would recommend this strain to someone looking for a mellow, EXTREMELY CLEAN head high. Like the cleanest smoothest climax and come down... love my medicine

VTo say this has changed my life is certainly a understatement. A little about me. I was a professional athlete for the first 15 years of my life. I had a total knee replacement at 15. I&#39;m now 32 years old and my body feels all I put it through at a young age. \u000a\u000aI was not a smoker, I always had a bad reaction to pot and had decided it was not my thing. Then it became legal in Washington State and much more info came out. I learned about CBD and it&#39;s health benefits. I&#39;ve tried a few CBD heavy strains and this is BY FAR THE BEST. \u000a\u000aMy pain (nerve pain) has went down to the point I am able to do things I couldn&#39;t do in years. My stress and social anxiety has gotten so much better. I&#39;m a extrovert, with social anxiety... do you have any idea how stressful that is!? \u000a\u000aI have currently only used the flower and smoked, but even a little bit and I&#39;m so much better. I plan to get a cart for either my Peal or Pax Era Vape if I can find it. But honestly for me, the flower is more manageable, this is not a strain to &quot;get high&quot; on. So unless you are treating your pain and stress through out the day. I&#39;d stick to this as more of your standard medicating. I use it in the mornings before work and then before bed. I keep a little one hitter in my back in a cig case for those &quot;middle of the day pain break through&quot; moments.

VIf you&#39;re looking for a strain with powerful pain, mood, anxiety relief, but with very little to no high,  then Harlequin is the right strain for you. This strain only gave me a light energy boost and a nice good general sense of well being. Felt very nice, and 100% fully functional. I recommend morning and day time, and perfect for work due to the little to no high effects. \u000aHarlequin makes a great pain reliever. Works well for mental disorders since it doesn&#39;t cause paranoia due to the high CBD which will lower anxiety issues. \u000aHighly recommend for great medicine without the high!

VI started using this strain for medical purposes. Some of my medical history includes: major depression, anxiety, possible PTSD, mood disorder, sarcoidosis, hepatitis C (blood transfusion/birth), asthma, diverticulosis, possible Lupus, degenerative disc and joint disease, chronic widespread pain, inflammation, and swelling. I have tried almost every medication under the sun. Doctors have been at a loss on how to treat my symptoms. Marijuana typically just makes me feel weird. I don\u2019t like feeling \u201chigh\u201d. However, THIS STRAIN IS A GODSEND!!!!!!  I do not feel high. I just feel BETTER!  I\u2019m in my 30s and usually feel like I\u2019m dying!  So THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR ME!  The taste is fantastic and smell is awesome!  No skunky stench!  No harsh hits either!  Did not hurt my lungs or even make me cough....AND I HAVE 2 LUNG DISEASES!  Quickly relaxes muscles, melts away pain (even severe menstrual cramps)!  Almost NO SIDE EFFECTS!  No extreme increased appetite. No dry eyes. No couch-lock. This is the best medicine I have ever taken!  I no longer need prescription opiates. Thank you so much.

VThis low THC flower, is great for relieving body pain. Wonderful on those cold mornings , where the pressure is more difficult on joints, especially patients suffering from Fybromyalgia, Arthritis, or other physically uncomfortable conditions. Its low THC feature makes it a comfortable product for those afraid of feeling the anxiety, or other side effects when using a psychoactive product. Its an extremely pain relieving flower but you aren&#39;t going to feel the cerebral high as much as with other higher THC cannabis sativa strains.

VHarlequin is Beautiful on the outside and inside. It smells amazing and fresh, like sweet grapefruit. The effects are very pleasant and relaxing with a slight spacey zoney effect for me. I have PTSD, Anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and daily stress out the wazoo. The harlequin helps with any physical pains and stress, and makes me wanna sit back and just relax. However, I&#39;m still able to get things done if I need to. For me, it smokes well at night trough a bong/bubbler, which is more relaxing from being combusted. You get the full CBD effect it seems. I smoked a whole j in the morning and it was wonderful. (i cant finish a whole joint if it&#39;s higher THC).  I am able to vaporize this during the day and not be &quot;too high&quot; to function. During the day, I usually vaporize through a cheap APX vaporizer or my MFLB (with weak batteries) and I still get a decent effect. I can also drive after vaporizing it as I feel only a mild relaxed feeling and no head high. When I&#39;m ready to get faded at night and put a cap on the day, I smoke more and do a dab of higher THC concentrate, as it pairs very nicely together for a clean high without paranoia. Can&#39;t wait to try this on the Arizer Solo I just ordered. I&#39;m almost out! I could easily rip through a lot of high CBD bud. Amazing medicine. Thanks for reading! Hope this helps. Cheers to all. 10/10

VAt first I didn&#39;t like this. The higher cbd ratio and lower thc is a nice change though. Depending on how bad my pain was, I would throw a high thc piece in for a pain murdering salad. A piece of afpak or cheesequake and all pain would just melt away. After it cured for a few weeks I got a slight grape dank out of the jar. Real earthy and deep. The exhale tasted the same. There is no high to speak of with this unless you are a lightweight or a beginner. I prefer cannatonic but this one is nice too. Give her a try. THC 7.0 CBD 15.0

VIf your looking to get high this isn&#39;t for you. With that being said it is a clear headed buzz but for me was harsh to smoke. I may have an allergy to high cbd strains because it left me with a terrible sore throat and lungs everytime I smoked. it was the same with harlequin as harlequin tsunami. I would likely rate it higher if not for my allergic reaction.

VI love it.. If you have pain this is the strain for you. Just there are some other CBD strains that are good but this strain is special. I mixed this Herlequin strain with some pennywise another  CBD strain not a potent, I believe pennywise was 10%-6%THC while Herle was  14%  and 2% THC. But this made my pain go away. I&#39;d be at a 10 on pain a couple blows of these strains I down to a 1 1/2. I&#39;ve chronic pain in my knees and back some days my whole body is tense and painful. This..

VI love harlequin. The medicinal effects of this strain can cure near anything. Its good for any time of day. Flavor is tang, musk, sweet, spice. Not overbearing flavor. Harlequins oil produces a terpene profile high in linalool. Very unique. Dabs are like ibuprofen shots. Amazing. Flower is mild, effective, and wont make you sick if you smoke a lot.

VThis low THC flower, is great for relieving body pain. Wonderful on those cold mornings , where the pressure is more difficult on joints, especially patients suffering from Fybromyalgia, Arthritis, or other physically uncomfortable conditions. Its low THC feature makes it a comfortable product for those afraid of feeling the anxiety, or other side effects when using a psychoactive product. Its an extremely pain relieving flower but you aren&#39;t going to feel the cerebral high as much as with other higher THC cannabis sativa strains.

TRY THIS STRAIN. \u000a\u000aHarlequin provides a very clear and focused energy, yet at the same time blankets you with an overwhelming calm. It&#39;s effects make you truly realize how you wish you felt all of the time. \u000a\u000aFor my pain management, anxiety, and epilepsy, there is no better strain. \u000a\u000aIf you were stranded on a deserted island and could only bring one strain, what would it be? For me, it&#39;s Harlequin.

Smells similar to grape and has orange hair as well as purple hair. Definitely highly recommend for anyone to try, especially those new to smoking, and those who want the benefits of pain, inflammation, depression, and stress relief without experiencing the effects if getting high as found in other strains that are higher in THC.

I would likely rate it higher if not for my allergic reaction.

VVery interesting strain.  I picked it up on my way through Tucson at the downtown dispensary.  \u000a\u000a I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect with the lower thc / higher cbd percentages.  To be honest it did not look all that great on the outside.  It looked real dried and more brown than green.  But it broke up rather nicely and it wasn&#39;t dry at all after it came out of the grinder.\u000a\u000aIts a pure body high.  Made me feel tingly and relaxed.  The head buzz is still there but it is very subtle.\u000a\u000aThis would be great for pain/headaches.  My body feels numb -- so does my head and face.  I also have a tingling sensation in my back.  It feels nice.  \u000a\u000aI would consider this something I could use and still be efficient at work.  It doesnt make me tired at all.  I would purchase this strain again.

VI usually pick up AC/DC for the higher cbd low thc but when I seen the quality on this Harlequin I had to pick up some. It&#39;s very calming and helps to sooth any anxiety or worry you have. It&#39;s a light, tastes great, and is easy on the lungs to smoke. This strain also helps with sore muscles after workouts or any time I hit the skatepark. I recommend this strain to anyone looking to keep some cbd in their medicine cabinet.

VIf you are looking to get high..... This strain is not for you. Or is it? To each his own :) but this is my opinion of it directly after smoking it...... It is has a light beer, or diet soda aspect to it. CBD sounds like a healthy thing and a cure all, but i smoke it, and dont get high? And i think why do i buy something that gives me paranoia but very little of the high? So you go to your bud tender, and they tell you how great it is and the fact that it blocks thc or whatever by amplifying its pain killing abilities sounds like a good thing... But you dont get high, the euphoria, the joy, the  relaxedness(?), the mellow, the social enjoyability. Just paranoia and a racing mind in my experience, the racing mind however could be confused with &quot;creative&quot; perhaps but, my overall mood is paranoid. And with traditional strains, i dont get paranoid. I originally gave this strain three stars, but after the first 15 minutes the paranoidness(?)  goes up another level, so that explains why one would leave a two star review of something that tastes so good. I dont just use to get &quot;high&quot;. I use cannabis as medication, i medicate for depression, i have chronic back issues, and marijuana helps me out alot normally with my pain and it allows my back to feel at ease and completely relax. At first i did feel a tad uppity from this,,,,,,, that soon gives away to paranoia, my back is still tight, and i cant fall asleep. Least favorite high ever. end this with a compliment. It does look and smell great.

I may have an allergy to high cbd strains because it left me with a terrible sore throat and lungs everytime I smoked. it was the same with harlequin as harlequin tsunami. I would likely rate it higher if not for my allergic reaction.

VThe &quot;high&quot; in the typical sense is either non-existent or very short lived.  However, to my surprise, it really made me feel better... I have bouts of depression and it made the depression really subside for 1-2 hours.   Other strains also help with depression too but sometimes you want to just function and not feel high at all, and that&#39;s what this strain does pretty well.   I was able to get some work done and have a pretty normal day.  Also, it makes music sound better and enhances focus!  In some ways it feels more like a nootropic (like Noopept or a racetam).   Thanks, Harlequin!  It really is medicine.

VA huge thank you to Wade Laughter for Harlequin! Picked up the clone from Harborside in 2010 and 2011 when CBD-rich strains were rare!  I have recently come to believe the name Harlequin must come from the liquor of the same name (Harlequin) that claims to have an &quot;orange flavor.&quot;  This flower tastes like sweet, syrupy, possibly even over-ripe oranges.  The music appreciation boost mentioned in other reviews of Harlequin is truly a characteristic of this strain!  Great high-CBD strain.

VThis is my go-to daytime strain if I want to be productive and feel good.  I got it at Nature&#39;s Better Health Center, and they have excellent strains.  What&#39;s amazing (for me) about this strain is that I can take enough of it to feel good but not get the &quot;overdose&quot; crappy feeling.  I also don&#39;t fall asleep once I achieve enough pain relief and anxiety relief, which is unique to this strain.  Most strains have some sedative effects, and this one I have to make sure I don&#39;t take within a couple of hours of bedtime!  Harlequin is excellent for pain relief AND anxiety relief!

It&#39;s effects make you truly realize how you wish you felt all of the time. \u000a\u000aFor my pain management, anxiety, and epilepsy, there is no better strain. \u000a\u000aIf you were stranded on a deserted island and could only bring one strain, what would it be?

VI love it.. If you have pain this is the strain for you. Just there are some other CBD strains that are good but this strain is special. I mixed this Herlequin strain with some pennywise another  CBD strain not a potent, I believe pennywise was 10%-6%THC while Herle was  14%  and 2% THC. But this made my pain go away. I&#39;d be at a 10 on pain a couple blows of these strains I down to a 1 1/2. I&#39;ve chronic pain in my knees and back some days my whole body is tense and painful. This..

Easy to stay productive throughout the day while the higher CBD content keeps aches and pains under control.

VThis is one of my favorite strains.  Gives me an extremely mellow, relaxed, and mildly euphoric feeling, with 80-100% pain relief.  I would maybe described it as feeling like you&#39;re floating on an inflatable lounge bed down a peaceful river while having a pleasant tingly/itchy feeling as well.  I can still function pretty well and have conversations with Harlequin in my system.  I only smoke with medical-grade oil vape pens cartridges and disposable vape pens currently.  Used to smoke the flowers but found I enjoy the pens so much more.  Less burning on the throat, no odor, no cleaning required, and very quick and simple to use.  Only tried this strain in an oil cartridge form.  All cannabis strains - sativas, indicas, and hybrids alike - seem to put me into a relaxing sleep within 1-2.5hrs.  So I can&#39;t give this strain a fair rating when it comes to daytime use.  I know sativas are generally supposed to be &quot;daytime&quot; energy use and indicas are supposed to be a &quot; night time&quot; relaxing use, but I&#39;ve tried over 40 strains in my life and they all seem to put me to sleep afterwards.  They also all encourage me to eat.  Maybe I just have a unique body makeup. I dunno.  I would definitely recommend this strain to everyone.  It won&#39;t get you totally blitzed and have you trippin&#39; balls, but it takes away all anxiety, stress, worry, paranoia, and most/all pain.

VThis is one of the most coveted CBD strains second only to Charlotte&#39;s Web.  It has a very low THC level, so it is perfect for those weekend warriors who maybe don&#39;t have the tolerance of more habitual smokers.  The medical benefits of this strain are amazing as well, due to the high CBD levels.  It is fantastic for dealing with chronic pain, anxiety, and insomnia.  If you smoke for medical reasons and you come across this strain in flower or oil, I suggest stocking up while you can.

VI am not a fan of Harlequin. It amplifies my anxiety problems. It makes me feel heavy and induces a strong head high. I don&#39;t get mad munchies, so that&#39;s cool. It sucks the energy out of me, though, and when I smoke it at night before bed, I wake up feeling super heavy and groggy. The high doesn&#39;t last that long for me and it makes my adhd symptoms much worse, unfortunately. Also, it burns the back of the throat and has made my asthma act up a little. Cool name, but I won&#39;t be back, Miss Harlequin.

VI don&#39;t know how I could get through anything without Harlequin. The CBD gets rid of my migraines within an hour of smoking it. I usually smoke it with a heavy Indica like 9lb Hammer to sleep. works every time!

VFinally! I got my hands on and smoked some real Harlequin. I found it at a dispensary in Capitola and I was so excited to go buy it and try it. This one I picked up is 8.80% cbd and 6.60% thc. Harle smelt, looked, and smoked a lot better and stronger than I was anticipating. I only took 2.5 tokes and I am really stoned. Very uplifting, euphoric, and happy. I feel very relaxed and anxiety free. My head feels really light and I feel the high in my eyes and pretty much all around my head. Body feels really good and relaxed. To me, Harlequin lived up to the hype. I think one big toke would be perfect to get your day started before work or just going out. More than one toke, to me, would be a little much if you have work or important tasks to take on. Perfect daytime strain. This is my kind of sativa. This one is my new all around favorite. I rate it a very high 4.9 if not a complete 5.

VI was quite disappointed in Harlequin. I ended up with intense anxiety, heart palpitations and a headache. Maybe because its mostly a Sativa or its terpene profile im not sure. It was a 1:1 THC to CBD ratio. I used it 7 times and every time the side effects where the same. It did motivate me to try other strains until i found the right one. Everyone is different. Im definitely an Indica person.

VThis strain was uplifting, euphoric, and physically calming. The Sativa side gives you an uplifting sociable high, the energy to keep you active through the cbd combination. The CBD helps with back pain and pressures from repetitive actions. The body feeling is not too strong to keep you from a hike, but I would prefer a dominant sativa strain or lower cbd level for running or sports.

It is the perfect strain to relieve pain and stress while giving you a decent buzz thats very managable even for newbies. secondly, while the bud itself is nice, i still enjoy getting high as well without smoking a whole lot. so when you grind it up and throw in some of your favorite sativa keif.... nothing beats that.

VI am ADHD and so varieties tend to act unexpectedly for me.  Harlequin is excellent.  The high is very mellow and relaxing.  Pain relief is good - not great like the heavy Indicas, but it leaves me very functional.  Enhancing morale vs wrapping the pain in cotton.\u000aIn general, Harlequin acts as a moderator for the effects other varieties - such as Cherry Kush or Skywalker.  \u000aThis is an outstanding daytime variety for me and is a great starting point for folks new to cannabis.  Pay close attention to the THC/CBD ratio.  Harlequin should be at least 10x higher in CBD than THC.

VLook: Mid green color with tons of red hairs. It looked like herb. :) which is always good.\u000a\u000aTouch: Mid size buds, solid but not dense and fluffy but not too airy.\u000a\u000aSmell: Sweet and Fruity. Very pleasant. Smells like herb, which is good.\u000a\u000aTaste: Not the best tasting cannabis. First drag tasted good, the rest were a bit harsh. Decent taste off and on throughout the smoke.\u000a\u000aThe Smoke: Grinder/Joint - semi- harsh smoke. The effects came on about 10-15 minutes after first drag. An hour later, I forget the semi-harsh smoke because the CBD kicked in.\u000a\u000aEffect: Happy, Euphoric, Laughing at the Bing Bang Theory and the Pete Holmes Show. I feel a bit more of the THC than I expected. Definitely felt the CBD. Started feeling relaxed and mentally stimulated at the same time.\u000a\u000aBefore smoke: Tight neck and shoulders. Inflammation from Arthritis. Specifically back, ankles, hips, hands and fingers. Sore muscles from heavy walking. General surge of anxiety throughout my body.\u000a\u000aAfter smoke: I still felt tight in neck and shoulders. After 20 minutes the effects started to sink in. After an hour, my body felt very relaxed in an uncomfortable sitting position. Good sign. I would have been constantly adjusting my body to find comfort, if not for this flower. My pain is there but it&#39;s not there. I can be aware of it, but it doesn&#39;t bother me. When I laid down, I felt very relaxed.\u000a\u000aConclusion: This strain was advertised as 8.12% CBD &amp; 4.19% THC, I would say that is about right. I would prefer a 10% or more CBD and less that 4% THC. If I vaporized or smoked out of a bubbler or smoked more, I may of had more of a relief.

VI had this recommended for me by a bud tender at a local dispensary. I live in Nevada and recreational as well as medical has recently become legal for all. I mentioned I was looking for high CBD strains with very low THC. The harlequin I ended up buying was 4% THC and 7.5% CBD, which ends up around day 2:1. I get extremely nervous when I smoke marijuana and have tons of paranoia and anxiety. A ton of it happens to go with being extremely uncomfortable sitting, as well as my chest being tight and not able to get a full breath.\u000a\u000aWhile this didn&#39;t happen to be an extremely intense high from just have a small bowl, it certainly did get me uncomfortable and out of my element. I have heard of a better strain called AC/DC which is a 1:19 or even 1:20 strain for high CBD. I think I may end up looking for either a teacher or a liquid AC/DC instead of finishing the eighth that I bought of harlequin. \u000a\u000aAbout 15 minutes after smoking a flower I did end up feeling very uncomfortable and paranoid, although this left after only about 20 minutes. I didn&#39;t get an extreme body high, however I did have a great night sleep after I finally made it to bed.\u000a\u000aFor many people, this was a brilliant example of finding something to balance their fears and anxieties with marijuana. It seems that this is just still a little too high for me in THC, therefore it doesn&#39;t work exactly for what I&#39;m looking for.

VThis strain has been the best yet I&#39;ve tried for pain relief minus the massive head highs. First few bowls tend to have a head effect but after the first couple days I can move around and think clearly. So far my #1 choice! Can&#39;t get my hands on any right now so Jack Skellington is the next best!

VHarlequin isn&#39;t necessarily about getting high, it&#39;s more about getting well.  The effect is very relaxing physically yet my mind is engaged and sharp.  Very nice as a morning strain with coffee.  Tastes quite unique, a little pinene and fruity while still being very earthy.  Delicious tasting and &#39;very&#39; smooth.  So far this is my favorite of the cbd strains I&#39;ve tried.

VThis is, by far, one of my favorite medicinal strains.  I prefer this as there is a complimentary THC content and effect that I find helpful as opposed to purely CBD strains.  This works great for relaxing and elevating the mood, as well as decreasing pain and nausea (I&#39;ve even noticed it help with my neuropathy symptoms from chemo).  Mix it with some Sour Diesel (not enough to kill the CBD effects), vape away, and its my &#39;morning coffee&#39; when on chemo.

VTrue to its namesake, Harlequin provides loads of positive and jovial energy. Also, Harlequin&#39;s initial effects may include a clear and focused mindset; however, I&#39;ve experienced pleasant and relaxed states while medicating with this strain. It may be important to note that despite its Sativa status, Harlequin has decent CBD content. Which means, in addition to its awesome cerebral effects, Harlequin provides excellent pain relief. Expect trichome-covered darker green flower with lots of deep orange pistils. For sure, I smell the musky earthy tones, but not so much concerning the mangoes.

VAgree with many reviews here: sets in nicely, relaxing; good for a chill-out sesh at night + doesn&#39;t mess with your head / doesn&#39;t send you to outer space. PERFECT for listening to music, conversations were confident, easy and insightful (still true the day after, too). Got way tired but I think that&#39;s more situational than strain-related, would love to try this with some coffee on a Sunday afternoon with a few art projects to see how things go. \u000a\u000aOnly bummer is that there&#39;s a really quick fade out -- effects were gone after about 75m (even though that hour-plus felt pretty long). A few solid hits of this right before your favorite band hit the stage would be pretty excellent. \u270c&#127995;\ufe0f

VThis was my first time dabbing a CBD focused product.  The consistency was noticeably more stringy and soft compared to a typical high-THC product from West Edison Concentrates. Flavor was noticeably different in that the typical dryness that THC seems to provide was replaced with a much more &#39;fruity&#39; and &#39;salivating&#39; characteristic. The high of a CBD product is  different than that from a high THC product. This shatter was in a ratio of about 1:1.25 of THC:CBD. I would describe the high as being similar in character to a typical stone but without any distraction or intoxication. It makes you high without being high. The nature of it is a little paradoxical and hard to describe. It&#39;s there, but you don&#39;t ever notice it. You can&#39;t find it if you go looking for it. The end result of this is a high that feels much more controllable. The only strongly defining characteristic is a relatively deep sense of relaxation. It&#39;s the most gentle high you can get. There&#39;s a thought in my mind that these kinds of products maybe more suitable for regular consumption than whats currently sought after in the market. While many claim cannabis can be used as a medicine only strains like these should be seriously considered.

VThis strain tastes real different, kinda hardy thick flavor but smooth thick smoke. It burns slow and very nicely.\u000aVery intriguing strain, overall I would buy more. It works great for pain, made me feel tingly with a touch of numbness and it made my spinal pain subside. I really enjoyed this strain for its pain relieving qualities from it high CBD count.

VThis is, by far, one of my favorite medicinal strains.  I prefer this as there is a complimentary THC content and effect that I find helpful as opposed to purely CBD strains.  This works great for relaxing and elevating the mood, as well as decreasing pain and nausea (I&#39;ve even noticed it help with my neuropathy symptoms from chemo).  Mix it with some Sour Diesel (not enough to kill the CBD effects), vape away, and its my &#39;morning coffee&#39; when on chemo.

Vour number one pick when it comes to comnbating depression; we have a very famous and potent cannabis strain; Harlequin. Harlequin is a seventy-five, to twenty-five Sativa dominant strain. What this means, is that it has a very strong CBD to THC ratio. As we discussed, it is the presence of CBD that creates the effects we are looking for. Harlequin is a decadent of a strain called Columbiana Gold, a Nepali indica, as well as Thai and Swiss landrace strains. With a ratio of 5:2, CBD to THC, this strain provides relaxation, and relief from pain, stress, and anxiety. With an earthy smell and a mango like the taste, Harlequin is a favorite of many, and for good reason.&#160; Taking the number one spot on our list for a reason, this strain will help relieve depression and anxiety-like no other. Let\u2019s continue on!

VI smoked this strain once and it was non-eventful.  I tried it again (different grower) and absolutely loved it.  The high was a verifiable rush of pain relief, at the same time giving me a warm, uplifting, happy feeling.  Even though I am a 24/7 medical user,  I definitely felt it&#39;s effects without it overpowering, over-energizing, over-sedating or so strongly affecting my short term memory like sativas seem to do.  A new daytime favorite.

VThis strain has done so much for so many, our version was obtained through &quot;Fat Honey Farms&quot; and it is amazing to say the least. Reminiscent of a sour pineapple/mango with a robust spectrum of flavors and smells when smoked. The bud structure is very nice for a CBD dominant strain, I would say the bud as a whole is very dusty, lots of trichomes all over the place, definitely a good hashish producer. The biggest quality that I would say this strain holds true to is the THC:CBD ratio. Instead of getting nearly comatose to have the levels of CBD that are required for some you are able to achieve the desired level with reasonably low dosage of THC. Although if you have had Harlequin before you do know that the bit of THC is very enjoyable when combined with the rest of harlequins spectrum. Find &quot;Fat Honey Farms&quot; on Instagram. #fathoneyfarms to know where to get some of this wonderful medicine!!!

I\u2019ve been using harlequin for months now and it\u2019s amazing. It takes away my pain, but doesn\u2019t leave me feeling too high or groggy that I can\u2019t function.

VThis is one of the most coveted CBD strains second only to Charlotte&#39;s Web.  It has a very low THC level, so it is perfect for those weekend warriors who maybe don&#39;t have the tolerance of more habitual smokers.  The medical benefits of this strain are amazing as well, due to the high CBD levels.  It is fantastic for dealing with chronic pain, anxiety, and insomnia.  If you smoke for medical reasons and you come across this strain in flower or oil, I suggest stocking up while you can.

VThis is the second time I&#39;ve smoked Harlequin and the first from a grower at the NW Cannabis Market.\u000a\u000aFirst, this guy had no idea what he was doing and the herb was clearly harvested too soon because it was way too sticky. No, that sticky icky icky shit isn&#39;t always what you want.\u000a\u000aBut even his shitty / cheap grow was awesome! Harlequin is hard to fuck up. It is just such a mild high; your mind is still feeling creative, but it is chilling... relaxing; no bounce. Your body feels a lot for a Sativa; this sort of ever-present tingling sensation. There&#39;s no anxiety; in fact, if you felt anxiety before smoking, this will alleviate it.

VFinally! I got my hands on and smoked some real Harlequin. I found it at a dispensary in Capitola and I was so excited to go buy it and try it. This one I picked up is 8.80% cbd and 6.60% thc. Harle smelt, looked, and smoked a lot better and stronger than I was anticipating. I only took 2.5 tokes and I am really stoned. Very uplifting, euphoric, and happy. I feel very relaxed and anxiety free. My head feels really light and I feel the high in my eyes and pretty much all around my head. Body feels really good and relaxed. To me, Harlequin lived up to the hype. I think one big toke would be perfect to get your day started before work or just going out. More than one toke, to me, would be a little much if you have work or important tasks to take on. Perfect daytime strain. This is my kind of sativa. This one is my new all around favorite. I rate it a very high 4.9 if not a complete 5.

VPicked up Harlequin in Bremerton. I would not recommend for anyone with anxiety or paranoia tendencies. I took a couple good tokes. It tasted great, but then when it hit after 10 minutes i was super paranoid, on the verge of panicking. It took all my mental strength to keep from freaking out. I just kept telling myself, it&#39;s medicinal, its medicinal, lol.! But after an hour i was fine, but i&#39;ll never smoke harlequin or with Willie Nelson again!! As always, remember everyone is different and I certainly suffer from anxiety and PTSD. :)

VA friend uses this for high-CBD medicine for himself and for hard-drug addicts in capsules.  He batched some in coconut oil; I put residue on toast with honey and I was tripping as if on LSD.   I was expecting something MUCH milder.  Now, the literature is misleading at best, e.g., here it supposedly is 5:2 CBD:THC.  Elsewhere, I read &quot;The standard ratio of CBD to THC in Harlequin is 5:2. Cannabis lab Analytics 360 has measured samples of this strain at between 4% to 10% THC  and 6% to 15% CBD.&quot;  6:4 - 15:10 show 5:2 to be misleading at best (I&#39;d say fraudulent).  It&#39;s high time for high science.

VThis is my go to strain. It helps me with my pain, anxiety, depression and over all well being. The 1:1 ratio is the key, at least for me. I like that the head high is minimal, due to the CBD. I can be productive or I can just chill. I honestly have nothing to say about it, well, more availability in my area would be great. I do travel a bit just for this strain. &#128588;&#127997;\u270c&#127996;

VA friend bought me this strain for my birthday, about 2 grams worth. I&#39;ve got a terribly low tolerance, but I have a deep appreciation for the high CBD, low THC type strains. I try to be moderate in my consumption, even though this is a strain that&#39;s been recommended by Leafly as a strain for beginners. Even so, I&#39;ve had some roller coaster-like moments... I can&#39;t really pin down if it&#39;s because I used a stem from the flower to fill the hole in the bowl of my pipe, so as not to get bits and ashes on my inhale.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m a shifty beginner, I realize, but this is definitely a strain that I would hold onto and keep working with. I&#39;d usually smoke it before work, taking one or two hits in the morning would put me in a really good mood to work with customers in my customer service job. Things seem easier to take in stride and I can let go of calls easier.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve been hard pressed to try to find it again in my local area, but I hope to find it again soon and to keep building up my tolerance with it!

VWhen I first tried this strain, I was hungover and it helped greatly with the nausea, headache and cramps, not knowing that it was number 1 on Leafly\u2019s top 10 strains for a hangover.  Was impressed, but, My innital idea was to try using it for work, so that\u2019s what I did the next day. It worked amazing and so did I! I was so productive and had no knee pain even at the end of the night. After the effects wore off, my back did hurt a little bit by lifting with improper form from feeling so good. I have anxiety and depression and it helped greatly wth my mood, but I strangely had mini panic attacks throughout the day. No reason. It just felt like my chest and lungs were being depressed, but I was also zooming around at the speed of a cheetah. I could focus on my tasks and execute my actions throughout the day as that of a kung fu master, but I had a hard time listening to people when they spoke. I\u2019m 32 and have had brittle type 1 diabetes since I was 7 and have neuropathy. I swear by this strain.

VI\u2019m not really sure how to write a review about this strain. I get big headaches after vaping it. It does do a better job then most high cbd strains for pain though. The dispensary I got this from is awful. All there strains can give you headaches from talking to other people. It did help with pain and inflammation as well arthritis. The head ache that comes later though makes it not even worth it. So it\u2019s hard for me to judge on that part because of the issue with the dispensary but I also read that one of the more common side effects is a head ache with this strain.

VCresco Harlequin - 5 puffs (only needed 3 it got stronger as it creeped slowly more and more into my head the CBD levels you must remember are very high and this Cannabinoid acts very differently than THC , anyway I feel very physically relaxed. My body is very limber. I feel mentally relaxed as well. My anxiety levels dropped dramatically to almost gone. I am thinking extremely clear and I feel like I can think clearer. I feel my thoughts connecting easier and my mind working like a machine. I feel a burst of energy not a ton that\u2019s it\u2019s anxiety causing but a little that it could be very helpful in just not being fatigued. I find it really relaxes my mind as well but like I said as my mind and body relax they body are still fully functional lol it\u2019s very unique and interesting. A strain that\u2019s 1:1 Thc and CBD it\u2019s a totally different experience. A little bit light headed and floaty. I feel a tiny bit of anxiety in my gut still. The CBD does make me a bit fuzzy which is hard to explain as it also is making me think clearer sorry but it\u2019s very unique. I\u2019d call it thinking clearly yet a little aloof? This is a good strain for medical reasons which is why I got it. It\u2019s good for my Anxiety but I honestly don\u2019t feel I\u2019d buy it again after I finish this. Ive had better success with strains that aren\u2019t 1:1 than this but Def good for the those with severe more physical anxiety it really relaxes the body. It doesn\u2019t make my mind feel quite how I\u2019d like it when medicating. I felt overmedicated with 5 puffs so remember your cbd tolerance and take that into consideration.

VLet me just begin by saying due to PTSD, I do not like being intoxicated.  I have degenerative disc disease: 16 bulging discs, 11 dessicated discs, 5 torn discs leaking inflamatory protein throughout &amp; wake up with a fever daily. I am a mom of 4 and when it comes to pain limiting...&quot;if I feel like I can, I do&quot;.  When I feel better I do more without thinking about it.   \u000a\u000aAfter research I knew I needed high CBD,  Maryland is limited in CBD  strains available, but I hunted down prerolls &amp;  vape cartridges in ACDC which helps me a good amount.  I was doing a lot more...we are selling our house and a lot needs done before photographers come.  I used a swiffer on my kitchen ceiling, washed the top half of a 18 foot chalkboard wall...couldn&#39;t do that before ACDC. \u000a\u000aI over did it reaching for something 4 days ago &amp; broke off a piece of disc and it is touching a nerve. My sterhoid injection is not for 5 more days &amp; I&#39;m in bad shape bed ridden.  The slightest movement in my hips makes me scream in pain.  ACDC wasn&#39;t doing much to help with the intensity. I have been in bed for 4 days, unable to stand from sitting without someone lifting me or rolling onto the floor to my knees and pulling myself to standing  with a door frame.  \u000a\u000aWith nothing else to do, I searched cbd strains on leafly and decided to try Harlequin.  I called dispensaries starting with the closest to me and hunted down a Harlequin vape cartridge by PRIME. \u000aI had a friend drive me to get it.  \u000a\u000aI took 4 draws of the Harlequin vape and 30 mins later I didn&#39;t feel like sitting down, I was up walking and made dinner for my husband and kids having my kids bend for me. After hour I found myself bending to get ice from my freezer drawer myself,  felt pain if I moved to fast but I felt like I could do it myself, &amp; did. I feelt motivated to get things done. \u000a\u000aLike ACDC I will have to be really careful not to overdo it and injure myself because both kill pain and gives you more range of motion, Harlequin is definately good for more intense pain, gives you added motivation too.  \u000a\u000aI felt like I could clean the house &amp; really wanted to. \u000a\u000aI vaped Harlequin again before bed (pain usually keeps me up) and fell asleep fine.\u000a\u000aI just woke up after sleeping 7 hours undisturbed, can barely move...I tried to roll over but it&#39;s not happening.  Harlequin to the rescue. \u000a\u000aI need to remind myself &quot;even though you are feeling less pain, you still need to take it easy because you can reinjure yourself by doing to much&quot;.  \u000a\u000aHope this helps others.

I&#39;ve tried it in both 1:1 and 2:1 CBD:THC levels and found little difference in the high, but the physical relief of the higher CBD is noticeable. Worth saying that I have only vaped Harlequin, both flower and concentrate.

VI was hoping for more from this one because of all the positive reviews, but for me it was a disappointment. In order to get the level of pain relief I need the amount I smoked caused nervousness and only partial pain relief. I wouldn&#39;t get this one again since there are much better choices for me.

VKnowing myself, i find it weird that i dont like this strain as much. As a fan of hybrids, this wasn&#39;t the best imo. Had cotton mouth but no red eyes, pretty decent munchies, but just didn&#39;t fully enjoy the high. Maybe it was part of a &quot;bad batch&quot;? Any-who, still worth recommending if you&#39;re in need of a daytime strain. It does the job!

VI am absolutely loving this strain! After just 4 hits with my one-hitter, I am feeling extremely happy and relaxed and just sooo warm and snuggly but yet I don&#39;t feel stupid at all. In fact, this strain is pretty damn great for doing homework and is helping me SO much with typing my 10 page essay for social psychology. Though I feel relaxed and mellow, my brain feels focused and motivated as well as pretty creative. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like CBD because it doesn&#39;t give you the &quot;head high&quot; but it&#39;s actually proving to satisfy my every need (relaxation, happiness, pain management) yet not producing any of the unwanted effects (no motivation, cloudy thoughts, etc.)

VSmoked Harlequin today for the first time in over a month. Really nice and pleasant high. Uplifting, mood boosting, and relaxing all at the same time. The 1/4 ounce I bought tested at 6.60%thc and 8.80% cbd. So it&#39;s more of a 4:3 ratio than a 5:2 ratio. 1 or 2 hits would be perfect for starting your day. So far this is the best day time/pre work cbd strain. Harlequin is a must try for cbd/sativa lovers. I&#39;m also looking forward to trying AC/DC for when I don&#39;t want any kind of high.

VThis strain is incredible. There will be more and more like it because of the growing research into the benefits of CBD. In  countries like the Netherlands, the government has been doing highly reliable scientific research into cannabis for some time. CBD  has been proven to reduce stress reactions to difficult situations, it reduces anxiety, and is a formidable pain reliever. This strain does all of that but lets you remain clear. There is still a slight buzz, great relaxation, and nice pain relief.

VSo I finally found, and picked up an 1/8 of the elusive Harlequin strain.  I was eager to try this strain having read a lot about it.  Being a chronic pain Medical Marijuana patient, and also having anxiety issues, I first noticed this strain while researching.  Since then I have found Jack Herer a great daytime medicine.  But being curious about the Harlequin I finally picked some up.  I have to say it is very very mild.  I smoked more than normal at first and was a little worried about being too high.  It never happened.  My body felt a little relaxed, and nothing in the head.  I then smoked some more and felt a bit more relaxed, almost tired.  I mixed it with Purple Kush and ended up getting a bit more high, and hungry.  Its a cool strain to try, but doesn&#39;t have a ton of effects on the body in my opinion.

VThe last time I smoked was 7 years ago. I quit because I would experience a lot of paranoia and anxiety. I started looking for a strain that wouldn&#39;t have those qualities but would help me relieve stress. I was suggested this strain but it doesn&#39;t really live up to my expectations. I don&#39;t feel any different when smoking it. No relaxed mood, no tamed attitude, nothing. I was able once to experience a sudden relief of anxiety but it only lasted for a total of 5 minutes. I probably will not buy this again.

VOnly smoked once, but so far I love this strain! Super mellow and relaxing, but also uplifting -- prolly from the sativas backbone? No paranoia though, or what I like to call double-think where I&#39;m trapped in my head over-analyzing what I&#39;m thinking about (I hate that side effect of weed! As long as I include CBD, I seem to be able to avoid that thank goodness). I had been really exhausted when I got home from work; smoked a bowl of this and I am in no pain and feel great! Not exhausted like I was before. Plus I am still clear-headed enough to do things. Actually helps me focus. I think this may be my go-to, day-time strain!

If you&#39;re looking for something to chill you out, go ahead and do this stuff, but if you&#39;re looking for a nice buzz, you might want to find something a little bit stronger.

VSince using marijuana medically, this was the first strain I tried. I eat it, it is a dark thick tar-like substance in a syringe. I take about 1/4 - 1/2 size of a grain of rice. It takes about an hour to take effect. When it does, I am couch locked, giggly, definitely feel high, and I care a lot less about my pain. Sometimes it makes me feel more tense, or maybe sort of highlights the tension in my neck and shoulders, where I tend to carry my stress. \u000a\u000aHowever, if I take more than my usual dose, which I did the other day - it wasn&#39;t doing it for me, the pain was still intense, so I took another dose - I ought to have only taken a tiny bit more - but I did another 1/4 - 1/2 grain of rice size bit - it was NOT good. I became overly emotional, my anxiety shot through the roof, I was weepy and paranoid and my thoughts spiraled into super negativity land. DARK thoughts. The only way I made it go away was to sleep it off - which only took a couple of hours but man alive, I have to be really careful with this strain, as I seem to be very sensitive to high CBD strains in that way. \u000a\u000aI so very much wanted to find a strain with less of the high and more of the pain relief, but this one wasn&#39;t it. I still use it occasionally when there isn&#39;t anything else available, but this one it too unpredictable for me. If I have something else available, chances are I will use that instead. And eating it can be unpredictable anyway - I would be very curious to try vaping this one to see if it is different in flower form.

Very easy to smoke and very relaxing, nice flavor.  Good for my headache, not gone but diminished, back pain barely registers.  Will use this batch at night-time and try again from another grower.\u000aAddendum: after the sleepiness wears off, a calm, clear headed focus takes over.

I didn&#39;t know how at peace I could feel until Harlequin. I didn&#39;t know the pain could vanish. Harlequin has nudged itself firmly into my all-time topfive favorite Cannabis strains.

VThis is an interesting strain as it has grown in popularity so much due to the high CBD percentage.  I too am fascinated by this strain as well as other CBD featured types. I have been fixated for quite a while on a strain that is less psychoactive. As I am still relatively new to mmj, i tend to get self-conscious, paranoid and it will give me anxiety. I worry about being too out of it. I pursued this strain heavily. The first time I tried it, my lower body was in a great deal of pain, I had a long day and was in a crappy mood. I had some Harlequin and this subtle sense of ease came over me. The pain was still present but it was manageable and I felt my mood relax and my patience grow just enough. Like I said, its subtle, but the state of contentment is just enough for you to stay motivated. I am rating it slightly lower, mainly because I notice there is a weird side effect for me and this strain; that contented feeling is not always present. In fact, lately I&#39;ve been getting agitated while smoking this strain. I am not giving up on it completely, however. it has made me consider different ratios of CBD, THC and other cannabinoids.

VTalk about class! This eloquent bud really knows how to treat you right. You can basically blaze harlequin chronic straight to your domepiece  and still do long division for hours. My jerk stepfather and the endless taunting of my inbred  peers contributed to a decades long fight against slouching and bad posture that one might associate with poor self esteem. Luckily I grew up to become a respected citizen in a very well liked but unknown struggling rock band. It gives me confidence, it improves my posture. The catch 22 is that guitar slinging and amplifier hauling and crouching over a notebook and carrying the weight of Artistic Responsibility brings that slouch right back. I&#39;ll keep rocking in the free world forever with a little help from the trusty harlequin, and some really good exercise routines.

V     Harlequin is the third CBD dominant strain that i have come across and is in a strong tie for first. Just to specify all three have been fantastic(In The Pines, Charlotte&#39;s Web). But where as CW to me was much more an evening buzz, ITP and Har were morning and afternoon energy bombs. \u000a     I must say to its credit the Har buzz began quite soon after a few rips. Amazing clarity coupled with energy and drive shortly follow one another in no particular order as you settle in. Always feels good to just feel good and Har without a doubt delivers a GREAT day!

VThis strain is unbelievable. I woke up in the middle of the night with a migraine so bad I became photosensitive to the point where I could hardly see. Within 5 minutes of smoking a bowl \u000amy eyes stopped watering and the pain radiating behind my left eye vanished. My anxiety over the episode also disappeared. I felt relaxed and happy. Getting back into bed and getting on my phone started to trigger another headache, but was it reduced again once I turned off my phone. Soon after, I was able to fall back to sleep. Needless to say, I love this strain. \u000a

VI thought this would make the perfect wake and bake. I was wrong. I don&#39;t know if I took too much, if my stuff was old, or if my brain chemistry is just wack, but Harlequin knocked me out. It was like someone kept putting a bag over my head because it would go dark, and I&#39;d realize my eyes had shut. I was literally forced to take a nap, however this still gets 5 stars because it&#39;s the only one of the many strains I have tried that completely killed my period cramps. Not just reduced, not just &quot;okay, I can tolerate that.&quot; Gone. If I had been able to stay up, I think this would be perfect for me. Not too much head high, nice body buzz, pain relief, and I felt fantastic after that nap!

VI was looking for a strain that was well related for pain but wouldn&#39;t knock me out completely. I was pleasantly surprised by this strain which gave me a nice relaxing feeling but didn&#39;t numb me down too much. My mind was still sharp but all pain was nicely subdued. My original go to bud was granddaddy purple which packs a stronger punch but I found if I mixed 70% Harlequin with 30% granddaddy purple, the result was really good.

VIt did what it said it would... low thc with higher cbd.  It was a very mild high.  Felt more lightheaded more than anything.  You wont stoned, but you will feel the buzz like you would when you drink.  The smell of the flower is very unique, i didn&#39;t like it too much.  Everything about this is mild.  You won&#39;t reach a high you would normally get from stronger weed.  I smoked 2 bowls in a pax vape within 4 hours to keep the high.. so this flower may get expensive.  my ultimate goal was to find a low thc weed that could keep me functional while wanting to feel the buzz and it did the job otherwise, i would give it a 2.5 out of 5.

VHarlequin is a workhorse strain for me, one that I use to counteract the stabbing pains of my osteoarthritis. I generally find it with a 2-1 or 5-2 ratio of CBD to THC. It gives me relief from the pain without psychoactive effects that would impair functionality. I currently have a stash of Harlequin with ultra-low (3%) THC content that I keep in my purse for when knee pain becomes a problem for my driving. The fact that I can smoke enough to relieve the pain without in any way impairing my driving ability is a blessing.\u000a\u000aThe aroma and taste are pleasant enough, but nothing special. It has a smooth draw which is easy on the throat. I haven&#39;t experienced any negative side effects.\u000a\u000aMy giving it 3 stars doesn&#39;t denote anything negative. It&#39;s just that I have found other strains such as Avidekel, Harle-Tsu, and others to do a better job for the intended purpose of fighting pain and inflammation. That said, this is a good, solid, dependable medication.

The first thing that hit me where the pungent earthy woody tones when I smelled it, the smell itself was almost intoxicating. It was very dense nice and sticky look like it was covered in Trichromes.  It loaded very well and when it smoked, the tones that were evident in the smell were again very evident in the taste. It was wonderful I I blew it through my nose and the terpans made me sneeze, it is wonderful for the pain I can not tell you how wonderful for high CBD strain this is a good one.... Two thumbs up

Vharlequin is a wonderbud for sure, she boasts high CBD and usually low THC but some varieties go up to nearly 20%. concentrates of this flower are truly incredible, like a caffeine shot coupled with aspirin, it will bring you up and kill your pain better than migrane meds

VHarlequin is my go to strain for treating my daytime anxiety and panic disorder. The CBD:THC ratio usually is expressed as 5:2 or 2:1 when in concentrate form more thc seems to be present. That&#39;s a good thing for me as high thc levels also help curb my anxiety but it&#39;s nice to have a strain like Harlequin for days when being high is not an option.

VI have severe Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia, and this strain is my go-to for daytime use. Indica&#39;s hit me too hard and knock me out, so it&#39;s great to have this for during the day when I need to get things done around the house or run errands (I&#39;m full time in a wheelchair so I have my husband drive, because while I&#39;m clear-headed, it&#39;s just smart not to smoke and drive). Plus, I have a 7 year old, and I can smoke this before he gets home from school and be completely clear-headed to help him do his homework or take him up to the park. Whenever I see this available at a dispensary, I grab it!

VWOWWWWWW! I&#39;m so mad I didn&#39;t discover all the great things CBD strains have to offer! When I first got my medical card all I wanted was high thc products thinking that would help my pain and anxiety it certainly does but I found that higher cbd strains with lower thc had even better effects medically. Overall this strain is a new favorite! I&#39;m just disappointed I didn&#39;t get more... but this is the perfect buzz wouldn&#39;t call it a high unless you smoke more, but it&#39;s the perfect buzz to have when your at work annoyed and stressed out or when you just wanna get rid of any anxiety.

VIs all good except ( to my taste)  it does leave a sort of front stone headed which it doesn&#39;t give much focus so that disappoint me. I guess it has much of cbd and indica and I don&#39;t like indica but I wanted to give it a try. It felt funny in the tip of my tongue like tingling sensation very close to like a hint of anesthesia per say  which I was surprised not been my cup of tea. I&#39;m still in d search of my best friend, but yeah after about 2.5 hrs I&#39;m getting clearer which I enjoy better. It is great for chilling on a couch...

VThis strain worked better than most at killing the pain in my intestines. It was nice not to have to feel that way for a longer period of time. When it came time for me to want to catch a buzz, I simply put some shatter on it and it made a wonderful, happy combination that left me free of pain. It is nice to have the option whether or not you want to get high when  you need to kill the pain. Sometimes I need to go out in places it is not appropriate for me to be buzzed and now I can do that without hurting.

VVisual Appearance:\u000aDark green bud, with dark orange sinsemilla. Sparse Trichomes.\u000a\u000aPhysical Consistency:\u000aCrispy, hard bud. Moderate density. Crumbly with a little bit of stickiness.\u000a\u000aPre-smoke odor:\u000aBurnt smell, similar to post-smoke odor. Also dark pungent aroma similar to hops.\u000a\u000aPost-smoke odor:\u000aTastes very similar to smoking a bowl of resin, but the has a much shorter and cleaner aftertaste and overall flavor like green bud.\u000a\u000aEffects:\u000aVirtually no head high. Distinct mental clarity and focus immediately after ingestion. No headache or mental fogginess despite resin-like flavor. Very short peak &#39;high&#39; but residual body sensation slight but persistently lingering.\u000a\u000aOverview:\u000aPerhaps the most distinct flavor and smoking experience I have ever had in my 15 years of smoking. Flavor and smoking experience definitely not prime for recreational use, but high CBD content  does offer a much different smoking experience. Perhaps better for individuals with low tolerance, or people who require high CBD with low THC for medicinal reasons. I do not personally suffer from high body pain, so pain relieving effects were not readily apparent. \u000a\u000a

I took 3 good hits and I&#39;m really liking the mellow high it gives me. Seems like a good day time strain that will allow you to function but still be medicated. The high is behind the eyes and a little in the head. A very mellow high. My body feels comfortable and a little loose. I feel slightly uplifted and colors seem brighter and prettier. I feel like it&#39; also worked on my anxiety really well. I wonder how this compares to the actual Harlequin. Anyway, I really like it so far. I rate it a high 4

VFour stars because the strain is not ideal for my needs: to mitigate RLS and PLMD.  Still, lovely overall. \u000aThe Sativa dominance was expressed with a touch of worry and tension in mind and body.  Not ideal as a sleep aide.  Still, Sativa mental wanderings can be meaningful and productive, don&#39;t you know, with more actual thinking, less mellow fantasy.

VI am a newer cannabis patient. I like this strain for many reasons. It has a interesting smell, somewhat fruity at first but them a little sour.  It is a heavy dense bud and it smokes very well. No burning in the throat, goes in easily. I find this strain good for day time, slightly energizing but relaxing at the same time. I am using it for ADHD and anxiety and it works! Also, mild pain relief. It makes me happy with out having a strong head high. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a.

VIf you are just starting to use marijuana then this strain is just right. Rolled into conservative joints or smoke in moderate bowl, the high is not so overwhelming as to scare you and the muscle relaxation and anxiety relief is really nice. The high is clear-headed, even for us novices, gives one the ease of mind to write, paint, draw, sculpt or create.  I had also found that with the loss of pain, anxiety and tension came the ability to sleep.  I think it can be a sleep aid but without the &#39;couch-lock&#39; of an indica strain.

VTried and kind of liked for pain. Next grew outdoor this year and had big thick plants. Mostly heavy leaf, yet appeared to be thick bud. Amazing look, but misleading, in that it is very lacking in bud after trimming, which is a nightmare. What do you do with leaf and trim. It&#39;s very disappointing and the affect is minimal when compared to extra quality strains, such as Platinum OG I grew at the same time. Will never grow/use again. Glad you like it. I will dub this the head lettuce of medical cannabis.

VI was lucky to get the original California phenotype my first time. The high was energetic, and uplifting. Not the most focused, but I was able to do the little things around the house without second thought. I pumped up the music as I worked and loved every short minute of it. Didn&#39;t do much for my pain though. Second time I tried it, it was bred with cannatonic and I didn&#39;t like it at all. It was harsh smoke with a drab indica vibe. CBD wasn&#39;t high enough to bring me down from a stronger strain like the original did!

VRight off the bat, this stuff smells like dirt that&#39;s been pissed on. That being said, the actual flavor when you smoke it is somewhat grassy and woody, while still retaining some of that feet and cheese funk. However, you&#39;ll grow to love the particularly unique smell and taste that this strain comes with once you experience the way it makes you feel.\u000a\u000aThis strain is quite potent. A nice choice for anyone with a very high tolerance. The high itself is a wonderful combination of a very heady, yet mellowing high. It&#39;s a relaxing, smile inducing, and eyelid drooping kind of high, without a lot of the couch lock and laziness that usually comes with it. This is a great strain for getting your mind off your worries and getting rid of any aches and pains you might have. Definitely not the best strain for doing anything productive, however, as distractions become plentiful.

There&#39;s not a huge high at all, I just feel very spacey and kind of uncomfortable like I need to go home and sleep lol. I recommend smoking this before bed, I bet that would be amazing.

VI prefer CBD strains and I def avoid stony head highs as I tend to wander into Anxietyville and that&#39;s a miserable place to visit. But Harlequin keeps me safe fr Anxietyville and instead I am able to relax after a hard shift at my soul-crushing job. It is a nice body high. If I am extra tired it will put me to sleep, which is nice since I work graveyard. This strain is my fave. Every time I go to Nectar I ask for it  and since it is so popular, they are often sold out. I stock up when they do have it.

This is a CBD strain, so just a slight tingle and not a high as a result. Didn&#39;t seem to have much effect otherwise. My sis says that with CBD you need a pretty good sized dose to do pain relief.

VI read that this strain was low THC, and most of the reviews mentioned that because of this it didn&#39;t cause anxiety like other strains. I guess I got cocky and smoked half a joint in a matter of five minutes or so without thinking about it. Within I wanna say fifteen minutes or so, I was watching Jurassic Park and it hit me. I suddenly felt very heavy. I couldn&#39;t track what was going on in the film. I felt like I suddenly knew everything and nothing &#128514; I had to keep reminding myself that I hadn&#39;t always felt that way and I WOULDN&#39;T always feel that way; just very out of sorts. Then I ate a ton of pizza, cake, and Takis and was in bed by 9pm. For what it&#39;s worth, I take Adderall. Because of this, my brain is always on high alert and laser-focused, and so the slightest bit of THC makes my brains feel like Jell-O. My mother has awful chronic pain though and said that smoking Harlequin made her feel better than she had in awhile, so, I&#39;m not knocking it&#39;s potential for other users.

VNot a review. Just going to say I really want to try this strain. There is only one place within an hour and half drive from me that carries it. I will need to make the drive soon and get it. I&#39;m looking for my &quot;wake and bake&quot; strain that will get my day started right without getting me stoned, and I heard this could be the strain that does that. Once I get it and try it I&#39;ll give a review on it. \u000a

VEs una sativa pura, cero sue&#241;o, activadora, pero sin causar ansiedad ni inquietud, si te permite viajar aun a dosis bajas tiene un efecto psicodisleptico pero agradable. Ideal para el d&#237;a. Lo &#250;nico que no me agrada es una sensaci&#243;n de presi&#243;n en el &#225;rea frontal de la cabeza al principio. Luego pasa y tiene este high agradable sin efecto narc&#243;tico en absoluto. \u000aQue no les enga&#241;e la concentracion de THC y CBD, es una sativa en todo el sentido de la palabra, pero sin paranoia ni ansiedad.

VThis is the 4th strain I&#39;ve ever smoked- tastes kind of metallic but definitely is tolerable. Pain is wiped out, mood gets lifted up, you get a little energy and  your whole body tingles a little as if you stepped out of a hot shower into a cold room and your whole body goosebumped up. This is by far my favorite out of the four (blue dream, night nurse, harlequin, and blackberry kush )

VI thought I\u2019d be fine with a dose of Harlequin oil, even though Sativa doesn\u2019t usually agree with me, since the oil was around 10% THC. Ended up having one of the worst experiences since adolescence. If you\u2019re normally chill with sativa I can see this being fine, but if you\u2019re prone to or worried about weed anxiety maybe try something else\u2014or at the very least try it in a non edible form first :)

VHigh in CBD! This sativa dominant strain left my body feeling pleasant with a slight tingle. Helps with pain and discomfort. I did feel the THC in this strain, however, it was fairly mild. Had me feeling a little anxious and slightly stimulated at first, but after 5-10 minutes, I began to settle into the high which left me uplifted, smiley, clear-headed, focused, and relaxed while remaining energetic. There is absolutely no burnout from this strain. Smells a bit like piney tropical fruit. Ripe mango&#39;s with pineapple, citrus, and pine undertones. The taste and smell of this strain burning is not very pleasant, unfortunately. It was woody and slightly earthy. Overall, good strain for medical patients. Decent for recreational users who want to remain highly functional.

VHarlequin JO I purchased last night.  The ratings are about double of the last blue dream/harlequin mix cartridge I had.  I liked the clear headed relaxation and ability to keep going.  Still 2:1 cbd to thc so I figured couldn&#39;t be too much more...the new ratings being 14%thc and 40%Cbd.   \u000a3 big rips on the old mix would be good so I hit this 2 times since it&#39;s a little stronger.  Whoa, yeah.  Much stronger.  I was stoned in 10 minutes and lasted for about 45min where I had to just chill on the couch being too high.  Head, body, Stoned.  After that 45 min the head started to clear up and I could start talking to the wife again and felt good for the next couple hours. Had to hold back a few giggles.  Slept like a rock.  I&#39;ll try 1 big rip tonight and report back how that goes.  \u000a\u000aUnexpected &quot;fun&quot;.

VHarlequin was not that good, not impressed at all.  Maybe its improved since last July 2014, but doubtful.  Over a dozen seeds pulled out, not counting those undiscovered until they popped in the bowl, obviously unpleasant and counterproductive for tx of headaches.\u000aCompletely disappointed with product.\u000aHOWEVER. . . G2G offers professional, courteous service, typically carries excellent product. Any service issues resolved quickly and adequately.  ONLY  wish it was easier to get on delivery schedule between 7pm-10pm and would love later delivery hours, or at least able to get on the last delivery without having to call before 7-9pm for a 10pm delivery.  Bid hours are til 10pm, but if you don&#39;t get you&#39;re order in by 7pm, likely you will be told they are too booked to help.
