VI waited and waited until Tru|Med in Phoenix had it ready. And it was worth the wait. The combo of Blue Dream with its haze like qualities and its distinctive Blueberry flavor added to Amnesia Haze make this a very nice, potent daytime strain for the experienced user. The flavor profile on the inhale through my Extreme Q were of Berries, Apple, Pineapple and Tropical Fruits, scent of vapor was just as pleasant. The colors in this premium flower were Pinks, Orange, Reddish and Purple throughout the nugs. Tru|Med has their grow and curing process down to a T. They don&#39;t rush the medicine to the floor and it shows. By far the TOP Dispensary in the Phoenix Area!!!

VI see why they call this strain &quot;Lucid Dream&quot; - it makes you feel like you&#39;re in one. This strain makes me feel very relaxed, but not sleepy, and I get a slight burst of energy. I feel uplifted and my reality looks like I&#39;m in a dream. It&#39;s sorta hazy looking, colors appear brighter, and it just -feels- like a dream. It&#39;s hard to describe, I guess!\u000a\u000aWhat&#39;s strange about this strain is how emotional I feel on it. I don&#39;t feel sad, but I notice that I&#39;m open to feeling more emotions. It seems to bring up feelings that you usually push down and ignore. But again, it doesn&#39;t make me feel sad; just more in touch with myself. Like my body is trying to purge these feelings out. \u000a\u000aI really like LD and I will definitely continue smoking it. I&#39;m thinking I will try mixing this strain with another to see if it counteracts some of the emotional side effects. Maybe facing those emotions will take the emotional effect away - I&#39;ll update you if it does! Lol.  \u000a\u000aAs for the taste and smell, it&#39;s like blueberries. It&#39;s delish and makes smoking it an even better experience. &#128077;&#127995; I also want to mention that it gives you a bit of a stoned look; so keep that in mind if you&#39;re going out!\u000a\u000a

VThis is truly a sativa. One of the first strains I&#39;ve had to actually be uplifting and not drowsy. It is the most purple bud you&#39;ll ever see but can be a little stem-y, but just pick around those. It is very potent and the % is not exactly because different batches can vary. If you have the chance to try this do it! It makes you feel kind of dream-like but everything is so vibrant and definitely gives a &quot;heady&quot; high. The name suits it well!

VThis strains flower has the sweetest aroma that I have thus far smelt, not even a hint of that oh so familiar smell. The bud was frosty with a light green hue. Smoked it with a bubbler and it brought out a lavender flavor that was delightful. This strains high was one of the best, not overly intense, but man my mind was moving at light speeds. It opened up any of my creative ideas, and if I focused myself could create till I passed out. Really recommend this for writers or artist.
