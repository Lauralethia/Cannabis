Vinitially a slow creeper? greens out of a fairly kiefy bowl had me a bit lethargic, then a euphoric head high..body buzz starts, kill the bowl, rollercoaster down immediately, tingly body buzz as head high expands. super trippy top shelf shit.

VI\u2019m a big fan of the CBD flowers, Poison especially! Great smoothness, evened me out perfectly in the mid-day when I needed some general relief without heaviness, I wish everyone would try this, beware the aroma however.

VI like Og Poison and if my tolerance was by so fucking high it&#39;d be a one hit wonder :) \u000a\u000aHalf way through my cone and I&#39;m getting sleep, feeling relaxed, and all my negative thoughts and depression is stripped away. Euphoric wonder and peaceful somnolence. :) \u000a\u000aThe bus itself tastes earthy and pungent and has a piney aroma as well.

VIm a OG fan big time , and this strain possibly is my favorite OG. The name tends to spook some ppl , but that&#39;s their loss. Really helps me sleep. If &quot;deep sleep(pre 98&#39; bubba x Larry og)&quot; isn&#39;t around I stick to the poison for help with my insomnia

VDidn&#39;t know what I was smoking at first lit up and 20 minutes later I was thinking less about food and more about the nap I was gonna take. Love the pine and earthy taste, best sleep I&#39;ve ever gotten without feeling even a little bit drowsy afterwards.

VEasily the tastiest and prettiest CBD rich strain I\u2019ve ever had. The OG flavor, smell and taste really come through in this super lovely CBD rich strain. Smooth smoke, light head change and overall heavy body relaxation, but without the sleepy effect.

VExtremely strong pungent indica strain. Comes in huge popcorn nugs in a bit of quantity. The effects out of a beaker with ash catcher are immediate and intensely sedating/relaxing. I can&#39;t sleep, this is a tremendous aid in sleeping and is better than medications I am on. This is not a social strain, not a wake and bake, and not a strain you want to use if you would like to do anything at all. And thats not just somebody saying that as usual. This is a tremendous indica strain for immediate insomnia relief.

VTrue to its name, this stuff doesn&#39;t taste very good - but I got it because I was averaging 3 hours or less of sleep a night, and it definitely did its job. If you suffer from insomnia, grab this stuff. After you smoke this, it&#39;s basically physically impossible to keep your eyes open! It&#39;s cheap, and I imagine it would be beautiful in baked goods as a before-bed brownie.

VI bet it is the best one for people that want to relax and do nothing, or watch a movie. So I made a mistake and rolled a joint with my boyfriend in the morning for wake and bake. I felt my head too heavy and instantly went back to bed. Also I had 2 bad trips from the first 2 joints I ever smoked from this strain. It leaves the worst taste of mud in your mouth. I guess this strain is not the best one for me but it serves its purpose.
