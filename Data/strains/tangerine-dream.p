VTangerine Dream is one of those really nice energetic focused highs but still keeps you grounded, so there is no paranoia.  Real relaxing and mellow at the same time.  I think the best thing about this bud though is the smell and the taste.  Sweet, but not overly sugary.  If you are drinking a soda when you smoke it, it takes on the sugary taste - tasty!!.  One of my fav&#39;s.

VMigraine pain 6; nausea 5-6 when I medicated round 1630 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. Head high strong but also energetic. Was able to cook my hubby a healthy dinner &amp; do a load of laundry. Body high perfect. Still very stoned &amp; body high is just startin to wear off @ 2000. Lasts a while which is very nice. Highly recommend for daytime use. Might keep ya up if ya use to late in the day. Excellent for a busy person that has pain/nausea (yay me!). :-)

VI&#39;ve seen this strain in shops, but until now, I hadn&#39;t purchased any for whatever reason. After doing some research, I purchased an eighth of Tangerine Dream, because I&#39;m always looking to cycle my meds so I&#39;m receiving the most benefit from their use. I used TD for about a week during which time I utilized it as my wake and bake sativa strain. I&#39;ve found that with cannibus I may treat my conditions and there are secondary benefits as well. One benefit is its ability to increase optimism and focus, another is pain reduction. Additionally, some individuals may achieve a profound connection with their body. I definitely receive those benefits. So, a few years ago I began administering small doses of cannibus prior to working out and just after workouts; I enjoyed the results. I was able to rid myself of exogenous stimulants like caffeine from coffee of pre-workout supplements. Stopping the caffeine helped with my anxiety, because I was no longer taking CNS stimulants so I may remain active or productive throughout the day. If you have anxiety the last thing you need is an artificial and self-imposed panic attack because of stimulants. Getting to he topic at hand, Tangerine MF Dream! This was not a let down. I functioned with a clarity that I haven&#39;t been fortunate enough to find in many Sativas or Sativa-Dom hybrids. If you have anxiety and want a nice sativa that won&#39;t have you pacing or your thoughts racing, then try this stuff. After its grinded, I use a measuring spoon to dole out about a quarter table spoon and that holds me down between the hours of 4 am to about 9 am. I know that may seem like a stretch, but I&#39;m so productive the time seems to fly and the boost in optimism isn&#39;t something I turn my nose up at. I gave TD 5 stars for its great odiferous contributions, its impressively fluffy nuggs, also for its incredible mental clarity effects. As always, do the responsible thing and look for the best expressions of each strain. Not all growers and/or shops are going to provide you with the best smoke, so do your research before buying. &#128072;&#127997;

VI LOVE tangerine dream! Although having recently had surgery and noticing that this strain was very good for managing the pain, I want to emphasize this strain for people who have pain and stress, but can&#39;t handle all medical mj due to anxiety. Some strains cause an anxious reaction in me, but tangerine dream is not one of them. I can smoke, manage my pain, relax and not have an issue. I love it; perfect medicine.

VFeels very medicinal so probably &lt; or =20% THC &amp; &gt;.5% CBD\u000aDefinitely citrus on the tongue with a light and clear head buzz thus validating itself as the working man&#39;s weed. Seems like an all purpose strain as it relaxes the muscles &amp; or any anxiety as well any stiffness in the body. I believe this G13/S5 Hybrid to be 2 parts Indica with 1 part Sativa. A professional grade bud for that special spot in any avid medicinal smoker&#39;s private stash well saved for that rainy day when you just can&#39;t stop yourself from picking up that aXe &amp; going to town. :-)

Very euphoric, and uplifting, my head is clear and focused yet my muscles are relaxed. Beautiful strain. This will be my new morning/afternoon strain.

VThis strain is very interesting that the fact it distinctively smells like Tangerines and tastes earthy and a hint of sweetness. Its perfect for a good ease-out end of the day and just to sit and smoke either or alone or with friends its all good due to the high being dependant on how your mood is while smoking. These buds have very dark leaves and looks almost as if the THC and the brown hairs are mixing into brown looking THC! The negative opinion on these buds are that they give you extreme &quot;cotton mouth&quot; (Dry mouth). I give this strain a healthy standing 8.

VIt is a clear, relaxed chill vibe as well as full body relaxation. In summation, I absolutely love this over everything currently except for BlueCheese &amp; Super Lemon Haze for those sleepier days. For a novice smoker i suspect it packs a punch (couch-lock) but for seasoned smokers it&#39;s probably more of an everyday medicinal pre-post work or work-out, socializing, relaxing &amp;/or any creative pursuits, pick me up. Smoking this is just  a pure good time for those who like to have fun with life and appreciate the finer things in life with a little less fluff &amp; noise. It is soothing yet mellow, fragrant yet citrus as if it were just plucked from the tree, stem, peel and all. If this were a wine it would be a 2007 Ch&#226;teauneuf-du-Pape and would go down with a Boeuf En Daube.

VI enjoy the subtle yet sweet taste of earthy citrus that this strain gives off. Freshly ground buds release a fruity cannabis scent with a dominant smell of tangerines or citrus. It provides me with relaxation and calmness, but still includes strong euphoria. I don&#39;t believe this is best for starting the day as it makes me lazy. Overall, a nice strain to chill out with.

VA small, light green, fluffy bud with a strong fruity aroma. I have tried this strain several times through my Iolite vape and it produces a heavenly orangy cream flavor with a strong aftertaste.  I noticed feeling relaxed almost immediately though this strain doesn&#39;t last as long as I prefer, an hour and a half, max. No headache or dry eyes which is normal for me, that was a perk. Definitely made me thirsty. I enjoyed this for chilling in the daytime, felt very calm and happy. Would recommend this for someone who is wound up tight with anxiety or possibly tension pain. Don&#39;t pass this one over if  you find it at your co-op garden.

VI just tried this strain for the very first time and I must say, this is my favorite so far! First off, it has a pretty unique look. The buds appear over dried, but have the most vivid orange hairs I have ever seen! It is a very sight. The buds were also full and fluffy. Second, the thing that impressed me the most was that it actually smelled just like a fresh tangerine! EXACTLY like a fresh tangerine! I have never had a strain that smelled so much like the name! The smoke tasted great! I recognized more of a tangerine essence in the smell rather than the taste, but it still tasted great, nonetheless. As the description says on this bio, it does start off as a social smoke where you can stay focused and carry on a conversation. I&#39;m not feeling so much energetic (as I&#39;ve had a long day), but I can definitely see it as such. However, too much can leave you with couch lock. That&#39;s probably the second v reason why I make this strain my favorite. You can almost control your high with this one. I&#39;d say it&#39;s comparable to Camel crush cigarettes in that you can switch from one type of effect to another...but I highly prefer Tangerine Dream over a cigarette any day! All in all, I strongly recommend this strain. Pleasing to the eyes, nose, and taste buds while still delivering a versatile smoke. If you find Tangerine Dream, I strongly suggest you try it. You definitely will not regret it. Happy smoking ;)

VI enjoy the subtle yet sweet taste of earthy citrus that this strain gives off. Freshly ground buds release a fruity cannabis scent with a dominant smell of tangerines or citrus. It provides me with relaxation and calmness, but still includes strong euphoria. I don&#39;t believe this is best for starting the day as it makes me lazy. Overall, a nice strain to chill out with.

VA small, light green, fluffy bud with a strong fruity aroma. I have tried this strain several times through my Iolite vape and it produces a heavenly orangy cream flavor with a strong aftertaste.  I noticed feeling relaxed almost immediately though this strain doesn&#39;t last as long as I prefer, an hour and a half, max. No headache or dry eyes which is normal for me, that was a perk. Definitely made me thirsty. I enjoyed this for chilling in the daytime, felt very calm and happy. Would recommend this for someone who is wound up tight with anxiety or possibly tension pain. Don&#39;t pass this one over if  you find it at your co-op garden.

VWow, I&#39;ve never been high *and* stoned before. I got nuked. Not a daytime strain at all. I wasn&#39;t in any pain, but then my brain went AWOL. All I could do was sit and giggle and stare at the computer monitor. There is no going anywhere on this. Good a lazy evening at home. Works awesomely on pain &#39;though, and makes you want to become one with the chair. Took a while to hit me, Then it snuck up on me, grabbed me by the collar, and kicked my butt.

VReview from an Indica fan:\u000a\u000aThis is a fun one. \u000a\u000aMy body is fucking tinglinggggg...\u000aI&#39;m vaping this and after a few minutes it hit me like a train. The room got lighter and brighter and I had a burst of energy. \u000a\u000aThen I sat down and the high quickly started to change into a chill, tingly, feel-good high. \u000aI can already tell you right now that this one would be great for sex. \u000a\u000aIt just feels ridiculously good. If you&#39;re up and need to do something it gives you a comfy push, but if you just want to chill on the couch it helps you really relax and do that as well, without knocking you out like a real indica. \u000a\u000aWhile this is a pretty chill smoke, it still has some of those sativa effects. \u000a\u000aI smoked this for wake and bake when I was exhausted, and immediately afterI did it felt like I did a bump. I was UP. Alert, feeling good, had some energy...then the high calms down into a nice awake, yet comfortable high. Great stuff.

I feel the sativa because i&#39;m not couch locked but it&#39;s sort of a Happy/Lazy high, tried to pay a bill and it took me almost 10 minutes because I kept double checking to see if I had spelled all the words correctly. Watched a movie &quot;Jonah  Hex &quot; and that was really great and very funny, this weed makes you very introspective and relaxed, the come down is nice , sort of tired but not at all sleepy

VI\u2019m recently new to Cannabis and CBD products for anxiety and pain (post-op shoulder surgery). I didn\u2019t bother to educate myself on the strain before vaping it (90% THC) and I suffered dearly. I was enjoying a nice afternoon at the park watching the sunlight shimmer on the ripples of water, sitting on my little bench when I pulled out my vape and took 2 decent size draws from it... \u000a\u000aI was playing chess while listening to 311 Grassroots album and within about 2 minutes my face felt tingly, my heart rate increased and I felt superglued to the bench. The music was coming in waves, minor visual hallucinations occurred until I pretty much checked-out from the earth. I suddenly appeared at home and after about an hour the intensity of the high began to subside a little bit, I mellowed out more and sank into a full-body coma with a monster appetite.\u000a\u000aIncredibly potent concentrate, intense cerebral and euphoric buzz that eases into a nice, mellow relaxation until. Super delicious  tangie flavor with soft and deceivingly light clouds of smoke. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d buy this again, but I have several more strains coming in a few days, GG#4 and GSC happen to be two of them and I\u2019ve heard nothing but raving reviews about them. This is by far the best remedy I have ever enjoyed. Cheers ~

VEven in a vape pen, with my undeveloped palate, I can tell that this is a delicious strain. It&#39;s a bit chocolate-orange, rather than the dreamsicle I was expecting. The first thing to know about this stuff is that it makes everything taste AMAZING. It doesn&#39;t give me the munchies directly, but it enhances flavors like crazy. There&#39;s a rush of euphoria, and then it&#39;s a pretty smooth ride for me. I get giggly and I&#39;m prone to making stupid, obvious jokes, but I also have self-awareness. I&#39;m capable of holding a conversation and being social while using this strain, and it does allow for a lot of introspection. I feel chill- so very chill- and as if I&#39;m enveloped in a hug from the universe. This is a boon to my anxiety and PTSD. I also feel the ability to focus on doing things without a crippling amount of negative self-talk. All in all, this is a new favorite for me. Plus, who doesn&#39;t want a hug from the universe now and then?

I was enjoying a nice afternoon at the park watching the sunlight shimmer on the ripples of water, sitting on my little bench when I pulled out my vape and took 2 decent size draws from it... \u000a\u000aI was playing chess while listening to 311 Grassroots album and within about 2 minutes my face felt tingly, my heart rate increased and I felt superglued to the bench. The music was coming in waves, minor visual hallucinations occurred until I pretty much checked-out from the earth. I suddenly appeared at home and after about an hour the intensity of the high began to subside a little bit, I mellowed out more and sank into a full-body coma with a monster appetite.\u000a\u000aIncredibly potent concentrate, intense cerebral and euphoric buzz that eases into a nice, mellow relaxation until. Super delicious  tangie flavor with soft and deceivingly light clouds of smoke. \u000a\u000aI\u2019d buy this again, but I have several more strains coming in a few days, GG#4 and GSC happen to be two of them and I\u2019ve heard nothing but raving reviews about them. This is by far the best remedy I have ever enjoyed. Cheers ~

Vtangerine dream = G13 x Nevilles A5 haze\u000a\u000aThe batch I got was a little wet which the dispensary warned me about ,but it is still disappointing. The flavor on inhalation through a volcano was zesty and spicy. The high was somewhat powerful ,but seemed more on the indica side which was disappointing because I have read that one of tangerine dream&#39;s parents was haze. Overall I dont understand the hype in this strain at all ,and I would rather have blue dream, strawberry cough or some other haze cross instead of tangerine dream. I give this strain a 6/10 for being a well meaning good smelling strain that fails in the high and taste department.

VGot some from a dispensary here in Vegas and first impression is it&#39;s OK but not great. I feel the sativa because i&#39;m not couch locked but it&#39;s sort of a Happy/Lazy high, tried to pay a bill and it took me almost 10 minutes because I kept double checking to see if I had spelled all the words correctly. Watched a movie &quot;Jonah  Hex &quot; and that was really great and very funny, this weed makes you very introspective and relaxed, the come down is nice , sort of tired but not at all sleepy

VPersonally, Tangerine Dream is my favourite strain I have tried. Fantastic taste, high and even smoking it in a joint was enjoyable, as it is very smooth. The first thing noticeable about this strain is the sweet aroma of tangerines, hence the name, however the tangerine taste becomes more apparent as you inhale some of the sweet haze. The effects from the strain are very quick to act upon you, as one or two joints of this can send you into a euphoric yet chilled stats for a good few hours. I would highly recommend the strain if you&#39;re looking to chill and have a good time with your friends. Although I personally didn&#39;t get the munchies as much as other strains, I still found my taste senses have enhanced more than when I&#39;m high, so I&#39;d advise you prepare yourself a pizza or snacks for this experience. Overall this is a great strain, myself and all my friends have enjoyed it, so go out and get yourself a bag of tangerine dream and you shouldn&#39;t be disappointed.

VFrom a purely grower perspective, this strain offered a teaching moment everyday of its soon to be, short life. As a mother she doesn&#39;t just rock, she rolls. Tangy girl&#39; clones are healthy and robust. This is an excellent clone choice for a beginner!\u000aGrowing her is much more of a challenge! She is moody and very particular. Goldilocks is a more fitting name. Once she is out of her juvenile stages, she begins to take on her lineage. Strong, tall and stately. Although these are more akin to her sativa roots, her buds are starting to show and smell her stronger indicated characteristics.  This strain, within the 805 area did better outside and in soil in the second half of her life than indoor and hydro. She and her babies&#39; preferred inorganic feedings, than organic. Her water requirements are very adept within the CA drought. Overall, she is a bit of a challenge to grow. Once past the 2gal pot size, she is on the stairway to heaven.

VThis was the 3rd time smoking weed and was done from a Gravity Bong, so it was a strong high for me. After the one bowl which almost made me throw up, I didn&#39;t feel much difference, so I went to start packing another bowl. Then after about 2mins from the first bowl and midway through packing the other I suddenly started to feel disorientated, tingly and my eyes felt very heavy. The tingling feeling was in my head and arms mainly and when I moved the tingles seemed to dissipate until I stopped. Everything seemed to sort of pulse and I moved as if in a dream. When I sat down the tingling seemed to strengthen untill it eventually faded away slowly. After a while my eyes didn&#39;t feel as heavy, but I never felt tired anyway when they were heavy. Food tasted the same, but it still made me hungry. Music sounded awesome and you could really just drown everything out with it. Orgasms were very good with this as well because of everything felt intense (hearing as well).\u000a\u000aThat&#39;s basically everything I felt!

I went to the skate park with friends after 3 bowls and had the most uplifting time. Had great conversations. To be simply put, you will have a fantastic time. The one down side I thought was, after we smoked copious bowls, the couch lock. I was glued but that&#39;s only if you are stupid like me. Definitely recommend.

VI usually get anxiety from anything but an indica. The budtenders at the west seattle shop in the top hat area, recommended this to help with daytime anxiety, and depression. It makes me feel relaxed, and happy, and not like I can&#39;t keep my eyes open like the wonderful indicas that help me with me insomnia. So, I recommend this to anyone who has anxiety, &amp; does not want to feel too sleepy in the day time. Thanks again West Marijuana!!!

The best part is when it wears off there is no hangover. It leaves me bright eyed and happy.  I\u2019m prone to anxiety &amp; tension headaches but I dont have those effects with this strain. It\u2019s very close to perfection &#127818;\u000a\u000aI love this strain so much that I bought the seeds from Barney\u2019s to grow next spring &#128578;\u26a1\ufe0f

Vjust had a bowl. very relaxed, very pleased with myself. Very carefree atm. I would recommend this bud to the average 9-5 working guy because you can come home hit this and just be satisfied with yourself no matter whats going on. overall very good bud. also the smell is very inviting. :)\u000a

VPerfectly balanced hybrid that will enhance your abilities while doing many activities. With top premium quality afghani genetics along with the legendary Neville&#39;s Haze and G-13 creates this &#39;dreamy state&#39; feeling like no other. Being a heavy indica kush lover I still highly recommend this strain as it chills you out at the same time. My fav strain hands down along with Bubba Kush.

VI recently switched to oil, and a Vape pen, and I just bought Interra Oils, Pure Upgrade tangerine dream hybrid. Now I am literally less than 24 hours into a switch to vapor pen, and I must say I love this option so much better.  I also have to give kudos to the staff at the stash box, Auburn. Every single time I go in there, I tell them what I am wanting in the way of effect and they make a suggestion and they have never been wrong! Today this product was suggested to me because I asked for something that would be great for daytime, uplifting, with no stress anxiety or paranoia. It&#39;s absolutely spot on. I am totally focused and able to do exactly what I need to today.  It&#39;s pretty cerebral, but you can totally focus in One Direction or another and easily shift if need be.  I feel like I&#39;m getting a lot done for the first time in a long time, and also my osteoarthritis pain is relieved to about a level two on the pain scale. Amazing.  Is also a real smooth and chill and happy kind of high. Five stars!  Big kudos to The Stash Box!

VTangerine is an apt description for the flavor of this, an absolutely delicious strain with a strong high to boot. Found myself losing track of time while laying on the recliner listening watching episode after episode of anime. I can definitely understand the medicinal value this strain has, melting away pain and making me feel very content with my sheer existence. Solid 4/5, will definitely get this strain again if available.

VPersonally, Tangerine Dream is my favourite strain I have tried. Fantastic taste, high and even smoking it in a joint was enjoyable, as it is very smooth. The first thing noticeable about this strain is the sweet aroma of tangerines, hence the name, however the tangerine taste becomes more apparent as you inhale some of the sweet haze. The effects from the strain are very quick to act upon you, as one or two joints of this can send you into a euphoric yet chilled stats for a good few hours. I would highly recommend the strain if you&#39;re looking to chill and have a good time with your friends. Although I personally didn&#39;t get the munchies as much as other strains, I still found my taste senses have enhanced more than when I&#39;m high, so I&#39;d advise you prepare yourself a pizza or snacks for this experience. Overall this is a great strain, myself and all my friends have enjoyed it, so go out and get yourself a bag of tangerine dream and you shouldn&#39;t be disappointed.

Vit&#39;s very nice strain.. i would give a 8.5 out of 10.. it&#39;s not sativa but it doesn&#39;t have body high either..it has dreamy, stoney nice high leaves you with dry eyes..

VPotent, delicious, fun, and confusing. The nugs are crumbly and a little sticky. A little dab will definitely do ya. You&#39;ll want to get a lot done at first, but at peak you&#39;ll probably need to sit your ass down and laugh for about half an hour. It&#39;ll feel like two whole hours though I guess. Anyway, advice for this strain: you can always have more, but once you&#39;ve smoked too much there&#39;s no going back.

VA personal favourite from the folks at Aurora Medical in Calagry. Tight, orange buds that broke out huge. My batch was bursting with flavour when smoked. Couch lock should be an expected side effect.

VI tested this strain for the first time today. I was absolutely productive ! It has a strong tangerine smell and taste. The bud is not sticky which is great for rolling up. Tangerine Dream gives a great head high.  Prefect smoke before work. \u000aIg: @Bigicethebeatuty

VI picked up an 1/8 of Tangerine Dream grown by Alternative Medicine Association. Wow this strain is Bi-polar! The first time I medicated I was relaxed. The pain melted away. Very nice indica feel. The second time, woooooo!!! I was up and energetic. Very talkative. spent 2 hours on the phone with my mom which is weird because I avoid her calls like the plague. Both times left me happy and euphoric. I am definitely keeping this strain around for a day I want to be surprised what kind of feeling I will get. lol!!

So take this review with a pinch of salt unless you are growing outdoors...I don\u2019t think these are suited to outdoor growing. The taste and smell and strength wasn\u2019t great on mine.

This is your happy go lucky strain.  How on earth can you go wrong with a mix of G-13, Neville&#39;s Haze and Afghani?   I want to hang out and be free and feel alive again and this strain is made for that. \u000aThere can be a spaciness to wander through at times but that&#39;s no reason to fear.  The playful nature you&#39;ll gain from consuming this wonderfully light and airy bud will tickle your fancy for sure.

VI&#39;ve been smoking grass for over thirty years and this is hands-down the best. Not the most potent, but potent  enough. It&#39;s like a nice French champagne, effervescent with lovely citrus notes. No freakiness or paranoia here, nor stupidity. This pot makes you a better human (at least temporarily)...more open-minded, more fun embracing, less judgmental. I find it organically grown and well tended at Green Anne in Seattle.

VThis is definitely one of my favorite day time strains. It knocks out nerve pain like a champ and doesn&#39;t leave me foggy or lethargic. It is a great work strain without the jitters or anxiety. Do be careful. It is potent and too much can leave you stoney for a little while. While it is great for most pain, it is not one that I&#39;ve found to help with headaches. All aspects hold true for both concentrate and flower.

VPicked up Tangerine Dream on the advice of a budtender at Canopi-Blue Diamond here in Vegas. I was looking for a daytime strain that wouldn&#39;t give me anxiety. Yep, this certainly fit the bill! Uplifting, yet VERY relaxing bud that tastes great and just makes you feel really good. My entire spine is degenerated and I literally crushed my tailbone. I&#39;m also very much a lightweight newbie in the Cannabis world, but this wasn&#39;t overwhelming when I hit it lightly. I have hit it hard a couple times, but it just made me take a nap. No panic. No racing heartbeat. Good, relaxing vibes, allowing you to carry on with your day!! I highly recommend to literally anyone!

VThis is, undoubtedly, one of the finest strains I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of smoking.  Smooth going in, and even smooother effects.  This one enhances most of the senses, allows free and clear thoughts, and lasts longer than most.  i was able to secure some medical grade quality and the word I can use to express my thoughts about this strain is WOW!  The only negative is drymouth, but that&#39;s just about the same with every other strain I&#39;ve smoked.  A must try

You&#39;ll want to get a lot done at first, but at peak you&#39;ll probably need to sit your ass down and laugh for about half an hour. It&#39;ll feel like two whole hours though I guess.

VI got this strain as recommendation from my budtender to treat depression, and I have to say that this was a STELLAR recommendation! She definitely hit it out of the park.\u000a\u000aI actually ended up trying this strain for the first time yesterday afternoon after waking up from a nap to some moderate-severe pain in my left arm due to tendinitis. I&#39;ve had bouts of tendinitis in this arm off and on since high school, and I think the recent resurgence has something to do with swinging around heavy doors at work; at any rate, my entire left forearm was on fire.\u000a\u000aHaving just woken up from a nap, I wanted something that would give me a bit of a &quot;pick me up&quot;, but also serve to relieve my pain... so I decided to light up some Tangerine Dream.\u000a\u000aFirst of all, this strain smells unbelievable. I thought Pineapple Express gave me those strong tropical vibes and citrus notes... This strain hardly smells like weed. It smells like fresh oranges with just a little bit of dankness thrown in (and even then, it&#39;s almost like a sort of... spice). Needless to say, the aroma alone had me excited to try this strain out. It made me happy just smelling it!\u000a\u000aOf course, the taste was equally as amazing. Got a few more pungent, hashy notes mixed in with juicy citrus on the inhale, with a very warm, sweet citrus taste on the exhale, and a very small hashy aftertaste. After maybe 4 hits or so from my bong, my arm wasn&#39;t hurting so much anymore; a couple more hits and the pain was gone, and I was floating in a blissful, bubbly euphoria, just hanging out up in my room and watching some Youtube videos.\u000a\u000aAfter I finished I came downstairs and played online games with my boyfriend... then the munchies set in. First it was a craving for ice cream sandwiches... then I thought of fresh-baked motherfucking cookies. So I got up, and (somehow) baked some motherfucking cookies. They were damn good, too, and let me tell you, you haven&#39;t lived until you&#39;ve tried an ice cream sandwich made with freshly baked white and milk chocolate chip cookies.\u000a\u000aThis strain would be great for anything. It&#39;s great if you want to get up and do stuff, great to just sit around and watch Youtube or play video games with... and I don&#39;t know how someone could stay depressed with some of this in their system. I was pain-free, uplifted, and had a grand old time; probably some of the most fun I&#39;ve ever had while high, even though I really didn&#39;t even do all that much!\u000a\u000aIt might also be worth noting that the strain doesn&#39;t have as strong of a &quot;weed&quot; aroma when smoked, either: I was worried that my room would smell super dank after smoking that, because it was hot outside and I didn&#39;t want to open the window and let out the cool air. When I went back to my room for the night, I was pleasantly surprised at how mild of a smell still lingered. Nothing like hotboxing myself in my room with something like, say, God&#39;s Gift. (Or even the Bubble Gum I have, which, for some reason, REALLY reeks.)\u000a\u000aThere are a few minor negatives with this strain, the main just being your run-of-the-mill dry eyes that can be fixed with a few eye drops. I also did notice a little bit of paranoia for the first time, but that was mainly because a family member had come over to work on something in the garage, and I was worried that they would smell the weed; nothing overwhelming or super anxiety-triggering though. I just chilled upstairs with my phone and Youtube until they left.\u000a\u000aIn summary, this is an awesome strain for depression, pain, and even managed to help with my chronic fatigue (seriously, I never have the energy to bake cookies). Also an all-around awesome strain for some social smoking and just straight up having fun while stoned. I&#39;ll make sure I pick up some more of this in the future!

VFantastic!\u000a You ever smoked something and mid way through crushing some up and smelling it you say, &quot;Man I smoked this somewhere before in the past. I recognize this weed?&quot;\u000a\u000aWell I think every rec shop that has this on the menu should offer a money back guarantee if not satisfied.  My guess is, it would never come back.  This is your happy go lucky strain.  How on earth can you go wrong with a mix of G-13, Neville&#39;s Haze and Afghani?   I want to hang out and be free and feel alive again and this strain is made for that. \u000aThere can be a spaciness to wander through at times but that&#39;s no reason to fear.  The playful nature you&#39;ll gain from consuming this wonderfully light and airy bud will tickle your fancy for sure. Guaranteed you&#39;ll float on into your very own tangerine day dream too, just like I did.

VTangerine Dream does not live up to it&#39;s name. The taste is marginal at best. The only flavor I could detect was a dull woody taste. The high was not too much better. It came on hard at first with a touch of anxiety. The anxiety soon wained. But unfortunately the high went with it. The buds didn&#39;t look to have much trichs. But I was hopeful considering  label showed 29% THC. Just goes to show you that quality is not commensurate with THC content. Don&#39;t be seduced by labels. Let your nose and eyes be the guide. All experienced stoners know what good weed smells and looks like.

VI picked up an 1/8 of Tangerine Dream grown by Alternative Medicine Association. Wow this strain is Bi-polar! The first time I medicated I was relaxed. The pain melted away. Very nice indica feel. The second time, woooooo!!! I was up and energetic. Very talkative. spent 2 hours on the phone with my mom which is weird because I avoid her calls like the plague. Both times left me happy and euphoric. I am definitely keeping this strain around for a day I want to be surprised what kind of feeling I will get. lol!!

VThis strain is astoundingly good at pain relief and relaxation.  I was told before I tried it that I might want to take it when I wanted to alphabetize my spice rack,  but my experience so far has not been like that.  It&#39;s super relaxing like I want to just lie there on the couch and watch the world go by and be happy.  Most strains that give me pain relief and relaxation put me to sleep because once I&#39;m relaxed my brain just shuts down it&#39;s so tired, but this allowed me to stay awake and enjoy the goings-on around me.  I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to do cerebral work on this strain, but I&#39;d love to go to a movie or concert with this!

Vthe tangerine dream I got was from buddy boy farms. it was suppose to smell of citrus. it did not. not even a hint. but buddy boy usually doesn&#39;t bring out the terpenes  very well. all the flower I&#39;ve gotten by them just smells of hay. the high came on hard and fast, which was nice. it tested at 18% thc. so I was expecting it hit pretty decent. the high was energentic at first. after a couple bowls it felt all indica. I had a real hard time staying focused and motivated. all and all it was good, I wish the high would have lasted a little longer and stayed more on the sativa side. I got a hour or so of buzz. which I&#39;m not complaining about. I got this 4 for $40 at Mr. bills of Buckley. This is Better than most buddy boy I&#39;ve tried. They seem to be getting things in order. well manicured. tight, dense nugs. the packaging is better than the little blue bottles they started with. I really want to like buddy boy a lot. They a amazing selection of strains. I would really like to see them put out a great product. not there yet but seem to be going down the right track now. if this is around, and at a decent price give it a try.

VBought at Barney&#39;s, Amsterdam. Pretty damn strong with a powerful citrusy flavor yet sweet flavor. Feels very sativa dominant at peak with a very indica-like buzz at the end and occasional spikes in alertness. Not recommended if you want to get a lot of work done.\u000aThis is an ideal strain to smoke at the end of the day, around 2-3 hours before going to sleep.

VI love Tangerine Dream! The Giving Tree Wellness Center in Mesa did this plant some justice! I&#39;ve tried Tangerine Dream from other dispensaries and with out sounding like a jerk to the other growers...you&#39;re not doing it right! VERY green with a LOT of orange. Very heady high which eventually melts into a nice body high that leads to great pain killing properties. When vaped this strain it has an unbelievable taste! I buy as much as I can when this pops up on my dispensaries (The Giving Tree Wellness Center in Mesa, AZ) menu not only because its my favorite strain but EVERY time they grow this beautiful plant it comes out phenomenal.

VThis was a lighter hybrid. It has a happy, slightly euphoric sensation with a heavy body stone. It seems to carry the body sinking high of its predecessor G13, but without the sleeping effects, which makes it a great late afternoon or early evening hit because you still have the energy and desire to get things done, but you have the relaxed body set of a solid indica session.\u000a\u000aIt is also a bit of a creeper so hits you heavier as the evening progresses. It was great for anxiety although I found it bad with pain as I noticed my injury more, although it didn&#39;t hurt like it normaly does it certainly made me more aware of its exsitance.

Great bud for beginners.   It made us laugh, paranoia was minimal, snacking was required.   It didn&#39;t feel as sedating as Blue Dream.  Harlequin had less paranoia/anxiety however Tangerine Dream felt more euphoric.

VWe have to admit that this herb taste awesome!!!! It&#39;s like tasting a brandy coated tropical salad. If you ever smoked or vaped Tangerine Kush, it&#39;s almost the same except without the Hashish-like notes but still sweet. In term of buzz, trippy cerebral at first but fast you&#39;ll be couch-lock. You have to control your dosage a lot with this one. Too much for me in fact. I only loved the first half-hour on this one.

VHighly recommend for those of us who need strong medicine. Would not recommend to first timers. The flower I got was lime green with orange hairs all over, fairly dense but not rock hard. Smelled of oranges and the first hit instantly gets you high. Nice mix of indica and sativa properties, overall an amazing flower that is definitely one of new favorites glad I Tryed it.

Head buzz nice &amp; strong but also smooth/not overwhelming. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (an absolute must for me). Body buzz very comfy; was able to get a workout in this eve! 2 1/2 hours later body high is just startin to wear off. Nice, lasts longer than some. I can see having couch lock if I have too much as this one. Highly recommend for after work/late afternoon use! :-)

VI love love love this stuff, it&#39;s yummy!!\u000aThe terp profile gives this strain it&#39;s standout flavor and fragrance. It&#39;s got a nice kick without being making you to hyped or edgy as some sativa heavy strains can do.\u000aNice and mellow and tasty as a Dreamsicle (the familiar orange popsicle treat filled w/ vanilla ice cream). I&#39;ve noted that after burnin&#39; one down in a room and then returning to the room some 1/2 hour later the orangy/ vanilla creamy scent still hangs in the air as if several people were eating that frozen treat. This is a true connoisseur strain. Be sure to pick some up if you get the chance.\u000aThe T-Dream I&#39;ve been privy to tops out at about 22-23% THC, but I&#39;ve seen it as low as 16%. It&#39;s. all good though for that flavor profile especially when freshly cured.

VGrown from seed by Barney&#39;s Farm\u000a\u000aRipe at day 65\u000a\u000aStrong tangerine smell that makes your senses tingle, and clears your head. Buds were pretty loose, even scrogged under a 400w to herself. Great for lack of appetite and does well as a pain reliever. Great head high leads into a lazy body buzz

VThis strain was obtained from Starfire in the NW Cannabis Market in Seattle and has a sweet, Haze-like aroma that hints at it&#39;s namesake. Sweet fruitiness in a flavorful smoke. Very sticky buds produce a solid medium-long duration high that is exactly as described by Leafly.

VI love this strain; I paint for hours and hours without break while smoking it; it makes me an unstoppable painting machine; the higher end dosages provides what I would refer to as an &#39;opiating&#39; effect; which is fantastic; since I use it to help me not be so edgy and to get to sleep.\u000a\u000aGoes very well with Tangerine Dream&#39;s (The band...) music.

VTangerine Dream is one of my favorite strains. it really helps me with stress and depression. The sweet orange taste and smooth smoke are unforgettable. The thing i love most is that it is a great med for day or night time use. During the day I stay focused and energized. Then at the end of a busy day its great for unwinding and relaxing. Its versatile and somehow work with your schedule and life, no matter how relaxed or busy it is.

VMy go-to strain in the morning to help you wake up make chores/exercise a breeze.  Versatile enough that if you use enough, can give a user a clear-headed but stoney indica feel for evening use as well.  Sometimes it can make me dizzy, though, so slow down and let a hit or two take effect if you&#39;re not used to it.  Other than that, it has a  great taste and smell.  Recommended!

This took my pain away instantly! Be careful though it&#39;s easy to over do it. Then you&#39;ll be worthless the rest of the night. After you eat the whole fridge. Seriously through this is my go to now for pain relief. And I love the smell it leaves on your fingers. Like sweet tangerines.  &#128525;

VI&#39;ve been smoking grass for over thirty years and this is hands-down the best. Not the most potent, but potent  enough. It&#39;s like a nice French champagne, effervescent with lovely citrus notes. No freakiness or paranoia here, nor stupidity. This pot makes you a better human (at least temporarily)...more open-minded, more fun embracing, less judgmental. I find it organically grown and well tended at Green Anne in Seattle.

VNice scent in the bag and on exhale was citrusy, and cool like peppermint. This is a very friendly strain, upbeat, not overwhelming with just a few breaths, nice for doing things around the house or sociably without having a brain cloud, enhances sense of touch so should be good for better sex.\u000aGreen Ghost is listed as the grower. Just noticed that harvest date is nearly a year ago. Got at New Vansterdam in Vancouver.

It is possible I may try it again in the future to rule out possible reaction simply because I have never had this experience with any other strain. \u000a\u000aOverall, I suggest this strain for those that want to chill after work or hang out with friends.

VWhat I tried was potent and tasted good. Also smelled amazing but the description here was not true for me. This strain in particular effected my short-term memory badly and made me tired. My body felt relaxed but not exactly pain-free. My disposition was positive and happy but I wasn&#39;t in the clouds or anything. I was still able to function fine after one bowl but not at my peak performance. And I was yawning ALL day after smoking. I liked Blue Dream better in comparison. I have a moderate to high tolerance, so take this into consideration when you develop an expectation for this strain.

VDefinitely does not live up to the hype. Not sure how this won a cannabis cup but I&#39;ve grown and smoked this strain and have been disappointed. It takes a good 70 days to mature. The buds are impressive in size but get kinda fluffy. The smell is good, citrus tangerine scents. However, the flavor reminds me of the smell of an old dirty shoe. Won&#39;t be keeping this one in the grow lineup.
