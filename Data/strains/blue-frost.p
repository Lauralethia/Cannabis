VDelicious daytime strain. Hints of blueberry and grated cheese in the flavor. Sounds a little odd, tastes amazing. High is really nice, very heady mellow euphoria, some body effects, not at all sleepy. Great first thing in the morning, or anytime of day. Also, will not keep you up like some other morning buds can. Not ideal for falling asleep, but also does not cause trouble falling asleep. Mellows out anxiety, no dry mouth or eyes, no major affect on appetite.

VSmell is very interesting... lightly floral followed by a sharp cheese scent. It&#39;s an unexplainably addictive scent , catch myself continuously smelling this strain.  Looks dark green with slight hints of blue.  I experience a calm head high with relaxation of the body.  I like this strain a lot for its versatility, being able to socialize or watch a movie.  I notice that even an hour and a half after intake I was still getting little waves of euphoria.  Very happy relaxed strain. \u000a

VThis strain is amazing!! I give every aspect of it top shelf. Smells great, very easy to pick up blueberry cheescake, very sweet.\u000aFlowers were beautify colored and dense. You literally can&#39;t keep your nose out of the container, even while you&#39;re  smoking.\u000aThe high took all of 45 seconds to kick in. Smoked 1/2 king cone 1st sitting. Immediately felt the stress melting off me. Calm happy mood (and I was actually pretty pissed earlier). The high lasted about 45 minutes, smoked the other half and it comes back full swing. Some strains are hard to reup with, start to not feel it. So far so good with this,  been maintaining the high for 3 hrs now don&#39;t feel burnes out.\u000aAlso very comfortable, not sleepy. Not stuck in one spot, but also kool watching a movie. Some Sativas give you that can&#39;t sit still feeling, this one gives you the head buzz but not all that need to reorganize you screw drawer in the tool box.\u000aGreat daytime meds, if you suffer from any sort of anxiety or similar ailments,  this will make you smile.

VThis is a near perfect half &amp; half strain. Heavy hitting. Seems like having Jack Herer in the genetics of hybrids and indicas really change its effects. I am mainly a Sativa sativa/dominant type of person, but a few indica hybrids have been intriguing me lately. This is no exception. Flavorful, energetic and some pain relief. One bong load and you&#39;ll be good to go. Or not. Good for watching funny shows or a scary movie too! This strain makes me feel relaxed but focused and normal. Great grower too from AZ nat selections Peoria. I&#39;m impressed yet again.

Vamazing strain, versatile is the word here. a true hybrid that shows little both indica and sativa traits. keeps you upbeat and running while being mildly stoned which is awesome. mine was 17% so it&#39;s mild and hits smooth almost menthol like tasting while smelling incredible. truly good times shit here, worth getting as much as you can get your hands on! indica chill comes later and let&#39;s you down gently like riding a cloud. in my top 5 now,ceres nailed this one!

VFor the second time I&#39;m sharing the day with Blue Frost, a supposed indica dominant hybrid that acts like more of a sativa dominant hybrid on me for some reason.&#160; I am vaping Blue Frost in a cartridge by Select Strains, my favorite brand, and it tested at 84.7% THC and .28% CBD, which is much higher than the carts I&#39;ve purchased lately so you can imagine how fast and high I am getting!&#160;&#160;\u000a\u000aIt tastes delicious - like blueberries with a hint of eucalpytus, and it is packing a punch!&#160; I am awake, giggly, and feeling frisky, and tripping out on house music, each note piping in with its own distinct entrance and titillating my eardrums and heartbeat.&#160;&#160;\u000a\u000aLast weekend I smoked this on a first date with a Pilot and when he kissed me goodbye I felt the earth move under my feet, just like in that song.&#160; We enjoyed some savory blue frost kisses before departing and for that reason this strain will always be a fave of mine!

VThis is a near perfect half &amp; half strain. Heavy hitting. Seems like having Jack Herer in the genetics of hybrids and indicas really change its effects. I am mainly a Sativa sativa/dominant type of person, but a few indica hybrids have been intriguing me lately. This is no exception. Flavorful, energetic and some pain relief. One bong load and you&#39;ll be good to go. Or not. Good for watching funny shows or a scary movie too! This strain makes me feel relaxed but focused and normal. Great grower too from AZ nat selections Peoria. I&#39;m impressed yet again.

VBeautiful to look at and smells of slight diesel with a smooth fruity taste . Nice frosty nugs  with green foliage against blue hues ! Just pretty ! The over all buzz is a body and head sensation with it all in the head for mellow and pleasing thoughts . Can enjoy any adventure with this bus . A great pain reliever and forget about the stress indica !

VThe first hit immediately gave me a good head buzz, accompanied by a rolling couch lock increasing in strength as time went on. This strain has a great blueberry flavor on the inhale, and an interestingly great mix of what tastes like Cheese OG and Blueberry Kush on the exhale. This strain&#39;s smell is slightly challenging to contain, and smells like a spicy, earthy, blueberry. It has a medium throat hit and it&#39;s not the most powerful or the highest yield, I&#39;ve ever had in flower form but this strain is not to be underestimated!

VFor the second time I&#39;m sharing the day with Blue Frost, a supposed indica dominant hybrid that acts like more of a sativa dominant hybrid on me for some reason.&#160; I am vaping Blue Frost in a cartridge by Select Strains, my favorite brand, and it tested at 84.7% THC and .28% CBD, which is much higher than the carts I&#39;ve purchased lately so you can imagine how fast and high I am getting!&#160;&#160;\u000a\u000aIt tastes delicious - like blueberries with a hint of eucalpytus, and it is packing a punch!&#160; I am awake, giggly, and feeling frisky, and tripping out on house music, each note piping in with its own distinct entrance and titillating my eardrums and heartbeat.&#160;&#160;\u000a\u000aLast weekend I smoked this on a first date with a Pilot and when he kissed me goodbye I felt the earth move under my feet, just like in that song.&#160; We enjoyed some savory blue frost kisses before departing and for that reason this strain will always be a fave of mine!

This batch was a little leafy I wouldn&#39;t know if that is related to the strain or just sloppy trimmers but it came off easily by hand and will be used for bho soon ! Flowers out the bing have a subtle taste and burn slow. Not my favorite but definitely still a dank strain. Really hits my forehead after a few hits.

VI&#39;m a regular smoker who likes variety, so I&#39;ve smoked pretty much every strain they carry at the dispensaries in the Seattle area, but this strain is one of the best. It&#39;s super relaxing and kills all of my pain, but my mind is alert and I&#39;m not lethargic or sleepy as many indica leaning strains tend to do. I&#39;d say it&#39;s more of a 50/50 hybrid in terms of effects, but it hits as hard as many indica strains in terms of pain relief. I smoked a bowl with maybe 1/8th of a gram and didn&#39;t need to head back for more.
