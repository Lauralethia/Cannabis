VPicked up some live sugar and shatter wax of this strain.  Tasty, citrusy flavor. Felt like I had a ton of energy and was super focused.  Made me a bit chatty...  Great smoke for a day outside or if you just need to clean the house.

VI&#39;m not too big on Sativa Highs but the one you get from this is amazing. It made me really focus on the television, I felt like my head was the TV and my body just want anywhere around. It has a very good Sweetish Sourish Taste. The actual buds smell delicious and are very sticky. Dope Strain

VI\u2019ve never reviewed a strain on here before, nor do I feel educated enough on the subject to do so. However I have enough experience to know that this strain is the absolute BEST mid-day, pick-me-up, strain I\u2019ve ever smoked. I was so fried the colonel would have been proud, and I still felt like I could have aced a job interview if need be (minus the piss test of course). I tend to get anxious when smoking sativa dominants, but this one kept me focused and stoned while melting all my worries and sorrows away. Also, not only does this strain make me hornier than a 15 year old boy, but my girlfriend is also sad that I\u2019m almost out of it due to my \u201cincreased performance in bed\u201d. All around this is probably the best sativa dominant I\u2019ve ever got my hands on, and you NEED to get your hands on it if you get the chance.

VHoly wow, got 7 grams of this super sticky, gummy, amazingly scented wax and two small dabs later I&#39;m slack-jawed and staring at my TV screen. Surprised by a low-moderate munchies craving, I had wobbly legs and an incredibly satisfied mindset, crawled into bed and slept beautifully. The stickiness could definitely be a pain but once in a suitable container it&#39;s no longer an issue. Highly recommended!

VThis wonderful lemony OG is the palate cleanser both in the way it taste and the effect on the body. Whether it&#39;s been a series of  a sativa mind/energy fix or an indica body/pain management strain, this one will balance it all out. I enjoyed using the Sour Lemon OG as a way to transition between indica and sativa strains. My MS was happy to get some much needed sleep without the &quot;dude where&#39;s my car&quot; loopy-ness.  I would recommend Sour Lemon OG to MS&#39;ers who may need to balance out after a strong  series of indica/sativa medication

VHad 2 Bowl hits and was completely paranoid wanted to throw up and I&#39;m not a lightweight either. Passed out in front of a school. Tastes good its smooth. I&#39;m just pretty sure it was laces, but it still makes you paranoid laced or not

VI were smoking this a couple days ago... And well the taste were fantastic. And except for the taste being fantastic the body high were even greater it took me on an adventure. it felt like i left my body and flew away. It felt like i were an alien in a human body at that i would crawl out of it like a butterfly from it&#39;s thingy. I were free and it lasted for like 2 hours. And eating sour food while being stoned wer awesome i ate an orange and the taste were stronger than ever. It helped against depression and i got my Apptite back. I Got adhd and this helped me alot tru my depression and anger problems i couldn&#39;t get amd at anything not even when i wobbled and hit my knee into the table or when my friend wanted to fight ( We been seeing who&#39;s the strongest a long time) . I recommend this highly. So it get 4 Stars not the best but One of them
