VI gave t his 4 stars, because It is a Great strain and Ithink the one I got could have been grown better. But the overall experience was Good. Pain relief was great but in larger doses. I found that it is kinda short lived. Maybe 2-2.5 hours of pain relief. The high lasts a bit longer than the pain relief. By the time I felt like medicating again for the pain, I was still lightly buzzing.. Really great High though. It&#39;s uplifting and cheerful. Kinda Goofy and silly to smoke with this. Had me doing goofy things, saying things without thinking.Doing things without thinking. Thinking out loud. I kinda felt it dumbed me down a bit. I wouldnt smoke this if you have to go to court or a Job interview. But if you want to enjoy your day and still be focused and  functional....not couch locked this is great. Great wakenbake and midday medication. Uppity and cheerful are always a good thing to be.

VDelicious. The cough is gonna happen don&#39;t fight it. It&#39;s not heavy in flavor or aroma. The flavor is sweet and light. I only use bongs so I can&#39;t vouch for dry smoke flavors.  But I&#39;m normally a 3-4 med sized bowls to get me high, this shit got me there in 2. And it says sativa dominant so the heady shit is there but it got me stuck on the couch like a mother fucker.  (I smoked like 20 min ago and I&#39;m still haf.) But it&#39;s not a bad stuck on the couch, I&#39;m writing this and watching a baseball game with full coherency.  If you find some And I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.

VI am having a very difficult time growing this strain. I am also growing ICE, which is the father to this strain I think, and it is doing very well. the biggest challenges have been, leaf claw, and no clones have survived, while all of the ICE clones survived. Also the branches are growing in very inconsistent heights, making it difficult to get even light and penetration with the LED. I am gonna try sprouting a new seed and going one more time before discarding this strain.

VI have and am growing several Nirvana strains that use their infamous Ice strain in the parentage and it is such a winner!! It is paired with a Cambodian Landrace which makes this strain even better, I am partial to Landrace strains that are grown just as God created them, all good medicine.

Vin veg she can handle a beating and lots of abuse. she bounces right back. make sure to top lots, lst, and bush her out wide. i easily filled a 4x4 tent corner to corner under a 600w hps with solid dense nugs by harvest. i ran her in rockwool on a recirculating drip system under a scrog for 68 days before harvest. she handles cloning and being cloned very well. during flush she puts of blue and purple tones especially during a colder night cycle. the smell was amazing, smelt  like a skunk carwash, pinesol, tropical everything, lemons, berries, and something ripe. tasted like lemon pez, pound cake, berries, bananas,  and bubble gum so far. she was glistening in trichomes and dense as baseballs.  much love to nirvana seeds and seed supreme for the hook up!

VI picked up 7 strains on oct 1, this stuff was gorgeous and had the best smell out of all of them, it had a sweet/sour flavor there was a very silvery after smell (I don&#39;t know how else to put it into words), rasberry is actually pretty spot on for a name. The high was very clear but permagrin is definitely a side effect (not a bad thing) decent body high I really didn&#39;t feel the expanse in the lungs that others mention, but then I don&#39;t cough easy. I wouldn&#39;t say this is the craziest or powerful strain but it does the job and if you want something in the mids with a very uplifting high, look no further

VCough strains have such great flavor -- this one tastes like raspberries and cream. Nice and mellow, no characteristic sativa race.

VOne of my favorite sativas. Very uplifting. Not too heady of a high. Perfect for a social gathering or a walk in the woods. The flavor will not disappoint either.

VGot this @ urban green house $9.98 gram special.. so I got 3.3g. FTB... Buds were big healthy 1 grm nuggets. Dense with brownish hairs. Taste was of raspberry pine. More bitter then sweet. Creeper upper.. Super head high with bad cotton mouth.

VFor some reason this stuff knocks me on my ass, consistently.  Makes me really sleepy/dopey.  Doesn&#39;t seem anything like a sativa.  Maybe the store put the wrong stuff in the container, but I doubt it.  Weird.
