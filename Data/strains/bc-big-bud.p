VUsing Magic Flight Launch Box, Very Low Dosage.\u000aNice, controllable head high. No added anxiety. No added Paranoia. Good strain to be creative, or to help you get things done around the house. \u000aI didn&#39;t have that ants-In-the-pants feeling but I did have a deep desire to increase my creative output -- for me, this is not a watch Tee Vee on the couch strain.\u000aVaporized, it had a great earthen taste. A deep loam that doesn&#39;t overpower the taste so much as it takes up the space where other tastes would be.

VI think this strain is great! It smells very piney and a little fruity when your not high but when you are really high it smells like fruit. I&#39;m high right now off of this stuff and I feel very very relaxed happy and everything seems like I&#39;m looking out of a bubble. Made me very  hungry until I ate a giant supper.  This strain does not make you giggly) It does make me feel very sleepy though. I really recommend this strajn! Not as good as wonder woman OG but its still a very good strain! #420blazeit

VIts a heavy dry mouth if you vape it higher than normal like 1 or 2 C&#186;+ degree&#39;s. Its smell and bud structure remind me of ship wreck and its a slight euphoric but more of a hungry strain than spacey. Perfect for getting my hunger up, it does kill my depression and my disorders. I haven&#39;t been eating much today so more of this tomorrow and we&#39;ll see :D. I feel very relaxed a heavy sleepy wave washes over me like a title wave lol its great for a pain killer glaucoma and cramps with nausea being killed this is a good strain but its just so dry.

VThe buds I bought weren&#39;t very typical to the BC BIG BUD strain. Hence my 4 stars rather than 5. I&#39;m originally from Vancouver BC so I was stoked when I heard my guy had some. Unfortunately the visual aspect isn&#39;t as pleasing.... FORTUNATELY the smoke and effect is true to nature. Great strain to smoke any time of the day. Calming body effect, stimulating enough mentally that it provides a full experience... as opposed to say the Cinderella Dream I just purchased, another hybrid, albeit sativa dominant, but the balanced qualities just don&#39;t exist on the same level. Buy, enjoy - BC BIG BUD.

VWith DBV: Wonderfully peppery and citrus in taste, fragrance, and flavor!

This is such a nice dense vape it always hits me in the stomach and allows me to eat. Great for anorexic&#39;s and pain, and if you feeling a bit of goofy like a noodle, has uplifting and happy notes relaxes me and tastes of skunk but more pungent berry tastes not harsh like a hash plant able to absorb all the vape how this makes me feel a depression killer for sure great if you have no appetite. Dry mouth and dry eyes. Very Euphoric all around my head and face 185C&#186; vape very happy moods and tones very impressed on how this is making me feel.
