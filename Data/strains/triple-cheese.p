VSo cheesy. Super relaxing and heavy. Started up a fever for a minute, then went into a soothing body high. Like I was wrapped in fleece fresh out of the dryer. Feeling a little slow on this. \u000aNice earthy background that can get a little sour too. I will definitely get more.

V\u000aI\u2019m a habitual cannabis user with a strong tolerance and usually more drawn to Sativa hybrid but have been experimenting with uplifting indicas and budddie is this a find!\u000a\u000aDeep Relaxation , kinda minty in the mind uplifted, creative insight and thought provoking. Tingly and pleasurable. Very cheesy pungent taste, nice on the exhale. Medium couch lock upon sitting but earlier when I was walking no difficulty. \u000a\u000aKnee pain gone. Gastro pain diminished. \u000a\u000aDefinitely in a better mood than earlier leas stressed and a nice relaxation that will probably lull me to sleep in a few hours.

VSo far this is my favorite indica ive got from lake effect. My bud tender did a great job telling about the strain and offered a very inviting smell. Once I had a chance to try it, it&#39;s kinda of a creeper. I was very pleased. I will be buy this strain again. I hope you get a chance to try it.

VVery easy plant to grow. Flowered for 10wks. When the flowers are alive they smell like blueberries with a little funk. After drying and curing the smell turn into blueberries and a little sweet cream. Potent medical strain! My body was buzzing from head to my toes for hours.
