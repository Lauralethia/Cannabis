VHella body lock. It&#39;s great for night time or going out with friends if you need to remain mentally sharp. I was in bed last night watching tv and couldn&#39;t feel my body. It was great. There isn&#39;t too much of a head high, for me, at least, which is kinda disappointing, but it&#39;s an India after all. Would recommend for anyone trying to straight up relax. Good shit.\u000a\u000a As always, Peace, Love, &amp; Purp

VAlthough this is an indica, I didn&#39;t get sleepy right away.  I felt a little of a sativa high at the beginning but no paranoia.  Near the end of the high it was time for sleep.  Great strain to just chill out and watch some Netflix. I&#39;m prone to paranoia but this strain did not bring that out. :)

VThe sweet aroma and earthy tones, help to make this girls flavor and terpene profile unmistakable and incredibly delicious. The effects are a clear headed indica that doesn&#39;t overtake you like couchlock. This strain is perfect for pain, nausea, and anxiety. Completely covered in resin, this bud is very dense when grown organically.

VSmells like minty cocoa...smooth taste with a slightly minty finish with my vape. I took 3 hits and was overwhelmed with euphoria! Dancing and grooving to the Talking Heads for over an hour. Stimming to the  iTunes visualizer afterwards. Good, simple-minded fun! I found it hard to contain myself in the beginning, as I was doing dancing laps inside my house! This strain would be great at a party or an outdoor concert. Very, very satisfying!

VOne of my top 10 strains now. \u000aOne of my favorite strains at the moment. It&#39;s one of the smoothest hitting weed out there. I thought that it was gonna be couch weed at first but it was actually very uplifting and energizing. I was super alert and had that nice feeling behind the eyes without looking super Asian. Also loved the sweet taste it had and the draw was very nice. I didn&#39;t cough one time smoking this weed. Highly recommended. \u000a

VFor my tastes, this was perfect. A nice, mellow body high with a functional mental buzz. Some small hints what I call the TJ&#39;s (Tired-Jollies), which was similar to a mood-enhancer/lift but with a bit of silliness in there.
