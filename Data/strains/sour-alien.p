VThis is a fairly decent strain; THC ranged between 20-25% yet it wasn&#39;t overwhelming potent. Buds are Christmas tree cola&#39;s in a light green shade with short bright orange hairs on them. My batch had a light Kush smell to it. It breaks down fairly easily and quite nicely, not too chunky but not powdery either. The high is a quick onset, with immediate mood uplifting affects (along with a slight visual distortions), a smile creeps in, and relaxation sets in. The Indica high is dominant but doesn&#39;t overpower the Sour D high. It&#39;s definitely a couch-locker but it isn&#39;t overly sedative nor narcotic like thanks to the Sativa side brought by the Sour D (which lends minor focus/creativity as well as slight psychedelic effects to the high.) After an hour and a half to 2 hours the Sativa side starts to wear off leaving one tired and in need of another bowl though. Overall I&#39;d buy it again and give it a 4 star rating; it&#39;s good quality flower but nothing spectacular.

VBH0 (shatter): A daytime favorite for those days that demand work and focus but require the alleviation of depression and lack of motivation symptoms. Although this is a Indica dominate strain it has a energetic nature that is undeniable and would make end of the day stress relief not as complete. The smooth, full vapor was filled with citrus notes and a delicious tip of the tongue aftertaste. A definite must have for active patients however the flowers of this strain may produce a heavy more sedative stone as certain terpenes and/or cannabinoids may have been left behind during the extraction.\u000a(Exclusive Extracts: Exclusive Limited Headstash- Full Dewax Nug Run)

Puts your two lungs to work. Combined with a nice sour, gas /Alien kush genetics taste, it&#39;s better than a damn fine cup of coffee. I&#39;m able to focus as it has a nice numbing effect.

I was able to get a lot done, but also have the more pleasant effects of a heady indica. No real couch lock. Took away stress a feel good giggly high. very talkative. A good social high.

VGave it a 5. A solid escaping feel. Felt a little tingly while watching TV. Will definitely use this after a long day of work to just unwind for a bit and go to bed. Didn&#39;t feel hungry at all.

VThis is an awesome strain. One of the best cerebral highs I&#39;ve had in a while. All of my pain went away in no time. It&#39;s a fun one to enjoy with friends. Music seemed so much better. Alien had a few purple leaves too. I definitely plan on getting it again.

VIt&#39;s a nice strain for getting deep into interesting science videos and stuff. However moreso than any other strain, this seems to have a harsh comedown and hangover complete with headaches and restless limbs. Maybe I&#39;m just sensitive to that sort of thing (although other strains do not do the same), so if you&#39;re not, you&#39;ll enjoy it. But for me, it&#39;s just not good enough to warrant the after effects.

VSo-so. Get&#39;s me a bit high but nothing really special about this stuff to me. Strange because I like Sour D and Alien Kush. At least no anxiety. This has on occasion relieved my head ache. Though another time it gave me a head ache. It definitely has some effect on the way one&#39;s head feels. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t act consistently in a positive way, to want make me use it for headaches.
