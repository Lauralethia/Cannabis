VHempstar is a strain that definitely lives up to being a sativa. As soon as I smoked it I felt relaxed and calm, my head was completely clear and gave me the energy to get on with my day. It made me very mellow but still very functional and aware. It&#39;s a great strain to start your day.

VI enjoy this sativa strain for its relaxing and uplifting high.  This is a wonderful strain to start your day with, as its energetic but sitll relaxing enough to lower anxiety or fears. The taste is earthy and woody with a spicy undertone. I suggest this to anyone who has those first day of work gitters and just needs a boost to get them going and confident for the day.

VSo far, Hempstar is my favorite sativa strain to-date. Not only do I work with startups, but I freelance on the side; so you can imagine the hours I have to work sometimes.\u000a\u000aThis strain seems to be the perfect sativa for dialing in my focus and getting in the flow of my work. It&#39;s also been great for those walks where you want to brainstorm some new idea. \u000a\u000aHighly recommend it for people that want something to help focus and think creatively.

VIts a mellow type of sativa high, it almost feels like a hybrid type feeling but still much more towards the sativa.

VThis particular strain is not the most potent of all the sativas out there, but provides a pleasant effect. A mild uplifting feeling is noticed accompanied by a cheerful euphoria, fading to a nice relaxed yet focused state. Not the strongest smelling strain, however it boasts a sweet woody scent with a minor earthy element. The sweetness is strongly represented in the taste, and it appears to also have a slight woody characteristic. A good choice for a more mellow sativa, especially as a nighttime medication.

VOrdered hempstar off of &quot;getwhite palm.com and delivery was as always prompt and service excellent. As for the strain as soon as I opened the first of 4 bags it was packaged in I could smell the pungent odour like a punch in the face and got my papers out and rolled just a small sativa sized joint and WOW!! It was like I just took some sort of upper and my energy level sored and I started cleaning my house with pleasure. Great head high and effects lasted well after I was done my cleaning fit. Overall this is a fantastic strain for morning or early afternoon if you want to get stuff done. Great strain and great dispensary , would highly recombine both.

Vthis is a very nice strain. i just had a nice wake and bake with my boyfriend out of our new bong and it was defiantly a nice way to start my morning. it wakes you up and it hit me pretty quickly. it\u2019s been a few minutes since i\u2019ve smoked it and the effects of it being sativa are very obvious. it is a little harsh and has a peppery taste to it. i found that smoking it out of the bong or smoking it in a blunt makes it taste much better. it is very uplifting as well and has put me in a good mood. highly recommend&#128154;

VFantastic woodsy taste. Clear headed euphoria without the sluggishness. Also perfect for people who have IBS related nausea (which I do) getting their appetite back! Actually enjoyed my dinner tonight after some Hempstar.\u000a\u000aI didn&#39;t use much (a pinch, vaped) but I can feel the potential for use with music and creative work! Definitely a good daytime medicine., for wanting to get things done, and de-stressing.

VOkay. So I invited a girl over to have some of this with me...it works on girls let me tell you! hahaha gets them &quot;motivated&quot; so to say. the only thing wrong with it was that she didn&#39;t get to high because she couldn&#39;t hit the pipe properly. one thing I did notice is that the effects of this strain don&#39;t last as long as the effects of let&#39;s say chocolope or maybe purple voodoo. but with a little higher dose I would recommend this one.

VI really enjoyed this strain. It had an upbeat feel to it &amp; the high lasted a while for me. I like to watch movies when I&#39;m baked &amp; usually when I watch movies high, I zone out or fall asleep through the opening credits. With Hempstar, I felt incredibly focused &amp; every word stuck with me. On a separate occasion, it made me rather energetic. Both times, however, I felt really happy &amp; destressed. One solid sativa.
