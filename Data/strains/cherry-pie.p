VThis particular hybrid made me feel the cerebral effects AND body effects, but wasn&#39;t overly powerful in either of those categories. It best suited me after a long day of classes and work, and helped me to, ultimately, relax. The smell is super dank and I ground it up which made for an even better smell. The &quot;cherry&quot; in the Cherry Pie was completely absent also.

VCherry Pie, Girl Scout Cookies and Phantom Cookies will all give you the same type of high because they all have Durban Poison and Granddaddy Purple, like members of a family.  I love them all for pain relief and euphoria. Phantom Cookies (CP and GDP) is a bit more energizing than Girl Scout and is better for a relaxing movie night. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of these strains. Toke lightly if you are a new smoker, it&#39;s potent.

VThis strain is NOT for beginners! Two hits, and I am high as a kite! I get stoned quicker on Cherry Pie than on any other strain. I smell and taste some sweet and some spice. CP smokes pretty harsh so be sure to have water nearby. I either cough or get phlegm in my throat. I consider CP to be a &quot;typical stoner&quot; strain. Everything arounds you slows down, your mind is racing, but you just look off into the distance. Over time you will be happy, and if you are with people, you will be social. This strain is perfect for friends to come over and relax outside. Just be sure that your friends are advanced smokers.

VJust got some solventless cherry pie shatter. Was kinda in between shatter anf crumble, a beautiful crystal clear yellow. It smelled very fruity as soon as the jar was cracked. One hit had me feeling unreal sensations tingling my entire body until settling into a intense euphoric body/gead high. There was no ceiling, every hit brought the effects on stronger, i was tempted to keep hitting it again and again. The taste was a sour fruity flavor that leaves a aftertaste very similar to cherry pie. Definetly a work of art.

VI love this strand. I had an ounce recently, and it was wonderful. I would say the best part is the taste. It&#39;s magnificent! One downfall, however, is if in an area where it&#39;s illegal, you can&#39;t, and SHOULDN&#39;T take it out of the house. Even if you have an air sealed container, the scent is stronger than any I&#39;ve experienced. It will take over any room.

VTried this strain crossed with GSC for Cherry Cookies. A sweet berry aroma and a smooth thick smoke, effects are delayed slightly by a few minutes, but like those cargo trains you wait at the railroad stop for 5 minutes for? It just keeps going on and on and on then finally peaks with it&#39;s sativa-like euphoria and tingling body high that lasts for about an hour leading down to a mellow body buzz for another hour and a half. Great strain for daytime or nighttime!

VExtremely upbeat and cheery. However, the very sedating body high feels like a weight, physically pulling you down. I guess that&#39;s what you call couch lock, kids. In this case, it&#39;s almost so heavy that it&#39;s a bit distracting/overpowering. Not a huge negative, just be aware.\u000a\u000aCognitively suppressed as well. Very cloudy, like your head is covered in cotton. Sound is sharp, but senses are so delayed that things feel a little numbed out.\u000a\u000aMaximum pain relief, muscle relaxant, and primo relaxation / do nothing strain. Just stone out to any form of entertainment. You won&#39;t care. You&#39;re a zombie.\u000a\u000aThe next day I did have a lingering cloudiness and lack of motivation which surprisingly lasted the entire day.

VCherry Pie, when grown correctly is an extremely dank strain! I love it, it&#39;s GDP x Durbin Poison! What else could you ask for, the smell, smells just like cherry pie with a hint of purp but just barely. It&#39;s definitely a strain that&#39;s totally worth trying it&#39;s like a true 50/50, we&#39;ll for me at least. This strain is very useful for calming down or even to get going but I find It to help alot with depression and anxiety, spasms too. If you see this one definitely try it but make sure it smells like Cherry Pie like it&#39;s supposed too, you&#39;ll definitely be able to tell. Also great for headaches or migraines! 5 stars all the way! Stuff is LEGIT!

VUPDATED 02/19/2016 After purchasing curaleaf&#39;s Sapphire (Cherry Thunder F):  Lower &#39;dosing&#39; creates an even wonderful undertone of happiness and uplift without the &#39;raciness&#39; that usually comes with some Sativas.  Great little pick-me-up during the day...and if you really want an interestingly wonderful feeling; add some high CBD along with this and you will absolutely love it!\u000a\u000aEven though I like this hybrid, I have to say that adding Durban Poison to Grand Daddy Purple is like adding ice cream to caviar...I love them both, but not together...as they are very different.

VI suffer from a few mental illnesses, and they cause me to lose sleep at night and often times leave me stuck in what feels like a systematic set of unsettling feelings.

I work with special needs students who are often aggressive, and two of them were literally kicking my ass today. Thankfully not together, but alternately throughout the day. I had my t-shirt ripped in half, and a busted cheekbone from a solid headbutt. Anyways, this stuff just made me think about all the small funny things that had happened throughout the day. It&#39;s a nice reminder of how helpful herb can be! In terms of the strains characteristics, it first of all smells amazing, just like berries!

VI went to a new clinic tonight. I asked for a energetic Sativa which is what I prefer. So the bud tender said that&#39;s what Cherry Pie is. Obviously she was wrong. I decided to look up the strain after I got it to make sure. It said on many different sites that it&#39;s a powerful indica dominant strain, that&#39;s sedative. Which I feel is all true. It is a strong strain and I feel the strong sedative effects. Im just not a big fan of the sedative effects that pot can give you. Im more of a energetic-fatigue fan because I can get tired easily. But this strain is definitely not a waste even though it&#39;s what I dont prefer, I can use it before I go to sleep. The high I am experiencing now is making me think that. I&#39;ve only taken a cpl hits and I got a nice high going and I&#39;ve smoked for over 20 years, so that&#39;s good. So even though it&#39;s not what I really wanted,it is still something thats good.and powerfull.

VI guess this is average in terms of the quality coming from the dispensary. This offering from Takoma Wellness Center in Washington D.C. is one from a newish cultivator to the scene from Sacaramento, Abatin Wellness. For reasons unknown they have been producing a lot of high-cbd strains that are sold as pre-ground here. I was hoping for more of a pronounced fruit or sweet flavor on this one. It was far more muted of a taste than their &quot;Krypto Type II&quot; (Type II=High CBD) I believe, but the smell is pretty wonderful, like a classic skunky M39 smell that gets me all nostalgic. I would very much like to see if they could get larger whole buds on this strain to sell while retaining the high CBD effects (5.8% tested on this one)

VBought this strain based on the name alone. Really nice hybrid, well balanced, I&#39;ve been smoking this afternoon and working at the same time, felt the body high but nice sativa element so no real couch lock. Smell isn&#39;t that strong but nice cherry taste on the exhale, helped me relax and focus, would buy again

VThis sample exhibits dark green flowers with reddish-brown undertones and purple-veined leaves.

VCherry Pie. While the name brings about thoughts of family gatherings, relaxed days, and sweet teeth...the strain can be much more intense. Within the first two hits out of my 3 chamber water pipe (with an added ash catcher), I felt the edges of my eyes begin to tunnel inward. There&#39;s was an immense sensation of falling off my chair when I knew I firmly planted in my seat and sometimes, when I stared at the wall, the tiny bits of plaster started moving becoming more reminiscent of a rising tide before a crashing wave.\u000a\u000aYou&#39;d think with a name like this, it would&#39;ve been more relaxing. But perhaps it wasn&#39;t the genome of the strain that determined its name...perhaps instead someone was just a really huge fan of Warrant. That would at least make more sense as to why this bud hit me like a bullet train.\u000a\u000aBut this is a very good strain for what it&#39;s worth. Cherry Pie works like a steam engine: It&#39;s quick to start when the fire is being fueled, but when the coal runs out, the locomotion is quick to haul.

OK now that you have learned your lesson feel free to go on a nature walk, I&#39;m sativa I make you giggle creative...stoner creative  but creative never the less. you will come of love watter coloring and things that bounce. also you just might get horny so ya know have someone who likes to smoke a bowl and do the baby making jig with you oh..right also make sure they like doing the baby making jig  particularly with you. like the smell of cherry&#39;s  dancing with mixed nuts (unsalted of course)  accompanied by  sweet notes of flower leaves? do not know what the fuck I&#39;m talking about?  then fire up a bowl and find out and brace your little noggin for one of the most taste giving strains in the herbal kingdom. be greeted by a quick sweet kick paired with deep wide bodied floral notes that taste like orange herbal tea after a strong steep. with a interweaving flavor of cherry&#39;s and grannies spice rack (get your mind out of the gutter I know how that sounded funny yes but spice rack was used in a literal manner and you fucking know it) So there be the basic outline of the dame known as  cherry pie (I know I was talking about gods or some shit, but I got distracted so now its this OK? ) So if you like going about town in a stony haze and have nothing overtly important to attend to then give this awesome giggle inducing (sometimes sexy fun time feeling) lets go see a Imax film...in 3d! inspiring weed A try.

VThis is one of my favorites- the piney/skunk aroma raw followed by the sweet, musky taste when smoked is a delicious experience. The effect runs a wide gambit- the initial eye pressure and bloom to the head is followed initially by a euphoric and gentle energetic focus, but that soon becomes the solid punch of full-body high that carries you off for a great ride that lasts hours, and at the end leaves you toasty and ready for a nap or a night&#39;s sound sleep. The only negative is the munchies- wow! My suggestion is to stock up on stuff prior to smoking, or have a waffle house within walking distance- you&#39;re gonna crave and crave bad! The other great aspect is the lack of residual effects upon waking the next day, unlike other heavy hitters- you can get up and running without feeling stoned first thing out of bed- for me, this is a definite plus.

VMy girlfriend and I picked up this particular strain from Good Vibes on Weedmaps. I honestly did not expect this strand to hit as well as it did. I felt very relaxed after three good hits. The taste is pretty good too. Cherry Pie is an above average strand in my opinion. Compared to a lot of the other strands I have tried, this one definitely stands out in its own way. Good stuff.

VThis recent batch I had was actually a tad bit greener than the more purple batch that I had previously obtained from Cannapassion on Osborn and 24 street in Phoenix, Arizona.  None the less it was some ultra fire Cherry Pie. This strain is super incredible and never seems to fail. Not even once!  You can&#39;t go wrong with these proven genetics that originated in the sanfransico Bay area of California.  Grand Daddy Purple x Durban Poison x Og Kush what else is there to be said? Well, lots...it tastes amazing combining a taste of Cookies with that gdp grape flavor.  It smells like animal cracker cookies or pie crust.  It has a hard hitting indica stone that will couch lock even the most veteran smoker.  I think this starin quite possibly be my number 1 favorite strain out of all the various types.  It&#39;s got the best of all worlds, sativa, purple indica, and og kush.  If you ever happen to come across this strain make sure you pick it up.  This Cherry pie got me so high- feel like I can touch the sky and fly- if you ever come across it don&#39;t be too shy to buy...E-Dank

I definitely see why the name cherry pie because of it&#39;s amazing taste. It is a true 50/50  Indica Sativa feeling, which neither is overpowering. Great for anytime of the day morning to get your day ready, afternoon to get your work done and at night to relax and unwind from your day.&#128077;&#127996;&#128077;&#127996;&#128079;&#127996;

VIt is hard to find any decent reasons to not at the very least appreciate Cherry Pie.  Appreciate the two powerhouse parents that are at the core of what make this strain so nice.  The pros outweigh the cons in mass, like I just said no decent reason with a taste of blended mellow candy sweetness with fast paced conifer funk.  My favorite thing about Cherry Pie is being able to pull the different aspects of each gene donor.  It is a really heady meditation to sit with the buzz, paying attention to these details, breaking it all apart with the senses, and depending on the space honing in further to the dance our body is doing with cannabis or just letting it all loose in recreation.  \u000a\u000aBoth have healing and positive benefit.  Having let loose for a good amount of my life there has grown a respect for this miracle plant.  So like many others with the same appreciation learning while experimenting all the while keeping my head together &amp; my body in homeostasis. The distinct differences begin just looking at the denser bud structure of Granddaddy with a longer triangle shape reminiscent of Durban.  The color is a mesh of the lighter green sativa &amp; maroon reddish indica all held together with burnt orange hairs. Smell leans way more Durban with a pop to it that sometimes makes a chill run down my spine.  Wakes me up to smell it like a really dank baby shit, except good =)\u000a\u000aFlower like this are great teachers in a science that is really kept more underground due to repressive laws.  Living in a culture that presents to and brainwashes the masses to have a one sided view of only the party.  &#39;The Gateway Drug&quot; lie just domino-ed out half assed propaganda leaving us die hard stoners to experiment.  A lot.  With everything that crossed our paths as well trading ideas, experiences, lineage, grow techniques, and so it goes on and on........  Cherry Pie is meant for first time smokers or all day every day pot freaks dedicated to the cause.  Simple, easy to enjoy, yet has very distinct dynamics making it a model weed.\u000a\u000aPersonally do get bored with all these aspects if not mixed up with other strains or put in spaced out rotation.  I have heard good things about the medical value behind CP, but have little to no experience.  Tried one time with migraine with more of an upper vibe than the mellow needed.  Def puts me in a good mood with lots of laughter if sharing with a friend.  Good classic weed.

VThis recent batch I had was actually a tad bit greener than the more purple batch that I had previously obtained from Cannapassion on Osborn and 24 street in Phoenix, Arizona.  None the less it was some ultra fire Cherry Pie. This strain is super incredible and never seems to fail. Not even once!  You can&#39;t go wrong with these proven genetics that originated in the sanfransico Bay area of California.  Grand Daddy Purple x Durban Poison x Og Kush what else is there to be said? Well, lots...it tastes amazing combining a taste of Cookies with that gdp grape flavor.  It smells like animal cracker cookies or pie crust.  It has a hard hitting indica stone that will couch lock even the most veteran smoker.  I think this starin quite possibly be my number 1 favorite strain out of all the various types.  It&#39;s got the best of all worlds, sativa, purple indica, and og kush.  If you ever happen to come across this strain make sure you pick it up.  This Cherry pie got me so high- feel like I can touch the sky and fly- if you ever come across it don&#39;t be too shy to buy...E-Dank

VI was pleasantly surprised with this strain. The cartridge has a really smooth hit. The taste threw me off, but in a good way. I taste a sweetness that would remind you of a sweet dessert, like a pie (obviously), but it had a spearmint aftertaste. I know that sounds like it would taste weird, but it&#39;s actually kind of nice. The high doesn&#39;t take too long to creep in. It&#39;s a smooth high, and allows me to relax and focus. It didn&#39;t take me away from the stress, but it did help me to calm down and look at things in a different perspective so that I could make the situation less stressful. I felt calmer and more relaxed as time went on, too. Not a strong high, but not too mellow either. First timers might also like it, especially if they&#39;re in a relaxing environment. Went grocery shopping with my husband and felt fine. No paranoia at all.  I did find myself to be more quiet, but I wasn&#39;t so wrapped up in my thoughts that I couldn&#39;t be aware of others. Overall, I&#39;d say this is a pretty good strain

VReally nice flavor- with a hint of a cherry thats distinct. I would say this is the best pot for pain I have come across in years. It stopped some really bad pain I was doubled over prior to smoking. Had a good up beat time with my family. I could get couch locked it I let myself with this weed, but I think its a good indica for do stuff at least in a low impact sorta way- like playing games with the family.  I am pretty prone to anxiety, which I am glad this variety didnt cause and kept me in a mellow happy mood with no episodes of my severe anxiety. I would recommend.

VThis cut was from Bang&#39;s in Washington State. There are several growers at the moment in Washington State retail stores, as it seems fairly popular at the moment. The buds are a full of almost yellow hairs that are both visually pleasing and unique, to me at least. The smell  is a sweet pugnacious fragrance that is hard to place. I don&#39;t get the cherry pie smell or taste  but maybe you will. The high was pretty mild to what I expected, that being said it was a great high. I could definitely feel the GDP genetics in the very calming body high. This is a very relaxing strain I would recommend for any time of day but especially if you are looking to unwind from stress.

VI suffer from anxiety and a motor twitch in my eyes/face. I in fact am underage, but have to self medicate because doctors have no solution. I was having a bad &quot;flare up&quot; if you will and was deeply anxious and twitching. I snuck out of my house and to the local park to do my thing. I had some of this mixed with some SFG and it took my anxiety away. And over the next few days my motor twitch started to fade. Right now it is fairly minute, but over my winter break for school will dose again. Also it gives you a relaxed, happy, and pretty productive high, so I was able to type an essay and do papers with ease. I recommend taking this in smaller doses at a time because for me at least, it took a while to hit me and turned my night into a Pok&#233;mon indigo league and In &amp; Out night. I would highly recommend to people who suffer from seizures, Parkinson&#39;s, and anxiety.

VI was pleasantly surprised with this strain. The cartridge has a really smooth hit. The taste threw me off, but in a good way. I taste a sweetness that would remind you of a sweet dessert, like a pie (obviously), but it had a spearmint aftertaste. I know that sounds like it would taste weird, but it&#39;s actually kind of nice. The high doesn&#39;t take too long to creep in. It&#39;s a smooth high, and allows me to relax and focus. It didn&#39;t take me away from the stress, but it did help me to calm down and look at things in a different perspective so that I could make the situation less stressful. I felt calmer and more relaxed as time went on, too. Not a strong high, but not too mellow either. First timers might also like it, especially if they&#39;re in a relaxing environment. Went grocery shopping with my husband and felt fine. No paranoia at all.  I did find myself to be more quiet, but I wasn&#39;t so wrapped up in my thoughts that I couldn&#39;t be aware of others. Overall, I&#39;d say this is a pretty good strain

VHad this in a shatter from Emerald avenue, and once again I am more than satisfied with their products. Why, oh why did I wait so long to get my card... Very flavorful with long lasting effects. I particularly enjoyed the way that the character of the high changes as dosage increased, making it a perfect all day any situation medicine. I&#39;d recommend being careful with your dosage if you&#39;re not experienced or have a tolerance because a couple of dabs and I was baked, really baked.

VThis recent batch I had was actually a tad bit greener than the more purple batch that I had previously obtained from Cannapassion on Osborn and 24 street in Phoenix, Arizona.  None the less it was some ultra fire Cherry Pie. This strain is super incredible and never seems to fail. Not even once!  You can&#39;t go wrong with these proven genetics that originated in the sanfransico Bay area of California.  Grand Daddy Purple x Durban Poison x Og Kush what else is there to be said? Well, lots...it tastes amazing combining a taste of Cookies with that gdp grape flavor.  It smells like animal cracker cookies or pie crust.  It has a hard hitting indica stone that will couch lock even the most veteran smoker.  I think this starin quite possibly be my number 1 favorite strain out of all the various types.  It&#39;s got the best of all worlds, sativa, purple indica, and og kush.  If you ever happen to come across this strain make sure you pick it up.  This Cherry pie got me so high- feel like I can touch the sky and fly- if you ever come across it don&#39;t be too shy to buy...E-Dank

VI suffer from anxiety and a motor twitch in my eyes/face. I in fact am underage, but have to self medicate because doctors have no solution. I was having a bad &quot;flare up&quot; if you will and was deeply anxious and twitching. I snuck out of my house and to the local park to do my thing. I had some of this mixed with some SFG and it took my anxiety away. And over the next few days my motor twitch started to fade. Right now it is fairly minute, but over my winter break for school will dose again. Also it gives you a relaxed, happy, and pretty productive high, so I was able to type an essay and do papers with ease. I recommend taking this in smaller doses at a time because for me at least, it took a while to hit me and turned my night into a Pok&#233;mon indigo league and In &amp; Out night. I would highly recommend to people who suffer from seizures, Parkinson&#39;s, and anxiety.

Definitely more happy and outgoing after smoking this strain in a concentrate form. Gave me plenty of happy feelings and let me forget my worries. Helped get rid of my anxiety. The only bad experience I had came after four consecutive hits. I became very paranoid and wanted to just go to sleep and woke up with a headache. 3 hits or less and you\u2019ll be good for the next two hours or so.

VMuch more scent as well as flavor than my last strain (Jack Frost). Very Sweet &amp; Sour. Nice, light green shades with a good amount of red hairs. Very smelly outside the bag unlike the Jack Frost. I smoked this with a small bong &amp; got a slightly heavier high than the one I got smoking a joint of Jack.

VSmoked alone this afternoon which takes a lot for me because of my anxiety and I&#39;m only a month into smoking pot again after about 20 + years.  I found myself wanting to keep busy doing laundry and not getting agitated cuz I had to take it to the local little laundromat.  And desire to do the dishes as well as put the clothes away.  Those who know about being clinically depressed I think you understand what a big deal this is and for those of you have anxiety this is also a big deal because it seems at this point a really good balance. there was a little bit of forgetfulness and confusion but overall I didn&#39;t even think about checking my pulse and that is amazing. And for someone who does not need to gain any weight I did not experience major munchies in fact my husband and I decided on other strains to use sunflower seeds to help combat that a bit.  The high lasted a good amount of time not disappointed at all and slight headache upon dissipation of the high.  By the way I&#39;m somewhat of a lightweight and I vaped it because I don&#39;t like all the toxins of typical smoke and I only took like one good hit so I was not overly high which I think brings on paranoia and anxiety.

VI\u2019ve experienced overall good times with this strain. This strain gives you a definite euphoric experience!!! I\u2019m. Definitely more happy and outgoing after smoking this strain in a concentrate form. Gave me plenty of happy feelings and let me forget my worries. Helped get rid of my anxiety. The only bad experience I had came after four consecutive hits. I became very paranoid and wanted to just go to sleep and woke up with a headache. 3 hits or less and you\u2019ll be good for the next two hours or so.

VI smoked one gram or so between a friend and myself. There was a very strong initial high that peaked quickly and faded slowly. It was a very pleasant high that really increased my mood and general disposition. After about an hour I noticed I was coming down but the lingering high lasted for about another hour. It left me with really bad dry mouth but the unique flavor and smell definitely made up for it. Overall it was a very good high that I will enjoy again.

VCherry pie is much beloved by the cannabis community here and I wish I could experience what they do. I have a similar experience to this strain as I have from some cookies and creams. The one in this review is listed as a indica dominate hybrid it looks like and indica with fat purped out calyxes I mean really beautiful bud, but it hit me like a indica dom at first then it creeped into a sativa feel overwhelmingly so with a sharp energy that made me more than anxious.\u000a\u000aI felt like if I were running it wouldn&#39;t enough energy expelled to compensate for the way the high was making me feel. I didn&#39;t care for it at all which is strange because separately I love GDP and am a fan of Durban poison.\u000a\u000aTHC is 20.5 CBD 0.11%\u000a\u000aFlavor had a backend cherry to it but was more earthy and woody in the front.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ll try the strain again by another grower.

I suffer from anxiety so I was worried trying this because it\u2019s uplifting and usually for an anxiety sufferer that mean = racing heart. \u000a\u000aI feel happy and up lifted for sure. This is my first take on it but I hope the same side effect continue when I smoke it !! \u000a\u000aIf you\u2019re sensitive or new to the strong marijuana taste I highly suggest this strain. It\u2019s a nice head high and it\u2019s so sweet and minty.

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA.  Check my blog out AgingEnt.com\u000a\u000a\u000a--\u000aBrand: Artizen\u000aStrain: Cherry Pie\u000aIndica-dominant Hybrid\u000a\u000aPotency Analysis: TTL 20.7% THC 20.4% CBD 0.3% THCA 0%\u000a\u000aHarvested: 05/25/2015\u000aSmoked: 07/11/2015\u000a\u000aPackaging: 4.75&quot;x3&quot; clear plastic, mylar backed tear-open zip top\u000aCost: $15/gram\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aWhen I ripped the top of this bag, my entire master area of my house - about 750 square feet of space with two doors - was filled with the potent and remarkable scent of this marijuana.  Inside the bag, with my nose down in there, it smelled almost artificial and chemically it was so complex and concentrated.  There was this deep, overwhelming sweetness to the smell of concentrated marijuana.   This weed must have sat packaged, stored somewhere in the heat - like a tin warehouse in the sun.  The weed probably began the very earliest parts of the decarboxylating process, releasing terpenes (the oils in marijuana that give it flavor and scent), thereby causing it to smell so much and so richly.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aMrs. Ent remarked, &quot;That is the stickiest, ickiest we had since we&#39;ve been in Washington&quot;.  I agree.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aThe high was so ridiculously deep, and I was fully stoned.  I went walking with my dog and ended up mentally clear about 30 minutes in.  My body felt good and I felt a sense of well-being, but all mental effects of the marijuana were gone - and I still had a half hour of my walk left!  My wife also had a short, but very deep, high.   It could be that we both got very active.\u000a\u000aYou can see pictures and read the rest of my review at agingent.com

VCherry Pie has a strong, pleasant scent that to me smells piney.  The effect is both stoney and happy.  I find it great for stress relief with the added bonus of helping me fall asleep a few hours later. Pain seems to melt away easily with this strain with excellent medical applications.

VI smoked some Cherry Pie with close friends recently and it was a great time. There is an overwhelming feeling of happiness and was perfect for watching the Mahr show. All smiles and giggles, just what a good high should be. Every time that I&#39;ve smoked CP I have a fun time. The taste and experience is great. I just wish I could get this more often.

VOh my sweet Cherry Pie. I have grown this strain twice and it&#39;s just a &quot;Beast&quot; as they say these days. The lineage being Granddaddy Purple and Durban Poison gives Cherry Pie an amazing flavor and effect profile I have never found before. \u000aDurban Poison is a pure landrace Sativa strain that would normally have one bouncing off the walls of creativity while Grandaddy Purple would normally put one in a deep sleep, but the combination of the two provides and even keel feeling while eliminating pain and providing much needed relief from Iraq and Afghanistan related PTSD

VI am slightly disappointed by cherry pie. Not because it isn\u2019t good. But because when I see a cross between two of my all time favorites I expected a little more. I had 7g of concentrate. A golden shatter pull snap consistency. It tastes good but not amazing. It\u2019s fruity and smooth and I enjoy it. I guess I had too high of expectations. I prefer the parent strains individually for sure. The indica dominant effects are nice and bring back my appetite.

VI usually pass up hybrids because they don&#39;t have much effect on me, either unpredictable or just nothing.  My 1st Cherry Pie buds were frm the Greenhouse, weighing in at 23+% THC &amp; almost 2% THCV.  I&#39;m writing this because of the effect. This batch delivered smooth, creeper, potent euphoria &amp; &#39;oh yes, i am STONED.&#39;  Buds are very leafy &amp; loose, light to true green, smothered in thick orange hairs &amp; a tinge of violet thruout.  Unburnt buds smell strong of sweet cherry &amp; berry notes, it reminds me of Cherry Pie&#39;s grandpa, Purple Urkle.  The taste follows suit, sweet berries on inhale &amp; exhale, with a touch of Durban&#39;s earthy note that can &#39;poison&#39; yr breath for hours.  This strain sold out in under 2 days. I&#39;m sad now; I wish I could go back for an oz!  Nice &amp; potent.

VThis Strain put me on my ass. I was very relaxed and happy that I didn&#39;t want to move a second! If I were to sit anywhere, I&#39;d basically stuck in that same spot until I had a reason to move or someone pulled me up. The high came in after about 3 bong rips and stayed for a decent 3-4 hours. Pink Floyd is a great band to listen to while experiencing the high and I couldn&#39;t stop eating food.

VThis is an amazing day time strain for anyone not looking to get tired or couch locked! It tastes exactly like pie and is very relaxing! If you love this strain and live around Portland I highly suggest releaf on 122nd between burnside and division! Almost every weekend they sell cherry pie OG for $5 grams!! Best deal around in my opinion! But get there early before it runs out!\u000a

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA.  Check my blog out AgingEnt.com\u000a\u000a\u000a--\u000aBrand: Artizen\u000aStrain: Cherry Pie\u000aIndica-dominant Hybrid\u000a\u000aPotency Analysis: TTL 20.7% THC 20.4% CBD 0.3% THCA 0%\u000a\u000aHarvested: 05/25/2015\u000aSmoked: 07/11/2015\u000a\u000aPackaging: 4.75&quot;x3&quot; clear plastic, mylar backed tear-open zip top\u000aCost: $15/gram\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aWhen I ripped the top of this bag, my entire master area of my house - about 750 square feet of space with two doors - was filled with the potent and remarkable scent of this marijuana.  Inside the bag, with my nose down in there, it smelled almost artificial and chemically it was so complex and concentrated.  There was this deep, overwhelming sweetness to the smell of concentrated marijuana.   This weed must have sat packaged, stored somewhere in the heat - like a tin warehouse in the sun.  The weed probably began the very earliest parts of the decarboxylating process, releasing terpenes (the oils in marijuana that give it flavor and scent), thereby causing it to smell so much and so richly.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aMrs. Ent remarked, &quot;That is the stickiest, ickiest we had since we&#39;ve been in Washington&quot;.  I agree.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aThe high was so ridiculously deep, and I was fully stoned.  I went walking with my dog and ended up mentally clear about 30 minutes in.  My body felt good and I felt a sense of well-being, but all mental effects of the marijuana were gone - and I still had a half hour of my walk left!  My wife also had a short, but very deep, high.   It could be that we both got very active.\u000a\u000aYou can see pictures and read the rest of my review at agingent.com

VFirst time with this strain and it knocked my socks off. Seriously potent leaf with heavy long-lasting effects. Small and dense fruity-smelling nugs. The high kicks in almost immediately delivering an uplifting effect before a deep relaxing cerebral knockout blow had me searching for the nearest sofa.  Recommended for relaxing days. One of my new favorites.

VI smoked one gram or so between a friend and myself. There was a very strong initial high that peaked quickly and faded slowly. It was a very pleasant high that really increased my mood and general disposition. After about an hour I noticed I was coming down but the lingering high lasted for about another hour. It left me with really bad dry mouth but the unique flavor and smell definitely made up for it. Overall it was a very good high that I will enjoy again.

VI am slightly disappointed by cherry pie. Not because it isn\u2019t good. But because when I see a cross between two of my all time favorites I expected a little more. I had 7g of concentrate. A golden shatter pull snap consistency. It tastes good but not amazing. It\u2019s fruity and smooth and I enjoy it. I guess I had too high of expectations. I prefer the parent strains individually for sure. The indica dominant effects are nice and bring back my appetite.

VWhen my girlfriend introduced me to this amazing strain, I did not anticipate the euphoria I was about to endure. The sweet aroma, coupled with dense buds and high THC count, brings together a combination that extinguished all pain and worry. The beautiful appearance of purple and orange hairs with a frosty coating of resin brings the experience all together. Five stars.

VMmmmm Cherry Pie! This my first encounter with this bud. Out the jar it looks and smells amazing. This crop was probably beautiful.  I put my Cherry Pie in my easy bake Pax oven but decided to stick with the glass instead. 8:30am East Coast time. On fire up the smoke is very thick, smooth on the inhale where you really get that earthy flavor and exhale through the nose and mouth is where I picked up on the sweet cherry flavor. Cleared the bowl and Wow! I&#39;m really high! Energetic too. This is a beautiful bud for the morning. Perfect bud for this AM session! \u000aBeautiful avail on iTunes now\u000aMichaelMillions.com

V9/10 strain for me. A very balanced high in the sense that you can get pretty high but you\u2019ll neither become too stoned nor too racy and anxious. For me, I do get the Grandaddy Purple effects more than the Durban Poison effects. Think GDP but with euphoria. It\u2019s great for the daytime in moderate doses and fantastic for a night of enjoying YouTube or a night where sleep is desired. \u000a\u000aAltogether, Cherry Pie is a strain I\u2019d be happy to keep in my regular line up. It\u2019s just that solid of a strain. Most of my reviews are lengthier, but this strain is such an instant classic right from the first experience with it, that it speaks for itself. May not be a hot rod like Ghost Train Haze or Chocolope, but it earns the title of old reliable.

VMy first review here on Leafly!  I&#39;ve always appreciated weed, though I&#39;ve not been a big smoker of it during my life.  However, now that I&#39;ve recently moved to Oregon, there&#39;s a good chance this will change.  :)  I visited my first dispensary today (4 June 2016) looking for something that preserves mental clarity but helps relieve pain and Cherry Pie was the one recommended to me.  For sure I have never had a weed high like this!  It felt more like a psychotropic experience (feelings of unexpected deep understanding &amp; profundity, teleportation, time-travel and place-travel, LOL).  My brain didn&#39;t know wtf was going on!  I *may* have had a bit too much of it all at once.  Nice stuff though, very fun.

VThis is an amazing day time strain for anyone not looking to get tired or couch locked! It tastes exactly like pie and is very relaxing! If you love this strain and live around Portland I highly suggest releaf on 122nd between burnside and division! Almost every weekend they sell cherry pie OG for $5 grams!! Best deal around in my opinion! But get there early before it runs out!\u000a

V9/10 strain for me. A very balanced high in the sense that you can get pretty high but you\u2019ll neither become too stoned nor too racy and anxious. For me, I do get the Grandaddy Purple effects more than the Durban Poison effects. Think GDP but with euphoria. It\u2019s great for the daytime in moderate doses and fantastic for a night of enjoying YouTube or a night where sleep is desired. \u000a\u000aAltogether, Cherry Pie is a strain I\u2019d be happy to keep in my regular line up. It\u2019s just that solid of a strain. Most of my reviews are lengthier, but this strain is such an instant classic right from the first experience with it, that it speaks for itself. May not be a hot rod like Ghost Train Haze or Chocolope, but it earns the title of old reliable.

VAs a 70/30 indica-dominant strain, Cherry Pie has an exquisite and pungent pie and slight cherry smell that extends to its taste. It is a great strain for winding down after a long day or on a lazy weekend, but it also adds a spark of energy that makes one talkative and euphoric. Excellent strain, in my opinion.

VCherry Pie aroma and flavor are neutral to slightly fruity. There is a hint of something like cherry pie in there. For me Cherry pie acted like a hybrid that was a bit on the indica side. It started out more sativa like and ended indica drowsy like. I found this strain a little too indica for doing errands and yard work. It&#39;s more of a video games level of activity strain. Where your brain is up for more than just watching TV, but your body feels a little relaxed.

VI usually pass up hybrids because they don&#39;t have much effect on me, either unpredictable or just nothing.  My 1st Cherry Pie buds were frm the Greenhouse, weighing in at 23+% THC &amp;  almost 2% THCV.  I&#39;m writing this because of the effect. This batch delivered smooth, creeper, potent euphoria &amp; &#39;oh yes, i am STONED.&#39;  Buds are light to true green, covered in thick orange hairs &amp; a tinge of violet thruout.  Unburnt buds smell strong of sweet cherry &amp; berry notes, it reminds me of Cherry Pie&#39;s grandpa, Purple Urkle.  The taste follows suit, sweet berries on inhale &amp; exhale, with a touch of Durban&#39;s earthy notes that can &#39;poison&#39; yr breath for hours.  This strain sold out in under 2 days. I&#39;m sad now; I wish I could go back for an oz!  Nice &amp; potent.

Nice and fruity, maybe even cherry taste. this certain pie is floatin at 23% thc and it burns great. I&#39;m going to destroy these chips. The high is strong and hits you fast.

This has probably got to be my strain.. helps me unwind and *eases* my chronic back pain about on the same level as an Aleve would. Also, it definitely gives me a headie high in my head :) Right now I don&#39;t feel any stress/anxiety from a stressful day at work. I absolutely recommend it for anyone who needs anxiety relief or help with pain, specifically back pain. For for me at least. Hope this helps.

VVery good bud. One of the best strains we\u2019ve tried (probably THE best). I have currently finished smoking this strain with my friend and we both feel very light like the feather of a dove. We are currently listening to Hunger by Rhye. And it feels like we are swimming through the warm oceans of one those warms ass countries. We can feel the sun heating our skin and imagining sea creatures playing the instruments and serenading us all around. There are 4 dolphins as our backing dancers, gently swaying to the rhythm of the ocean. A massive whale breaching above the waters. A medium sized fish singing beautiful music. Along with other fish playing instruments. Oh, and on that saxophone solo near the end of the song, we see a shark suddenly appearing and performing on the sax. So yeah. This strain is also creative too.

I feel relaxed and happy, with a little energy. Not too much, though, don&#39;t get me wrong but it&#39;s like a second wind... Not an adrenaline rush. There&#39;s no real crash I&#39;ve noticed but with my hectic life the relaxation effect does help me sleep. This is definently in my top 5.

VI grow this strain and it is one of my favorites to smoke. we have seen thc levels as high as 28.3% with ours but is averaged out around 26%. if you are going to grow this I recommend c02. I think it&#39;s one of the easier strains to grow as long as you keep it well manicured and adequate air flow I have never had powdery mildew or bugs on my strains due to clean room environment so I can&#39;t vouch for what it will do outside.

The best cherry pie I had was by blue roots in WA. Buds look dense crystallized purple and green  nugs with neon orange sprawling conical hairs. Taste is like berries and cream. Smoke is smooth and cough is decent and short.\u000aEnergetic, sleepy, anxious, paranoid and happy. My thoughts get scattered in a terrible mind fog.\u000a\u000aI pass on the cherry pie.

VAside from an a pretty distracted high (A little surprised here, seeing granddaddy strain Durban Poison is one of my all-time favorite productivity boosters), I&#39;m impressed with CP&#39;s longevity - a nice, heady haze for a couple hours. Soothing and euphoric, which I&#39;d imagine goes magnificently outdoors; unfortunately, Puget Sound winters offer little of this. Great for the Netflix-and-or-chiller, and happy/uplifting enough for anything from West Wing seasons or stand-up comedy specials. Not as giddy as I&#39;d been led to believe, but I can&#39;t wait to take this flower on some road trips.

VThis batch of Cherry Pie, smelled and looked great. smooth smoke, just felt relaxed and calm, pretty mellow high. probably a 3.5 for me, could be a 4 to the right person. organic that I had previously was 4.5-5.

VDense and gooey buds, with dark reddish hairs. Dry-toke was earthy; with tart fruit. It was great to smoke. I found a good ol&#39; joint pulls out the &#127826; pie flavor. This starts more saliva and gets you going, yet, will finish with waves of indica body meld.

VThat great cherry taste was evident. Looked green with orange/red hairs all over. Dense, smells great just not overwhelming. It was a creeper. Had 1 whole bag from the volcano and after I was done I was disappointed. Then 5-10 min later I started feeling that shift in perspective and that warm head feeling. Felt relaxed and happy and content. Like a less strong GSC or Cherry Kush. That is why the lower rating, but will buy again if the other 2 (GSC or Cherry Kush) isn&#39;t available. From New Hope Clinic in Sacramento, CA.

VA very strange high. It&#39;s an indica that thinks it&#39;s a saliva. Or maybe the other way round. Leaves you feeling alert and sober, when you&#39;re dumber than a door-stop. Got it as a 15$ 8th, definitely the best I&#39;ve bought.

I continued smoking it daily in smaller amounts and by the end of the month was able to celebrate my birthday with a whole bowl. Ha! Ended up loving this strain and its uplifting feel. I&#39;m always looking to try something new, but I&#39;m looking forward to returning to this one next time I see it on the menu.

VPicked up an 1/8 and it was the best stuff I picked up that day. Kept me high for a long time and didn&#39;t make me sleepy at all. Kept the munchies at a low. Had an amazing sweet taste and smell. Definitely in my top 3 choices of strains. You can&#39;t buy it everywhere though, some places do a splitting image but you can tell the difference by color and smell.

VI. LOVE. THIS. STRAIN.\u000a\u000aThis is the best strain I&#39;ve ever smoked (pineapple express is a close second but this takes a slight edge). It&#39;s sweet, dank, and tastes amazing when you smoke it. It&#39;s the perfect strain for anything, I&#39;ve smoked it alone, with friends, at concerts, at parties, you name it. I havent been able to find it near me recently though...a real shame. But I&#39;m getting by...\u000a\u000aThis is the perfect strain for anyone. Even if you&#39;re new to smoking or a seasoned veteran you&#39;ll still enjoy the high it brings on.

VFantastic strain!!! Definitely the product of its ancestors, the only noticeable negative is major cotton mouth which is to be expected, and of course isn&#39;t really that bad of a negative. The dry eyes weren&#39;t super significant. Got some chapped ass lips afterwards too but oh well. The Euphoria is what sets in immediately giving a breezy, uplifting feeling. I felt like I was floating up. Stress is completely gone, I couldn&#39;t help but start to smile. Nothing was on my mind except for my immediate surroundings and emotions. After the initial euphoria, a feeling of serious lethargy overcame me which I can only expect is a result of the Grandaddy Purple. One of the best highs I&#39;ve had in a while.

VThe sweet, skunky, and somehow also fruity smells of this strain are so deep you find yourself with a strange look upon your face when you smell the jar.  It is a deep, intriguing smell that has the complexity of a good pie.  It was easy for me to concentrate on this indica dominant hybrid (mine was about 65% indica) and the high mellowed out and the end.

VThe scent of both Durban Posion and GDP are definitely evident as soon you break the seal of its container. I find myself smelling it a bit more than other strains because it smells so unique and fresh. The high is strong, with a creeping onset, and a perfectly balanced hybrid blend in my opinion. Highly recommended for pain and appetite. This pie should be dosed considerably, as it may be a bit much for thrill seeking beginners. Top quality bud!

VCherry pie i&#39;d have to say is my most favorite strain all around. Most arousing aroma when you  crack a nug, smells like fresh baked goods. Tastes like it smells maybe even better, with a little earthiness. The nugs are as beautiful as it gets almost everytime I get some; Dense, stout, covered in crystals. With a dark purpleish leaves, and darkish green nugs. And nice thick little orange hairs creeping out. Light grey ash when it smokes, so you know its good. The high is amazing, perfect for anytime really for me. Nice hybrid cerebreal high and laid back, but also uplifting. 5 out of 5 no doubt! I try to get some Cherry Pie nearly everytime I pick up from the dispensaries. Always a bud to have in my rotation.

I feel as it gets better over time. Lots of smiles to just random people lol. Great laughter, so much euphoria! I was pretty talkative in the beginning. Ended up pretty hungry and thirsty. Especially the thirst! I don&#39;t know about doing complex things while high on this. I was making silly mistakes like searching someone&#39;s Instagram name on the YouTube search bar. Also the paranoia is slight. Just try to be distracted if it starts to happen or just have someone to talk to.

Melts away stress and leaves you feeling like the end of your day has arrived. That smell though ;) Can cause headaches and definitely leaves you couch-locked. Red eyes and full body elevation achieved here. This high does end up right between the temples and tightens its grip slowly and steadily.

VThis is my 2nd time ever vaping marijuana (I have only ever had vaporized concentrates, never actually smoked it). It tasted minty, herbal, sweet. Not too strong at all, I actually really enjoyed the taste. I took quite a few hits because I&#39;m a novice and wasn&#39;t feeling anything. Finally it kicked in what felt like 20 minutes later and I was on cloud 9. The only thing that felt natural was to smile, a neutral face felt forced. We had to go into a pizza place for food and I was super giggly, had trouble walking because my legs felt wobbly, and ULTRA paranoid that people knew I was high. I went to the bathroom and had to control my laughter for about 5 min before going out. I felt very egocentric like I was in my own bubble and everything outside my bubble was separate, but also just so paranoid. Next time I do this I will stay home :)

VFirst-time medical marijuana user, primarily treating anxiety. Two hits hits from a Dugout one-hitter and I was feeling uplifted, energetic, and social. The third hit was too much for a beginner. Lost all sense of direction and time, felt like a busted compass or broken watch! Vertigo symptoms and dizziness kicked in and made me very paranoid. Felt very heavy and tired but had a difficult time falling to sleep. Finally I did and just slept through the rest. Looking forward to trying it again but just a hit or two! Stars are based on the initial high, which was pleasant and energetic.

A joint of sugar leaf really came on strong. Very nice indeed.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m an experienced grower. This strain is not for novice growers. And not for summer growing. My buds were so airy I had to grind the entire plant for joints. I&#39;m not complaining. Everyone loves these joints. Too bad I have so damn little of it this harvest.

Go back inside and make the kids lots of arts and crafts, fun activities planned for the next day, and was really progressive for bout an hour or two before I got tired and dozed off. Only negative was next day I was a little iced out and groggy when I woke up. I&#39;d still have a great day with the kids. Lots of fun stuff I&#39;d set up the night before and planned out.

VAnother great strain from the cookie fam. How I always envisioned a hybrid to act. It starts off with pleasant and euphoric feelings and later transitioned to it&#39;s indica effects. People will sometimes refer to this effect as &quot;creepier,&quot; because the heavy sedation effects seems to &quot;creep&quot; in, rather than a pure indica where it&#39;s sedative effects happen quicker.

VCp is a pleasant hybrid with a wicked taste. 50/50 in nature this strain offers medical effects as well as a not too overwhelming. I would rate the batch i had a 4 but could see the potential for being excellent. I would recommend this strain for daytime medical use as well as recreationally because there is no anxiety but still an uplifting effect. Sour cherry and musky purple in flavor. 2 great strains well mixed.

VI really enjoy this strain. The nugs are absolutely beautiful to look at. The smell isn&#39;t very strong but it does have a faint cherry scent to it. The taste on the other hand is great. Now I know why it&#39;s called cherry pie. The nugs are nice n dense too. I smoked a J and I could still feel the effects a few hours later, which I that&#39;s what I like alot this strain. The triches are so caked on that the nugs look like disco balls.lol. I would definitely keep this in my med box. ( 1 of my top 10 faves)  \u000a                \u2661\u2661\u2661&amp; Peace....

Cherry Pie is the best I&#39;ve had so far for the combination of both.  The flavor is absolutely delicious, and the effect is also strong, and well balanced through the mind and body.  This is a new favorite.

VThis is currently my favorite strain. I use it to treat PTSD and when I have flashbacks or anxiety, just a couple hits of Cherry Pie (it is very potent!) takes away my symptoms. It also improves mood and for helps me take life less seriously. Most importantly for me, I experience NO paranoia when I use this strain. It is very fragrant and tastes nice. I recommend using Cherry Pie in the evening because it makes you a little tired and lazy. It definitely helps with insomnia as well.

VThis strain had me feeling like I smoked a dominant indica hybrid, instead of a sativa. I felt lost in deep thoughts and felt stoned at the gym for the longest time. I was able to stay productive but at a slow pace. I don&#39;t recommend if you looking to stay alert and focus. \u000a\u000a6.5 outta 10 #queerboisays

VOne of if not the best strain I have ever had. I smoke a lot of OG Kush, but when I had Cherry Pie my mind was blown. It has a very sweet cherry taste and that good smoke funk. 5 minutes after I smoked it I felt as if I was a bobble head and had me laughing the whole time. Like I said before one of if not my favorite strain.

VCherry pie is a good night time strain for me. It helps ease the day&#39;s stress and anxiety and releases muscle tension. I normally have a pretty high tolerance, but this last batch I picked up was pretty potent. It hit fast and hard and I wasn&#39;t expecting it. A little dizzy for a few minutes, but no paranoia or anything. Once the dizziness let up it was just a nice relaxing body feeling, and a general feeling that things will be okay that let me drift off to sleep.

VMy initial thoughts:  A strong smelling strain with more faded green color, and almost mixed brown appearance.  Almost had the appearance of a strain that was harvested a tad too late.  Tighter buds with the odd small leaf flake sticking out here and there.  Could be easily cut with scissors it&#39;s so dense.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the strain itself didn&#39;t seem to live up to it&#39;s smell.  While it does have a pleasant sweeter flavor, it takes a moment for it to catch up with you.  Not quite creeper, but not a brick wall either.  I attribute this to it&#39;s potency, which - while still being stronger than average - didn&#39;t hit like I hoped through a vaporizer.  \u000a\u000aOverall, I&#39;d give this an 8/10 on the smell/flavor/density categories, but probably closer to a 7 on the overall potency.

One of my favorite strains for video games on a day off. Also would be great for migraines or pain relief. Didn&#39;t give it a perfect score b/c it&#39;s not quite as pretty as say a platinum GSC, and doesn&#39;t taste as fabulous as Pitbull. Damn living in WA has got me spoiled af!

I took a hit from the bong and Cherry Pie on the the exhale indeed tasted yummy, like cherry!  Yum!!\u000a\u000aThe high?  It&#39;s really hard to pinpoint any special quality to it other than it&#39;s nice, like being high usually is.  Cherry Pie is, after all, a hybrid.  Because there isn&#39;t anything distinct that stands out about the high to me I will use the rest of this bud in cooking, as I&#39;ve been making a lot of edibles lately in an effort to give my lungs a break, plus I just like the slow body high of the edibles.\u000a\u000aWhen I vaped Cherry Pie it wasn&#39;t as yummy as it was from the bong. \u000a\u000aBecause there are so many strains to try and new ones being created every day, I don&#39;t think I will buy this one again anytime soon.  Still, no regrets - no bad marks for this strain, just no outstanding ones either.

I wanted something to make me feel uplifted and happy without feeling any level of anxiousness. \u000a\u000aJust vaped this and it&#39;s cool but nothing to write home about. I will say there is a lovely wave of relaxation that comes over you and I do feel more awake. This is a nice, calm, day time smoke for beginners.\u000a\u000aDefinitely lacks the oomph I was looking for. If it&#39;s under 35 an 8th, it&#39;s worth it.

It hits you fast and you know it does which is hard to come by. I noticed it had a heavy feel but was gentle on the throat hit unless of coarse I blasted the bowl. I only ever smoke out of bongs.

VThe taste of this bud is world class, it has a distinct baked goods taste with appaerent fruity undertones that when cured correctly allow for a divine smoke. The nugs are small and dense but covered with sticky trichomes inherent within the Indica strain. The color of the bud is almost a goldish green with dark orange hairs and purpleish-black spots. The smell is skunky with a hint of baked goods and fruit, but make no mistake it will stank up any room you bring it into like no Bud i have ever seen.The high provides heavy pain and stress relief while still providing some clear headedness. All around a great medicine for pain relief, insomnia, and anxiety.

VI usually pass up hybrids because they don&#39;t have much effect on me, either unpredictable or just nothing.  My 1st Cherry Pie buds were frm the Greenhouse, weighing in at 23+% THC &amp;  almost 2% THCV.  I&#39;m writing this because of the effect. This batch delivered smooth, creeper, potent euphoria &amp; &#39;oh yes, i am STONED.&#39;  Buds are light to true green, covered in thick orange hairs &amp; a tinge of violet thruout.  Unburnt buds smell strong of sweet cherry &amp; berry notes, it reminds me of Cherry Pie&#39;s grandpa, Purple Urkle.  The taste follows suit, sweet berries on inhale &amp; exhale, with a touch of Durban&#39;s earthy notes that can &#39;poison&#39; yr breath for hours.  This strain sold out in under 2 days. I&#39;m sad now; I wish I could go back for an oz!  Nice &amp; potent.

VNice Indica hybrid, great for hanging with friends. I&#39;ve had a bunch of this in hash form. Gives you a chilled-out body buzz but with a good bit of cerebral stimulation as well and not sedative or overly couch locky. Actually smells like pie crust and has flavor notes similar to a Cookies strain, it&#39;s crazy.

VGod this bud smells so good!!!! Even with congestion I was able to smell it&#39;s beautiful scent. It&#39;s a slight creeper in my opinion, and it doesn&#39;t hit you all at once. I feel as it gets better over time. Lots of smiles to just random people lol. Great laughter, so much euphoria! I was pretty talkative in the beginning. Ended up pretty hungry and thirsty. Especially the thirst! I don&#39;t know about doing complex things while high on this. I was making silly mistakes like searching someone&#39;s Instagram name on the YouTube search bar. Also the paranoia is slight. Just try to be distracted if it starts to happen or just have someone to talk to.

VVery good bud. One of the best strains we\u2019ve tried (probably THE best). I have currently finished smoking this strain with my friend and we both feel very light like the feather of a dove. We are currently listening to Hunger by Rhye. And it feels like we are swimming through the warm oceans of one those warms ass countries. We can feel the sun heating our skin and imagining sea creatures playing the instruments and serenading us all around. There are 4 dolphins as our backing dancers, gently swaying to the rhythm of the ocean. A massive whale breaching above the waters. A medium sized fish singing beautiful music. Along with other fish playing instruments. Oh, and on that saxophone solo near the end of the song, we see a shark suddenly appearing and performing on the sax. So yeah. This strain is also creative too.

Vtldr: Getting too high off this was unpleasant. In small doses it&#39;s quite enjoyable. \u000a\u000along:\u000aI&#39;m a new smoker, I&#39;ve had anxiety from smoking in the past, so I&#39;m very cautious when I smoke up.\u000aWhen I smoke this I get numb and tingly, deeply relaxed almost like I&#39;m dreaming. Can&#39;t say I felt particularly happy/euphoric/uplifted or giggly.\u000awhen I smoked too much I needed to lie down because of anxiety, I made tea but as I drank it I felt like all my senses were workijg at different speeds ( I saw myself drinking it, then heard it a few seconds later, then felt it on my lips after I had already swallowed... it was weird)\u000a\u000alots of people seem to love this strain! it was definitely ok in small doses, I&#39;ll finish what I have for sure, but it wasn&#39;t for me.

VFirst-time medical marijuana user, primarily treating anxiety. Two hits hits from a Dugout one-hitter and I was feeling uplifted, energetic, and social. The third hit was too much for a beginner. Lost all sense of direction and time, felt like a busted compass or broken watch! Vertigo symptoms and dizziness kicked in and made me very paranoid. Felt very heavy and tired but had a difficult time falling to sleep. Finally I did and just slept through the rest. Looking forward to trying it again but just a hit or two!

VCherry pie i&#39;d have to say is my most favorite strain all around. Most arousing aroma when you  crack a nug, smells like fresh baked goods. Tastes like it smells maybe even better, with a little earthiness. The nugs are as beautiful as it gets almost everytime I get some; Dense, stout, covered in crystals. With a dark purpleish leaves, and darkish green nugs. And nice thick little orange hairs creeping out. Light grey ash when it smokes, so you know its good. The high is amazing, perfect for anytime really for me. Nice hybrid cerebreal high and laid back, but also uplifting. 5 out of 5 no doubt! I try to get some Cherry Pie nearly everytime I pick up from the dispensaries. Always a bud to have in my rotation.

VThe scent of both Durban Posion and GDP are definitely evident as soon you break the seal of its container. I find myself smelling it a bit more than other strains because it smells so unique and fresh. The high is strong, with a creeping onset, and a perfectly balanced hybrid blend in my opinion. Highly recommended for pain and appetite. This pie should be dosed considerably, as it may be a bit much for thrill seeking beginners. Top quality bud!

VI grow this strain and it is one of my favorites to smoke. we have seen thc levels as high as 28.3% with ours but is averaged out around 26%. if you are going to grow this I recommend c02. I think it&#39;s one of the easier strains to grow as long as you keep it well manicured and adequate air flow I have never had powdery mildew or bugs on my strains due to clean room environment so I can&#39;t vouch for what it will do outside.

Also, it definitely gives me a headie high in my head :) Right now I don&#39;t feel any stress/anxiety from a stressful day at work. I absolutely recommend it for anyone who needs anxiety relief or help with pain, specifically back pain. For for me at least. Hope this helps.

My mind was wonderfully creative and I felt giggly all over, with a nice side of the munchies, I quickly found myself on the way to In-n-Out.. Still feeling the couch locking effects and loving the creative mind buzz. Perfect hybrid.I&#39;m going to float to sleep and probably have some nice dreams. &#128564;&#128564;&#128519;&#128513;

VPossibly top 10 of all time favorite strains for me.  Being that Durban Poison is in my top 3, Cherry Pie has got to be one of the best hybrids out there. And any Purp is great with GDP and Purple Urkle being 2 of my most treasured Indicas. \u000aI really like the sweet earthy taste that comes with CP. \u000aThe high is almost perfect, especially in the evening. Feeling up but relaxed. Could go well with a coffee or a beer. So I like it as a sat/sun morning smoke when there&#39;s a little less responsibility. CP gets my #sunsetsmokeseshaward &#127942;

VCp is a pleasant hybrid with a wicked taste. 50/50 in nature this strain offers medical effects as well as a not too overwhelming. I would rate the batch i had a 4 but could see the potential for being excellent. I would recommend this strain for daytime medical use as well as recreationally because there is no anxiety but still an uplifting effect. Sour cherry and musky purple in flavor. 2 great strains well mixed.

VAnother great strain from the cookie fam. How I always envisioned a hybrid to act. It starts off with pleasant and euphoric feelings and later transitioned to it&#39;s indica effects. People will sometimes refer to this effect as &quot;creepier,&quot; because the heavy sedation effects seems to &quot;creep&quot; in, rather than a pure indica where it&#39;s sedative effects happen quicker.

VDefinitely got the job done lol. I used to smoke this when I was a live-in nanny. After everyone went to bed I&#39;d go and burn a little out in the dewy grass. Go back inside and make the kids lots of arts and crafts, fun activities planned for the next day, and was really progressive for bout an hour or two before I got tired and dozed off. Only negative was next day I was a little iced out and groggy when I woke up. I&#39;d still have a great day with the kids. Lots of fun stuff I&#39;d set up the night before and planned out. Every night though I&#39;d still look forward to my guilty pleasure... a sweet slice of cherry pie&#127856;&#127826;&#129303;

VLove the taste and smell of this strain. Very different from other strains I&#39;ve tried... about 50 of them. The Force is strong in this one. Handle with care. A joint of sugar leaf really came on strong. Very nice indeed.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m an experienced grower. This strain is not for novice growers. And not for summer growing. My buds were so airy I had to grind the entire plant for joints. I&#39;m not complaining. Everyone loves these joints. Too bad I have so damn little of it this harvest.

VThis is my 2nd time ever vaping marijuana (I have only ever had vaporized concentrates, never actually smoked it). It tasted minty, herbal, sweet. Not too strong at all, I actually really enjoyed the taste. I took quite a few hits because I&#39;m a novice and wasn&#39;t feeling anything. Finally it kicked in what felt like 20 minutes later and I was on cloud 9. The only thing that felt natural was to smile, a neutral face felt forced. We had to go into a pizza place for food and I was super giggly, had trouble walking because my legs felt wobbly, and ULTRA paranoid that people knew I was high. I went to the bathroom and had to control my laughter for about 5 min before going out. I felt very egocentric like I was in my own bubble and everything outside my bubble was separate, but also just so paranoid. Next time I do this I will stay home :)

Took my severe back pain and made it a figment of my imagination. Things are wide open here in Houston now. Hydro is everywhere. I am comforted to know I will see a steady supply of this medicine.

VThe smell of this strain is amazing! With purple trichomes all over this sticky bud. Definitely a night time smoke. Very relaxing, great for pain or after a workout. Melts away stress and leaves you feeling like the end of your day has arrived. That smell though ;) Can cause headaches and definitely leaves you couch-locked. Red eyes and full body elevation achieved here. This high does end up right between the temples and tightens its grip slowly and steadily.

It is a deep, intriguing smell that has the complexity of a good pie.  It was easy for me to concentrate on this indica dominant hybrid (mine was about 65% indica) and the high mellowed out and the end.

VAside from an a pretty distracted high (A little surprised here, seeing granddaddy strain Durban Poison is one of my all-time favorite productivity boosters), I&#39;m impressed with CP&#39;s longevity - a nice, heady haze for a couple hours. Soothing and euphoric, which I&#39;d imagine goes magnificently outdoors; unfortunately, Puget Sound winters offer little of this. Great for the Netflix-and-or-chiller, and happy/uplifting enough for anything from West Wing seasons or stand-up comedy specials. Not as giddy as I&#39;d been led to believe, but I can&#39;t wait to take this flower on some road trips.

VBy far one of my favorite strains. The ounce I picked up was Grade A premium from northern California.  It initially gets you really happy initially followed by a sedation into the twilight. Great strain for creativeness. Thoughts kept flowing and great ideas would randomly pop up. \u000a\u000aI heavily used this strain for a month straight. After a while I started to notice my memory was improving along with improvements in speech and long term creativeness. I felt I was becoming in a way smarter and was starting to appreciate art. \u000a\u000aThis strain is great for depression, stress, insomnia (higher doses), anxiety.

VThat great cherry taste was evident. Looked green with orange/red hairs all over. Dense, smells great just not overwhelming. It was a creeper. Had 1 whole bag from the volcano and after I was done I was disappointed. Then 5-10 min later I started feeling that shift in perspective and that warm head feeling. Felt relaxed and happy and content. Like a less strong GSC or Cherry Kush. That is why the lower rating, but will buy again if the other 2 (GSC or Cherry Kush) isn&#39;t available. From New Hope Clinic in Sacramento, CA.

VCherry pie! When i first smelled cherry pie, it was an ounce and it had such a strong tart musky sent, I immediately thought the name made so much sense. But then when i took a small bud to smell; i felt it had a really sweet and floral smell. The taste was very similar like a rose! What i really love about this strain is the uplifting and creative spark that quickly over comes me after smoking. This is a great midday strain for a boost. It&#39;s also one of my favorites for smoking with large groups and having a good time!

VMy first review of this strain was as an absolute beginner smoker. It hit me hard. Overwhelmingly so and I had to sleep it off. I continued smoking it daily in smaller amounts and by the end of the month was able to celebrate my birthday with a whole bowl. Ha! Ended up loving this strain and its uplifting feel. I&#39;m always looking to try something new, but I&#39;m looking forward to returning to this one next time I see it on the menu.

VAwesome smell, smooth smoke, and great buzz, but ever so slightly disappointing in flavor. Considering the outstanding appearance and  aroma of this bud you would expect a blast of flavor, however, it is likely due to its parent genes (GDP x DP), neither of which express over the top flavor. Fun fact: This strain does very well under high power LEDs (where other strains exhibit leaf burn or discoloration).

It&#39;s sweet, dank, and tastes amazing when you smoke it. It&#39;s the perfect strain for anything, I&#39;ve smoked it alone, with friends, at concerts, at parties, you name it. I havent been able to find it near me recently though...a real shame. But I&#39;m getting by...\u000a\u000aThis is the perfect strain for anyone. Even if you&#39;re new to smoking or a seasoned veteran you&#39;ll still enjoy the high it brings on.

VFantastic strain!!! Definitely the product of its ancestors, the only noticeable negative is major cotton mouth which is to be expected, and of course isn&#39;t really that bad of a negative. The dry eyes weren&#39;t super significant. Got some chapped ass lips afterwards too but oh well. The Euphoria is what sets in immediately giving a breezy, uplifting feeling. I felt like I was floating up. Stress is completely gone, I couldn&#39;t help but start to smile. Nothing was on my mind except for my immediate surroundings and emotions. After the initial euphoria, a feeling of serious lethargy overcame me which I can only expect is a result of the Grandaddy Purple. One of the best highs I&#39;ve had in a while.

VMy all-time FAV. The flavor is amazing, really sweet, skunky, and kushy. The effects are indica, making the couch feel way more comfortable than usual but if you need to be doing things it&#39;s not hard to get up. Senses feel sharpened and you feel super creative and clear minded with tons of room for thinking. If you are an artist, musician or just feel like rewinding and chillaxing for the evening this is for you. Even though it is indica, I like it in the day while walking through the neighborhood. Really opens up your mind. Beware, can make you eat... Like a lot lol but really good for headaches, stress, and pain. 5 STARS

VThis strain smells great. Take a good deep nasal inhale of the bud and you can smell the cherry pie just waiting to bake you. Nice dense buds. The effects of it are a nice happy feeling, for those who have anxiety or anger issues, this is a huge benefit. The smell while burning it is a nice fruity, earthy smell. Personally, i like a nice, clean, glass bowl for bud this tasty, but also really burns nicely in a dutch. \u000aFor me, this is my favorite strain.

VThe high is like a speeding train.  Once you get moving, like walking or doing yardwork... you can do it with energy and longevity.   Depending on how much you smoke, the high could get uncomfortable.  Too much , and your head will start buzzing and later once you comedown, may feel dizziness/anxious.   Definitely one to stay away from if you want to relax.    Not a fan myself

VYou will never forget the smell of Cherry Pie; pungent, skunky, herbal/flowery, purple, semi-sweet and absolutely punch-you-in-the-face strong.  Durban Poison and GDP combine to create a strain with dark green/purple fat dense nugs with dark orange/red hair - it can have sort of a mottled yellow and lighter green throughout, just like GDP always tends to appear.  The heavy skunky stench and the dark nugs come from the DP, while the sweetness, density, and purple are GDP characteristics.  The high is strong and full-bodied - starting in the head and melting into a full body euphoria; I find it leans towards the Indica side of things, but can still be very suitable for any time of day.  Not a heavy, sleepy, narcotic indica - more euphoria, happiness, and a dreamy feeling.  Very popular in Cali right now - especially in the greenhouses.

VSolid mid-shelf, sativa-dominant hybrid. This bud being supposedly derived from Granddaddy Purp and Durban Poison, I expected something a little more stimulating. Nevertheless, this strain delivered a solid high that was more cerebral than calming, but was not overwhelming in terms of potency. The taste and smell are sweet and reminiscent of berries.

VI have to admit, I&#39;m disappointed in this strain.. To be fair, it could be that particular grow, but needless to say I&#39;m disappointed.. Nice sized and smelling buds, very frosty with crystals, but after going through a 1/3 of a jay the size of a cigarette, to only feel brain fuzz and like you&#39;re walking through sand is sad.. Meanwhile other strains like GG4 or GSC would knock you on your ass if you smoked that much by yourself..  Gonna try vaping it next, when I can, hopefully that&#39;ll release more goodness....

VThis was a strain recommended to me by a friend and I was excited to try it, particularly due to the taste that was described (i.e. Black Cherries). &#127826;&#127826;&#127826;\u000a\u000aI must admit that I think I got an incredible batch of this strain as the smell was heavenly as soon as I opened it up. Smoking it in a joint was no less pleasant. Definitely a fruity taste akin to cherries and an absolute delight.\u000a\u000aThe high was not immediate but within 15  mins after a few draws on the joint I was this strain&#39;s prisoner. An incredible head high accompanied by an absolute resignation to laugh at anything remotely humorous. Also a strong sense of couch lock with little appetite increase - the ride of euphoria was not having food included. \u000a\u000aSlept like a baby after an evening of laughter. \u000a\u000aI would note, however, that it is almost 16 hours later and I am still half-baked and resigned to my couch. This one lasts - at least for me- a long time. My partner in crime is also asleep on the other couch having experienced the same stock - wonderful for a weekend of relaxation, but not a weekday strain in my books. \u000a\u000aAbsolutely loved it though - will have a second helping of cherry pie again soon!

VI describe Cherry Pie as the perfect hybrid. As if it was designed for any activity, this strain can be used for anything you want it to be. Whether you need something to help you sleep or something to get your day started or anywhere in between Cherry Pie has that versatility. It never has given me more of a head or body high, rather a beautiful balance of both.

I feel relaxed and happy, with a little energy. Not too much, though, don&#39;t get me wrong but it&#39;s like a second wind... Not an adrenaline rush. There&#39;s no real crash I&#39;ve noticed but with my hectic life the relaxation effect does help me sleep. This is definently in my top 5.

Not the dopest dope I have ever smoked. It had a nice cherry flavor on exhale, not much in the smell department though.

VThis strain&#39;s unique, sickly-sweet, pungent aroma can be described in only one word...dank. Cherry Bomb would be a more precise name, because once you open a jar, the bouquet explodes out into the room. But that aroma turns into a really pleasant taste, once combusted. This particular bud was particularly smooth, as well, which is always something I appreciate in good smoke. As for the effect, Cherry Pie has a really interesting Sativa/Indica combo going on.  Mentally, it begins pretty clear-headed, then transitions in a spacey high. I definitely felt a bit introspective, but certainly didn&#39;t feel like I was trapped in my head. Physically, I felt very chill. I was nice and relaxed and although a little spacey, I was definitely able to keep up with what was going on around me.  It&#39;s certainly not an indica, but Cherry Pie wouldn&#39;t be my choice when trying to stay active. But, it would be the perfect pairing when watching a movie, going to see a play or listening to your favorite album. For people looking to use cannabis medicinally, this strain may help relieve depression, anxiety and stress

VI agree that the smell is a little off putting. Think sour d but with a hint of woody fruit. The whole cherry part I think is a bit overrated, the cherry is more of an undertone. The spicey taste on exhale is a nice surprise. All of this doesn&#39;t mean slit because the effects are spot on. Relaxed but not too tired and I felt really nice. It won&#39;t be a go to for me but I&#39;m glad I finally got to try it.

VCherry Pie is a wonderful strain and If you can get your hands on it, go for it! Although at first, it may trouble you that this strain is a stong indica (Being 90/10 Indica), but it sure doesn&#39;t seem like it! I was really creative, talkative, and happy! Not too much of a couch lock, but it&#39;ll knock you down if you&#39;re not careful! Some negatives were dry mouth, heavy/dry eyes, and it somewhat-hindered my driving due to it&#39;s stong, limb-numbing effect. Overall, Cherry Pie is a high-quality stain and it sure is delicious!

VI&#39;m not sure if this is because when I smoked this today I was already a little drunk and ripped a HUGE beautiful bong with like seven percs but I got sooo stoned. I had smoked quite a bit of this last night while I was on some edibles and the high was just overwhelming and tiring. However, earlier today it was an awesome euphoric giggly long lasting high. Very, very nice. No physical or body effect for me or any visual confusion/coolness. Just an awesome mindset and a hazy day :)

VSlight cherry taste on exhale with a mildly mellow sour afterbite. Non-chemical in taste. Smells of berry. Great daytime strain to keep you mellow, euphoric, and happy. For medical use I use it as a daytime strain to help with my PTSD and the symptoms associated with it.  4.5 for daytime strain!

VIt was good.  My max hit is 5.  It is my 2nd strain I have tried. I felt the happy sensation and like a punch of relaxation.  My mistake was I&#39;m heading to work but called in sick the last minute.  It was my happiest and relaxing feeling that I want to go to sleep. My migraine went away and I had food after, nothing crazy.  It&#39;s been 2 hours now and still feeling the relaxing sensation.

VCould&#39;ve been a bad crop or something, but I personally didn&#39;t feel much of an effect from when I smoked this. It just didn&#39;t feel very potent. I smoked about ~10grams of this, but didn&#39;t really enjoy it much. For me the best part of this strain was it running out so I can buy a different strain and move on from Cherry Pie.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d consider it 2 stars though, if I was to get it cheap or something I&#39;d consider it again. Like it wasn&#39;t bad, it just was noticeably weaker for me than other strains.
