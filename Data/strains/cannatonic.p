VThis is a high-quality strain. Great medicinal value. Excellent tasting, Haze dominant. I smoked my sample and that is not the best way to utilize CBD in our bodies. No psychoactive effect you simply just feel fine. It&#39;s pretty cool. If you are a medical patient, check it out. Recreationally, this probably isn&#39;t what you are looking for but keep in mind rec users, CBD is a great alternative to Tylenol, aspirin, or acetaminophen for a variety of ailments so instead of going to the drug store, stop by your local shop and pick up some CBD oil or edibles!

VThis has got to be the most medicinal products out there. With a 28 to 1 ratio CBD to THC, cannatonic sets the bar for other CBD strains. Use alone or mixed with other strains to add THC, either way, cannatonic is awesome. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve seen people who couldn&#39;t walk apply sublingually apply cannatonic CO2 and begin walking within five minutes. I know a girl who began taking cannatonic and after a month her doctor said she was ulcer free after a life long battle with stomach ulcers. I use it for anxiety and no longer need benzos to keep the edge off. \u000a\u000aCannatonic will be legendary (if you don&#39;t already consider it to be), in time, when Medicinal Marijuana&#39;s benefits are given a larger platform while putting pharmaceuticals into bankruptcy.

VI come from a family of weed connoisseur  , and advocates. Everyone around me has always smoked and I&#39;ve seen the benefits firsthand.  , personally I just can&#39;t fuck with weed- Or so I thought. \u000aEvery time I&#39;d smoked in the past, I&#39;d be that one person, stuck on stupid. One of my relatives introduced me to this strain yesterday . He, along with many others  informed me it didn&#39;t &quot; get them high&quot; ( they prefer a high THC content) , so they wanted to see how I&#39;d like it. I was skeptical at first , However , I AM A FAN.  No paranoia , no munchies, no dazed and confused feeling. Literally was a great way to end a stressful workweek - took my headache away, and I was completely relaxed , but I wasn&#39;t feeling &quot; trapped&quot; in my mind as I had when I&#39;d smoked other weeds before.  Now I know - high  CBD; low THC is where it&#39;s at for me. Does anyone know of any strains they  think are comparable to this one , or better ?

VPain - if you have it, you need to use this.  I vape it daily.  It smells like a hairy man&#39;s asshole, but it works SOOOO good for pain relief.  It smells awful, but if you can get passed it, you&#39;ll learn to love it.  I suffer from chronic kidney stones, endometriosis, hypersensitive fibromyalsia, neurological pain disorder &lt;unknown so far&gt;, herniated discs, torn disc, dislocated ribs, inflammation throughout my body, and asthma.  Works for inflammation &amp; every type of pain in the body &lt;not sure about migraines&gt;.  I get a little tingle in my brain, but I normally wind up pretty damn happy because I&#39;m not in pain.  Not sure if it&#39;s a forced feeling of happiness or if it&#39;s because I&#39;m not in pain.  Either way, this is my #1 for pain relief.  I&#39;m still fully alert &amp; aware, never makes me sleepy or tired.  Doesn&#39;t make me hungry or change the flavor of food.\u000a\u000aI don&#39;t use a ton, so my review is based off of 4 puffs.

VCannatonic is a great high CBD strain... in fact, I have never seen anything like this.  I purchased it two different times from SPARC in SF, which tests for THC/CBD and shows it on the package.  The first batch said 16.8% CBD to 6.8% THC, the second batch was 16% CBD and only 1% THC!  CBD blocks anxiety and paranoia along with some other effects caused by high THC, but is also great for muscle spasm and pain, to some extent.  The best thing is you can mix it with another high THC variety and get the best of both worlds... this helps get the benefits of THC with less anxiety.  This strain is also probably the best for medical cannabis beginners as CBD prevents any overly intense high.

VI highly recommend this strain to anyone with a chronic illness. I have HCV, and this is the first strain in my four years of being a cannabis patient that has FULLY eased my symptoms. It has been a true godsend. Cannatonic allows me to carry on, and get through my day (with 0% anxiety). If you are looking for relief and have yet to find it through other varieties, this is definitely the one to try. It will not leave you unable to interact with people, like other varieties I&#39;ve used; and you don&#39;t need to become inebriated to achieve relief from your symptoms.. although in the evening it doesn&#39;t hurt :) Cannatonic gives a spacey, euphoric, relaxing, and extremely pleasant (sometimes even sexually arousing) sensation when deeply indulged in. This is absolutely my go to strain. Congratulations Washington, Massachusetts, and Colorado voters! We have shown the world once again that we have a voice. Enjoy your new freedoms, and keep on fighting :)  Om Namah Shivaya!

VFor the past 2 weeks, I&#39;ve been taking massive amounts of Ibuprofen for my migraines, resulting in kidney inflammation.  Then my Dr gave me some migraine medication, and that didn&#39;t work for my really bad episodes.  FINALLY.. I tried a 2:1 high CBD tincture made from Cannatonic... and I swear that headache went away almost immediately.  I feel totally &quot;sober&quot; and able to work and write this review! I love this stuff. I&#39;m tossing all my pain meds and using this for now on.  I&#39;ve never been able to successfully treat a headache or migraine w/ MMJ but this stuff seriously works for me. I also got an 1/8 of the actual flower but I haven&#39;t tried it yet.  I&#39;m hoping it works well for my headaches that aren&#39;t migraines.

VI have wicked anxiety. Went from being an avid smoker when I was in my 20s to having panic attacks. I have desperately trying to find something that allows me to feel in control of my head but takes away nausea and anxiousness. I&#39;ve tried many edibles, tinctures, patches. Most of which were either too strong in THC or didn&#39;t help at all. I was really afraid to smoke again. Well....I&#39;m now mad I didn&#39;t try it earlier. This is the perfect short lived strain. Doesn&#39;t burn your throat, can calm small panic attacks, helps me sleep....I would love to have this in a vape version because I&#39;m an ex cigg. smoker and would prefer not to actually smoke anything but, until I find that I&#39;ll be using this to help me everyday . totally worth the price. if you are scared I promise, there is no need to be. and if for a second you feel uncomfortable. it goes away very rapidly. I&#39;m in love.

VI&#39;m a 65 year old Progressive MS patient in a wheelchair. Let me say this strain has helped me so much. Have pretty severe spasticity and occasional prolonged tremors. After vamping can feel the loosening effects first in shoulders then working down through my whole body.

Vbought this to help a pinched nerve in my back. the strain I purchased claimed to be 17.8% CBD And only 1% THC. I took a few hits and didn&#39;t feel anything. So, 3 bowls later I found myself very relaxed with very little symptoms of pain. Yet I was still fully functional; it didn&#39;t take but a few minutes to pass out once I got in bed. Overall I was pleased and will purchase again knowing I can actually function doing normal things.

VMy favorite strain thus far. A notably high in CBD strain. The THC/CBD ratio is apparently 1:1. Smoking will get me just a touch high and vaping (using the mflb) won&#39;t. Getting high is not the priority for this strain. The main \u000abenefits are simply relaxation and a slight feeling of happiness. This is the type of strain that will not debilitate you; the kind you could take before going to class.

Both were relaxing and extremely mellow, with just the right mix of high and physical comfort. I can&#39;t recommend this strain more highly, particularly when you&#39;re feeling stressed.

VThis CO2 oil is amazing! I was told it was a great THC to CBD ratio and a small amount would do the trick. The first night I gave this a shot. Within 15 minutes, my eyes were feeling a bit heavy and the pain started to diminish rapidly. I smoked this on top of flower as well and that was amazing, but recommend using something like a G-Pen, as it burns much cleaner and less irritation on the lungs. Having severe Fibromyalgia and taking various pain killers and meds for muscle spasms, I can say that this stuff BY FAR exceeds the prescription meds and does not have addictive properties like prescription pain killers.

Doesn&#39;t make you feel completely stoned, but definitely has positive effects. I&#39;ve never been a fan of the frankenweed for daytime consumption, because I just can&#39;t function. This lets me smoke, get positive effects on mood an anxiety without just hitting me like a mack truck like some other strains. Can work, have a conversation, whatever. Earthy flavor.

VThis is miracle weed. I have an extremely tight schedule, and I smoke in the evenings to help me come down after school and work. Unfortunately, in addition to the physical relaxation, I very often experience anxiety, paranoia, &quot;thinking in circles&quot;, confusion, and other negative side effects. I would experience this with both indicas and sativas alike. It became so common for me to have a bad high that I gave up smoking weed at all because the negatives began to outweigh the positives. Enter Cannatonic! My boyfriend ordered this especially for me, and after trying it once I&#39;ve smoked it in the evenings almost every single day since, with no negative effects except for some dry mouth/eyes. \u000a\u000aWhen I smoke a little of this I immediately relax, and often experience a powerful euphoria. Smoke a little more, and I start getting drowsy, a little more again, and I can get really stoned. Great for listening to and appreciating music, feeling good, positive, chilled out. It&#39;s just great stuff. I know some have complained that they don&#39;t really get high on this stuff, my boyfriend doesn&#39;t smoke it because he has to smoke a ton to get anything out of it, but it&#39;s the ideal strain for me.

I felt it off the first hit instantly and I did feel a little anxious I won&#39;t lie to you, but that could&#39;ve been pre nerves too. I felt tingly in my chest and legs which turned into complete body relaxation. I feel euphoric in my head in the front and back, a better description would be it feels like a tickle in my head that makes me laugh and feel good. It&#39;s been 2 hours now and I still feel the effects and I had the tiniest hit I ever took and I used to smoke a ton. Bottom line, I&#39;d recommend it at your discretion

VI tried this because of it&#39;s high CBD %. While I think the high CBD&#39;s do help with my chronic back pain. I think this gets me a little more stoned than I&#39;d like to be during the  day. Harlequin seems to be a better option (if you can find it!) for patients looking for pain relieve and less of the head high. This is a good medical strain, but for me had more of a psychoactive high than the Harlequin, or Raskal OG.

VBought this strain from High Country Healing in silverthorne Colorado over the holidays to try my first high CBD strain. I vaped it and really liked the effects for a daytime smoke. It definitely does not get you head high and definitely no anxiety or paranoia at all even after repeated tokes. In fact, it actually seemed to calm me down and make me feel more centered and focused. I could easily have done analytic type work or gone to the gym on this strain. The body effects were very soothing, relaxing like having two beers, but with a very clear head similar to how you feel after a long run or hard workout. \u000a\u000aOver several smoke sessions I mixed this strain with higher thc strains like kosher kush and silver haze and loved the control it gave me over the high. Many high thc strains make my head racy and bring on anxiety for me, but cannatonic let me sample some really high thc buds and dial the effects back when I overdid it. I would definitely recommend having this strain in your stash.

VI have ankylosing spondylitis, and this is my default daily vape. The flower I get tends to be about 10%/12% thc / cbd, and it is just wonderful for joint inflammation. It does give me some mild jitters in my chest if I use enough to really get high, but I feel like that isn&#39;t the point with this strain. It is definitely a nighttime vape, but still leaves me clear headed enough that I can function relatively unimpeded. Highly recommended for anyone with inflammatory pain, not so much recreationally.

After using marijuana medicinally for the last year I have found the following works best for me: \u000a\u000aHarlequin for \u2018mental\u2019 work\u000aCannatonic for social situations and sleep\u000aSwiss tsunami / sweet Island skunk / AC/DC plus some others for general anxiety and home relaxation \u000a\u000aHope this helps!

VI have ankylosing spondylitis, and this is my default daily vape. The flower I get tends to be about 10%/12% thc / cbd, and it is just wonderful for joint inflammation. It does give me some mild jitters in my chest if I use enough to really get high, but I feel like that isn&#39;t the point with this strain. It is definitely a nighttime vape, but still leaves me clear headed enough that I can function relatively unimpeded. Highly recommended for anyone with inflammatory pain, not so much recreationally.

V.order to write these reviews I need to take notes and always wtite down my thoughts before looking at the strains page. Because of this I didn&#39;t realize there&#39;s no listing for &quot;Chronatonic&quot;, a strain in a few AZ dispensaries, but my notes are eerily similar.\u000a\u000aThey read: Color - Light Green, with Orange Streaks. Looks - Fluffy, Very Hairy. Smell - Woody, Forest but not evergreen. Taste - Smokey Wooden, Dark not sharp, Fruity almost Orange... slightly Citrus but very dull. \u000a\u000aEffects On: Nerve Damage / Sciatica. Arthritis, in hands. Carpal Tunnel. Energy/Fatigue. Appetite. Seizures/Epilepsy. Eye Pressure\u000a\u000aIf you have Sciatica you know it is the most impossible pain to treat. Back Pain - Improved, less tension in hips and butterfly pelvis. Arthritis - Eases tightness. Carpal tunnel - Improves grip. Energy - Slight boost, not sleepy (definitely a hybrid). Appetite - Didn&#39;t notice either way. Seizures - Decreases headache auroas. Eye Pressure - Glazes eyes, dries so use eye drops, eases socket and jaw pain.\u000a\u000aVery medical strain overall, reccomend for actual frequent treatment. Length of heavy effects before redosing, 1hr to retreat nerve pain. Usually load a snap, less than .4gs. Heavy smoker for years, avid strain elitist, but always had incredibly low tolerance before effects sit in.

VThis batch of Cannatonic is 12.5%CBD and 5.8%THC. I feel refreshed: warm and tingly in the body, cool and clear in the head. Another batch (2:1 CBD-THC ratio) has very little psychoactive effect for me, but my body feels great... I mostly prefer a little buzz. \u000a\u000aThis is my top medicinal strain for mood, health, pain, anxiety, easing social interaction, insomnia, stress, and creativity.

VI am new to cannabis and have a very low tolerance for THC.  I usually cannot smoke any of my friend&#39;s collective-purchased stashes as they&#39;re always too potent for me, and I get extreme anxiety.  I did some homework on strains, and decided to try this one.  I purchased some from Spectrum Caregivers in Los Angeles, and I&#39;m so happy to report that this is the PERFECT strain for me!  \u000a\u000aI was a little worried before I smoked it as I&#39;ve gotten too high before and it&#39;s not fun.  Within a couple of minutes of smoking the flower, I felt an incredible happiness and inner peace.  I felt a mild head buzz, but it was absolutely clear and anxiety-free.  My body felt so good... all the tension I have in my shoulders seemed to melt away (I still don&#39;t feel any tension right now, a whole day later without smoking it again) and my stomach felt warm and &quot;loose&quot;.  I haven&#39;t been able to sleep very well since I quit smoking cigarettes 3 weeks ago, and it gave me the best night&#39;s rest I&#39;ve had since I quit. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this to any beginner or someone who is looking to quell anxiety problems.  I can&#39;t say enough great things about this strain, or how happy I am that it works so well for me.  I can&#39;t wait to continue to reap the benefits and am so grateful.

VAs someone with a history of weed related anxiety and paranoia, Cannatonic made it very easy to get back into enjoying marijuana. With my very low tolerance, I experienced an initial body centered high that gradually trailed into calm contentedness. A few moments of anxiety here or there, but overall a huge improvement of my typical smoking sessions. If you do experience anxiety or paranoia with marijuana, this strain could be worth a try.

VCannatonic is my go-to strain before AND after physical therapy appointments. It loosens all my muscles up before my appointments and takes all my pain away post-therapy. I am not a huge flower smoker (usually prefer either edibles or oils) but I HAVE to have some Cannatonic in my line-up. 4.5/5. The only thing I would change about this strain is the smell/taste. Could definitely be a bit tastier.

The strong body buzz would trigger an attack.  But the visual changes in my sight might have also caused me anxiety.  Unfortunately what was to be a relaxing time, just turned so sour so fast.  \u000a\u000aWith this strain, I am able to get the relaxation I need without the head high or body buzz that triggers my attacks.  The high cbd content and low THC is the perfect pairing if you have anxiety and want an anti-inflammatory and immune system regulator. It will keep you relaxed. I could function fine although I was sometimes a lil heavy-lidded.  \u000a\u000aThe effects didnt last long. 2 hours tops.  So I medicated often- wanted to keep the healing cbds in my body (:  Only time will tell if this helps cure my psoriasis.  i&#39;ll let you know if it does.\u000a\u000aGot my Cannatonic at Waterfall Wellness in SF.

VThis was the first time I had a high CBD content strain. I usually go for sativas with higher level of THC to help me go by with my medical condition and for recreational occasions. This is truly medical marijuana and I was happily surprised to see how much it relieved the symptoms of my neurologic pain condition. It is perfect for day use as I felt perfectly functional and alert. \u000aI gave it a 4 stars instead of 5 because, even in a vaporizer, I felt it was &quot;burning&quot; pretty fast compared to other strains.

VAfter a medium-size blunt to myself at night (because the time of day affects; the environment, socially, emotionally, and physically, your state of consciousness. Why it&#39;s important for any review to be through or direct to get the bigger picture), i feel mellow, tranquil, alert, curious, unfocused, &quot;in tune with nature,&quot; stimulated, but relaxed; peaceful and creative; an 8-8.5 on &quot;body relaxation scale,&quot; and a 9 on the pleasantness of &#39;my&#39; intrapersonal experience, though I&#39;d only give a 6 at the most on the intensity of the experience. But again, it&#39;s a cbd-strain, so this is sort of no surprise. I like it a lot, but I like a lot of different varieties for different reasons. Overall, there&#39;s &#39;merely&#39; a general well-being that washes over you for a few hours. The effects are slow - 15, 20 minutes before I started to feel the medicinal qualities take hold on my body and arrest my mind for a 15 or 20 minutes; now smoothing out into a pleasant, mellow body stone, but not sleepy - I just cracked all my joints in my neck and back because of her kindness)....any way, great strain: 8/10.

VCannatonic is a strain that put me at peace. It&#39;s not one of those in your face strains. It crept up slowly and it felt like it was going to blast but it remained mellow. 0 anxiety. Just calm.

VI wasn&#39;t expecting to feel the strong head buzz from this strain since I had read that it was a high CBD strain.

VI have horrible headaches and have been on narcotics which I am sick to death of taking. The headaches stem from my neck which gives me a lot of pain also. I was surprised how well Cannatonic worked for me. I use it in my vaporizer and had good relief. I wasn&#39;t looking to get &quot;high&quot; though I did get some, mostly I got relaxed and good pain relief.

VAfter a medium-size blunt to myself at night (because the time of day affects; the environment, socially, emotionally, and physically, your state of consciousness. Why it&#39;s important for any review to be through or direct to get the bigger picture), i feel mellow, tranquil, alert, curious, unfocused, &quot;in tune with nature,&quot; stimulated, but relaxed; peaceful and creative; an 8-8.5 on &quot;body relaxation scale,&quot; and a 9 on the pleasantness of &#39;my&#39; intrapersonal experience, though I&#39;d only give a 6 at the most on the intensity of the experience. But again, it&#39;s a cbd-strain, so this is sort of no surprise. I like it a lot, but I like a lot of different varieties for different reasons. Overall, there&#39;s &#39;merely&#39; a general well-being that washes over you for a few hours. The effects are slow - 15, 20 minutes before I started to feel the medicinal qualities take hold on my body and arrest my mind for a 15 or 20 minutes; now smoothing out into a pleasant, mellow body stone, but not sleepy - I just cracked all my joints in my neck and back because of her kindness)....any way, great strain: 8/10.

I was in tears from the pain when I got off work today so I stopped at Maritime Cafe, told them how much pain I was in and they recommended Cannatonic. I took a 40mg OP and was still in massive pain. I smoked just a little Canna tonic and suddenly realized the pain was almost completely gone! This is the best pain medicine I have EVER had! I  highly recommend this strain :)

VI have like, NO tolerance, no matter what, and I don&#39;t enjoy being very high in the giggly, trippy way sativa dominants can do. I got this strain for pain relief, in a CO2 cartridge (concentrate). Usually I can only handle one puff from a vape pen, but I took three or four puffs of this without feeling any head high. Instead, I felt an enormous body buzz, a significant reduction in pain, and a feeling of relaxation. Turns out, after about 20 puffs, I&#39;m damn high, but it&#39;s a calm, silly feeling, which I don&#39;t mind. But I&#39;ve been sticking to 2-3 puffs on this since then, because that&#39;s enough to reduce my pain and relax me without causing any cerebral effects. I love the soothing body feel. Big fan.

VOK..Im actually high right now..literally.. at the moment I feel completely high and like, its a mixture of being buzzed (alcoholic) and your basic regular high at a moderate pace. I haven&#39;t smoked for about 4-5 years and for being RESEARCH \u2026 i  feel ok.Normally, I would be freaking the fuck out, having panics attacks, accelerated heart beat, and a bunch of regular bad shit.\u000a\u000aIf you can imagine a nice 10mph red roller coater (..haha\u2026=P image (giggles) ) going up and down. thats it..! Im writing this review cause now-a-days its pretty difficult to find a decent one. anyways..onward. \u000a\u000aumm \u2026 would i smoke this again..perhaps not. not because its not a quality strain, or a bad high. I kinda grew out of it ever since a horrifying experience i had that changed my life forever.\u000a\u000aIm trying to get the effects and see how it would effect people regarding physical disabilities or the disabled in any aspect whether big or small.\u000arecreationally ..HELL YEAH! MEDICALLY..YES.\u000a\u000aI would see how this would work in ailments physically and  psychiatric. one can control very well the sense of paranoia or anxiety really well as long as you&#39;re keeping busy. I suffered from O.C.D and this can somewhat help. ( 5 out of 10\u2026maybe 6, 7\u2026maybe 8. yeah\u20268!) so, this is really good for people who suffer in that category. I&#39;m also very giggly and have a sense of happiness. not that gloom and shit.\u000a\u000apain\u2026? uhhhh..i really don&#39;t know cause nothing hurts while I&#39;m sober but I&#39;m sure it would work fine. *shurgs shoulders*  BODY HIGH FERR SHURRR!\u000a\u000aoK this is fun!! =D\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t give this to my mom who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis in her knee cause..im sure she wouldn&#39;t hang. my intentions are for the CBD..but MEDICALLY 2 FUCKIN THUMBS UP REALLY HIGH!! \u000a\u000afor a low thc content (11-12%) and a 14% CBD ratio. its fine\u2026 I&#39;m gonna smoke A.C.D.C next and post that up for you guys..later. \u000a\u000aoh..! P.S. ...and my high is coming down.. like really good. I was horny for like an hour and it was a very nice ride. =)

VThis is by the far the best strain I\u2019ve ever had.  I don\u2019t like marijuana too strong, sometimes I find myself stuck, loss of focus or paranoid but this strain is very soothing due to the low thc and high cbd.  This is rare to find in LA and once I tried it I realized why it was the price it is.  The ratings on this are spot on, I feel uplifted, happy and less anxiety.  I don\u2019t know if I could move back to the east coast again until they legalized this strain, this can be 100% beneficial to all types of people of all ages.  I tend to think ALOT, I am a very very imaginative dreamer and creator, but this strain helps to soothe my mind when thoughts become too overwhelming.

VAm I supposed to be this high? I&#39;ve watched plunty of YouTube videos where people swear they don&#39;t get high off of this stain. I must have grown mine to good. BTW I love the way this grows, buds are frosty and as hard as rocks, also it was easy to LST. I admit, my tolerance is very low, but a thumbnail sized bowl of a CBD strain shouldn&#39;t have got me as baked as I was. I got everything is was not looking for, dizziness, cottonmouth, anxiety and I also couldn&#39;t sleep. When I finally did sleep, I woke up, still baked! For me it was like getting the wrong order at Mc&#39;Donalds. #SuckerPunched The 3 stars are for; it was easy to grow, finished early, and provided pain relief. If your looking for a CBD, I would suggest something else. Anyone else experience this?

VCannatonic isn&#39;t about getting high, it&#39;s about stress relief and medication.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s got a high CBD:THC ratio and that&#39;s apparent from the buzz and how long the effects last. Figure you&#39;ve got 60-90 minutes from a normal dose. But those 60-90 minutes are excellent for relaxation and stress relief.\u000a\u000aI suffer from Sciatica that&#39;s caused by adrenal fatigue. So I&#39;m likely to be in chronic pain for 4-7 days any time I need more Adrenaline to get through my day, which means I need to limit my sugar intake :-( ...\u000a\u000aBut if I can smoke a bit of Cannatonic, I can usually ward off the pain and even if I can&#39;t prevent it, it definitely lessens the painful effects of sciatica.\u000a\u000aOr if I can&#39;t sleep at night, because of pain or general insomnia, Cannatonic helps there too.

VI have tonic clonic&lt;i.e. grand mal&gt; seizures.  I needed a co med and my doctor had run out of meds to help me.  Side effects were harsh.  He was at a loss.  I had to find something.  I found a diet that works partially and went out experimenting with mj strains.  It took some time but I came upon cannatonic in oil form.  I take it at night and not only am I seizure free but I can go to sleep for 8hrs. or more and wake up with a smile.  I love this stuff.  \u000aIn my own experience, I found the amount of CBD is balanced with enough THC to work for nocturnal tonic clonic seizures.  It tastes horrible in oil form but the effect is well worth it.  Also in oil both THC and CBD levels are much higher than with flower.

Cannatonic is an extraordinary strain that gives off a very pleasant body buzz that will not cloud your mind.\u000a\u000aMy job is very stressful at times (White hat hacker) and requires constant thinking which usually leads to a headache at the end of the day. I usually use a bit throughout the day to keep me nice and stress free with the added bonus of not having any headaches. I have also noticed that I come home feeling OK instead of exhausted and grumpy.\u000a\u000aOverall this is a wonderful strain that will not mess with your head too much that I would recommend to anyone.

VMy new favorite strain. It was the perfect balance of a sativa and indica. It took care of my pain, but didn&#39;t knock me out or make me feel jittery. Felt calm, happy and focused.

VAs a sativa smoker, I was always used to the crazy head highs I could get from just taking a hit. When I smoked this strain, the body high hit me first after 2 minutes, and then my head felt as if it was shutting off. Can atomic was a big help to my knee pain after my snowboarding injury. I reccomend this strain for pain.

VThis is by the far the best strain I\u2019ve ever had.  I don\u2019t like marijuana too strong, sometimes I find myself stuck, loss of focus or paranoid but this strain is very soothing due to the low thc and high cbd.  This is rare to find in LA and once I tried it I realized why it was the price it is.  The ratings on this are spot on, I feel uplifted, happy and less anxiety.  I don\u2019t know if I could move back to the east coast again until they legalized this strain, this can be 100% beneficial to all types of people of all ages.  I tend to think ALOT, I am a very very imaginative dreamer and creator, but this strain helps to soothe my mind when thoughts become too overwhelming.

VI have tonic clonic&lt;i.e. grand mal&gt; seizures.  I needed a co med and my doctor had run out of meds to help me.  Side effects were harsh.  He was at a loss.  I had to find something.  I found a diet that works partially and went out experimenting with mj strains.  It took some time but I came upon cannatonic in oil form.  I take it at night and not only am I seizure free but I can go to sleep for 8hrs. or more and wake up with a smile.  I love this stuff.  \u000aIn my own experience, I found the amount of CBD is balanced with enough THC to work for nocturnal tonic clonic seizures.  It tastes horrible in oil form but the effect is well worth it.  Also in oil both THC and CBD levels are much higher than with flower.

VI&#39;m very sensitive to THC, prone to paranoia and anxiety. This is my first true encounter with a medical strain that can be felt or noticed, unlike my experience with Charlotte&#39;s Web from The Stanley Brothers, where effects are not very noticeable. The woodsy citrus flavor in Cannatonic, I find enjoyable. Many others compare it to Pine. With a hit you feel a small wave of relaxation and arousal. After a few more puffs, you may feel your appetite slightly kick-started and a bit more personal comfort. Overall relaxing, gives a better sense of well-being. Any euphoric effects are short-lived but the greater sense of well-being will carry into the next day. Very clear headed and no anxious feelings, may make you slightly horny.

VJust starting out on the CBD&#39;s, this is exactly what I needed after a super stressful morning while I am on a gradual decrease on my anxiety meds (SSRI/Benz). \u000a\u000aGot this in pre-wraps at my local dispensary....very good tasting, very relaxing effects.  Stress melts away.  Stress/ anxiety not 100% gone but very much not a factor.\u000a\u000aUpdate 8/19/16:\u000a\u000aThe effects of SSRI/Benzo withdrawal becoming a bit overwhelming.  Smoked another of of these puppies, a half in the morning and a half at lunch.  Did provide a bit of relief but not as much if consumed in one application.  Going to continue to use pure CBD extract from Herbal Renewals as a baseline of determining the effectiveness and potency while I explore other options, such as different forms of application, concentration, purity and cost while determining what will increase or decrease the intended effects of CBD.  Will probably pickup a few more of these and test further for effectiveness.  Might then try integrating small ratios of THC.\u000a\u000a Just smoked some Holy Grail (rated here in leaflly as well) and got some panicky effects.  Took appx 2.5 servings @ .03g which I think is 5 mgs/ serving.  So this would provide me with approximate intake of (12.5 by  3x daily totaling 37.5mg for today.  Feeling quite better.\u000a\u000a  I will definitely be picking up some more pre-wraps of this to have on hand though.  I will need to find or purchase a new dry good vaporizer (think it was the K-Pen or something like that) as I can not find the one I just lost.  Maybe allow me to maximize more product with a cleaner application.\u000a\u000aUpdate 8/20/16\u000a\u000aDecrease Sertraline: 125mg to 100mg\u000a\u000a&lt;summit/leafly/k/pen/dr

VFirst &quot;medical&quot; strain I&#39;ve tried, so take that into consideration. It didn&#39;t do everything I wanted it to, because it had zero effect on my anxiety one way or the other (when vaped), but it did cut down significantly on my pain from Spastic Cerebral Palsy/Quadriplegia. Its next most noticeable effect was to regulate my sleep, even if I didn&#39;t use it close to going to bed; instead of being awake all night and sleeping during the day, as I was apt to do before, I find it helps me to feel like going to bed at a reasonable time and getting up early. Lastly, I did notice an elevated mood, and more ease in social interactions. \u000a\u000aPoints off because of the taste, and because I had to vape more than recommended to feel the effects. My next step is to experiment with different ways to ingest the ABV, and to mix it with a different strain (Dairy Queen) for an equal ratio of CBD to THC.

VGot a 5g Package of this strain from Tilray. I quite honestly was not really looking forward to it that much, but was extremely pleasantly surprised when it arrived (Less than 24 Hours Later) at my house. This is one of the  BEST strains I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of smoking for medicinal effect. It more or less Evaporates the pain in my hand (Broken Ring Finger Knuckle, Knuckle Pushed Back About 6cm. 5 year old break no surgery) instantaneously. It also gives a nice clear headed approach to the day, and really helps improve your outlook on life. This strain is a must try for those who suffer chronic pain. The Smell is a perfect 50/50 mix of citrus and pine, and the buds are absolutley coated in trichs. Takes on the look of outdoor grown Marijuana, However very little leaf content was left on this particular 5g Bud. Excellent Citrusy-Fruity-Floral-Piney Taste. VERY Expansive smoke. A MUST HAVE!\u000a****SIDE-NOTE****\u000a- This strain also worked incredibly well for my insomnia. Sleep induced within a 45 minute period after consumption Via-Glass-Bong. (2 Mid Sized Bowls, Ripped In Single Toke In Rapid Succession)

VI think this strain is great for those needing a mild anti-anxiety, anti-depression strain who would like to still be a productive, active member of society while doing so. This strain, or at least the batch I have causes little to no psychoactive effects, making this ideal to relieve a multitude of symptoms while still being able to go about your day!

VThis is my first review here and my first time trying Cannatonic for my chronic migraines. Great aroma and flavor. Very smooth (not harsh on the throat). I noticed right off a nice &amp; mild fuzzy feeling in my forehead and behind my eye&#39;s. No high at all. Honestly I just felt like myself which is good. I wasn&#39;t as tensed up and it seemed to help with my nausea. For pain I&#39;d rate it (from 1-10) a 6 on its own. I still needed my mild THC strain sprinkled in to push the pain back to a tolerable level. I&#39;d purchase it again.

It feels like your body is melting with very little mental effects, just a slight mood lift, made me a little giggly too, but this only lasted like 20 minutes then it was just relaxation.

VI tried the Cannatonic last week &amp; havent used it since because I wasnt use to the experiences I had, however I find this strain very useful when experiencing HIGH pain.\u000aThere was little cerebral effects &amp; what I did experience only lasted less than 20 minutes but left a vague feeling of uplifted.\u000aThe pain reduction was high, I experienced what could be described as an iron Shawl effect over both shoulders &amp; neck which is where my most common problem for pain exists. within 10 minutes of vaping this strain I began to feel a slight high which was a good start, then a progressive clamping feeling arresting pain in my neck &amp; shoulders from 2 medical conditions one of which causes severe headaches daily. I didnt have any problems with pain there after &amp; was motivated to go to bed instead of staying up for a while to enjoy the euphoric feelings I typically get from other strains. I am ranking this strain for me personally as the morphine of cannabis lol its a definite pain relief strain I will use again. I just have to get use to the initial effects now.

Vthis stuff is incredible, this is exactly what I was looking for when I became a medical cannabis patient. something with minimal psychoactive effects but knocks out my chronic pain. ten minutes and the pain is completely gone, cramps, nerve pain, headaches, whatever. I can smoke this before work and not worry about being &quot;high&quot;. and when I&#39;m not working I still mix it into bowls or joints with other strains. 10 outta 10.

VI can\u2019t have anything with a lot of THC (doctors orders until my anxiety is under control and managed).  So finding high CBD dried herb is dependant on what is available from the places that my script lets me buy from.\u000aI found this strain to be fast acting, five minutes for it to kick in after vaping a few breaths.\u000aIt tasted very green, almost a touch of peppermint.  \u000a\u000aI have adhd combined type and I can tell this strain would be amazing for focus and keeping clear.  It also helped with relief from the constant tension headache that I run.  It also does help immensely with anxiety.  At least for me.\u000a\u000aIt definitely has a euphoric effect.  But perhaps that\u2019s just a feeling of immense relief of my anxiety, and I\u2019m just feeling way better.\u000a\u000aI\u2019d suggest this strain for daytime, as many people find high Cbd low thc strains stimulating.  I personally find the lack on anxiety and the clarity really relaxing so I sleep better with this.  But anxiety relief lets me sleep.\u000a\u000aMy strain is 1.4% thc total and 24% Cbd total.  \u000a\u000aIf you want to feel high though this isn\u2019t a strain for you.\u000a

VI&#39;m giving this 5 stars even though I started to go into panic mode from the effects. I tend to get anxiety if I get too medicated but I figured only one hit would be fine. Nope, that one hit did me in. I had to wake up my boyfriend to talk me down. Keep in mind I live in a prohibition state (Texas) and am used to the street stuff, albiet good, its no match for the stuff I got on my trip to Washington. It was the initial wave of kicking in that the anxiety took over. I read a lot of the other reviews for this particular strain prior to partaking and it sounded pretty great. I thought I would be safe from the anxiety since it isn&#39;t supposed to be a head high and people say it took them extremely large amounts to even achieve a shadow of that effect. Well something must be backwards in my brain because just from that one moderate hit I took, I was more stoned than I&#39;ve been in years...to the point of panic attack. It totally blindsided me. I wasn&#39;t prepared for it. As with any new stuff I get, there&#39;s always a learning curve on the proper dosage and it always takes me a few sessions of trial and error to hit that sweet spot. I won&#39;t give this strain a negative review based on user error. It did effectively wipe out various aches and pains throughout my body. Once the initial panic wore off (about 30 minutes for me) I was able to be totally and completely relaxed and happy. I even got up and wanted to do stuff like straighten up the house, take a shower, get down, etc. Like I said, maybe I&#39;m wired backwards since this stuff did the opposite of what everyone else says it does for them. Great stuff though. Next time I&#39;ll start off with a half hit and see where that takes me. :)\u000a\u000a(Grown at Buddy Boy Farm in Washington)

VOne of the best hybrids I have ever smoked! An excellent uplifting and anti stress/anti pain relief strain! A true top shelf for those with jobs but still need to be medicated!!! (One of the best strains for people that wanna have a clear head and still be under the effects of a type of budd with high CBD in it) The first 10 mins of hitting this is the only sativa side you will get out of this bad girl because it has no sativa effects after having it hit it for about a 20 to 30 min max wait time for it to be a smooth good uplifting indica high! (not the strongest of indica highs but a true great for those with jobs or tasks needing to get done or just someone who doesn&#39;t wanna be super high or stuck in they&#39;re head like a major sativa would do! For the cbd effects alone with a combined indica like relaxation deserves the highest of ratings! 5 out of 5 all day everyday for this truly helpful and incredible hybrid!

VI will be honest. Five years ago I went in for three open heart surgeries and since then I have been smoking pot but all of the times I&#39;ve smoked they were too high in thc and I could not enjoy the high so I kind of thought I&#39;ll stop smoking since I can&#39;t really be comfortable smoking it. I decided I would try using edibles although I never got that far yet. My friend brought over a strain called cannatonic and he told me that I should try this as  its exactly what I&#39;m looking for. So I held onto the pot he gave me for about a week as I was to scared to smoke it because every other time I was basically bed ridden and not enjoyed it at all. But I smoked this stuff and I was totally able to handle it. There was not much of a buzz at all. I noticed a small increase in heart rate but I also noticed it took the pain away from my ankle almost instantly after smoking. Also usually pot takes away my breathe this stuff here I was actually able to smoke a whole joint and once it was done I was still able to take full good deep breathes and also light breathes without feeling light headed or getting a pain in the back of my head. So to conclude people if your looking for a good smoke that has a great pine smell and taste this is for you. There is not really a high but man this bud has a great auroma and honestly all I can say is wow this is the best pot I&#39;ve smoked since my heart surgery. Thank you so much for making a strain like this that even people like myself can fully enjoy.

VCannatonic will change the world.  It is the most high CBD strain I know of.  Aurora has their own version of Cannatonic and somehow it&#39;s pushing 20% CBD I believe with under 1% THC.\u000a\u000aIt is however I feel a completely different strain than the Tilray version which is 12% THC and 12% CBD.\u000a\u000aActually now that I think about it, the feeling is the very close to each other, just more intense with the Tilray version.  I don&#39;t honestly know if they&#39;re the same or not.  I just have no idea how the same strain can have such different numbers.

However the strain left me with a migraine that started about an hour after I smoked it and it lasted for about a full day.

VSince I&#39;ve gotten back into smoking again it has blown my mind noticing the extreme difference in my perception between Indicas and Sativas. Cannatonic, touted as a high CBD to THC strain turns me into a anxious wreck during the initial portion of the high. I stretched obsessively and started lifting kettlebells and played with some expand-your-hands bands to ground myself and quit freaking out from the high. Seriously, it&#39;s one of those strains that makes me think &quot;this is the way my life is now, I&#39;ll always be high, I don&#39;t know what direction to go, nothing is familiar anymore, is Cobb&#39;s totem still spinning or did it wobble!? It&#39;s got me seriously debating whether or not the whole chewing on peppercorns thing actually works. Because, when you first chew them (and I have chewed a shitload of them!) relief from the anxiety takes what seems like hours even though time only registers as minutes on the clock. Which made me think that in some Shamanic (technically Sorcerey technique because I&#39;m not a Siberian tribal medicine man) you&#39;re actually self administering something that changes your perception of &quot;time&quot; as you usually perceive it to be. \u000a\u000aLong story short; finally chilled out, time seemed to move normally again after about 4 hours. Watched a few episodes of The Pyramid Code on Netflix. Got to thinking more about the nature of time and the Great Cycles of Death and Rebirth. Then drank a shitload of water and listened to the George Frideric Handel station on Pandora. And now; I have miraculously come to the end of writing and this silly treatise! So - when it comes to Cannatonic, maybe if you&#39;re wired like me you&#39;ll get blasted out of your socks! If not, find a strain that does because being high as fuck is pretty rad... and kinda scary!\u000a\u000a\u000a

VReally solid 1:1. CBD and THC are working together on this strain for serious pain relief and relaxation. I smoked up a pre-roll and poured a little bit from the joint into my Pax. Tastes a bit like tobacco, though I&#39;ve never tried any fresh bud, just what I&#39;m getting from the pre-rolls. Strong body effect, something that can take a bit to get used to... since there isn&#39;t a psychotropic high with this pain, you think you&#39;re fine but you legs might go wobbly! Excellent clarity and focus, too.

VI am reviewing the CO2 oil of Cannatonic from Pop Naturals. This is a great go-to for the end of day pain relief. I am using a dab rig and dabbing the oil out of the syringe directly onto the heating element. It is instant body melt that relieves all symptoms of pain and clears your calendar of anxiety for a good 4 hours or through the nights sleep. Highly recommend for those needing heavy calming effects for end of day. I do not recommend this concentrate for start of day (at least not to dab).

VI&#39;m giving this 5 stars even though I started to go into panic mode from the effects. I tend to get anxiety if I get too medicated but I figured only one hit would be fine. Nope, that one hit did me in. I had to wake up my boyfriend to talk me down. Keep in mind I live in a prohibition state (Texas) and am used to the street stuff, albiet good, its no match for the stuff I got on my trip to Washington. It was the initial wave of kicking in that the anxiety took over. I read a lot of the other reviews for this particular strain prior to partaking and it sounded pretty great. I thought I would be safe from the anxiety since it isn&#39;t supposed to be a head high and people say it took them extremely large amounts to even achieve a shadow of that effect. Well something must be backwards in my brain because just from that one moderate hit I took, I was more stoned than I&#39;ve been in years...to the point of panic attack. It totally blindsided me. I wasn&#39;t prepared for it. As with any new stuff I get, there&#39;s always a learning curve on the proper dosage and it always takes me a few sessions of trial and error to hit that sweet spot. I won&#39;t give this strain a negative review based on user error. It did effectively wipe out various aches and pains throughout my body. Once the initial panic wore off (about 30 minutes for me) I was able to be totally and completely relaxed and happy. I even got up and wanted to do stuff like straighten up the house, take a shower, get down, etc. Like I said, maybe I&#39;m wired backwards since this stuff did the opposite of what everyone else says it does for them. Great stuff though. Next time I&#39;ll start off with a half hit and see where that takes me. :)\u000a\u000a(Grown at Buddy Boy Farm in Washington)

VI purchased this strain because of the high CBD. The smell of it was not that great. The taste was better and it calming effects lasted longer than the other strains I have tried. However the strain left me with a migraine that started about an hour after I smoked it and it lasted for about a full day. I found mixing this strain with a strain that has a high THC level prevents the migraine from forming. I find this strain works well all times of day.

VI finally tried the legendary cannatonic. Not an easy strain to find in ca. I see why this is seen as one of the best medical strains ever. It relaxes your body and mind to the point where you feel like your on some kind of real medication. I don&#39;t have issues with pain but if I did this would have taken it away. Very good for pain and stress. Makes me feel really lazy and kinda slow. Body feels like jello but not in a good way for me personally. Makes me feel a little uncomfortable almost. I don&#39;t like the feeling of a complete jello body, but I could see how this is great medicine for ppl with real pain and other medical issues. I rate this a high 3 stars because of the potential medicinal effects, but it&#39;s not my Cup tea. \u000aBtw this strain tested at about 9% cbd and 4.5% thc. Maybe a different ratio of cannatonic would be to more to my liking. I will keep my eyes open.

VUsed to smoke a lot as a teenager,  had a horrible panic attack from it and didn\u2019t smoke again forever.

VI used a vape for this for indoor use. The effects were mild, light high, minimal psychoactives, and generally softens the edges a little. I would describe it as a decaf of weed since the typical &quot;high&quot; is minimal. Good for getting things done without distractions of pain or fatigue. \u000a\u000aOne thing to note, however, is that I noticed a sudden drop in body temperature and heightened adrenaline.

VI am reviewing the CO2 oil of Cannatonic from Pop Naturals. This is a great go-to for the end of day pain relief. I am using a dab rig and dabbing the oil out of the syringe directly onto the heating element. It is instant body melt that relieves all symptoms of pain and clears your calendar of anxiety for a good 4 hours or through the nights sleep. Highly recommend for those needing heavy calming effects for end of day. I do not recommend this concentrate for start of day (at least not to dab).

VI will be honest. Five years ago I went in for three open heart surgeries and since then I have been smoking pot but all of the times I&#39;ve smoked they were too high in thc and I could not enjoy the high so I kind of thought I&#39;ll stop smoking since I can&#39;t really be comfortable smoking it. I decided I would try using edibles although I never got that far yet. My friend brought over a strain called cannatonic and he told me that I should try this as  its exactly what I&#39;m looking for. So I held onto the pot he gave me for about a week as I was to scared to smoke it because every other time I was basically bed ridden and not enjoyed it at all. But I smoked this stuff and I was totally able to handle it. There was not much of a buzz at all. I noticed a small increase in heart rate but I also noticed it took the pain away from my ankle almost instantly after smoking. Also usually pot takes away my breathe this stuff here I was actually able to smoke a whole joint and once it was done I was still able to take full good deep breathes and also light breathes without feeling light headed or getting a pain in the back of my head. So to conclude people if your looking for a good smoke that has a great pine smell and taste this is for you. There is not really a high but man this bud has a great auroma and honestly all I can say is wow this is the best pot I&#39;ve smoked since my heart surgery. Thank you so much for making a strain like this that even people like myself can fully enjoy.

VThis strain was good to medicate with using a good quality convection vaporizer.\u000a This particular form of administering medicine is highly effective without the numerous drawbacks of combustion.\u000a Negative aspects of this strain like harshness can be nearly eliminated by controlling temperature, So you get what you need and leave what you don&#39;t want behind.  This is nice medicine when it is used this way; good for pain and muscle spasms.  This was recommended to me by Los Primos Hermanos out of San Diego, their product was clean and top notch.

VDon&#39;t hold my review again this strain but I wanted to write a review for others like me. This is not the strain for a novice or low tolerance patient. Cannatonic was the third strain I tried and it was not a fun evening for me. \u000a\u000aIm not a fan of the tingling body rushes which with this strain was quite strong. It didn&#39;t provide relief from my nausea and gave me a massive headache coming down. \u000a\u000aI mostly felt a heaviness, tingling body rush, and sleepiness. Though due to the boy rushes and headache I didn&#39;t get to sleep when I intended and ended up being up later than if I hadn&#39;t vaped. I vaped fairly low temp (365F) and did two light hits 15 minutes apart. \u000a\u000aIm not writing off the strain just keeping in the back of my stash till I am  ready for a &quot;big gun&quot; strain.

VReally solid 1:1. CBD and THC are working together on this strain for serious pain relief and relaxation. I smoked up a pre-roll and poured a little bit from the joint into my Pax. Tastes a bit like tobacco, though I&#39;ve never tried any fresh bud, just what I&#39;m getting from the pre-rolls. Strong body effect, something that can take a bit to get used to... since there isn&#39;t a psychotropic high with this pain, you think you&#39;re fine but you legs might go wobbly!

VWith a nearly 1:1 ratio of THC:CBD, this is an outstanding choice for relief of chronic pain, but it works just as well as a nightcap to help you relax and get to sleep. Terpy strain with a gentle citrusy/earthy flavor. Dosing is easy to control for daytime use when you need to TCB. Excellent pain management properties. Definitely one of the finest medicinal strains available. I mix it with Space Cream at night for an impressive full-body and mind experience that will take you as high as you want to go.

VI smoke a little weed very often to get CBD then I toke other stuff to get blazed, so I usually have a hard time determining the more subtle points of a low THC strain. Recently, I was without cannabis for a month due to business travel. I realised two things: a) CBD helps a lot with my muscle/nerve pain in my back. b) Cannatonic is a really good weed for low back pain.\u000a\u000aThe best part is that it doesn&#39;t taste completely awful like many of the other high CBD strains. All the different grows of Cannatonic that I&#39;ve tried have a kinda bland earthy taste with maybe a little tar or tabacco-ish flavor in there. The smell is kind of similar - earthy, skunky, a little citrus(?) - but not a &quot;nice&quot; smelling bud compared to most recreational strains.\u000a\u000aI really appreciate that Cannatonic only gets me a little high, even on my first toke in weeks, the sensation is subtle, comfortable. I feel a little fuzzy but not tired or lethargic. My back pain and spasms are calmed considerably. A great feeling to get me into some Yoga poses and loosen up my aching joints... Happy toking, my dudes!

Both had just the right blend of the best effects of THC and CBD. This is a sweet strain, clearly a favorite.

VThis was another one of those high CBD strains I was eager to try after hearing so much about it. I found it provided good pain relief but did make me feel groggy. Therefore, not good for daytime consumption for me. I find this strain to be a bit overrated IMHO. There are a number of other high CBD strains I have found to be more effective for daytime pain relief without that groggy, sluggish feeling. Overall not a bad strain for pain relief with very little of the &quot;high&quot; feeling.

It had like 6% thc and you could definitely tell. I am usually looking to not &quot; get high &quot; and this strain did not really deliver on that. You will be high using this. So if that is your goal to find like a nice half and halfer then you might like this one. \u000a\u000aI didnt get the normal sleepiness that you get and was a more active high. I wasnt crazy about this though. There are so many good CBD strains out there ... and if you are looking to get stoned then there are even more strains out there. \u000a\u000aIf you are something of a rookie then this is a good strain for you. Otherwise unless its on sale ... pass it up.

VI only smoke moderately potent/high CBD strains now, as they don&#39;t give me panic attacks like the super high THC/nearly zilch CBD strains do.\u000a\u000aThis one is about as good as you can find in Colorado, the other being Rubicon which is only available at one dispensary (and all their locations). The THC percentage is moderate, like 7%, and has 15% or so CBDs. The result to me is a very pleasant stone that is ultra-relaxing. Perfect for playing a marathon session of Civilization or binge watching a show. I never feel panicky after smoking it, and that&#39;s about the biggest plus I can give a strain.\u000a\u000aTo me this is the perfect strain to try if you haven&#39;t smoked anything in ages. This will still get you high, but it&#39;s a throwback to the mellow pleasant high of the strains way back when. It has the added benefit of having very nice anesthetic appeal on top of it. It looks great, smells wonderful (a piney/cirtusy mix), and has a very nice taste to it. Ignore those who say it doesn&#39;t have any effect. My guess is those people smoke strains that have a significantly higher percentage of THC in them on a regular basis. Sure, if you&#39;re tolerance is that big perhaps it won&#39;t have much of an effect. But still, 7% THC isn&#39;t nothing, and most people will feel stoned off of it, especially if they aren&#39;t everyday smokers.

VSmooth and minty - lingering freshness in my sinus and throat. Came on quickly but gently. I note this because I am very sensitive and can easily become overwhelmed when it hits strong. One hefty drag more than did it for me for about 40min.  Felt effervescent, like head on a crisp beer, but stays there - no bass notes. But that\u2019s perfect for me to engage in activity. Boosts and focuses, not spacey. Had blasts of creative ideas. Practically speaking, I used it for pain relief for menstrual cramps and chronic back pain; I felt great. Was recommended for me at Cloud Nine based on my personal needs - they were right on target!

VI am ADHD and strains tend to not act as expected.  Cannatonic is reliably mellow, leaving me relaxed, happy, and functional.  It doesn&#39;t bury pain in a wrapping of cotton, but enhances morale which helps on it&#39;s own level.  Cannatonic - like Harlequin - is a great variety to load up on CBD before using some of the heavier indica - though I have found Pure Kush to mix poorly.  Cannatonic is an outstanding starting point for anyone.  Pay attention to the THC/CBD ratio of what you purchase.  Go for the CBD that is at least 10x higher than THC.

VWow. I have been a medical patient for a little over 5 months now and THIS is what I have been searching for. As someone who doesn&#39;t enjoy high THC strains, I always seem to find 1:1 or higher CBD ratios. Cannatonic (Tower - Aurora) leans really far on the CBD level. Within minutes of using, I felt extremely relaxed, super focused, and only felt a high similar to that of a cold and sinus pill. There is a slight dry mouth that kicks in after about 15 minutes but its nothing that a glass of water can&#39;t fix. So in love with this strain and I&#39;m excited to try it before bed.

VReally bad experience with this strain (not sure if it would be paranoia, depression, or somnolence). This batch tested at 12% CBD and 6% THC so was not expecting much psychoactive effects, however so far almost all high CBD strains give me a couple hours of drowsy crash immediately after taking them. (I take CBD Critical Mass as my universal buzz killer when a Sativa strain gives me insomnia, but this was taken by itself at 7pm to evaluate side effects). \u000aThere were no real effects fir a few hours, then got really drowsy and crashed to bed early, Slept for 11 hours. (I do recall dreams so at least it didn\u2019t cause the usual THC suppression that messes me up). Very lethargic and fuzzed on waking, despite morning workout. This progressed to pervasivevnegative thoughts leading to strong near depression lasting till the 24 hour mark after taking it, despite taking a few puffs of Jack Herer to try to break out of it. (I am an upbeat positive person and only get this way as a result of rare medication side effects). \u000aThe nightmare finally broke at the 24 hour mark but I won\u2019t try this one again.

VI have lung damage I can&#39;t smoke. This strain works so good just decarboxylated ground up mixed with coconut oil to seallow... no extraction processes, no toxins added nothing like that needed.. it works so good on my neurological disorders without having to worry about using alcohol, butane, glycerin or any shit like that which would actually make the damage in my brain worse and illegal here in Michigan. It works so well without being in any concentrate form. No Lyrica or Neurontin (both of which have almost killed me and I had to report to the pharmaceutical companies).  I had such bad reactions to those Pharmaceuticals that are full of toxins. It helps my life-threatening neurological disorders in Herb form. It&#39;s organic and a hell of a lot safer than the pharmaceutical shit I&#39;ve been rx in the past. I find that Cannatonic works better than Charlotte&#39;s Web. if you have neurological disorders you have to ingest it to get therapy smoking it does not work for neurological disorders, it might help a little bit on pain but not to actually treat and cure diseases in the brain. Quite honestly I don&#39;t see where the concentrated oils are such a necessity.  I have great relief with the weed itself.. but then again I&#39;m not an epileptic who&#39;s having 200 seizures a day either..if it came right down to it and I had to have the concentrated oils I would try to get someone to do the CO2 method which is less toxic and I&#39;d move to Colorado if I had to.

VI think this strain after smoking it makes you feel kinda nice. For example: Like when you just wake up from a good nap &amp; you feel all calm &amp; relaxed (I got 4 1/4 grams for free because it wasn&#39;t dried out right because they couldn&#39;t legally let me &#39;donate&#39; )

VI picked up some Cannatonic from my close dispensary. I only grabbed a gram as I wasn&#39;t sure how it was going to go down with such a low %THC content, despite the fact that the CBD is so high... I am forever glad that I picked up, more for it&#39;s CBD anyhow... \u000a\u000a The scent is insanely aromatic and the flavor very closely resembles it&#39;s more obvious flavor characteristics. It&#39;s super stinky with a heavy nose of Orange blossom, Grapefruit and has a heavy nose of wet pine. \u000a\u000a It&#39;s  fantastic and major mellow if you smoke this on it&#39;s own. However, while I am not of any authority to tell anyone what they should do, beyond my personal experience. I will say though, that this strain 50%50% in my grinder with an indica or an indica hybrid, puts you into deep relaxation and an intensely calmed mind. \u000a\u000a If this shows up at you local shop and you are looking for something fresh, then give it a shot!

VAfter my Dr. told me that the next medication to try for my continuous back spasms was Valium, I said Absolutely Not. My goal is to get off my current pharmaceutical muscle relaxers. So, since Oregon now allows recreational marijuana sales, I decided on Cannatonic for the CBD effects.( 7% THC, 16% CBD) is the strain offered by our local shop. Light buzzy head but fully functional. No spasms now for the past three days, a new record and no need for muscle relaxer meds. I gave it four stars as at first, it was not alleviating the spasms and I still need to rely on the rx, but it&#39;s been improving with daily usage so I&#39;m treating it like medication and taking a hit two to three times a days even if I&#39;m not having symptoms. Fingers crossed this works, so far, so good.

VMy first true high-cbd strain. The flower I have clocks in at just about 1:1 thc/cbd, with a slight edge to thc. The cbd effects are outstanding, I feel as though I&#39;m floating as I lay down to go to sleep. The thc is still very present, but in a much more calming way. The cbd just soothes my Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Would highly recommend.

VI&#39;m new to medical cannabis, but have to say this strain is now my lifeline! I have a severe type of arthritis that can hit overnight with excessive inflammation of my joints which along with causing mobility issues also puts me in shooting or aching pain. I started using this last month, and a little over a month later I can bend my fists almost closed, my thumbs couldn&#39;t bend along with my index finger on my left hand and middle finger on my right but now they&#39;re near normal. I mix this with sativa strains and get all my housework done! WOW! I mix this with indica and sleep through the night another WOW as pain kept me up a lot. I take meds that cause upset stomach but after taking this the morning sickness feeling is gone. This strain moved the clock back for me and coming from pretty sever pain to now near normal is a miracle. I must caution though being an ex smoker then suddenly vapeing was pretty harsh, but now Im getting used to it. I bought some in oil form but find its not as fast acting so vapeing is still the way to go.

VI suffer from chronic hip joint pain due to bursitis. The pain is often severe enough that I will wake up at night if I roll onto that side during sleep.  Cannatonic was recommended by one of the budistas at my local dispensary for its high CBD content.  IT DELIVERED!  This strain knocks me out and I sleep through the night.  I can&#39;t smoke it during the day, however.  For less severe pain and when I still want to function, I use Harlequin.

VThis bud typically goes head to head with Harlequin. \u000a.\u000a.\u000a.\u000aNot entirely sure why. \u000a\u000aHarlequin is a sativa dom. bud, this is a indica leaning hybrid.\u000aUpon first toke, I was greeted with a pleasant flavor, nice and earthy, a little sweet as well, with a fantastic scent!\u000aThe flavor doesn&#39;t stick on you like it does with Harlequin, which is a shame, because I love tasting my cannabis after the fact.\u000a\u000aThe high is entirely different than Harlequin. \u000aI got a little more anxious, it did not help with my anxiety, but it did uplift my spirit a little, I felt happier, but it wasn&#39;t a &quot;high&quot; happy, it was a natural &quot;I&#39;m just a happier person&quot;. \u000aMaybe the anxiety was due to the fact that I got poor sleep and was a little tired. Who knows.\u000aAnywho, moving on. \u000aThe high is weird. It&#39;s neither a sativa or a indica high. It&#39;s quite literally, right down the middle. Your body gets tingly, but you&#39;re not tired, and you get a decent cerebral buzz but it&#39;s not too hard. You get happy, but not the giggles.\u000aIt&#39;s quite literally down the middle. A GREAT hybrid.\u000a\u000aThe come down is just fine, no heavy effects on the come down, you go back to &quot;normal&quot;, not tired, or dizzy or drowsy. Then again I just smoked half a bowls worth for this review.\u000a\u000aOver all, Cannatonic is a decent bud. But it does not feel &quot;complete&quot; like Harlequin does. Harlequin is honestly, and in my opinion, one of the best buds out there. You can get sleepy from it, or energetic, or happy as a clown or super focused. Dependent completely on your mood.\u000aCannatonic just does whatever it does to you, but it does it well. \u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t look at this bud if you&#39;re looking for a crazy high. Instead you&#39;ll get a well balanced body/head buzz that is pleasant and not over powering. \u000aI wouldn&#39;t use it if you&#39;re lethargic, because it does nothing for your energy levels. \u000aNow you might be reading this and saying &quot;OMG IT MAKES YOU ANXIOUS&quot;, keep in mind I went through a boring and depressing day, so yes, I was a little depressed and emotionally &quot;blah&quot;, which is NEVER a good context to part take in. The anxiety was not over powering at all...It was there, it makes your body surge with a bit of energy, but as soon as you get up and move around, it wears off quickly. \u000a\u000a&quot;So you&#39;re saying it doesn&#39;t help energy levels, but I should get up and move around because it makes you anxious&quot;....Yes, anxiousness makes you want to move. But it&#39;s not because of the buds characteristics. \u000a\u000aDon&#39;t worry, just don&#39;t smoke this indoors and you&#39;ll be fine. This is a &quot;busy day&quot; kind of bud, or a &quot;out in nature&quot; or park kind of bud. \u000aIf bud of any kind makes you anxious, don&#39;t smoke it indoors, typically does the trick. ;)\u000a\u000aIf I HAD to pick between Harlequin, I would take Harlequin in a heart beat and you should too. Maybe grab a gram of this. \u000aBut this is a solid replacement for Harlequin if you have none of it around.\u000a\u000a71$ after tax for quarter ounce at Caliva in SJ.

VThe strain I used was called &#39;cannatonic cbd&#39; and I used in shatter form. Felt a mild head buzz that went away quickly. Felt focused, energetic and in the moment but it made me jittery .... similar to what green crack and djanjo does to me. Used it before hockey and had a very good game (I play defence so like to be focused and alert) but had to use an indica to relax me at the bar afterwards.

Fantastic for migraines, headaches, pain, or needing to relax a bit. The flavor reminds me of a very mellow or lightly flavored Cheese or Tangie or something similar. Super dense, sticky, crystally, and decent sized buds! Not sure how to describe smell, but I wish I knew how to show some pictures. Purchased from Eugene OG.

VThis review is based off of a clone that I grew and harvested myself.\u000a\u000aI really like Cannatonic. It&#39;s smooth and has a nice taste. Being a high CBD strain, there&#39;s no real &quot;high&quot; for me, but pain relief is nice. There&#39;s something about the high CBD strains that I like, but also make me feel a little off. I can&#39;t quite explain it.\u000a\u000aSo, I like to mix it with a good indica dominant hybrid. Personally, I mix Cannatonic with Blue Magoo... about 1 to 3 ratio. That really relieves pain, relaxes me and helps me feel great without a real &quot;stoned&quot; feeling.\u000a\u000aOverall, I really like Cannatonic, but I do prefer it as a &quot;mixer&quot;.

VCitrus yet earthy notes upon first scent. Rolled a J and used a glass filter tip; smooth sailing off the draw, nice on the throat not harsh.\u000aTen mins in, feeling relaxed and at ease. Thirty mins in, at complete relaxation, not a lot of head trip going on, focused more or less. \u000aDecent strain, not for recreation, good alternative to Advil/simple pain relief. Would not suggest if looking for creative or couch lock types of meds.

VThis is the second best high-CBD strain I have tried, just behind Ringo&#39;s Gift. As someone with several sports-related injuries, this is the perfect pain killer. Keeps you clear headed.

VThis was an interesting one for me. I had atypical results. I wasn&#39;t having any pain at the time and was using it solely for anxiety. I think I&#39;m one of the rare few who really need THC for anxiety relief. High-CBD strains and CBD oil seem to actually increase my anxiety and make me a little dizzy. You can in fact achieve a high on this strain if you smoke enough of it, but even then it&#39;s pretty gentle. I&#39;ve had family members achieve great relief and reduce their use of pain meds thanks to CBD supplementation and may eventually grow this strain for them though it&#39;s seemingly not what my body and brain desire. We all have to find what works for us, and the limited availability of high-CBD strains is frustrating for me because I have loved ones who need it. I wish more dispensaries and delivery services would make sure to keep this one in stock. Again, not my particular cup of tea, but SO important for so many people.

VI suffer from debilitating pain and this strain has significantly reduced my need for prescription pain relievers. The CBD has a higher bioavailability when vaporized rather than smoked or eaten. I have tried Cannatonic in many ways, and I highly recommend vaping the flowers for pain relief. I keep a clear head with this strain and have no anxiety or drowsiness. This is definitely a great medical strain! I strongly suspect that those giving bad reviews had subpar buds from plants that weren&#39;t properly flushed, dried, cured, etc. Poorly grown &amp; cured herb will disappoint- no matter what strain.

VI really like this strain. The stuff I have is 11% THC and 12% CBD. It&#39;s still enough THC to get me mildly high and the CBD is great for my chronic pain, insomnia and anxiety. As far as the high, it reminds me of some of the weed we used to have back in the &#39;70s that wasn&#39;t nearly as strong as most of the stuff we have today. It&#39;s great for times you need some relief but don&#39;t want to get totally ripped.

VThis was purchased from Aurora, tested at 20+% CBD and below 2% THC.  Haven&#39;t seen numbers this that since.  Citrusy, delicious taste.  Fragrant, delightful vaporized.  You still get high and know you are, but not impaired at all.  Overall feeling of ease, like a background high....your body is high but the part of your mind that talks and thinks is not.  You can easily carry on a conversation with someone; be relaxed enough to handle crowded mall on the Saturday afternoon. Great for anything you need a little more patience for.  I felt like I was experiencing crowd anxiety from a distance, didn&#39;t have to react it out.  I can see how this would be good for adults or children looking for a more medicinal effect or specifically targeting anxiety.

VI decided to try this strain because I heard there was very little THC and mostly cannabanoids as an active ingredient.  I heard there was little &#39;high&#39; associated with it and more of a body relaxing effect.  The first part coming up and plateauing was rather uncomfortable.  I felt anxious and muscle tension along with twitching.  This was also accompanied by sweaty palms and a slight, but annoying anxiety.  It took a while to shake the feeling and eventually I got more giggly, however, the overall experience was heavy and groggy feeling and I didn&#39;t care so much for the Cannatonic.

VRather popular CBD strain and not one of my favorites. Small, sparse pop-corny nugs, lemony scent, decently frosted. If you&#39;re not into the THC psychoactive high then skip this CBD strain, regardless of its decent CBD/THC ratio, it still packs a rather heady high that might turn off most people looking for their medical CBD fix.

VOk.  I recently reviewed this strain and gave it three stars.  I just wasn&#39;t impressed by it.  It must have been my mood or other strains I had smoked not too much earlier.  Because today and I came home completely sober, with my nausea and my joints screaming and I took one bong rip, and upon exhalation, the nausea disappeared and the aches got significantly better.  My anxiety definitely was lowered by Cannatonic but not to as large of a degree as I would like from a high CBD strain, still it is nice to have some relief.  I still do hate the fact that it comes with sort of a head fog.  But there is a great body euphoria.  The effects don&#39;t last long either, which I kind of like.  It&#39;s a great quick fix.

And don&#39;t let those sticky, glistening, dense buds fool ya, because I invoke, a toke of this will make you drool. Low THC, high CBD, smells of sugary sweet tangerine and freshly-squeezed limonene. It&#39;s a smooth smoke, on the way in and out, there is no clout, I have pure clarity, honestly and apparently, this absolutely one of my favorite strains!\u000a\u000aBy the way, if you cure it correctly, then you should be able to accomplish some hints of purple!!

VGreat Stuff. Since this strain has more CBD and less THC, I feel as though it is a more enjoyable experience. For one, I don&#39;t have to worry about being too high for talking with my family. Cannatonic also gives me less anxiety and relaxes my muscles. Another thing I noticed was that my memory during and after cannabis use has drastically increased.

VThis strain is great for pain relief, and little else. If maintaining sobriety while medication for pain is what you&#39;re looking for, this does the trick. For me, appetite is suppressed, which is a huge bonus. Doesn&#39;t interfere with my mental state any more than over the counter pain relievers do.

VA very mild high with a lot of effect on pain for me personally. I don&#39;t usually smoke because of a sensitive respiratory system but this has a mild enough taste to easily smoke if need be. All in all, very helpful and probably my favorite so far to be out of pain and still be functional enough.

VI give it 2 stars for the fact that I usually get anxious and fidgety with anything other than indica but with this one I didn&#39;t. I was looking for a daytime strain to help with pain and low energy. This wasn&#39;t the best at taking my pain away but it did take the edge off. It was just waaaay to short lived and coming down made me feel cranky and tired, Almost downright b*tchy... I do like that I didn&#39;t really get &quot;high&quot; and no effects in my head and it didn&#39;t give me the munchies. Mixing it with an indica nighttime strain helped a little. All in all, as a medical partaker, it&#39;s decent for muscle relaxation but not so much for actual pain... I didn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; high but I also noticed that coming down sucked, physically and mood wise. Wouldn&#39;t try it again

VI&#39;ve learned that my body reacts best to this strain when used for medicine making (i.e., tinctured, in salves, infused in coconut oil, etc...) &amp; not when smoked or vaporized.  I just don&#39;t get &quot;high&quot; or feel the THC too much when smoked.  About 15 minutes into it, I do notice pain relief, and I mean it is definitely very noticeable.  Even though I don&#39;t really feel the THC in this strain, the batch I got, definitely had a very distinct Indica feel to it.  I feel it in my body more than in my mind.  I take the tincture at night to help with insomnia caused by chronic pain.\u000a\u000aI recommend you use this strain for tinctures, salves, making edibles, and things of this nature.  You&#39;ll get the medicinal aspects without the psychoactive effects.  I personally really like this for my own tinctures, salves, and edibles.  I&#39;ve come to use this strain almost exclusively for these types of medicines.

VThe time I bought this I had left my MED card at home and shopped recreational. I purchased Cannatonic from Livgreen cannabis, who is also my caregiver. The flower smelled fantastic, really unique scent. I was not impressed with the structure which was loose and borderline leafy.\u000a\u000aCompared to strains such as Banana Kush or Granddaddy purple, cannatonic was a major let down. Exhibiting almost no euphoria and I was unable to notice any of the benefits which should have been present with the high CBD content. I was hoping to use it to aid with sleep and neck pain  but to my disappointment it helped neither.\u000a\u000aLivegreen (patients choice) has excellent flower and my disappointing experience may have been attributed to it being recreational cannabis, I don&#39;t plan on giving it another go to find out.

If you have the money (and) get a true cut of this (profile with lots of triptykons and lemonoids); do not waste it on its&#39; own;  throw those &#39;binoids and terps&#39; in another thc packed strain.  Now you&#39;re smoking something with more than .07% of THC in it.
