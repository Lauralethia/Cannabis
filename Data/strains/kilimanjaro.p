VThe flowers I received from Bloom in Phoenix, Az on 5 18 2015 is pretty much what I call &quot; show bud &quot;.  It looks the part, smells the part, but unlike a duck, this bud just did not quack, so to speak.  The flower and scent was spot on, and the trichome build up on the flower was also impressive, BUT its burns up really, really fast because the batch I got was borderline stale, and the buzz did not only not have legs, it did not take you that far up the medication trail.  IMO  good bud for pictures, but not to smoke for pain, Look elsewhere guys.

VThis is by far one of the best strains for energy, cronic pain, situational depression(due to illness).  It gives me the relief beyond what I usually expect.   It maked me able to get off the couch do dishes and laundry,  just everyday living. The taste is very comfortable, I am also able to smoke it with any device that doesn&#39;t make me cough horribly and regarding munches and appetite,  it does not give the feeling that you have to eat everything in the refrigerator also my cravings for sweets like chocolate cake or cookies is nowhere near the level I am familiar with.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.

VI vaped this strain. It was actually recommended by the bud tender at YiLo. I originally had my heart set on Acapulco Gold since I\u2019d read such great reviews and I was looking for something that would get me energized and positive without brain fog or being couch locked.  \u000a\u000aThis strain left me clear headed which I loved, but I didn\u2019t experience much of an energy boost that I read about. I actually wanted to just sit and do nothing, which wasn\u2019t bad. I did notice I was more focused on my thoughts and individual items. My focus wasn\u2019t sharp enough to grab a pen and start writing down things which were memorable This strain will definitely be a go to when I want to just chill by definition.

I&#39;m a Caucasic boldy man. I really love to run Marathons . I can only dream to run like the beautifull black people. But when I consume this extract of heaven ,I can feel the black power in my vains. My favorite kind of plants are Indicas, but when I need the power of &quot;Madiba&quot;, I can run with him like a dream...a power dream. This is my favorite Sativa.

I&#39;m a Caucasic boldy man. I really love to run Marathons . I can only dream to run like the beautifull black people. But when I consume this extract of heaven ,I can feel the black power in my vains. My favorite kind of plants are Indicas, but when I need the power of &quot;Madiba&quot;, I can run with him like a dream...a power dream. This is my favorite Sativa. I&#39;m never going to run like the black phantoms, but fly in kilimanyaro&#39;s blood.

VThis is one of the best landrace sativas and my personal favorite. Wonderful head high that keeps you lifted and motivated. Great strain for daytime, working or just need to get things done. Earthy aroma and extremely resistant to mold and mildew. Easy to grow with great yields, especially outdoors. If indoors you will need to watch the height as this landrace grows tall.

VI got this in Lowell as they dont have vape oil cartridges often but finally found kilamanjaro in 0.5ml vape oil. It is awesome!! Tastes so good. I instantly feel relaxed but am still able to function and stay productive throughout the day. This Sativa does not make you tired but more of a calming effect. Seemed to help my anxiety and depression. A definite must try. A very close #2 to my fave strain of all time...White Fire OG

My mood is uplifted and my alertness is up as well too!  I feel like a good walk or hike. I like it and recommend it for a great pick me up that has a mild buzz that doesn&#39;t hinder cognitive or physical function.

Allows me to get high enough to forget the reasons i don&#39;t want to work out or stretch but not too high i can&#39;t push myself physically. I use this before I do my powerlifting routine, hiking or rid&#237;ng my bike. My fav sativa for exercise. A++

I take 5 MG of Hashishans Lo drops in morning so don&#39;t feel psychoactive effects from this strain. Heart beating very nice and enough cerebral that I&#39;m sitting real good.

VThis strain does exactly what a sativa should do: provides a great energy boost, increases creativity and clears your head. All without a heavy body high. For me it works great in social settings. My only complaint is that the high doesn&#39;t last very long. It seems to come and go in under 2 hours. However, I find this to be common with most pure sativas. I definitely recommend this strain but be prepared to smoke a little more for a longer high.
