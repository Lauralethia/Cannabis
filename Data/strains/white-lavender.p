VI&#39;m new to using cannabis for my medicine. Threw away 6 R/Xs a month and only vape for medicine.  The first time I tried flower was with White Lavender and although I&#39;m new to using cannabis I use a lot of vape cartridges.  Love my Girl Scout Cookies!  And for night GDP.  But never flower, only vape, lol\u000aI thought smoking flower would get me really stoned.  I kept going back to the water pipe and tried more, all day long in fact. I got giggly though and I DID feel very happy!!  Other than that I recommend this for pain relief and depression if you don&#39;t want a heady high. I felt good, pain was gone, I have CROHNS and it was mellow.  I was able to function well all day!  \u000aBiggest reason I may not buy again is I did not enjoy the taste. Too much lavender. \u263a\ufe0f

VTasty. Lime green with orange hairs. More of a sativa effect, however, after about 20 minutes or so, the indica effect lingered around and made itself known. The batch I&#39;m reviewing was considered bottom shelf, and fairly priced considering that the buds were nicer looking than their top shelf selections.

VAm amazing calming social strain that removes that tightness that is the fear of socializing and, for me, catastrophizing thoughts that lead to anxiety. You&#39;ll have a great time, and while it&#39;s not the best for pain, it&#39;s strong enough to make it an effective pain killer for a solid 10-15 minutes depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke at once. It helped me socialize and I had considerably less inhibitions. I would definitely recommend this to anyone trying weed the first time too; don&#39;t overdo it though, because it can be strong.

After smoking this strain I felt great, the sharp pain I would get from certain motions when bending my knee were completely gone. In addition to being able to go through the day with little to no knee pain I was also happy and giggly. Without a doubt one of my favorite strains!

VSmoked this strain for the first time last night and it\u2019s definitely my new favorite! Definitely sativa dominant but not to the point of paranoia which is something I\u2019ve struggled with when smoking sativas. Nice light body high that had all my muscles relaxed and left me feeling like I was floating on a cloud. I\u2019ve read other reviews saying this is good for daytime but I think I\u2019ll stick to smoking it at night. Makes my relaxing time of reading and listening to music before bed so much better
