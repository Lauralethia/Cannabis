VThere are no negatives about this extraordinary strand I can think of experiencing.  It tastes great with a pinnapple twinge and the diesel powerful intake.  Sour D and P.K. together is a piece of heaven.  I rate this a solid 9 as there are others as good, ie: Trainwreck, C-3 and Hindu Kush to name a few that quickly come to mind, but none any better that I&#39;ve had the priviledge to smoke yet!!  The only hybrid that may taste slightly better, Headband is not as powerful.  R.F.

VVERY sticky bud, takes some effort to grind up when its stored properly. Bud smells amazing. Has a citrusy, fruity, smell with the hint of a smooth marijuana aroma. I used my Vaporblunt to smoke this strain at about 2:00pm after I got off work. I felt energized and ready for the day. I immediately though of everything I needed to do as far as shopping and fixing things around the house. Long story short it was a very productive high. ALTHOUGH, keep in mind that I don&#39;t recommend driving or operating heavy machinery because it definitely makes you dizzy. You don&#39;t realize this at first but it will kick in. Overall one of my favorites so far. I was looking for a strain that would give me a euphoric energy boost and this definitely did the job.
