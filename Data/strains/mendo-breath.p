VI had no idea that Cannabis could be as strong as opiate pain medications until I tried Mendo Breath. Eyes and a nose are all you need to determine the potency of these flowers. The smell is ridiculously sweet and vanilla-like, much like Thin Mint GSC. I can&#39;t begin to describe how tasty these buds are. They&#39;re overpoweringly fruity and sweet, almost like buttercream, and the nice smooth smoke leaves a pleasant hint of vanilla with every breath out. The high you achieve from this strain is so strong its stupid. The initial effects are misleading!!! You may not realize how high you&#39;re getting while smoking this stuff because it is a CREEPER! I smoked two bowls for the first time trying this and regretted my decision. About 10 minutes into the high, the heavy body high kicks in and eliminates any sense of pain you may have. It also makes you go full retard. And the duration really takes the cake: 4 HOURS. I was high for HOURS. I definitely recommend that you take it slow and proceed with caution if you try to smoke more than one bowl because this shit put me on my ASS and i can smoke grams upon grams in a sitting and not even get that high. I highly recommend to people with a high tolerance who need powerful and consistent pain relief. But be warned, this should DEFINITELY be smoked AT NIGHT and not during the day unless you plan on getting absolutely nothing done at all.

VHoly Hell. This is MEDICINE! I have never felt this way after smoking before. My head literally just fell over because my neck gave out while hunched over to type this comment. Never smoke this strain and operate machinery. \u000a\u000aMedical users: physical pain, chronic pain, anxiety. This strain is magic.

VIt seems from other reviewers this is a night time strain, but it seems to have some hybrid genetics to it which is why i got this for &quot;daytime&quot; use. It is a very dense flower i got a 2.9G rock, fully cured, hats off to the grower for selling properly cured flower!!!\u000a\u000aNow this has major SOUR notes to it after being ground up. As well; it looks similar in structure to sour strains I have encountered in the past. Tastes like a sour kinda strain, has that euphoric rush minus the burn like haze?\u000a\u000aMy personal experience with sour strains after exhale is WOOSH to the head minus the burn like haze ( I always stress that) this has the same effect. Very heady strain but not sleepy at all, a tad spacey yes but you can refocus!\u000a\u000aMy opinion? A lost sour strain, five stars!!!

VSo I was with a few friends last night, all of us prepared to try this indica-rich strain. FIFA on the screen, controllers in our hands, ready to go. \u201cY\u2019all ready to spark this up?\u201d says my buddy, half gram in the red, lit bowl. One hit, then passed around the room. It literally only took two bowls between four experienced smokers to get entirely ripped and forget about the entire PlayStation FIFA game for a solid hour. Completely relaxed, comfortable in the living room watching a paused game. But happy. And nice. An hour passes by, and we all talk about the nice high we each finished up. I highly recommend this strain before bed, or if you just want an hour long of coach lock. Great stuff, we followed up with Green Crack\u2019s strong sativa to wake up and walk back home. Great strain, will try again soon.

Very smooth smoke with a nice hint of spice on the exhale.\u000a\u000aThe high is instant and heavy. No tripping balls or anything, just a weighted body high and overall chill feel.

VFantastic stoning. My coworker suggested this strain as his go to when I told him I wanted to be &quot;high-school high&quot; not high, not blazed, I wanted to trip my face off. \u000a\u000aThinking he would reach for a 30%+ THC sativa, he instead points to a mid-twenty pure Indica. Mendo Breath. \u000a\u000aA beautiful flower with dark purple, almost black leaves which contrast nicely with a thick white frosting of trichomes. The smell is thick, spicy, weeeedy. It tastes like you shouldn&#39;t be smoking it in the best way. The stone is great. Opiate level sedation and relaxation. Great smoke.

VI took three hits of my Tree Base oil pen and was instantly transformed into a blissful state of presence. It\u2019s not a strain that will \u201cdestroy\u201d you, per say, but it puts you in a relaxed, peaceful state of mind. Perfect strain for anxiety(especially when used in conjunction with l-theanine), and insomnia. Moderate dose will not knock you out but once you start increasing your intake you will have no problem catching some Zs. Overall, great strain for novice users or those just looking for a chill little getaway before bed and want to spend some time reflecting.

VWaves of highness creep through my mind as my body is completely cemented in place. Then the euphoria lifts and the thoughts fall out of my head as I am gently laid down by sweet sweet sweet Mary Jane. I would put most potent smell as welchs grape juice. Thick pungent smooth smoke, fruity as a starburst and tastes exactly how it smells. Potency is not fully incorporated into high THC content alone it is also the synergy between more rare cannabinoids present especially more so in those rare strains like Molakai Frost or Grape OG. This one has some special goodness that I would put up on a similar shelf as Master Kush, Purple Haze and Pink OG. Pain, muscle spasms, depression, anxiety, insomnia, full body and mind relaxation and definetly sedative the strongest I have had so far :o)--(

Sniffing the nugs from the jar at the dispensary there was a sativa feeling.  That feeling never went away for the terpenes on this strain run a chill up my spine like many good sativas do.  Way smoother smoke with mellow almond milk taste that is nothing like the smell that cools back of throat on exhale.  I like cannabis like that with a built in coolant which this flower didn&#39;t need as it was with a light smoke that immediately takes effect numbing the body in one quick wave.  The Mendo Breath fairy has waved its wand of mellow moods &amp; casts a spell of restful la-la-la-zzzz......but not before a major munchie attack that could occur while asleep....unaware......waking up surrounded by empty  food paraphernalia, plates, a full bladder with your arms wrapped around the jar of Mendo Breath.....Dreamy =)

VI was taking this to lessen pain and try to sleep. It works well. I feel relaxed and my pain is less. I think that mendo also has high cbd so this could by why my pain has decreased. Good, strong, heavy hitting, strain.

VDefinitely my new number 1!!! Kudos to whoever marked these genetics!!! I have a pretty high tolerance but this put me down and relaxed every muscle in my body. I am currently detoxing from an awful, very strong benzodiazepine which has been an absolutely brutal month to say the least. This is the ONLY thing that has eased my convulsing muscles and the deep tissue pain across my entire body as well. It also relaxes my brain, which is not easy for me. I haven\u2019t had a single panic attack since I found Mendo Breath (the reason I was on the benzo). Couldn\u2019t recommend any higher (I don\u2019t think I can get much higher) !!!!! &#127788;&#128131;&#127996;

VI grew this strain outdoors in The 916 cali. It came out most beautiful flower time was about 8n1/2 weeks. flower came out really dense , frosty. The final product was great super skunky smell. When you open a jar its loud lol. Looks like its indoor even though grown outdoors. Yield was nice about 9 oz on a 15 gal smart pot that was put out late.

I haven&#39;t slept in months and this strain allowed me to sleep after surgery. This certain strain is clocking in at over 30% thc and has some cbd/cbg as well.  Very narcotic like, heavy indica.  Best strain I&#39;ve ever had for pain and stress.  I&#39;m going to try to grab more before my dispensary runs out.

VThis hits pretty hard with a punch but then evens out with a steady relaxing drift into a pleasant contemplative high. Smells rich and flavorful like a candy chew and almost a hint of earth. A slightly creamy undertone.\u000aThis is just pleasant comfortable kick back and zone in or out on pretty much anything that appeals to you type of bud. Makes me think back to a time when things were a little less busy. Or maybe that&#39;s the weed talking.

V\u000aMajor body relaxation and stress relief. Very smooth taste. Very relaxing. Even when feeling super shorty and anxious really helped relax my mind and body. Gets me ready to sleep. Easy medicine. One puff and the body gets the creeper chill out effect. Makes my eyes close and want to stay closed. I\u2019m talking about even if you try to open your eyes things get a little bit blurry. It has me breathing slowly, calm and at ease. I\u2019m nodding off after 3 puffs. This strain not Only get you ready for bed but it tUCKs you right &#128716; &#128164; I mean I\u2019m an indica guy I use indica all day and am very functional but nope this is doing what I wanted insomnia/anxiety relief &#128513; it absolutely does have a euphoric and happy feeling to it as well but the sleepiness is definitely the strongest effect.

VMendo Breath is so good that, after the very first dose, I was compelled to provide a review; something I&#39;ve never done before!\u000a\u000aI had finished what I had on hand of Super Silver Haze (SSH).  SSH was very disappointing.  That it was a from a brand that I had never had before and from a new dispensary, I was pretty suspect.  That said, this batch of Mendo Breath is from the same brand, Korova, and it is much more amazing than SSH was disappointing. \u000a\u000aMendo Breath provides an immediate head high.  Whereas with SSH, I was perpetually waiting for it to kick in (and it did always eventually creep), Mendo Breath was a direct shot.  It didn&#39;t take long before I was pleasantly throttled into my chain, and in a whole other mood.  My tolerance is pretty solid, so for this to so rapidly and thoroughly set in is a testament to its potency and quality. \u000a\u000aEverything about Mendo Breath is great.  Pleasant taste, pungent piney aroma, awesome experience.  After being initially weighted in my seat, I feel energetic, wanting to stretch and just generally euphoric.  \u000a\u000aBest I&#39;ve had in a long time!

VTechnically, I\u2019d guess the bud I smoked was about 70-30 indica to sativa, but it felt like 80% sativa, 100% indica. I\u2019ve never had anything like it. The head high is very uplifting and happy, grounded by a strong indica stone that comes on about 15 minutes after smoking. I was waking my dog late under a full\u000aMoon, and the trees looked like they were glowing. I felt alert and stony at the same time. And when it came time to sleep, I was out minutes after my head hit the pillow.\u000a\u000aThe flavor is really nice as well: earthy and sweet. A very pleasant smoke, even though it did catch in the back of my throat a bit, but not enough to make me cough.\u000a\u000aI\u2019ll be picking this up again. A top three nighttime smoke for me.

VPretty decent strain.  Flavor was very nice.  I\u2019m a very light user so the flavor is always subtle for me.  This was the first strain I had that was actually kinda sweet.  I have terrible anxiety so I tend to lean toward stains that don\u2019t make my heart race.  This was a nice light high that lasts a while.  Super munchies and no vending machine at my hotel is terrible but you win some and loose some.  Made me nice and heavy eyed too which is what I was looking for.  Never got that \u201cbe careful if you smoke too much your anxiety is gone bf in the opposite direction\u201d feeling.  Decent strain

I could be pain free but I like to be alive n not catatonic from Big Pharmas poison.\u000a\u000aI just wanna thank all those who work in the industry for the same reason decades ago people became Dr,s.\u000aI have not met a person who hasn\u2019t taken each patient seriously....sometimes it,s just knowing these fine people r really trying to help me.....\u000a\u000aAll this depends on your body, take your time, keep records of how each thing worked...always FIRST TRY a NEW STRAIN alone....then you can spice it up with CBD or as ya please.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s taken awhile and a few bucks but to be able to control my pain somewhat is a good feeling.\u000a\u000aLook up Mendo Breath n check out all it has to offer.\u000a\u000aHope this helps...feel well \u000aVoodoo ldol

VSmokin a fat joint of Mendo Breath at 3am outside my house. I 100% agree with the original post about how this strain needs to be saved for after work. It only took a couple puffs for me to become perfectly mellowed out after a long day. I immediately felt extremely heavy indica vibes as I blew down the solo joint on my quiet street at 3am. The ultimate indica test is to take your joint out alone on a quiet night like I am now, and see if it makes you feel a) Paranoid and antsy or b) extremely relaxed and vibed out to the quiet peaceful sounds of life at 3am. Fortunately, Mendo Breath was completely the latter. I feel amazing right now and I can&#39;t wait to go inside and chill for a bit, then pass the F out! \u000a\u000aShort version:\u000aSmoke this late at night and you will feel amazing! Awesome indica!

VThis could be because of the new Pikachu bong I&#39;m smoking from but I think this is the most enjoyable high I have ever had. Like so good I wanted to tell others. Like enough to find a website where I could. And enough energy to create an account, search where I purchased, write an overall review. But like not enough energy to get up and get my phone to snap a picture to attach to this review. I&#39;m not really trying to do that right now but I am very surprised. I usually only smoke sativa strains because i have no problem falling asleep with a blink of an eye. I want to come home from work and create things. So I tend to stay away from Indicia&#39;s but this guy looked so beautiful with all the dark purple mixes.  So happy about this purchase and will be back to gather more.

V&quot;Uhm.... What was I saying again?&quot; That&#39;s something you may hear from Mendo Breath smokers! Side effects may include giggles, munchies, and short-term memory loss. The earthy and pine aroma is sure to allure the majority of enthusiasts. With a slightly sweet pine taste, highly recommended to make sweet rosins from this flower. Mendo tends to be quite dense covered with beautiful orange pistils (hairs) and trichomes

VI love this strain such a great body high with just enough energy to want do yoga , stretch, and relax.  Perfect for relaxation and introspection.  One of my new fave strains, so happy to have found this for night&#39;s when I need to chill.

VOnly tried this on the pen, so far. Pulled my intercostal muscles from grappling and this definitely helped with the pain. Things feel a little bit quiter, too,  like putting on head phones.

VAwesome smooth. Very good for my anxiety especially good before bed.  No cravings for food and an extremely clear regressing feeling. I woke up with no after effect and an extremely peaceful sleep. I\u2019m extremely impressed with this strain and will try it in a cartridge next.  This experience was with flower. Very good for high anxiety !

VExcellent morning wake-and-bake strain. Prefer to vape rather than smoke. Has a lot of head high for an Indica, the first 20-30 minutes is mostly a head buzz, which is uplifting and energetic. Then it settles into a comfortable, body numbing groove, that makes work and daily chores a pleasure. Despite the body effects of this Indica, your brain is focused with very little &#39;mind fuzz&#39;. Highly recommend during the day, not really a nighttime or going out strain. Neither is it for watching a movie or TV because the subtle effects will be lost.

VThis wonderfull earthy cross of OGKB ad MM resulted in one of my favorite idica strains. I had the chance to tast is from High Noon Cultivation, and I must say I was impressed. Woody, Nutty and slight hints of coffee. If you ever get a chance to try it in Portland, please do so.

VOne of my favorite strains for pain.  I mix a little bit of Mendo Breath with Jack Herer to achieve my favorite way to battle my wanna flip out kind of anxiety symptoms. But I&#39;ve been able to come off heavy narcotics thanks to Mendo Breath being there to encourage me.

VHas such a unique flavor and scent profile. Ham and cheese sandwich is the best way to describe it. The euphoria and cerebral effects come on fast for increased focus. Really fought away my fatigue and helped me get motivated. I use this strain when I need to get big projects done around the house.

VHad this a few times as of late, and I gotta say it&#39;s a fairly solid, euphoric, Indica body high without being  too much of a cerebral thing (just enough). Shifts gears on you after a couple of hours though, and is highly (no pun intended) likely to leave you snooin&#39;. Overall it&#39;s a solid Indica strain, but nothing to really write home about honestly.

VBought an 1/8th of this for $25 and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll pick it up again... Better strains our there for my money. I&#39;m more of a sativa dominant hybrid kinda person, but I do like a good indica before I sleep and this just wasn&#39;t very strong to me, and the high didn&#39;t last long or felt very Stoney at all. Maybe it was a weak plants buds?... Idk.
