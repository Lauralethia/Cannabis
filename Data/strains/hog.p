VI had not heard of this strain when i saw it at the dispensary, but seeing it listed as a pure indica at 28% thc definitely peaked my interest. I ended up picking up 2g of it for $21. Upon opening the jar there was this really heavy deep pine smell to it. It didn&#39;t have any notable sweet berry aroma to it like of indicas seem to. Definitely had the piney, hashy, Afghan-like smell. The smoke was one of the smoothest I have found. The high hits you quick, but the real high didn&#39;t fully kick in until the end of the bowl, making it a bit of a creeper. But when the high DID fully settle in, whoa. If you&#39;re looking for the perfect evening indica, something to straight up knock your ass, I can&#39;t think of a single reason anyone would not love this. Does exactly what it&#39;s supposed to x5.

VPotent. Sedating. Definitely didn&#39;t feel social, didn&#39;t feel like talking, very concentrated on my own thoughts. I see in the negatives that there&#39;s a lot of anxiety and I think it may be from the feeling of being paralysed and kinda stuck in your head. If anxiety patient take your usual micro-dose or less, be in a good headspace and everything should be fine.More couchlocking at the start as it hits fast, you can feel it behind the eyes a lot. The smell and taste I could detect is earthy/green tea. The first time, I didn&#39;t feel the euphoria others experienced, the sedative side is really overbearing.

VI got a pound of this stuff out of Colorado last year, and I was wowed. This stuff must have been given exactly what it wanted when it was grown because the bud was barely visible under the blanket of crystals. Very heavy duty high and an above average uniqueness to the flavor that leaves an impression on your memory. Definitely one I would re-visit again.

VI recently was able to smoke The Hog for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised. Not that I had low expectations, but the high was incredibly enjoyable. It is relaxing enough to help chill out after a hard days work, but will still allow you to get up and be functional. It is heady enough to be enjoyable, and won&#39;t give you the spins. The high can last for quite a while, even after you stop smoking it, so be careful. Being that it is about a 60/40 indica, its really live up to being closer to a hybrid, but with very evident indica traits. I highly recommend this strain to all smokers, though it is pretty potent, beginners should be cautious.

Definitely not for beginners, this strain will leave you totally couchlocked, but will remove most any pain and one of the few that when i am fighting insomnia can give me a solid 6hrs sleep and wake up totally refreshed. Wonderful sweet smell and flavor, dense nugs, and the burn time lasts forever with little loss of flavor. A little goes a long way here.

VI anticipated more&quot;pop&quot; from these beautiful dense  nuggets, a very user friendly strain, offers good flavor and managable effects. As an Indica medicine, it doesn&#39;t work for insomnia but seems more geared toward stress and anxiety relief with some pain benefit. A bit &quot;light&quot; for vetran users, highly recommended for noobs!

Vbusted out some more Hog that i got at F.R.A.M it&#39;s a bit more harsh then i usually like it leaves that brn in the back of your throat. after a couple drags a nice buzz spreads across my body allowing me to either pop a movie in and be prepared to stay mindless and numb, or to close my eyes and get a good hour or two of sleep which is good for me i have four plates and two new discs in my back plus nerve damage in both legs pain is a constant in my life while its not the best bud ever it does do what its supposed to do. i recommend this strain for those who are looking for a nice heavy indica, go to FRAM to get it their prices are great and their product is a step above.

VVery smooth on the draw, immediate relaxation on the exhale.  Smoking in two-chambered chiller, and smooth enough that it doesn&#39;t need ice.\u000a\u000aAgree that the flower&#39;s got a sweaty smell to it, but it has a piney overtone on the exhale that&#39;s nice enough.\u000a\u000aLabeling states 90%/10%, and sold as top shelf.

VI just picked up some Hog, and I can say it is a real beast!  The smell when the bag was opened reminded me of freshly ground Kona coffee beans. The taste is smooth on the inhale and exhale, and the effects are immediate, lasting about 2 hours. If you can get your hands on it....try it!

VI grew up smoking blue dream, so it&#39;s a treat to come across an indica that can knock me down. Hog is perhaps my all time favorite strain because of its potency and it&#39;s qualities. It may not have the highest THC concentration, but it will affect even the most experienced smokers.

VPOTENT. Acted a bit like a Sativa as it was more energizing and uplifting than I expected. I was expecting more of a body buzz and got more of a mind buzz. Smells like a big ol dirty hog rolled in tobacco ash. Nasty ashy taste left in mouth, like burnt tea with cigarette ash.
