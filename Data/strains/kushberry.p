VI got a free gram from Urban Greenhouse in Phoenix. \u000a\u000aI smoked a decent sized bowl out of a water bong. Whenever I try a new strain, I only smoke one bowl. Then I wait a few mins to see what happens. I figure if it doesn\u2019t make me feel anything after an entire bowl, it probably isn\u2019t the strain for me. Anyway, it smoked really nice and smooth. Taste was decent. After about 5 minutes, a really nice euphoria crept up. I mean a really nice euphoria. A couple minutes later, my body was more relaxed than it had ever been. I had ZERO pain, anxiety, or depression. \u000a\u000aI medicate daily and try to stay medicated all day. I am retired. My tolerance is ok. This strain made me feel better than any strain I have tried. \u000a\u000aI am going to pick more up ASAP!\u000a

VA very nice, very classic Indica. Very relaxing both mentally and physically. Careful getting too comfortable after use, getting up could be a bit difficult. It won&#39;t suck the energy out of you if you&#39;re already doing something though. Not bad for walking the dog, going to the store, etc. though.

VBoth OG and Blueberry stands out. I\u2019ve smoked quite a few OG varieties but this one is in the top 3.  Smooth head high and after about 5-10 minutes sit down cause it\u2019s going to take you for a ride of no pain no anxiety no blockage mentally. Nice bud structure and very nice trim up. Afghani type structure mostly stands out. &#128077;&#127998;&#128077;&#127998;&#128077;&#127998;&#128077;&#127998;&#128077;&#127998;&#128077;&#127998;

VWas so impressed with this strain. Extremely effective for being able to get to calm down and sleep with symptoms of bipolar (type 2) and just insomnia in general. But what stood out to me the most was the flavour. The funky sweet, pungent, fruity, herbal taste is so pleasant. Very glad to have got my hands on this strain a little while back, looking forward to hopefully getting it again soon! Makes you feel like you just wanna spread the love &lt;3

VI alaways roll 1/2 garam joint. This stuff has a good kush and berry taste hence the name. Sweet and smooth lung expanding smoke gently puts u in your seat. It has good qualities for nightime.

VKushberry has strong, earthy notes that accompany the purple and floral accents from each rip. You definitely will taste the Blueberry out of it, and those effects with the OG Kush mend so favorably to create this one outstanding strain. It&#39;s a warm, mind-numbing strain that will work its way on you after a few minutes. Nice after long days work, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll sleep well. Borders a 4.5/5 in my books.. The line&#39;s gotta be drawn somewhere..
