VThis is one of my new favorites, I think. It seems to be one that does my bidding. If I want to hang out and chill, it&#39;s happy to sit back on the couch with me and catch a movie or some Netflix. If I need to get stuff done, it will get up and help me get the house clean. It doesn&#39;t have quite the kick of Green Crack...so it&#39;s not for those times I need to clean the bottoms of my shoes with a toothbrush, or count the grains of rice I have left. But I can still do the dishes, sweep the floor and it looks pretty okay. The only issue I have is that...what was I saying? Oh I get distracted with it, so it might take me 2 hours to sweep the floor, but it takes me two hours to sweep the floor with Green Crack too, but that&#39;s only because while I was sweeping the floor, I noticed my broom wasn&#39;t doing the job it used to, so I decided to trim it, but while I was trimming the broom, I noticed the scissors needed sharpening, so while I was sharpening the scissors I noticed the tools really should be organized so I decided to organize the tools and do not even GET me started on the state of the utility room, so while I&#39;m out here I will just straighten this up, which brings me to the little box fiasco I&#39;ve been meaning to address.\u000a\u000aSo yeah, at least it&#39;s not as bad as that.

VI vaped a couple dozen hits at 392F mindlessly while reading some forum post on the chemical reactions involved in THC combustion. I was nodding along, wondering if the vape was even working. Then I turned on some nice jazz music and the high came crashing in. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s about 15 minutes in, and it&#39;s a very mellow, chill, euphoric high. I can easily tune in and out of it (if I turn the music off) and focus on whatever I need to, but I can tune back in and ride the high on cue. Very light, energetic head high. \u000a\u000a30 min. I love my cat. He&#39;s purring like a madman while I massage his neck. He snorts like a little piglet if he purs hard enough. I was able to really feel/follow the beat of a strange-rhythmed Jazz beat I was listening to while tapping frantically on my cat. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

Vsome background on the strain: super lemon haze originally from greenhouse seed company . THC 20-22%\u000aGenetics: Lemon Skunk crossed with Super Silver Haze. Multiple Cannabis Cup winners. This sativa will shoot your head to the sky with a nice subtle body stone, very potent bud.

VAnother one of those strains that&#39;s basically everywhere in the Washington rec and med. market and for good reason. I love the terps in this strain in concentrate form it&#39;s usually very sour and lemony something I&#39;m always gonna be looking for in a Sativa. Plenty of energy, it&#39;s very upbeat, and probably lends itself to creativity, On the physical side there&#39;s a nice pressure in the head and there&#39;s an underlying relaxing euphoria. If looking for a good Sativa this is definitely one to try.

VI grew this strain four times,and she is a beauty. Out of 20 plants,only two were with bad genetics(but still good in the end). She likes nutes, only trouble was that she doesn&#39;t like lst. She suprised me outdoor. Finished before white rhino,and some other indica strains(nine weeks of flowering,i plant sativas late in outdoor,because of stretching).Indoor also great,and with good care she is great producer(for that quality) Potent as hell, beautifull smell, and after propper cure,she looks like fruit dipped in sugar. Real sativa structure, beauty,and buds get all the light because she is not leafy. My recomendations ( i enjoy growing cannabis for 18 years, not for sale,for pleasure). GHS did a good job with this one. Greetings from Croatia...

VSuper Lemon Haze is my all-time favorite strain. It pulls more sativa than indica, which works best with my brain chemistry. The flower is a gorgeous light green, crystallized bud. It smells like a lemon tree as it goes into flowering. If you throw in a lemon peel as the bud cures, it will taste like an earthy/mossy lemon. Delicious. I have anxiety, so I am always careful when it comes to the strains I choose to smoke, but this strain has never given me a negative side effect like anxiety or paranoia. The high for me is uplifting, happy, creative, and focused. I don&#39;t feel hungry or tired, but do get dry mouth. This strain will make you want to do something fun and creative. I would recommend SLH to anyone who deals with anxiety, depression, paranoia, ADD/ADHD, PMS, and lethargy.

VVaped on the way to return some ceiling fans to Jerry&#39;s. went in with my sister and husband. When we got to the customer service desk something came over me and I decided to tell the woman that two of the motors were burned out and the other one was a piece of crap. I&#39;m not sure why I said that! then I tried to pick up one of the fans but couldn&#39;t really feel my arms so I just moved it around a bit. Then I decided to leave the store immediately where I doubled over in laughter for the next 10 minutes. my husband came out of the store laughing with a confused look on his face. point is: 5 stars!!!

VPicked up a half ounce of this yesterday from my caregiver, as I opened the jar, I was greeted by a heavy sweet smell of citrus,  the herb also had hints of diesel. When ground the smell of lemony herb filled the room. Very pungent.\u000aVery smooth smoke, tastes just like it smells. Lemon head candy or sour lemonade is a spot on description. The high is a bit psychedelic as I feel myself very awake yet floating through space and time. It says not for the tightly strung but I find no anxiety in this strain, the energy is positive and leaves you craving more, will buy again for sure.

VOne of the best smokes, defintely recommended. Perfect for morning to late evening, socializing, going out in the evening. Incredibly energetic, happy and euphoric. Intensely psychoactive, makes your feel so much more alive, more connected to the world and those you&#39;re with. Smells delightful, tastes just as nice bit less lemony than the smell though. Definitely still got that slight skunk flavour in there. 10/10. Negative: slight dry mouth, easily controllable.

VI smoked it for the first time today.  It was after my 74th chemo.   I like it a lot. It brought me out of the brain fog, chemo brain. It didn&#39;t last long it must have been a low grade. (extra from club) I will buy it again to see if it has the same effect.  Maybe a higher quality bud it would last longer or get rid of the fog all together.   It is like sunshine on a cold morning.  It taste lemony on the inhale and on the exhale it taste like fruit loops.   It might be sweeter with a higher grade bud.   I liked it.  I am going to smoke the other half now. \u000a\u000a  live pain free you deserve that!

But, I use it before my runs and during house projects. Two small puffs and I\u2019m good to go.  Seems to make \u201cthe blues\u201d go away quickly; which is an added medical benefit for me. I feel happy, euphoric, and energetic on this. Kinda scary to admit....But, I feel like a better person on this.  I use to drink a lot. Now, I only have a social drink once a week....If that.

VI have to say, this is one of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked in a while. I was a little worried when I read that it was sativa dominant, but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. \u000a\u000aNow that I&#39;ve tried it, I can say that everyone else is right. It&#39;s top shelf shit and is fantastic. Great buzz, great flavor, smooth to hit. Very potent, but doesn&#39;t make you stupid. Although, with the strength of this stuff, you&#39;d probably get stupid if you smoked enough of it. \u000a\u000aThere is a lot of red hair in the buds and plenty of trichomes -- but the buds are just kind of plain looking. The look doesn&#39;t grab your eye... but smoke it and you will understand. Makes you happy and positive, while still giving you a nice head and body buzz. \u000a\u000aI tend to prefer indicas because I like the calming effect... the sativas can make me a little jittery (like Cindy 99.) However, SLH doesn&#39;t make me jittery or paranoid. As of yet, I really can&#39;t say anything negative about it. The buzz is as smooth as the hit is. And by the way, sometimes it tastes like lemon meringue pie. It&#39;s amazing! \u000a\u000aHIGHLY recommended.

VDon&#39;t understand why Sativa&#39;s work for me but the more they say they are like espresso the better they work. I cant even drink coffee because of anxiety but have no problems with this Sativa. Florida girl so we are limited to what they let us have which is mostly vapes and/or concentrates. This strain is able to get me right out of bed and get my day started. It also has an appetite suppressant quality to it.  I can eat but don&#39;t feel hungry till about 2pm  usually up by 7:00AM.  This also has been good for my low back nerve pain.  Still new to this and I am having a problem with sleep and the indica strains are giving me high anxiety with the higher THC counts. I use this all day and into the night but try to start going to bed around 11. but could stay up much later using this.

VI like this strain.  The buds are medium green velvety beautiful and fluffy looking like fairy forest moss with little orange hairs throughout. It smells slightly citrusy and also a little skunky.  It elevates my mood, increases my creative energies, and allows me to focus.  I feel a little haziness in my eye muscles but not in a tired way.  This strain gives me a little of the munchies but no dry mouth at all.  I have to be careful because it is a little bit of a creeper.  The effects are felt immediately but it has a wave of intensity that kicks in about twenty later that can be too intense for a social situation but alright if I am alone working creatively.  This wave of intensity lasts about 25-30 mins and then the effects even out into a very pleasant energetic, happy, motivating,and creative high that lasts for a couple hours.  Smoking just one puff is also nice for a mild mood elevator while having the ability to remain very functional and efficient.

VSuper Lemon Haze is quite a unique strain. Loaded with limonene terpenes, this strain gives you a great earthy, lemon candy like flavor. After taking 3 hits, I felt very euphoric and energized. It\u2019s almost like drinking a cup of coffee. After about 20 minutes, I started to become very focused and motivated.. hence this review. If you\u2019re looking for a productive morning, slh is the sativa you\u2019re looking for. Definitely one of my favorites. \u000a

I get panic attacks and incredible paranoia, which is to be expected with Sativas for me as I\u2019m mostly a medicinal user, but I fail to see how this strain could have any recreational value. The high is short and lackluster. Also, I didn\u2019t get any medicinal value out of this plant, either.

VI was already a fan of Super Silver Haze, and, as I&#39;m usually also a big fan of Skunk crosses, I&#39;d had Super Lemon Haze on my list for quite some time.\u000a\u000aIt did not disappoint. It smelled lemony and a little sweet, which is exactly how it tasted. Very tasty!\u000a\u000aThe effects, though, were exactly what I look for in a sativa dominant strain. Like many sativas, it was a bit of a creeper for me, fully kicking in about 15 minutes after I finished smoking, but once it did, the high was really nice. A strong happy wave of relaxed energy, which combined with a mild body high after about an hour&#39;s time. \u000a\u000aI have to be careful with sativas, as smoking too much can make me very anxious, but at 15% THC, this was perfect. It didn&#39;t take much to get me where I wanted to be -- another bonus! \u000a\u000aHighly, highly recommended.

In small doses, this strain can be used for intense focus and study. But once you cross that threshold, the high becomes a trip. Has psychedelic elements to it. Body is very tingly.

This bud is grown in Spokane, WA and boosted a TCHA of 23.70 and 21.00 total cannabinoids. It tested for .10 percent CBD. So light and airy. The lemon and earthy aroma fill your nose and lungs. This is my favorite wake and bake strain! It pairs so well with a cup of coffee in the morning. This strong sativa goes straight to your head. It also take away my arthritis so I can go kick butt and get things done! No couch lock for me, no real munchies. The come down is excellent! I still feel motivated at the end of my high just as I did in the beginning. Not so much for other sativas. I am also a chick who is prone is anxiety attacks and this strain doesn&#39;t give me that. It makes me happy and take away my depression. It&#39;s a gentle, motivating, and just a well balanced daytime smoke!

VSuper Lemon haze is a very potent long lasting Sativa dominant hybrid, with earthy, herbal, &amp; sweet lemon flavors. \u000a\u000aThis strain is the offspring of Lemon Skunk &amp; Super Silver Haze. Lemon skunk is a Sativa dominat hybrid, and SSH is a Sativa.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a               [Review] \u000aWhen smoking this strain, the most common early effects you will feel are, euphoria, hunger, &amp; relaxation. Some of the effects you may encounter durring the climax of the high include, dizziness, drowsiness, dry eyes, dry mouth, arousal, &amp; paranoia.\u000a\u000a  [My overall impressions]\u000a\u000aI have smoke this strain for a while. And I have been gathering note on it for some time. And there are a few things worth mentioning.\u000a\u000a\u000a(Pros)\u000a\u2022 Very relaxing \u000a\u2022 Great for anxiety\u000a\u2022 Good for insomia\u000a\u2022 Pairs great with music\u000a\u2022 Food tastes better\u000a\u2022 Games seem more immersive\u000a\u000a(Cons)\u000a\u2022 Bad dry eyes &amp; mouth\u000a\u2022 Dizziness \u000a\u2022 Paranoia (briefly)\u000a\u2022 Extream munchies\u000a\u2022 Rough on throat \u000a\u000a\u000aOverall I sotra love and loath this strain, when it hit&#39;s it wipes you out. But, on the other hand, some of the cons get in the way for a little while then they calm down a bit.\u000a\u000aSo would I personally recommend this strain? Yes I would.\u000a\u000a\u000aOverall score: 7/10

VA Great Lemon taste that grows a very large main cola that is awesome! here&#39;s what Attitude seed bank had to say: Green House Seeds Super Lemon Haze has won the 2008 High Times Cannabis Cup with a landslide of votes. Its incredibly intense lemony flavour, with a strong haze background has a sharp and intense taste, which reminds of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit, followed by a very earthy and musky haze aftertaste, with traces of incense and black pepper. The effect is very balanced; it starts with a quick indica-hit feeling that softly moves to a very strong high, with a social and creative side. The Super Lemon Haze is a very smooth compromise between the great qualities of its parents. It&#39;s cannabis seeds has 9-10 weeks flowering time, and a very typical Christmas tree shape. Plants tend to grow quite tall, but the internodes are not too far apart, and allow easy topping. The leaves are very sativa-like, while bud formation comes dense and has a high calyx-to-leaf ratio. The Super Lemon Haze is very effective both indoors and outdoors, and responds very well to high-EC hydro systems as well as organic soil setups. When cultivated in soil, the spectrum of terpens is more developed and gives an extra lemony flavour. The THC is high at over 22%, ensuring a very psychedelic experience to even the most experienced smokers. Effect: A very lemony haze, works fast and lasts long. It\u2019s a very powerful high, very balanced between a physical and a cerebral side. Flowering outdoor: finishes end October in northern hemisphere, production up to 1000 gr/plant.

VWas super excited to try this one. Picked up an 8th from the dispensery. Buds definitely had some zest going on, but the flavor wasn&#39;t quite as citrusy as I expected.\u000a\u000aThe high was similar to the super silver but not quite as energizing,  definitely had a laid back vibe similar to the Lemon Skunk I tried. Given the option I&#39;d probably take SSH over this, but very nice stuff non the less.\u000a\u000aMore recently I picked up a strain called Lemon Burst (SLH x Wonkstar) that was exactly what I hoped this would taste like. That is one I highly recommend as well.

VThis strain just makes me happy. It is an excellent all-day, work-weed with the added awesomness of pain relief, relaxed muscles and a creative, cerebral high. This will be a definite regular for me! I have an incredibly wound-tight upper back because of a lower back injury that causes me constant soreness, downright pain and hella-fatigue. Within 1-2 hits of my vaporizer I can feel everything start to unwind. I seem to instinctively start doing small yoga poses in my office chair (I don&#39;t always realize I&#39;m doing it at first) because it feels so amazing to get such deep stretches that I can hold a really long with some good breathing. Excellent for brainstorming/problem solving too. The cherries on top?  I don&#39;t seem to get the munchies with this strain, but it does enhance flavor very nicely if it happens to be mealtime. Also, not as much dry mouth or dry eyes with this one.\u000a\u000aGo now, run to your dispensary/dealer to get this Super Lemon Haze...&#39;tis the shit.

VBackground: I&#39;m a 34 year old woman who&#39;s newer to weed (2 years this month). I generally go for hybrids because when I first started smoking I figured hybrids would give me the best of both worlds. Plus I was scared of sativas because of my anxiety issues. Well I&#39;m getting sick of the strains I&#39;ve tried making me lazy and fall asleep.\u000a\u000aSo the budtender at SWC in Tempe, AZ recommended this one along with a few others. I chose this one because I seem to like the ones with lemon in it.\u000a\u000aLast night I tried it and loved it!! It made me feel happy, energetic and motivated. I felt like I wanted to be creative again and I was giving myself positive mental pep talks. This sounds ridiculous but I turned some music on and was dancing in the shower. Lol!!! It was great!! I did have a moment where I wanted to become nervous or paranoid but I took a deep breath and reminded myself I was fine and it passed. Tonight I tried it again and again it was fantastic. I got my whole house decorated for the holidays in a few hours. I was focused and uplifted. \u000a\u000aI really love this weed and I&#39;m no longer scared of sativa dominant strains.

VCartridge was a little sticky when I took it out of the sealed package so a little nervous that these might leak. Metal tip is nice though. It twisted almost all the way onto the Max Battery but was a little loose. Still hit just fine though. The taste is sooooo good. It actually tastes like lemon. It&#39;s like a lemon Italian soda. Super sweet and pleasant. Directions say to start with one 5-second hit and that there&#39;s 75 5-second hits in one cart. I took a few at different temperatures. It&#39;s nice to vape but the effects aren&#39;t awesome. Very noticeable head change however this is supposed to be a sativa and I feel pretty wiped out and sleepy now. I had energy and slept 7 hours but this thing captured my essence and trapped my soul inside. C&#39;mon it&#39;s a sativa. Where&#39;s the energy? Where&#39;s the uplifting morning strain I wanted?

VFirst of all, one of the BEST experiences I&#39;ve ever had. I have severe anxiety, severe depression, and insomnia. My anxiety was COMPLETELY GONE after smoking maybe half a bowl, and the only thing I had left of my depression was a mild disinterest in watching TV, but I found joy in art after years of finding it stressful and annoying. Time dialation was hella strong, and trying to listen to music was somewhere between incredible and mildly disturbing. Taste, looking back, was very distinct and enjoyable, at the time I remember describing it as &#39;tasting the way lemony fresh cleaner smells&#39;. The smoke is very tolerable and I didnt cough once through nearly 2 bowls. Honestly I cant get enough!\u000a

VReally great strain for daytime use. Gives you an energy boost, but not an overly focused one--good for wake and bake but not a day where you have to be mentally focused. Starts out as an energetic high and then fades into an euphoric and happy mellow. No crash after the high wears off\u000aDelicious, citrus and sweet flavour is a bonus as well

VCartridge was a little sticky when I took it out of the sealed package so a little nervous that these might leak. Metal tip is nice though. It twisted almost all the way onto the Max Battery but was a little loose. Still hit just fine though. The taste is sooooo good. It actually tastes like lemon. It&#39;s like a lemon Italian soda. Super sweet and pleasant. Directions say to start with one 5-second hit and that there&#39;s 75 5-second hits in one cart. I took a few at different temperatures. It&#39;s nice to vape but the effects aren&#39;t awesome. Very noticeable head change however this is supposed to be a sativa and I feel pretty wiped out and sleepy now. I had energy and slept 7 hours but this thing captured my essence and trapped my soul inside. C&#39;mon it&#39;s a sativa. Where&#39;s the energy? Where&#39;s the uplifting morning strain I wanted? Paranoia level: 0/10.

I\u2019d much rather those kind, than full on like, Psychedelic Sativa City where I feel like like I just took a Microdose of LSD or Mushrooms. Not really what I\u2019m looking for in a toke personally.\u000a\u000aFuck ANYWAYS (sorry, it\u2019s late, and I\u2019m LIT), I decided that I was just a little tired of my local recreational delivery company\u2019s Indica Oil Vape Cartridges, so rather than King Louis XIII or Skywalker OG I decided to roll the dice and get a 0.5g Vape Cart of 74% THC (0% CBD, .93% CBN) Super Lemon Haze by The Bloom Brand (which is actually owned by Leafly if I\u2019m not mistaken?\u2014 and no this isn\u2019t a sponsored review or whatever.

VI usually like sativa strains that have the word lemon, super, or haze in the name so this one was the best of them all in my opinion. I bought this because I couldn&#39;t get any sour diesel which I use on a daily basis for my chronic nerve pain and for creativity as I am a writer and musician. I like sour D better but this works almost as good for my needs minus the pain relief and much less creativity. Decent though for day time but for the new toker still in training wheels, I&#39;d recommend doing a 2 toke test first on this one... :-)

VA very uplifting energetic high with euphoric feelings. The high is clear and smooth with a trippy psychedelic aspect.  It does not fog the brain like Amnesia Haze as you can focus in on things. The high is also quite lively in that you feel like doing things. Decent weed though I prefer Amnesia Haze which gives you a intense feeling of happiness and joy. Where this weed gives you a feeling of happy contentment with a bit of euphoria thrown in.

VMy strain was labeled as a sativa. This is definitely a daytime only weed. It had a strong lemon citrus smell that you could taste when you took a hit. Its was a very energetic happy high. Me and my friends wouldn&#39;t shut up. The downside is it gave me the worst munchies of my life; I gained about 5 pounds the week I had this. When the high starts coming down I started feeling very tired and became stoned on my couch watching classic Star Trek. Overall a very fun weed if you have the food to fuel it.

VSTART SLOW. That&#39;s my biggest takeaway from this. I&#39;m a daily user, though not in large amounts, and my tolerance is pretty high. I was excited to try this because of the alleged euphoric effects and high energy, so yesterday I bought a vape cartridge. Definite lemon taste. Took two hits later and went to clear piles of freshly folded laundry off my bed. One involuntary nap later, I woke up in a pile of my own drool on top of the aforementioned laundry. I figured it was a one-off because this week beat the crap out of me and I was extra tired. This morning I tried it again for a little wake and bake. Take the wake part out of it and it was pretty accurate - SLH put me right back into bed for another three hours. Maybe it&#39;s because I have ADHD that it&#39;s having an opposite day effect on me, maybe it&#39;s just the Canna-Gods having a good laugh, I dunno. But so far, though it&#39;s done wonders for my super crappy mood, it is not a strain I would expect to smoke and get anything done.  I still like it lots, there&#39;s very little paranoia which is a big concern for me, hence the four stars, but it&#39;s not having the effect on me that I wanted or expected. I&#39;ll re-review this once I&#39;ve developed a little more tolerance and see if it&#39;s become more sativa like. \u000aOh, one more weird thing - when it first hits, it makes my knees ache. ???

VA very uplifting energetic high with euphoric feelings. The high is clear and smooth with a trippy psychedelic aspect.  It does not fog the brain like Amnesia Haze as you can focus in on things. The high is also quite lively in that you feel like doing things. Decent weed though I prefer Amnesia Haze which gives you a intense feeling of happiness and joy. Where this weed gives you a feeling of happy contentment with a bit of euphoria thrown in.

VFirst of all, one of the BEST experiences I&#39;ve ever had. I have severe anxiety, severe depression, and insomnia. My anxiety was COMPLETELY GONE after smoking maybe half a bowl, and the only thing I had left of my depression was a mild disinterest in watching TV, but I found joy in art after years of finding it stressful and annoying. Time dialation was hella strong, and trying to listen to music was somewhere between incredible and mildly disturbing. Taste, looking back, was very distinct and enjoyable, at the time I remember describing it as &#39;tasting the way lemony fresh cleaner smells&#39;. The smoke is very tolerable and I didnt cough once through nearly 2 bowls. Honestly I cant get enough!\u000a

VSTART SLOW. That&#39;s my biggest takeaway from this. I&#39;m a daily user, though not in large amounts, and my tolerance is pretty high. I was excited to try this because of the alleged euphoric effects and high energy, so yesterday I bought a vape cartridge. Definite lemon taste. Took two hits later and went to clear piles of freshly folded laundry off my bed. One involuntary nap later, I woke up in a pile of my own drool on top of the aforementioned laundry. I figured it was a one-off because this week beat the crap out of me and I was extra tired. This morning I tried it again for a little wake and bake. Take the wake part out of it and it was pretty accurate - SLH put me right back into bed for another three hours. Maybe it&#39;s because I have ADHD that it&#39;s having an opposite day effect on me, maybe it&#39;s just the Canna-Gods having a good laugh, I dunno. But so far, though it&#39;s done wonders for my super crappy mood, it is not a strain I would expect to smoke and get anything done.  I still like it lots, there&#39;s very little paranoia which is a big concern for me, hence the four stars, but it&#39;s not having the effect on me that I wanted or expected. I&#39;ll re-review this once I&#39;ve developed a little more tolerance and see if it&#39;s become more sativa like. \u000aOh, one more weird thing - when it first hits, it makes my knees ache. ???

VAs the name goes this particular strain of Hazes&#39;, has very pungent lemon flavour to it.  The lemony characters shine through with a sweet citrus after note both in smell and after you smoke it.  This is a Sativa dominant in which it sits @ 90/10 %.  Being, near 100 % Sativa, the buzz is truly euphoric and uplifting.   There is a sense of calmness after the first until few tokes and the the energetic and euphoric sense kicks in.  Great for combating depression and anxiety.   This particular strain is also good those who a little bit of oomph, in dealing with social anxiety.   Overall, I highly recommend this strain even if you are new you will really enjoy the lasting effects of the high.  The Indica aspect comes in towards the tail end of your high.  It eases you down gently and leaves you felling happy and calm.

VHazey, zesty and a bit sweet. This is a toke that was recommended to me by a Sativa-enthusiast.  \u000a\u000aProminent cerebral effects: creativity, energy (both arousal + nervous energy), euphoria, and uplifting happiness. This strain makes it a good solution for treating depression, fatigue, and chronic pain. I would not recommend it to folks that are wound too tight (prone to anxiety/panic). If you must -- try it with some L-Theanine supplement. This is like a cup of caffeine, unless you drunk coffee every day, take caution with this strain. It&#39;s awesome, but at least have a backup plan in case your heart starts racing.\u000a\u000aIn any case, your mood will be happily elevated. Expect a high-buzz with a desire to to be outdoors. This is a great strain if you&#39;re into hazey type of experience. The taste itself is quite delicious and this is certainly one special and stimulating strain.

VIt&#39;s a lemon factory. A heavy, very bold flavor that is very pungent. A thick musky lemon smell, kind of like a tropical skunk. Get for migraine headaches and insomnia. It will surly turn all engines off for a deep rest. I would recommend before bed or a Willie Nelson concert. I give it 4 Green Iguana&#39;s.

VHigh has an exceptional come on. It\u2019s so easy and stable, full of comfort and fresh, clear-headed positivity just bursting out your head. Vision is wide with a softly out-of-focus, fish-eyed perspective. It\u2019s like crazy wrap around vision, but you can only concentrate and focus on one narrow thing. It\u2019s pretty trippy. Sound is almost more hallucinatory. It overwhelms the senses and is a force of nature. Powerful. Cottonmouth gets bad quick, you can literally feel your mouth drying out. Mental state stays resiliently euphoric, full of genuine, heartfelt nostalgia. Very moving, but also fun! Socializing is oddly difficult. Words don\u2019t quite register and you\u2019re left struggling to keep up, which makes responding awkward. Better just watch or absorb stuff. For that alone as really the only discernible downside, I think it earns a 9/10.

VI&#39;m not normally a sativa guy since I usually smoke at night to relax and go to sleep but when I saw this at my dispensary I had to get it. I happened to come across this same strain a few years ago and it staaaaank up the place. Took it on the city bus and I heard several people just say out loud &quot;something smells like weed&quot;. I can&#39;t stress enough how good this bus smells like. Be prepared to get some looks if you just have it sitting in your pocket.

VSo let me start by saying that the first time I tried this I also got a new variable temperature Vape pen. This is the first time I\u2019ve had a variable.  So wasn\u2019t quite sure what I was doing\u2026 Just being honest\u000a\u000aI got a Bodihi cartridge as a bud tender said that if I like blue dream and Girl Scout cookies that I should really like this as well.\u000a\u000aI wasn\u2019t experienced with cartridges that have the air vents, nor did I realize that the high temperature of the variable pen would give me a lot more of a concentrate in one puff than I was used to.\u000a\u000aI am generally a 1 to 3 pass person.  I like to get the giggles\u2026 I don\u2019t like to feel as though I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u000a\u000aIn this particular case the first time i vaped it I definitely got too much.  I was trying to explain to my mom that I felt like I was seeing this whole situation from the future and retelling the story to her. My mind was wandering all over the place and I pretty much traveled the world. Anything I thought of I thought of in such high detail and so fast it was pretty amazing. That being said I felt that I was on a roller coaster the whole time.  I kind of wanted to just back off a little bit.\u000a\u000aMy mom, took a much smaller puff so she didn\u2019t have such a big impact. She did however laugh so much that she pissed herself\u2026 Literally.\u000a\u000aAfter a little bit of time since we were staying in an Airbnb I decided I should go watch a movie and relax on the bed and let things process.\u000a\u000aThe following day I took much less of a puff and at a lower temperature, and that was a winner. I left I was relaxed and I had a good time.\u000a\u000aLast night my sister and my mother and I went to a casino. We were celebrating my sisters bachelorette party. So my sister and I decided to have a puff or two. And that was fine we were silly at dinner it was really enjoyable. However I felt like I was landing pretty quickly. So when into the bathroom and decided to have another puff. And\u2026 I think I over did it again.\u000a\u000aIt was certainly not as intense as the first time that I did it to be clear. But I did feel very tired and my mind was wandering and I\u2019m pretty sure other people realize that I wasn\u2019t quite as comfortable as I was earlier.\u000a\u000aI wasn\u2019t paranoid or anything like that, but I will say that with all the casino machines and people\u2026 It was like my mind could not calm down. It was bouncing all around everything from mentally seeing the circuitry on the inside of a casino machine to thinking about all the people\u2019s stories that were there.\u000a\u000aThe detail thinking is so intense that it can make you a little uncomfortable. This is especially true if there are a lot of things in your environment that might be stimulating. There is nothing more stimulating than hundreds of slot machines making noises and flashing lights.\u000a\u000aI like this strain, but I think it has a very tiny window of error for me.  I have to remember to only take a little bit at a time and let it run its course before I decide another go at it.\u000a\u000aIt is very delicate nature the detail thinking is pretty amazing. From a physical perspective it is relaxing not as much as some other strains though. I do feel like I am squishy and that my hands and arms can go through my hands and arms or other things if I wanted them to. I also felt like this strain increase my level of suggestibility. So for example if you told me that I had Chinese finger trap holding my index fingers together my fingers would be stuck there.  I also felt like I could be as still as a statue.  \u000a\u000aWhen we were at the casino I did feel like everything was so far away and so close all the same time.  I finally left my mom and my sister playing games and I went over to a restaurant and sat down at a table and just relaxed. I felt much better later after getting some soda.\u000a\u000aI wasn\u2019t nauseous or anything it wasn\u2019t that it was an enjoyable it\u2019s just I think it\u2019s one of those strains that go over the line very quickly and if it does I\u2019d rather be in a low stimulus area than in a casino.\u000a\u000aIf you are a occasionally user as opposed to a regular user I would suggest making sure the first time you use the strain start out very low, and consider being at home comfortable. Until you figure out how you react to it this is the safest way to be.\u000a\u000aSo I like this strain\u2026 but I think others have a more reliable reaction for me.\u000a

Come up was nearly fucking instantaneous (less than ten minutes). Currently high as a kite. Can barely type. I can\u2019t feel my toes, or my scalp. Waves of pressure up and down my body. Time dilation effects. Enormous head high. Words getting hard. Some arousal at around 45 minutes.

VHigh has an exceptional come on. It\u2019s so easy and stable, full of comfort and fresh, clear-headed positivity just bursting out your head. Vision is wide with a softly out-of-focus, fish-eyed perspective. It\u2019s like crazy wrap around vision, but you can only concentrate and focus on one narrow thing. It\u2019s pretty trippy. Sound is almost more hallucinatory. It overwhelms the senses and is a force of nature. Powerful. Cottonmouth gets bad quick, you can literally feel your mouth drying out. Mental state stays resiliently euphoric, full of genuine, heartfelt nostalgia. Very moving, but also fun! Socializing is oddly difficult. Words don\u2019t quite register and you\u2019re left struggling to keep up, which makes responding awkward. Better just watch or absorb stuff. For that alone as really the only discernible downside, I think it earns a 9/10.

VHigh has an exceptional come on. It\u2019s so easy and stable, full of comfort and fresh, clear-headed positivity just bursting out your head. Vision is wide with a softly out-of-focus, fish-eyed perspective. It\u2019s like crazy wrap around vision, but you can only concentrate and focus on one narrow thing. It\u2019s pretty trippy. Sound is almost more hallucinatory. It overwhelms the senses and is a force of nature. Powerful. Cottonmouth gets bad quick, you can literally feel your mouth drying out. Mental state stays resiliently euphoric, full of genuine, heartfelt nostalgia. Very moving, but also fun! Socializing is oddly difficult. Words don\u2019t quite register and you\u2019re left struggling to keep up, which makes responding awkward. Better just watch or absorb stuff. For that alone as really the only discernible downside, I think it earns a 9/10.

VFirst time I used a pipe. Tiny cute little thing. Strain is Super Lemon Haze (25.65% THC) from Rootworx and purchased from Dockside. Taste was mild and not unpleasant. Come up was nearly fucking instantaneous (less than ten minutes). Currently high as a kite. Can barely type. I can\u2019t feel my toes, or my scalp. Waves of pressure up and down my body. Time dilation effects. Enormous head high. Words getting hard. Some arousal at around 45 minutes.

VHigh has an exceptional come on. It\u2019s so easy and stable, full of comfort and fresh, clear-headed positivity just bursting out your head. Vision is wide with a softly out-of-focus, fish-eyed perspective. It\u2019s like crazy wrap around vision, but you can only concentrate and focus on one narrow thing. It\u2019s pretty trippy. Sound is almost more hallucinatory. It overwhelms the senses and is a force of nature. Powerful. Cottonmouth gets bad quick, you can literally feel your mouth drying out. Mental state stays resiliently euphoric, full of genuine, heartfelt nostalgia. Very moving, but also fun! Socializing is oddly difficult. Words don\u2019t quite register and you\u2019re left struggling to keep up, which makes responding awkward. Better just watch or absorb stuff. For that alone as really the only discernible downside, I think it earns a 9/10.

VFirst time I used a pipe. Tiny cute little thing. Strain is Super Lemon Haze (25.65% THC) from Rootworx and purchased from Dockside. Taste was mild and not unpleasant. Come up was nearly fucking instantaneous (less than ten minutes). Currently high as a kite. Can barely type. I can\u2019t feel my toes, or my scalp. Waves of pressure up and down my body. Time dilation effects. Enormous head high. Words getting hard. Some arousal at around 45 minutes.

I can&#39;t stress enough how good this bus smells like. Be prepared to get some looks if you just have it sitting in your pocket.

VAnother live review: This is fantastic. I rolled it with a melon zigzag blunt wrap and summer 2014 blend tobacco, so I&#39;m getting a nice tropical medley taste, almost as it&#39;s a citrus melon fruit salad I&#39;m only 5 minutes in and I feel like the back of my head is getting massaged by the tender fingers of 2 Asian lady masseuses. Idk why they are Asian, but it feels like the best descriptor.\u000a\u000aAbout 9 minutes in and I&#39;m going to walk up the stairs back into my apartment. Okay, walking may be a struggle. Kinda. Now to take these fucking stairs back to my apartment on the third floor. I made it!\u000a\u000a15 minutes into this and I&#39;m actually getting a little pressure to my head now... a little uncomfortable... BUT I feel creative AF, which is a nice trade off. Im gonna brush my teeth and take a shower.\u000a\u000a20 minutes, actually writing this in the shower. Sipping on some bubbly cucumber water... it pairs well, i must say. I feel extremely refreshed and awakened... no more pressure in my head, but I still feel like I&#39;m getting a full body massage. \u000a\u000aFeel fantastic, and no more soreness from the gym. Feel like a rock! A+ Strain from Garden of Eden in Hayward,Ca.

I happened to come across this same strain a few years ago and it staaaaank up the place. Took it on the city bus and I heard several people just say out loud &quot;something smells like weed&quot;. I can&#39;t stress enough how good this bus smells like. Be prepared to get some looks if you just have it sitting in your pocket.

VI went with this strain for a week to see how it would benefit me. \u000aHere is what I found. \u000a\u000aSmoking once a day in the morning, It gave me the same energy levels as drinking 2 cups of coffee would. Also combined with the energy was a very welcoming feeling of wanting to get things done (a perfect feeling going into the day). I felt these effects about one hour after smoking and they lasted for almost seven hours more.\u000a\u000aVery smooth smoke with an incredible lemon flavour.

VSuper Lemon Haze was the first strain that got me high, so I may sound biased. The euphoria was amazing. I felt like I was on clouds all night. I had energy, but wasn&#39;t bouncing off walls.

VHigh has an exceptional come on. It\u2019s so easy and stable, full of comfort and fresh, clear-headed positivity just bursting out your head. Vision is wide with a softly out-of-focus, fish-eyed perspective. It\u2019s like crazy wrap around vision, but you can only concentrate and focus on one narrow thing. It\u2019s pretty trippy. Sound is almost more hallucinatory. It overwhelms the senses and is a force of nature. Powerful. Cottonmouth gets bad quick, you can literally feel your mouth drying out. Mental state stays resiliently euphoric, full of genuine, heartfelt nostalgia. Very moving, but also fun! Socializing is oddly difficult. Words don\u2019t quite register and you\u2019re left struggling to keep up, which makes responding awkward. Better just watch or absorb stuff.

Come up was nearly fucking instantaneous (less than ten minutes). Currently high as a kite. Can barely type. I can\u2019t feel my toes, or my scalp. Waves of pressure up and down my body. Time dilation effects. Enormous head high. Words getting hard. Some arousal at around 45 minutes. Definitely lowered inhibitions, stress, etc.\u000a\u000aI did experience borderline paranoia, vertigo, and hallucinations. Dry mouth and itchy eyes.

VThis strain has a sweet, citrusy smell, that explodes when the buds are opened or ground.  Rich aroma of lemon, pine, eucalyptus, and a slight pleasant cattiness.  The smoke is very smooth with notes of citrus, and pine coming through.  The high comes on at a moderate pace, and is highly cerebral.  A tingly, tightness creeps like a halo across the scalp, and settles in behind the eyes, and sinuses.  A very happy, energetic high, with subtly body high.  In small amounts, the body high is barely perceptible.  Good productive strain, similar to Blue Dream in effect, and heritage, it is substantially more cerebral.  Great for social activities, e.g. video games, night out, etc.  Quite potent.

VThis strain has a sweet, citrusy smell, that explodes when the buds are opened or ground.  Rich aroma of lemon, pine, eucalyptus, and a slight pleasant cattiness.  The smoke is very smooth with notes of citrus, and pine coming through.  The high comes on at a moderate pace, and is highly cerebral.  A tingly, tightness creeps like a halo across the scalp, and settles in behind the eyes, and sinuses.  A very happy, energetic high, with subtly body high.  In small amounts, the body high is barely perceptible.  Good productive strain, similar to Blue Dream in effect, and heritage, it is substantially more cerebral.  Great for social activities, e.g. video games, night out, etc.  Quite potent.

VIt&#39;s not terrible. It&#39;s also not a typical weed feeling. For me i literally get no head high or body high from it. I just get very energized. Im using it in distillate form so it&#39;s very concentrated. It&#39;s good for smoking at work because it&#39;s not going to impair you mentally and it energizes and helps focus. It tastes like lemon pledge but in a good way. I love the lemon taste.

VI like this strain, I don&#39;t love it, I like it. This lifts your mind right for sure, but it is not without its drawbacks. The really stoney part only lasts like 15 minutes. I began feeling the awful and unwelcome return of sobriety after only 45 minutes. If you don&#39;t mind going back to the well often, this strain will do. No body effects though.

VFirst time I used a pipe. Tiny cute little thing. Strain is Super Lemon Haze (25.65% THC) from Rootworx and purchased from Dockside. Taste was mild and not unpleasant. Come up was nearly fucking instantaneous (less than ten minutes). Currently high as a kite. Can barely type. I can\u2019t feel my toes, or my scalp. Waves of pressure up and down my body. Time dilation effects. Enormous head high. Words getting hard. Some arousal at around 45 minutes.

VA great daytime choice!  I worked a roofing job and chose SLH to medicate with.  Not only was I wide awake working hard but I was extremely accurate, as well as strangely pleased to be working.  The limonene terp shows up very strong as suggested by its name.  It&#39;s easy to see why this strain is so adored and has been reviewed as many times as it has.  9/10

VHigh has an exceptional come on. It\u2019s so easy and stable, full of comfort and fresh, clear-headed positivity just bursting out your head. Vision is wide with a softly out-of-focus, fish-eyed perspective. It\u2019s like crazy wrap around vision, but you can only concentrate and focus on one narrow thing. It\u2019s pretty trippy. Sound is almost more hallucinatory. It overwhelms the senses and is a force of nature. Powerful. Cottonmouth gets bad quick, you can literally feel your mouth drying out. Mental state stays resiliently euphoric, full of genuine, heartfelt nostalgia. Very moving, but also fun! Socializing is oddly difficult. Words don\u2019t quite register and you\u2019re left struggling to keep up, which makes responding awkward. Better just watch or absorb stuff. For that alone as really the only discernible downside, I think it earns a 9/10.

VI finally found a strain that I can use PRN during the day that markedly improves my symptoms without sedating me. \u000a\u000aRoute use is vape. 600 mg cartridge 62.5% THC 1.67 mgs per three second inhale. \u000a\u000aI have only needed at most two doses four minutes apart  to alleviate my symptoms.

VSuper Tasty! This is the real Super Lemon Haze too. Some place have stuff that has the same name but is drastically different. The Super Lemon Haze has a great lemon flavor as its name suggest. the thick tasty smoke is smooth and pleasant as it expands the lungs. The flowers are dense light green and packed with crystals. The best part is that it is organic! As are all the Strains here.

VLucky to get have this strain back after a few weeks of testing different strains. Hands down this is my favourite smoke, you are placed in the most perfect bubble of bliss. You have the energy to take on the world with not a care in the world and no hindrance to your mind or body. You can just keep on smoking, lovely flavours of lemon pepper and earth. 10/10, all day every day.

Really does taste and smell like lemon when vaping, especially when the vapor hits the tip of the tongue. \u000aOther than that, I really didn&#39;t find this bud to be special for me.

VThis is a pretty bad ass strain. I got this in a Bloom Vape Disposable and I held back on smoking for maybe 3 weeks. Yesterday I decided I was all good and could smoke a bit you know. The first time I smoked this, I felt hella good. I felt like this probably kept me with a smile on my face the whole time I was high. Its a really good high, you feel calm but also aware and focused. I feel like it also just makes you a little more confident more social which is cool because this will come in handy if you\u2019re having some anxiety while going out. The lemon of it is sweet and just makes you pucker a little, like lemon heads! Totally recommend!

VSuper Lemon Haze is by far one of my favorite strain of all time and I say that as someone who prefers indica strains on average, as well as indica leaning hybrid strains. SLH&#39;s effects are like a strong cup of coffee, making me feel very focused. It is a great strain for the start of the day because it has very little sedative effects. I got an Oz of this strain for $120 at Diego Pellicer and it was well worth the green for green.\u000a      The flavors of SLH are amazing the flowery lemon taste I get when vaping at medium temperature through my PAX three is amazing. It really is a treat to vaporize, I highly recommend this strain for the flavor if you have a method of consumption where you can truly taste the boiling terpenes of this strain. The aromas of SLH have a potent citrus and lemon smell followed by a slight whiff of the skunky smell. I find the whole bouquet of smell and flavor to be very enjoyable.  \u000a      SLH&#39;s effects are great for starting the day, there is some very mild pain relief followed by an awareness and focus of having your first cup of coffee. The fact that this strain can get me up and moving while adding some notable, but not overwhelming, giving me the energy and ability to whatever I need to throughout the day.  I currently have what I like to call my &quot;Head High Halo&quot; this is always a good sign for sativa strains as the HHH usually means the strain is something truly special to consume. There is a good reason why Super Lemon Haze has attained such a renown status as a legendary sativa strain.

VThe name says it all!! SUPER-friggen-great sativa strain here that is my favorite to smoke during the day. The lemon aroma is intense and refreshing and tastes the same. The effects are typical sativa - no couch lock or desire to nap with a nice boost of motivation &amp; a chill, quasi euphoric head space. As with all bud: smoke enough and you&#39;ll get sleepy but good quality versions of this strain, in my experience, can be smoked throughout the day &amp; won&#39;t cause me to become sluggish (if nothing else just smelling the nugs is an energy booster, definitely top 5 personal favorite tasting buds!)

VTried the cannabis derived Super Lemon Haze terpenes for the first time. Typically with other strains, I would take 4 to 8 second draw from my pen. But with SLH, 2 second draw is all I need. The onset starts in the throat and eye area. I experience 15 minute of psychdelic-like effects before stabilizing. I felt focused, energetic and sometimes goofy for 2-3 hours. This cartridge will last me a long time.

VSuper lemon haze moxie live resin cart- quite Tasty like a lemon head not as sour. Great lemon on the exhale as well. Wow &#128559; so first I notice my headache &#129301; die down about half intensity with just one slow puff. I feel more relaxed.  I also feel mood uplifting and my mind state gets to a more chill Zone. \u000a.\u000a.\u000a.\u000aIt\u2019s wild how every strain affects everyone differently I wasn\u2019t sure how this one would work with my PTSD anxiety but I\u2019ve heard about 50-50 some people experience a lot of anxiety from some people get none. Very potent at %81.41 definitely give you a nice little cough when you take a deeper which I like I feel my body kind of loosen up I was feeling pretty stiff today and tired of giving my body a little bit of energy to relax my mind and giving me no anxiety in fact it\u2019s helping with my anxiety so yet again it\u2019s pretty crazy but it\u2019s true. I swear I have not had one product from Moxie that has not helped and worked for me unbelievable. \u000a.\u000a.\u000aSo I feel relaxed I feel my body is much more loose I feel like my body has more energy on top of that I feel my anxiety levels lower I also feel my mood elevate I feel slight mental energy and this is only two puffs. Maybe a little bit of paranoia to it like a slight bit of it but I feel like you can overcome it.

VAlright, this strain is bomb. The smell was a dominant lemon and citrus smell. It smelled fucking amazing and I could not wait to get to smoking it. Smoked it on my favorite bong. The taste was more earthy with hints of lemon, I appreciated that very much. Now the high was amazing, it was all head high. But what do you expect? It&#39;s a Sativa. When I was high off this strain, I could FEEL all the cells, particles, molecules and atoms floating around my head making a &quot;BZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&quot; feeling. It uplifted me to go do things and that was amazing. Folks, try Super Lemon Haze. I suggest you start here if you&#39;ve never smoked a Sativa before.

VOne of the best strains I smoked and my girlfriends favorite. Bought this strain from the Baguerra Coffeshop in Amsterdam and I have only positive things to say about it. Very energetic, we were walking all day with backpacks on, in sneakers in the snow , once i smoked this i stopped feeling the fatigue, the soreness in my feet, it gave us an instant positive vibe. Very racy, very powerfull, no munchies ( thats why the miss liked it), excelent smell and taste with obvious lemon aroma. This is definetly a strain to try!

VI&#39;ve been on the hunt for a good, strong haze. Something that stands out. Memorable. This strain is all that and then some. The smell is supremely complex lemony sweetness and the vapor really accentuates those flavors. \u000aThe high is sublime. A wave hits you and starts buzzing through your head giving you that happy/excited feeling. This is a strong one and you can take a few too many hits and get a little antsy. Perfect for daytime and makes everything fun. Definitely adding this to the house strain rotation.

It&#39;s tasting fairly smooth and has a sweet citrusy flavour.\u000a\u000aWell the effects are strong I&#39;m feeling good not feeling tired or lazy.  Definite boost in energy.  Let&#39;s see where this goes!\u000a\u000aA couple hours have passed and the effects are gone and I feel pretty good.  Definitely still relaxed and not too tired.  Though if I tried I&#39;m sure I could nap right now.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d recommend this as an almost anytime smoke.  Might not be the best right before bed but a few hours before should be fine.\u000a\u000aThis is great stuff but doesn&#39;t make the cut as a go-to Sativa for energy and motivation.  Definitely worth a try though.

VThe Slh I recently got from L&#39;Eagle Services under the name Super Lanny Lemon is in a word - kick ass. The taste is not a true Lemon Haze Lemony but really nice none the less.  The high however will slam you to the floor.  As a Sativa lover this one bakes the cookies for me.  Over the Top and recommended.  Also scope out some Durban Poison.  ns

VThis is a really nice strain. I was on the fence for a long time before I decided to try this one, but I really am glad that I did. Not only did it help with some of the pain, but it was actually a really nice tasting strain and for once, I can actually taste the flavour that the name implies or that is advertised! Right off the bat the smell is citrus dominant with the lemon standing out very prominently! Actually, as I keep smelling it now, it reminds me of a pitcher of lemonade or a strong smelling lemon iced tea, or iced tea drink powder mix. Quite addictive (For me anyways!)\u000a\u000aThe vape makes it taste real nice and the buds are covered in these orange hairs! They also gave me this one bud that is massive! It extends from almost one side of the container to the other! I do not know if that is a good thing or not. I am wondering if smaller buds are better than large or massive buds.\u000a\u000aThe effects are pleasant. I felt it hit me relatively hard, but in a good way, not in a stupid embarrass myself by yakking too much or laughing at nothing like a fool. I usually get the Indicas or Hybrids but this Sativa is actually quite nice and I don&#39;t get the sleepiness after about a couple hours, so for me that is a thing to get used to. I usually medicate at night when the kids are all in bed so Sativas are not my main choice, but this is one I will be getting again when the time comes.\u000a\u000aThe effects lasted for me about 2 hours to 2 1/2 Hrs. on 2 bowls. \u000a\u000aMy only fear is that I will go through this one a bit too fast! But the smell alone just reminds me of a summer day and a big pitcher of iced tea or lemonade!

VWhen it comes to flavor and aroma I&#39;d give this strain 6 stars if I could. The high on the other hand isn&#39;t as impressive. Don&#39;t get me wrong I like a clear headed high and feeling uplifted but I was hoping for a little bit more of a kick. Thats my opinion though, all my friends say it rocks their worlds... Give it a try I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy it.

VA lost shady contact who grew organic cannabis in their backyard supplied me with an ounce of Super Lemon Haze - but in reality, it was an ounce of weed that was completely wet, having very little curing time. However, I persisted that I would smoke it and nothing was going to stop my mouth from meeting the bong.\u000a\u000aThe buds were amazing looking. One thing I remember distinctly about it is that there were little golden yellow balls that were situated sparingly across the buds, giving it a fantastic look, with the rest of the weed looking an amazing green colour. This is the only strain that I can actually distinctly identify a smell, as I could actually smell the lemon and it was a very pleasant odour.\u000a\u000aThe high was probably one of my most memorable. I was doing a big exam for university late at night and brought along this ounce of weed. We rolled the ounce up into about two dozen joints and smoked a joint every 15 minutes. The high was so clear but it really knocks you down when you overdo it. The high was energetic and one of those &#39;I wonder what would happen if&#39; moods where you create silly scenarios, but the SLH would make you actually do it. \u000a\u000aMost likely my most memorable series of highs have come from this strain. Not the best high, but as far as tolerance goes over smoking an ounce, this was the best.

VI suffer from chronic fatigue (no pun intended).  There are very few strains that help me with this and Super Lemon Haze is one of them.   I feel alert when high, as if somebody turned the lights on.  After the high, and for most of the next day, I still feel alert, focused and energetic.  While high I felt very open minded intellectually and emotionally.  It was a nice light head high that left me very optimistic, affectionate, extremely empathetic, and competent in whatever I needed to do.  For me the high doesn&#39;t last very long.  I felt sexually passive,  but able to function fine.  Felt wonderfully in touch emotionally with the people I care about.

VI love Super Lemon Haze and have been loving it for at least two years to this day. Me and my friends picked up a 50 sack of SLH for $30 which was super cool, but that&#39;s way off-topic. In the bag we found TONS of seeds, and most of them are feminine, which if you&#39;re new to cannabis or growing is the seed that produces THCA, which is converted to THC when ignited, which produces the psychoactive high cannabis users know and love. This is going to be my first growing project and I&#39;m happy to have picked one of the best strains out there for my first harvest. SLH has some of the highest THC in a strain I&#39;ve seen in a while. SLH reaches THC percentages up to 23%, which is inherently high. (No pun intended!) I&#39;d put SLH at #4 in my top ten. I&#39;d definitely recommend this strain to anyone looking for a super active sativa high. Stay medicated, guys!

VThis strain was very well balanced. I had a very positive experience with this specific strain. The taste is only describable as dank lemons. No lie! This strain is also particularly light on your throat. I had a hella sore throat from a bad cold, and when I smoked a fat king sized RAW cone filled with beautiful nugs of this amazing kush, I didn&#39;t actually notice a disturbance in my disturbed throat. It&#39;s parents are really good strains as well. Lemon Kush and Super Silver Haze are definitely top 20 strains in my book. A mixed breed of the two? Damn.

You have the will to take on the world, with not a care in the world and no hindrance to your mind and body.

A very nice hit, not harsh at all. But like most just pack it tight for those who love it harsh. Great high, giggly and hungry is what I&#39;d describe it as. I prefer it in the morning personally.

VSome batches can be almost racey, but this has quickly become a personal favorite and considered great for early morning/all day smoking. The aroma is pungent and bright lemonheads candy. The flavor is similar, but very mellow while also a bit herbal and earthy. The buzz is very uplifting, energetic while not causing restlessness and nicely cerebral without getting too heavy. The stickier the flower the heavier the head buzz tends to be. Avoid using before bed, will likely cause restless sleep resembling sleep apnea.

The taste was more earthy with hints of lemon, I appreciated that very much. Now the high was amazing, it was all head high. But what do you expect? It&#39;s a Sativa. When I was high off this strain, I could FEEL all the cells, particles, molecules and atoms floating around my head making a &quot;BZZZZZZZZZZZZZ&quot; feeling. It uplifted me to go do things and that was amazing. Folks, try Super Lemon Haze. I suggest you start here if you&#39;ve never smoked a Sativa before.

Think Mathew McConaughey&#39;s character in Dallas buyers Club, meets Reese Witherspoon&#39;s character in Wild, at a Rodeo with edible Lemon condoms and a PEZ full of Viagra...Lemony tart good ness

VThis strain tastes amazing and is smooth going down. I don\u2019t really feel like I need to cough when I smoke this and it hits you very quickly. It doesn\u2019t make me hungry and I don\u2019t even feel like I need to eat on this strain. These are all amazing things! \u000a\u000aHowever, I suffer from occasional anxiety, and this strain seems to exacerbate these feelings. I will definitely try some higher CBD strains next.

VSo i chose this strain primarily for its lemony appeal which iv really enjoyed in strains like Jack the Ripper. Secondly slh had plenty of raving reviews of it being fire.\u000aGrown organically with the biocanna range along with a few gh additives i got two beautiful babies.\u000aAlthough they had no lemon smell or flavor, the buds smelt dank, fresh, earthy, sweet complex.\u000aThe high was up, awake and clear energetic and a bit more then slightly trippy.\u000aOne plant had huge nugs on slightly fewer sights, the other more of a wider bush with smaller nugs evenly distributed. Both were very sticky and had huge amounts of trichomes that in themselves were huge and easily distinguishable by the naked eye.\u000aThe high lasts for up to 2-3 hours. Is relaxing enough at night if consumed in sufficient quantities to get you deep knock out sleep. If your seeking energetic qualities a couple hits in the morning is plenty any more brings on a dreamy state where mental expansion brings about fits of creativity and an urge to undertake artistic endeavors. \u000aA notable strain, slightly dissapointed about the lack of lemon menthol which i found wicked in jtr but still very very happy non the less.

VThis strain has an interesting lemon-mint esque taste with notes of pine and citrus. The aftertaste seems personally  a little un-natural. The high is sativa leaning, sort of a lifted feeling in the back &amp; upper forehead. As usual a good extract from Botanico; just not a personal favorite.

VSuper Lemon Haze is by far one of my favorite strain of all time and I say that as someone who prefers indica strains on average, as well as indica leaning hybrid strains. SLH&#39;s effects are like a strong cup of coffee, making me feel very focused. It is a great strain for the start of the day because it has very little sedative effects. I got an Oz of this strain for $120 at Diego Pellicer and it was well worth the green for green.\u000a      The flavors of SLH are amazing the flowery lemon taste I get when vaping at medium temperature through my PAX three is amazing. It really is a treat to vaporize, I highly recommend this strain for the flavor if you have a method of consumption where you can truly taste the boiling terpenes of this strain. The aromas of SLH have a potent citrus and lemon smell followed by a slight whiff of the skunky smell. I find the whole bouquet of smell and flavor to be very enjoyable.  \u000a      SLH&#39;s effects are great for starting the day, there is some very mild pain relief followed by an awareness and focus of having your first cup of coffee. The fact that this strain can get me up and moving while adding some notable, but not overwhelming, giving me the energy and ability to whatever I need to throughout the day.  I currently have what I like to call my &quot;Head High Halo&quot; this is always a good sign for sativa strains as the HHH usually means the strain is something truly special to consume. There is a good reason why Super Lemon Haze has attained such a renown status as a legendary sativa strain.

It took my pain away and I feel clear headed and functional without feeling stoned(which I don&#39;t like during the day) it is definately more a head high than a body high, which I don&#39;t prefer as much but I cannot take a heavy indica strain like Afgani Og during the day and get anything done.\u000aPain relief quality 4/5\u000aalertness 4/5\u000afunctionality 4/5\u000ataste 4/5 \u000a* Note I use medicine daily but at a very low level so my Info is best for a beginner user or someone sensitive to psychoactive effects.

VI had been reading about this one for a bit so I bought some flower, a single gram, from Save Greens in Culver City today for 4/20. The stuff is absolute fire.  This is truly a Sativa lover\u2019s sativa! The smell when I grind the flower up is such sharp, lemon oil, almost like lemon acid, in the best possible way. Super Lemon Haze has the clear headed and energetic feel and also has amazing subtle, zesty flavor that never made me cough once through the whole joint, all citrus oil with no gas flavor here, really pleasant.  I would honestly rate this one close to perfect. No couch lock but you can chill, I just felt my stomach talking to me so I\u2019m about to smash some food here. I\u2019m going to buy the newest Jetty Extract Pax Era pod in Super Lemon Haze and review it next.

VWashington State should be damned please that this incredible stain hails from there, with just a bit of Qu&#233;bec in her as Haze the original comes from here.\u000a\u000aThis is one Limonene terpene rich strain that I recognize from its parental strains of Lemon Skunk x Super Silver Haze a match made in CannabisGodsLand.  She is a mighty wonderfully long lasting high like few strain mixes that I have known in the nearly 48 years of Cannabis use.\u000a\u000aShe is an 80% Sativa dominant strain with 20%Indica.

Wow &#128559; so first I notice my headache &#129301; die down about half intensity with just one slow puff. I feel more relaxed.  I also feel mood uplifting and my mind state gets to a more chill Zone. \u000a.\u000a.\u000a.\u000aIt\u2019s wild how every strain affects everyone differently I wasn\u2019t sure how this one would work with my PTSD anxiety but I\u2019ve heard about 50-50 some people experience a lot of anxiety from some people get none. Very potent at %81.41 definitely give you a nice little cough when you take a deeper which I like I feel my body kind of loosen up I was feeling pretty stiff today and tired of giving my body a little bit of energy to relax my mind and giving me no anxiety in fact it\u2019s helping with my anxiety so yet again it\u2019s pretty crazy but it\u2019s true. I swear I have not had one product from Moxie that has not helped and worked for me unbelievable. \u000a.\u000a.\u000aSo I feel relaxed I feel my body is much more loose I feel like my body has more energy on top of that I feel my anxiety levels lower I also feel my mood elevate I feel slight mental energy and this is only two puffs. Maybe a little bit of paranoia to it like a slight bit of it but I feel like you can overcome it.

VTried the cannabis derived Super Lemon Haze terpenes for the first time. Typically with other strains, I would take 4 to 8 second draw from my pen. But with SLH, 2 second draw is all I need. The onset starts in the throat and eye area. I experience 15 minute of psychdelic-like effects before stabilizing. I felt focused, energetic and sometimes goofy for 2-3 hours. This cartridge will last me a long time.

VGreat day-time med. This is my favorite tasting strain yet. super silver was one of the first &quot;new meds&quot; I tried as a new patient. Loved it.

VAs a relatively inexperienced smoker who uses cannabis medicinally for anxiety and migraines, I have to say that this strain definitely did relieve anxiety for me personally. It&#39;s a very strong strain, and I found that the high started off slower and then really hit me! \u000a\u000aAs far as the effects, very happy, uplifting high. A little goes a L-O-N-G way for daytime use. I am a working professional, so this is something that I can use after-hours to get some work done or on the weekends when I don&#39;t have my usual obligations.  For taking the edge off anxiety during the daytime, I would recommend something lower THC-HIGH CBD.\u000a\u000aA really uplifting, happy sativa.  My favourite strain of reefer thus far :)

VSuper Lemon Haze is a must try for a daily smoker who doesn&#39;t like the dumbing down feeling a lot of strains can leave you with. After a slight delay it kicks in with a buzzy head rush that will remind you of mellower version of its cousin Super Silver Haze. The flavor is nice and citrusy just like the title suggests, smooth and mild.

VA proper Sativa strain; gives a good head-high. You feel the raise after even a small amount. Hits you quite fast and makes you happy and dazed. Had little paranoia and didn&#39;t feel any problems like twitching. I would recommend it for everyday users as it&#39;s easy to control whilst you&#39;re high, and simply gets you feeling good. I slept afterwards so i&#39;m not sure about the come-down, but it puts you right to bed.\u000a\u000a(Smoked by Joint W/ no tobacco)

VAn enjoyable sativa. The buds in my sample ranged from light green to slightly dark green with brown pistols, and a nice layer of frost. The flower was a little leafy I&#39;m thinking the trim was rushed a little to meet production needs as the dispensary was processing several grows worth of product at once. I experienced a flowery scent with a subtle hint of citrus. The flavor I got from vaping SLH can best be described as a yellow skittle or the end of a lemon head candy; sweet, citrusy, lemony. Cerebral high that gets me thinking and has me focused. Smoking strains like this helps me write reviews. Nausea was eliminated with hunger usually ensuing. Good strain. Its what you&#39;d expect from a good sativa and from its genetics. Recommend to nausea sufferers who still need to focus/think/be creative.

VI&#39;m a Depression and Anxiety patient who had this Sativa Dominant hybrid suggested to me as it was the only strain within my doctor imposed THC limit of 15mg that was available for my condition. At $9 a gram, I was expecting a lot and it delivered on the mostpart.\u000a\u000aWhen opening the packaging, you instantly get the sour scent blasting out pretty quickly, The nugs were well trimmed and intact. The trichomes very visible and buds were sticky, not too crispy when breaking meaning i didn&#39;t have too many crumbs to deal with.\u000a\u000aI loaded .5g into my vape and found it responded to the lower temperatures quite well which gave me a good 6 mins of vaping. Flavour was quite sour and the effects lasted around 50 mins. Made me feel calm, not too lazy allowing me to perform day to day tasks. I found that the strain dried my mouth out pretty badly though compared to others i&#39;ve had.\u000a\u000aAfter a few days with it, i&#39;m confident this will allow me to regain some of my life that had gone due to anxiety and depression. It&#39;s allowing me the freedom to do what i want to again.

VReally pretty, bright, fuzzy looking nugs which are not overly hairy.  A hint of citrus is what I get on fresh grind.  Maybe not as lemony as expected.\u000a\u000aReally great, thick vapor is coming out of the Volcano.  It&#39;s tasting fairly smooth and has a sweet citrusy flavour.\u000a\u000aWell the effects are strong I&#39;m feeling good not feeling tired or lazy.  Definite boost in energy.  Let&#39;s see where this goes!\u000a\u000aA couple hours have passed and the effects are gone and I feel pretty good.  Definitely still relaxed and not too tired.  Though if I tried I&#39;m sure I could nap right now.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d recommend this as an almost anytime smoke.  Might not be the best right before bed but a few hours before should be fine.\u000a\u000aThis is great stuff but doesn&#39;t make the cut as a go-to Sativa for energy and motivation.  Definitely worth a try though.

VI&#39;ve been on the hunt for a good, strong haze. Something that stands out. Memorable. This strain is all that and then some. The smell is supremely complex lemony sweetness and the vapor really accentuates those flavors. \u000aThe high is sublime. A wave hits you and starts buzzing through your head giving you that happy/excited feeling. This is a strong one and you can take a few too many hits and get a little antsy. Perfect for daytime and makes everything fun. Definitely adding this to the house strain rotation.

VOne of the best strains I smoked and my girlfriends favorite. Bought this strain from the Baguerra Coffeshop in Amsterdam and I have only positive things to say about it. Very energetic, we were walking all day with backpacks on, in sneakers in the snow , once i smoked this i stopped feeling the fatigue, the soreness in my feet, it gave us an instant positive vibe. Very racy, very powerfull, no munchies ( thats why the miss liked it), excelent smell and taste with obvious lemon aroma. This is definetly a strain to try!

VThe name says it all!! SUPER-friggen-great sativa strain here that is my favorite to smoke during the day. The lemon aroma is intense and refreshing and tastes the same. The effects are typical sativa - no couch lock or desire to nap with a nice boost of motivation &amp; a chill, quasi euphoric head space. As with all bud: smoke enough and you&#39;ll get sleepy but good quality versions of this strain, in my experience, can be smoked throughout the day &amp; won&#39;t cause me to become sluggish (if nothing else just smelling the nugs is an energy booster, definitely top 5 personal favorite tasting buds!)

VMy favorite Sativa hands down!  This strain grown by Root Down of Spokane is always beautiful, stoney, and anxiety free.  Great for those days where you want to be productive, but still wanna take the edge off.  A nice hint of lemon and a pleasant bit of &quot;Earthy&quot;.  Sometimes &quot;earthy&quot; can be a pc way of saying &quot;musty&quot;, but not this strain!  Tasty and smooth, no off flavors.

Vsmells unreal, tasted like grilled lemon in my vapor. Very strong high...was awesome socializing. Shit was so funny! i felt very happy, and uplifted with many creative thoughts. Excellent head high, and a gentle body buzz that made my arms and legs feel like they were made with cotton wool. i didn&#39;t get much in the way of pain relief but was an excellent way to rid my stressful thoughts

VI smoked about 3/4 of a pre-rolled joint that came recommended by my local shop. the high was incredible to my senses, what I mean by that is it felt as if all my senses were hightened. lights were brighter, smell and tatste were affected, and I could isolate all sounds as if they were layered on top of one another. great high, but really intense, if you are the paranoid type you may not like this high.

But the buzz was mostly pleasant after a tiny bit of racing heart one or twice which seems to dissipate quickly. Like the way it keeps you high a while and that it will allow your body to relax enough to sleep.

VThis is a pretty bad ass strain. I got this in a Bloom Vape Disposable and I held back on smoking for maybe 3 weeks. Yesterday I decided I was all good and could smoke a bit you know. The first time I smoked this, I felt hella good. I felt like this probably kept me with a smile on my face the whole time I was high. Its a really good high, you feel calm but also aware and focused. I feel like it also just makes you a little more confident more social which is cool because this will come in handy if you\u2019re having some anxiety while going out. The lemon of it is sweet and just makes you pucker a little, like lemon heads! Totally recommend!

The Super Lemon Haze has a great lemon flavor as its name suggest. the thick tasty smoke is smooth and pleasant as it expands the lungs. The flowers are dense light green and packed with crystals. The best part is that it is organic! As are all the Strains here.

VWhile I like the effects from this strain, I had a hard time getting past the flavor. I didn&#39;t get any of the sweetness of citrus that people say it is supposed to have. It tasted kinda like sour milk, to me. I found the flavor more tolerable if I mixed it with another strain

VI bought it at a dispensary in Detroit. It smells EXACTLY like lemons and the smoke is extremely smooth. It tastes amazing but as soon as I took a hit my gums and mouth started going numb, exact same feeling you get when you rub cocaine on your gums which I did not like. I felt very tingly and eroused (which I did like lol) Definitely a Sativa strain but I was confused as hell, anxious, and disoriented, along with very slow reaction times. It was hard for me to type on my phone. Major paranoia for sure which I do not like and is the reason I gave it a 3 out of 5.  It would be a great strain for someone that likes strong Sativas though and would definitely say it&#39;s for more experienced smokers.

VLet&#39;s talk about the taste first. Smoking will leave a slight lemony taste upon exhalation, which adds nicely to a smooth smoke experience - a generic bong with ice is a beautiful thing. Vaping this is an entirely other level - like turning a lemon drop into vapor. The effects are smooth, upbeat, cerebral and very positive. Unlike the initial description, I never found it gave an abundance of energy - just enough. Worth every penny - my favorite sativa.

VAmazing strain looks and tastes great like all my favorites it&#39;s a frosty dense bud. For me it&#39;s a great daytime, outdoors strain perfect for exploring a new trail or hiking to the top of the mountain by my house. It tastes really lemony I had a friend that said he could never taste the flavors that were supposed to be in different buds well I had him try this one and even he could taste the lemon flavor. So to me this is an excellent strain unless you want to get to sleep if that&#39;s the case it might take awhile.

VSuper Lemon Haze could be the dopest dope I&#39;ve ever smoked. While the smoke itself is lemony, the taste is truly remarkable when vaporized at threshold temperatures (185C - 190C). It is certainly a daytime strain and should be treated with some caution to those who are not Sativa-oriented. For a Sativa lover, however, this is a staple strain in a healthy diet. Its effects are both euphoric and energizing.  In a few words I&#39;d describe it as a functional stimulant.

VI just purchased SLH today 4/26 and WOW! Very nice lemony taste that lingers for awhile. After a couple of hammers and 3 hits from a joint I can barely type. What a head high, I paused because I forgot how to spell high, that&#39;s how good SLH is. The SLH was purchased at Compassionate Sciences (Bellmawr, NJ) and like every other strain they dispense is absolutely fantastic. The THCA is 17.64% and CBGA 1.5%. I just re-lit the joint and it holds its mild lemon flavor and a big head rush upon exhale. If you have a chance to try this strain do not hesitate Super Lemon Haze is a winner. Looking forward to trying some in my Volcano.

VI was warned that this strain would make me tingly and happy, but I thought it was just the usual up-sell talk. Not so. This bud made me giggly, which is extremely rare, and I had goosebumps after a few bowls out of the vaporizer. My only complaint is that it didn&#39;t help much with migraines or severe fibromyalgia pain, but staying happy is half the battle, so I love this strain.

Perfect if you don&#39;t want to be put out like an indica, or like me get anxiety from the high energy in some sativas, but really recommended to all. Taste and smell will be top notch if grown and cured properly.

VI was hoping for an uplifting and bright way to kick back a hefty afternoon wave of nausea with this one. It just missed the mark for me. My nausea was probably an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, so I didn&#39;t expect that to be completely eradicated. It didn&#39;t really touch it though. It also left me with a mild headache and a slightly jittery feeling. This one works for just about everybody else I&#39;ve ever talked to, so my experience is likely the exception to the rule

VThis was an amazing strain. The hit happened pretty quickly and lasted for a very long time. The smell of the bud was extremely citrus-like and and fresh. It&#39;s appearance with long fuzzy hairs and tightly pack nugs with the trichromes sprinkled on top. The way i tried it was with a bubbler. It burned slow and it&#39;s aroma spread across the room as the taste of lemon filled my mouth. By the time I got done I was already feeling the effects. It was extremely heady and shared a powerful sativa effect. You get extremely giggly and relaxed. Great for anxiety, stress, and headaches.

VI hit this strain one time and within 30 seconds was already stoned. Unfortunately, I have anxiety as is and this strain sky rocketed it. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for anxiety relief, but it&#39;s potency is relatively unmatched if you&#39;re looking for relief from other medical concerns.\u000a

VI liked the smell and flavor was nice like lemon peels. the stuff I got was fluffy and sticky with lots of long hairs and hit pretty hard when freshly ground and smoked pipe or bong. while I would recommend it the high seemed short lived which is why its a 4/5

VI absolutely loved this stuff! I got it rolled in a blunt from a Washington dispensary and it definitely earned it&#39;s name! it&#39;s as sativa as they come, but with a bit more of a body high than you&#39;d expect from say, something like blue dream or another sativa dominant. super lemony in smell and the inhale, omg, it was like sweet lemon candy! I&#39;m definitely picky when it comes to flavor, and though I don&#39;t like citrus much, this stuff was great. no creep, you know what your in for right away! I would definitely smoke this again.

VA euphoric taste, like someone sipping from a top shelf quality vodka bottle. It was my first time smoking using an oil cartridge. The lemony taste was too eerily similar to the actual lemon that you can&#39;t even distinguish which is which. I only had two long puffs from it. My dealer was kind enough to let me try, and I felt like I was crossing something off my list of things to do. It was great. I was told the effect would last an entire night from those two puffs. I look forward to enjoying my introvert self, while watching South Park and maybe some Fight Club afterwards. \u000a\u000aMust get my hands on these!

VI got this as a free pre roll for being ftp, I usually smoke Indica but the review on this strain was good so I tryed it and regret it. Instead emptying out my pre roll and loading it like I usually do I smoked it as a whole, let me tell u, it taste like my pre roll was soaking in pine sol for 3days, to me it left a weird chemical taste in my mouth. The high was pretty good but didn&#39;t last long, I also found myself depressed on this strain it made me think way to much and not really relax. I judge all my meds by taste and high, and this for me isn&#39;t my style.........

VLove at first smoke.  I felt energetic, uplifted and happy.  I was overall good. The flower smell was combo of citrus and sweet.   I was feeling and loving the head high and floatiness because it&#39;s not too overwhelming.  No real munchies with Super Lemon Haze.  I suggest this strain if you need to get your head right.

VThe buds are beautiful, thick and lightly sticky. It has a deep woodsy aroma. And the high is incredible. Started lightly at first then hit pretty hard. Little goes a long way. I also felt very creative and organized in regular things I would do. I don&#39;t mind taking a little longer to do something when my mind is so wavy. My only negative is it made me very paranoid.

You may talk a lot more than normal as well. SLH burns slow with no coughing so I enjoy it a lot. No harsh after taste or throat irritation either.

VBy far one of my favorite Sativa strains. Like most weed, depending on the manufacturer it&#39;ll change what quality you get. Most strains are good but if you can possibly grab some Seatown Lemon Haze from Western Cultured. One puff of this guy and I felt like I was flying, incredible mental buzz that lasted at peak for about an hour and a half with a slow decline. I&#39;m also a daily user if that matters.

I&#39;ve convinced myself through trial and error that i fit the hybrid-strain demographic. Sativas allow me to maintain conversations but I&#39;m missing the&quot;high&quot; feeling.

VIt starts with a sweet flavor. It&#39;s also really smooth. I ripped it a few times, but didn&#39;t cough or anything. It kicks in pretty quick too. I sat down and got really relaxed. After standing up, I get a little light headed, but nothing too bad. When I laid down, I fell asleep pretty easy. I was pretty tired, so I don&#39;t know how much it actually helped. Once I woke up, my mouth was drier than usual. A quick trip to the fridge for a cup of water fixes that no problem though.

VSo this is a pre-roll we grabbed since we&#39;d read numerous good reviews and wanted to give her a shot.  We expected more for the taste but both the Mrs and I noted the lack thereof.  It was damn near tasteless when was a bit disappointing.  The aroma was lacking as well...nothing like the Lemon Kush my guitar buddy grabbed...that stuff permeated the house!  Both the wife and I are indica fans and tend to gravitate towards those strains, but occasionally we&#39;ll grab some sativa or a nice hybrid just to mix it up.  Now even though we were disappointed with the taste and aroma, the effects were a totally different matter.  Total euphoria...with an excellent mix of both head high and body buzz.  It just hit that exact sweet spot of the type of effects we enjoy.  We will try this again but grab an eighth instead of a pre-roll to see if it has the taste and smell I expect it normally does.  I&#39;d say it is a 3.5 for now all things considered but it could easily be a 5-star rating for us if my suspicions are correct.

VBuzzy cerebral sativa high, but very very short-lasting, 20-30 minutes tops. Had to keep smoking bowls to get my usual high. After the third (where I normally only need one) the high finally lasted, this time more of an indica body high eventually melting into couchlock and brain fuzz.\u000a\u000aTaste and smell are amazing though, just as described:: &quot;As the name states this strain has real lemony characteristics. The smell is zesty, citrusy, and a little sweet. As for the taste, it&#39;s everything one would expect from the namesake; tart and sweet like lemonheads candy - not quite as sharp as one might expect.&quot;

V(.5g) ID grown\u000a\u000aFirst off, the nug I got was absolutely rock hard, dense, and felt almost as frustrating as peeling an orange that is not ripe by hand. Very hard to break apart...I didn&#39;t see too many crystals, but I think it may have just been the way it was grown...More about this later.\u000a\u000aThe first time I tried this strain was with alot of salad bowls, and I distinctly remember getting a headache that got worse after every hit, which I just associated to the wrong combination of herb. Even after a second time of testing SLH alone later in the week, the high felt very dull,  &quot;muddled&quot; and pretty underwhelming.   Especially with the consistent headache that followed every snap.\u000a\u000aI am assuming I may have a &quot;strain allergy&quot; to SLH, or it was not grown/processed properly but unless I can try this from another source in the future to confirm, I will make sure to avoid this one.

Whatever goes in my head becomes more focused and if I am are wanting to get things done but just can&#39;t get to it then this would help. Made me content but still on the serious mode. Made me numb to the pain but just for pain relief this is not the best strain.

Suggest something spicy/salt to complement the fruity tones. Chips and salsa is good. As for a drink, try a Cream Soda; it just brings everything together.\u000aPain was reduced dramatically, as well as muscle tightness, upset stomach, and soreness (yemv...)

VVery powerful, but didn&#39;t liked it too much. My body was all vibrating, i was locked to the couch and after 30 mins i started to have double sight and  an heavy balance loss. Got a bit of anxiety but after i felt every muscle and every cell of my brain relaxed. after 1 hour i was in an extremely peaceful mood. \u000aRating: 6.5\u000aRaccomanded? Yes ( for &quot;couchlock&quot; users)\u000a

VSuper Lemon Haze when grew buy top notch growers is not a chill strain like this site is saying. All most like eating magic mushrooms or LSD Causes paranoia and all most a transcendental experience. Would not smoke if your a novice or beginner smoker. This is a very strong/crazy strain very impressed :) lol Good luck with this stuff. _Boots_

VI thought I was alone in my feelings due to rave reviews! I was shocked, I love Sativa dominate strains or Hyrid some of my faves being Blue Dream, Train Wreck, Blue Cheese is nice for mainly Indica.. I did not find this to make me happy like &quot;silly social weed&quot; it is more of a energy. I think this could help people get off stimulant drugs for sure! My opinion. I would NOT recommend to do at night or alone. I was in the bed sick for 6 days feeling mentally not myself, got dehydrated, caused vomiting..Ironic another female friend noticed the same thing but the men seem to love and upon research it is mostly females that experience the negative effects, for me it was horrible worsening my anxiety, educed unpleasant euphoria, vomiting, too much energy, lacked the silly social feeling.. I would love to know if anyone else has been through this? My recommendation is: best for regular, long time users not anyone new at marijuana, is not for anyone wanting to relax or sleep (morning use only) however if you have an event like a concert, Nascar race, active job, low energy you will probably love...also ladies be warned we tend to be more sensitive.. I found it horrible for anxiety/stress/ptsd/nausea/triggered my migraines however others may be different...I was so excited and just knew I would love it, but our bodies are different as we are all different and like 1 person can take a med or food but another can&#39;t, I would say this Super Lemon Haze is the case..love it or hate it! I will go without until I can get something else..

Vnot even close to super lemon haze. I grew this strain about 5 years ago, and this doesn&#39;t even hold a candle to what I grew. Didn&#39;t taste like lemon at all to me. what I had would leave your whole house smelling like lemons after one bowl. They should change the name of it.

VA very popular strain, Great bag appeal. I don&#39;t care for it, as an experienced patient I didn&#39;t experience paranoia or anxiety although I see how this strain can take you there. Munchie alert, eye drops and water.\u000aServicable smoke, nothing special. IMHO
