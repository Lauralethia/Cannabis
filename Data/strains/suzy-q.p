VGreat CBD. Don&#39;t look to get high with this one though. \u000aA good hit is like taking 1200mg of ibuprofen. \u000aFantastic strain. \u000aThanks for producing this. Wish I could find seeds. \u000a~J\u000a

VFlower I bought had no THC in it. Only thing that helped my shoulder pain. Was able to use it and work, with no head high or fuzziness. I also really enjoy the flavor and smell of this strain (used in a vaporizer).

VI have been looking for a bud that I could use during the day to keep my back pain in check and I found it with Suzy Q. I got almost no &quot;high&quot; from it but did feel like I had cotton stuffed in my ears and that was about all. I am thrilled to have such a high CBD strain in my medicine chest.

VA pleasant, pain-relieving strain with a very high CBD to THC ratio. I get the most out of this one when combined with a little of a &quot;happy&quot; sativa (daytime) or a sleepy indica (evening). Ironically for a pain-relieving strain, it does tend to give me a headache.

VDid not like this strain. I have Fibromyalgia and have been searching for a faster action alternative for pain management then CBD oil and all the opiates and OTC meds I was on. I should preface by saying I dislike/disliked smoking Pot in general (never worked for me always flipped me out) which is why it&#39;s taken me so long to try this). This was the first strain my local shop suggested. Did not like. First, the throat hit was awful I was coughing and had a sore throat after a hit. Also, smelled so much and burned way to quickly. In regards to feeling, I had crazy munchies and was nodding off which was super unfortunate. The come down was also not my favorite, while it took pain away, afterwards I felt my inflammation was worse and had a crazy headache. Would not recommend

V\u000a\u000a\u000aVery good strain. Has more of a honey/sweet and flowery smell and taste I found. Very mellow and smooth. While it has a little bit too much THC for my likings, I enjoyed the high. Unexpectedly sleepy, but mostly very relaxed, while also being a clear headed buzz.

VRight off the bat, I did not have flower or concentrate of this strain directly. HOWEVER, I have tried terps derived from it, that were then added to CBD isolate. It has a beautiful vanilla almond butter smell, and leaves a creamy almond and slightly citrus/cherry aftertaste. In the form that I have, it is not going to produce a psychoactive high, but will give a slight euphoria in the forehead. It does boost energy and focus, as well as relieving some pain. It works best in addition to other cannabinoids, whether concentrated or over flower.

VPleasantly surprised how effective this strain was. High CBD with 1% THC is nice for that clear head, but still has the effectiveness to cut pain and deliver focus. Additionally, you feel happy and relaxed as you go about your day. Thanks Leafwerx
