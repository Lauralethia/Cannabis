VI am writing this review, baked as heck, and I have to admit that this is the best flavor profile I have ever smoked in regards to fruit/citrus.  \u000a\u000a Upon opening the package you are struck with an aroma, that is a cross between fruit cocktail and oddly enough floral sweet.\u000a\u000aI purchased my green as a 1g flower, and smoked 2 bowls, between which I also washed a load of dishes.\u000a\u000aUpon smoking ( I use a 6&quot; glass pipe), I first noticed the aroma again, pungent citrus and sticky sweet flavors. The taste was similar: Strong citrus and fruit cocktail sweet. During exhale it tasted strongly of almost a pineapple. \u000a\u000aEffects wise: This is a very heavy hitter, it takes a couple of minutes to catch up to you, as you smoke, so watch how much you partake in. Very Euphoric, uplifting, stress relieving, relaxed, calm, at ease. On the other side you feel very stoned classically (unable to move), Tired, slightly paranoid, dry eyes, dry mouth, and dizzy.\u000a\u000aI still rate this as a 5 star, one if the best highs I have had in over a decade! {Lol I really have only been smoking for like 1 year haha. I was just discharged from the military &#128514;&#128526;&#127482;&#127480;). Either way, this is great stuff, it smells wonderful, and the high is very  cerebral. \u000a\u000aHave a good night!

VGreat burst of energy with no anxiety. Really helps with brain fog, fatigue, and aphasia, and makes me feel optimistic and productive. Nice relief from nerve pain and muscle cramps/spasms as well. Some cottonmouth and dry eyes, but not as bad as other strains. Gets less energizing and more calming in higher doses, but still no couch lock. The only downside is it doesn&#39;t do much for my arthritis, but overall it&#39;s a great daytime strain for me.

VDouble Tangie Banana is a great strain. I would of gave it 5 stars but isn&#39;t as potent as I would like. Very, very, very, tasty!!! Tons of great terpenes upon smoking. Has a great fruity smell and taste reminiscent of the name. Tangerines &amp; Bananas!! Great electric greens color with nice yellow to Orange hairs &amp; tons of crystally trichomes. Great Sativa Dominant Hybrid. Very good for daytime and morning use. Very mellow high, very mellow on your lungs!!! Can take a big hit and no coughing. Great overall strain. Would buy again if THC% is higher.

VAt first it was ok, I vaped it on 400.  All of a sudden  my vaping intuition kicked in and I thought to increase the heat to 415.  That made the diff let me tell u! After the heat adjustment I can say this strain lacked in the flavor department but the high was pretty damn good. 3.5 stars.  I probably wouldnt buy it again just because theres better out.  Buy a little and try it for yourself but dont pick it over your go-to strain, you may be disappointed.  Well, I kind of think it may be better combusted....ill try it and write a review.  Get the best out of your bud people ;) work the weed dont let it work you!

VI give this strain 4 stars. I was so surprised when I saw this, and smelled it. It has a very strong odor like cat piss. The high I would say is ok. Not a amazing buddy buzz or strong sativa feeling. Good for the afternoons.

VGuise. This is a must have, must try. if you can&#39;t get down with this, then idk wtf you&#39;re doing with your life. Dtb is starts with a sweet burn as you inhale, and a nice citrus and earthy taste on exhale that leaves the deliciously sweet taste in your lips. the high hit me almost immediately, but it was a  &quot;creeping&quot; type of high starting in the toes.  It was a uplifting, euphoric and it didn&#39;t leave me feeling fuzzy the next day lile most sativa dom. strains do. 11/10 Would recommend.

VThis strain from Lifted was found in Yakima at Sweet Relief yesterday.  It was a pre-roll and very cured. The effect was very heady when it took affect. Lifted does a good job and Sweet Relief is a good place to get a great variety of canna-goodness.

VLet me say I&#39;m reviewing the Banana Sherbet X Double Tangie. I obtained a gram of accidentally marked down from 65 at dispensary to 35 oops. It is live resin, I generally smoke rosin for concentrates, but have been curious to try it out THC was 4.39% THCA 83.67% CBD 0% CBDA 4.89% it came loaded. The terp profile is top notch delicious. A new top ten for me on strains Soaring creative high helped with IBS also helped destress and PAIN. I&#39;m now on the hunt for some Banana Split Rosin. Very medicinal, creative good for any time day or night. Great HIGHLY recommended

Great for sleep, physical pain.\u000a\u000aWhen vaped, it felt much clearer. I felt  perceptive, relaxed, wound down. Strong strain.

VWhen this one came in to my shop, my co-worker said it smelled like the produce section of a grocers, and insisted I bring some home one day. \u000a\u000aI regret nothing. It is an idiotic terpene Powerhouse. There&#39;s so much going on in here it&#39;s really hard to pick out individuals. The namesake Tangie and banana come through via the citrus and sweetness, but there is definitely more than that going on here. Fresh fruits chopped vegetables\u000a\u000aThis particular batch was only about 15% THC, but was just so much fun to smoke and had such a fantastically positive terp profile but that I would definitely recommend to flavor enthusiasts and those just looking for a good, tasty, chill smoke.

VSticky, dense, FRAGRANT buds. Bubblegum, ice cream, bananas. Less suffering from the headache i get that is related to my brain tumor and surgery, less pain even. Really clear, uplifted feeling. I was in a funk before I smoked and I can feel myself pulling out of it. Feeling like I&#39;m seeing everything for the first time. I imagine this would be an excellent strain to take to the woods.

VAmazing terpene profile that lives up to the name. Beautiful nugs, frosty, light green tightly packed and airy. The smell is of fruity citrus, same with the smoke, so tasty you can\u2019t help but french inhale time and again. The high is cerebral and heady, but clear and uplifted (great for depression) A slight body buzz at first that gets heavier over time. All around good smoke
