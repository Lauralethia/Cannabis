VAmazing creativity with this strain! Thoughts rushing through, and very amusing ones, but my mind hops around from one train of thought to the next too quickly. Still, I get my mind opened up to new thoughts I wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. Being a writer, this is helpful. I get giggly and euphoric, completely blissed out, and end up sleeping hard and pleasantly. This strain has been wonderful for relieving depression and emotional fatigue. I have frequent seizures and Headband has done a lot to help me cope with the emotional strain of being sick.

VThis strain is very unique! After 1 bowl of 707 from Silver Sage Wellness, I was very perky and needed a project to do! lol! Silver Sage Wellness has their strain tested at 25% THC and 0.13 CBD. I have noticed that sativa and sativa dominate hybrids strains that have a little extra CBD in them makes a great product for people with anxiety and stress enjoy a more uplifting experince. At least the ones I have tried. Strains under 2% CBD.\u000a\u000aWonderfully uplifting and happy mood almost immediately. Nice head change that did not come hard and fast but you know when you get there. My favorite part was the initial body and head change lasted for over an hour. that it wore off after another 3 hours. (I was on an empty stomach the whole time)  Very pleased. \u000aI would recommend this strain for people that have a home project they want to do. I was able to stay focused and on task. \u000aI don&#39;t believe in bad Strains. You just need to find the one that is right for you.

VSlow hitting strain but once its there, touchdown. Lower half of forehead has a cold band creep across it about a half hour after smoking and that&#39;s when you know Headband has come to play. Very cerebral but body driven high. Very sensitive touch and taste but youll be too focused on how much fun it is being high that you won&#39;t really care.

Vi thought this strain was master kush x og kush x sour diesel?   well nonetheless, this strain is great. but i came up on a rare gem today. its a strain called &quot;3 KINGS&quot;. it s tri-brid. its genetics are og kush x sour diesel x headband. it has the pale green sour diesel look, but it had dense OG looking buds. it is rich in amber trichome and very sticky. it totally looks like yomixed the 3 stains together. its got a very pungeant scent. upon opening my jar, it has a sour chemical diesel smell. but when i put my nose to it, i smelledf OG. the chemical smell i think is the headband. it smells toxic sour diesel. its effects are very sedating. i smoked a bowl in my car, and i fell into a deep stare at my ipod and felt slow. it was mind numbing. it took away my back pain andgave me the mean munchies. i suggest 3 kings to anyone who loves headband, 707 headband, or sour diesel. its a 10

VDefinitely worth getting for medicinal purposes or just for fun. Just got a quarter today and my head is spinning now. Honestly please take everyone&#39;s advice, I myself am a very experienced smoker and this has me blown away right now. About 3/4s of a g and I can barley type.I smoke around 3 gs a day to keep my epilesy under control so that says somthing. Having major epilepsy, manic bi-polar 1, and a major anxiety disorder I can say this is a very good strain to relax and forget all the crap that comes with my illness.

VPurchased a strain called Purple Headband but since I can&#39;t find that one listed here I&#39;ll review it as 707 since the effects,taste and odor are all close to the ones discribed here. This was a very delicate earthy taste with a mild pungent odor. The effects were very pleasing as it kicked in quickly and lasted r about 3 hours. I was very laid back, no make that peeled backed and relaxed but wasn&#39;t sleepy. In fact it made me want to play guitar and do some writing. After about 1 1/2 hours I started feeling very horny. Really enjoyed this and look forward to trying it again. Some of the best I&#39;ve had in a while.

VBeen wanting to try headband, and opted for the 707. Overall it was real nice mellow smoke. I use it for anxiety and it definitely helped. It did make me a little tired and took a little catnap about 30 minutes after i hit it. For me, It would not be a morning smoke. maybe a late afternoon or a lazy Sunday smoke. I did like it a lot and will keep some in my stash for those lazy dayz.

V*this review with a caveat: I\u2019m a lightweight and the 707 Headband I had was in edible form, and I barely ate 2.5 mg thc per session....so maybe I\u2019m just an outlier in terms of experience**\u000aI found that this made me very tense in a very specific way: my legs will twitch and feel super-restless. I\u2019ve tried commercial edibles from the same company several times and this strain in that brand feels ok for a while, but then the tension and restlessness set in. My suspicion is that this strain has some particular GABA-receptor effects bc several medications that affect the GABA cause the same reaction in me. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. I\u2019m sure this is a fine strain for others, but maybe it has some idiosyncrasies that might not be great for people who have had adverse reactions to gabapentin, lyrica, etc.

VGreat daytime companion. It seemed to take the edge off of any stress that was building up. Also helped with pain. Following an elbow surgery I need to stretch it often to increase/maintain but the pain at furthest extension and  flexion is overwhelming! 707 Headband helped me gain a coupled degrees and I had less pain overall. I&#39;ve vaped the flower as well as the oil form. Each had a smooth taste. Felt a little high instantly then another wave of highness hit me 5-10min later. Could chill with my Dad and watch  football on this stuff. If he knew I used it he&#39;d probably flip out and forever be reserved around me. He&#39;ll never know while I&#39;m using this  strain.

Vi love this strain, i had a caregiver in which had a lrge yield of some quality and real headband. The strain was excellent, the smell was potent and after a few run in&#39;s with some pesky coppers, i choose to seal the bag in a smell proof container. The strain is good, and i believe more of a sativa feeling. This strain made me feel very creative, and energetic. I mean i thought i was wearing a hat! : ) i guess that&#39;s why they call it headband. I bummed i just smoked my last bowl, but excited to grow it this summer!

VVEEEEERRRRYYYY NICE!!!&#128527; After a day in the NE with dank rain,humidity then if your a pain patient everybone is screaming well look at my reviews PAIN CONTROLLED my life then I started doing my research.\u000aEvery review here though I have many ailments PAIn is the BIG one I\u2019m at battle with and TODAY WE WON THE BATTLE!\u000aCRESCO again hits a home run with 707 Headband. Upon opening it ya get a very earthy,outside grow smell, very dense nuggets that just keep growing as ya break em....taste great when ya lick your fingers! I decided to add 10% of THE-WIFE just to BOOST CBD......\u000aThis was the BEST thing that happened today!\u000aOK 15 minutes in .....The neuro pain  is slowly lifting, the CBD has cleared my head..which seems to let the INDICA have a clean slate to bind to. \u000aCBD is NON psychoactive and can be smoked as is or mixed for one stop medication but forget the THC and all this is a waste., Sure you\u2019ll get high but CBD needs THC to activate it ALL even in small amount like less than 1%. CBD is the active medicine THC  makes ya comfy while the medicine heals ya!\u000aOnce ya understand the science behind how this all works...it\u2019s rather simple, yet many forget ONE THING..THC is the SPARK to make  CBD work and get a full entourage effect of what your paying for. So find out what Cannabinoids do what n FIND THE STRAIN with those Cannabinoids in it, after that it\u2019s hit n miss with dosing, mixing etc..I keep a journal.\u000a\u000aOK 25 minutes in....my pain has gone from a 6+ to a 2 ,my mind is relaxed and stress, worrying about my health isn\u2019t stealing the moment.I could eat , all around this has been pretty DAMN good and I would say...the strains\u000aTHE WIFE n 707HEAD BAND have certainly earned the right to be in the PANTRY LIST.\u000aThese are the items in my FIRST AID EMERGENCY KIT!!!\u000aRemember this is my medicine..and BTW ..YES when ya hit on it, the results are better n safer than pills.pills,pills, \u000aQuickly, the downsides....slightly dry mouth n eyes.\u000a\u000aPs. Take it slow don\u2019t waste this...it\u2019s worth more than gold to me!!!  \u000a\u000aHope this helps......

The strain was excellent, the smell was potent and after a few run in&#39;s with some pesky coppers, i choose to seal the bag in a smell proof container. The strain is good, and i believe more of a sativa feeling. This strain made me feel very creative, and energetic. I mean i thought i was wearing a hat! : ) i guess that&#39;s why they call it headband. I bummed i just smoked my last bowl, but excited to grow it this summer!

V707 Headband acquired in Massachusetts.\u000aSmell - Very Sweet &amp; Pungent Diesel smell with a hint of pineapple in my opinion.\u000aLooks - Very nice fluffy buds, super bright green with nice yellow to Orange hairs everywhere, low on the tricromes.\u000aTaste - Very Sweet &amp; Diesel taste with a great Apple pineapple taste very similiar to the smell.\u000aEffect - Makes you feel very head high. I can see why they call it headband it gives u weird feeling in your head but gives you a nice mellow high.\u000aOverall - Didnt impress me too much but did very well with headaches and stress &amp; anxiety during day &amp; afternoon&#39;s\u000a4.2 out of 5

I&#39;ve been smoking it in the afternoons and evenings the last three days... I&#39;ve been eating a bit more then usual. I&#39;ve been very happy and content too. I like this strain over all. Not too potent but not weak. Has helped my appetite and mood.

VHighly accessible strain, particularly well-suited for social gatherings or cranking through 60 minutes or less of unbroken, focused productivity before phasing into a wonderfully soft ether. Not too &quot;phasey&quot; for a morning toke if you need to get the ball rolling, and there&#39;s a roundness that accentuates the touch of sweet pine in this otherwise earthy strain speaking to both its quality and versatility of enjoyment.

VI managed to get my hands on a little bit of this over the weekend. The buds were small and had a mild pungent smell to them. It broke down well and minutes after lighting up I could feel the intense heady effects setting in. Very smooth inhale and earthy taste. No paranoia, no anxiety, just a calm relaxed feeling that lasted for hours. I would definitely recommend this strain if you come across it. One of the best highs I&#39;ve had in some time. Not too powerful but the right mix of both.

Very skunky funky diesel smell and a nice hard hitting smoke can definitely feel the indica in the high with a pretty nice sativa effect aswell. The balance is right where I like it.

VI mistakenly got this thinking it was a phenotype of SFV OG. This 707 by the og line was disappointing and not very effective. I could tell by the smell it was weak. This was 6 months old too. A lot of stem, but easy on lime colored leaves. Brown short thin hairs connect to long lush nugs that are white beige to green. Covered in a moderate amount of yellow and white trich. The smell was all wood and earthy dried leaves and dirt. Like, a forest in autumn while there&#39;s a been drought for a year or two. Effects were weak, moderately relaxed all over body and mind. Slightly happy and creative. The sativa side can cause me bouts of anxiety within the first 10 minutes of first session. Not to much going on besides that. The og line represented 707 to be relaxed and calm without any couch lock or energy. I didn&#39;t like this. Nor was I against it. I would resort to this strain over any sativa though.

I did also smoke some of their other strain &quot;The White&quot; but two thumbs up and 5 stars to the 707 Headband. You can&#39;t go wrong when you get it from the Bay.  \u000a\u000aStrong hit to the chest, pretty good taste.. A little stemmy. But its all about how it smokes! It will have you up and hyper then creep up on you and put you on your a$$! Enjoy!
