I can tell at the beginning of my consumption cycle that this strain is already a killer. Wow. If you have things you need to get done, this might not be the strain to use. But if you are looking for something for stress relief and for help sleeping, then this is your strain.

VA really nice indica. The flowers have some dark purples among a variety of green tones. They were a little on the fluffier side for such a powerful indica; although nice and sticky. The smell was sharply piney and citrusy. A bit astringent. The taste is a combination of citrus and nuttiness. I got a little hint of grape on the exhale. The effects start with a euphoric body tingle. Then about 15 minutes in, wham, it sucker punches you right in the face! It&#39;s works it&#39;s way into a deep body relaxation, coupled with a solid euphoria. Good for sleep and relaxation. A pleasure to smoke. Can be a little tougher to come across,

VGreat offering from bodhi, one of the more legit breeders at the moment. Not sure if its iranian indica, south asian indica or whatever but even with the snow lotus background it for sure has some extremely similar og kush notes. Earthy, sweet and pungent with notes of diesel and a funky flowery aftertaste. Strange...but its so good i don&#39;t particularly care about the lineage, which frankly for me is a bit odd but whatever LOL. Well find out eventually what OG actually is and then the pieces of the puzzle will make more sense. Good for relaxation and nighttime activities or for pain/ appetite stimulation.

VSmelled so much like pine + sherbet ice cream! Packed 1/2 a bowl in my glass, tastes like sweet pine and roasted pez candies - if that existed. Nice smooth and light smoke - nice for beginners. The high went straight to my head and my mouth was non-stop salivating. Felt clear headed, no anxiety, super relaxed - no stress, super aware, but it was like a lucid dream. I know I was there, but it didn&#39;t feel real... Helped with my nerve pain a bit 3/5 and helped with inflammation a bit 3/5. Was a nice stoney high, but it didn&#39;t really help with all my pain.
