VRecommended to be my my budtender, saying that his was is favorite. So it&#39;s either a sales push or honest advices. Checked out the Pie next to all the other killer dank suggestions, and it was obvious that the Key Lime Pie was the winner. Looked unreal, price point wasn&#39;t cheap, but it was still less than half of &quot;toppies&quot;. Got more weight for less cash and it fucking unbelievable. If Girl Scout Cookies had a lazy ass Indica brother, it would be KYP.  Crazy strong, actually tastes like citrus, and slams your ass the into the couch. Yes, please.

Vgreat for depression - bad for anxiety \u000aI&#39;ve got pretty bad depression, along with a ton of anxiety. my favourite strains are hybrids that give a good head high, but without any anxiety. this strain is great for depression, it makes me laugh and smile lots! but, it makes my anxiety much worse. if I don&#39;t get anxious at all through my high, it&#39;s amazing! but the problem is, I can&#39;t control when I get anxiety, and I tend to get it a lot.\u000a\u000astrong strain, tastes and smells fantastic, but would not recommend if you&#39;ve got difficulties with anxiety

VGrower: Northwest botanics THC: 11% CBD: 0.05% Harvest 5/31/16 Okay this strain is amazing the taste is great the smell is great and the high is great. The taste is very flavor full even for a 5$ gram the the store, It tastes just like key lime pie but some nugs are a little more minty that leaves your mouth kinda numb and tingly. And the smell is just like keylime pie but its very subtle as a nug but after grinding it its just like a fresh key lime pie. The effects were a good indica dom hybrid at 60/40 were it gave some haziness to the head and gave a good body high. This is one of the tastiest strains I have ever had and it was just a cheap gram so it can get alot better with a longer cure and flush.

VThis strain has become one of my &quot;private reserve&quot; level favorites. Having read the Leafly description which mentioned that it could be overpowering to those not used to today&#39;s strong strains, I limited myself to three puffs of a Key Lime Pie preroll. Smart move (for once). I didn&#39;t get quite the key lime flavor that others have noted, but I found it to be smooth and easy to smoke. No scratching of the throat, no hacking cough. A pleasure to puff.\u000a\u000aIn about 5 minutes I was feeling a strong mind-tingle. It soon turned into a very nice cerebral high. It was quite relaxing, but not a couch lock. My arms and legs felt heavy, but floaty at the same time. At the same time, I experienced an uplifted, creative focus. I can see this being very helpful for my writing. \u000a\u000aOn the pain management side, KLP significantly lessened my arthritis pain without a sedative effect. I could walk up a steep flight of stairs without sharp pains in my knees.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I highly recommend this strain for stress relief, pain relief, and a pleasant, creative mental focus.

VKey Lime wasn&#39;t the sweet leaf I thought it was. I picked up a quarter ounce of this at da chronic spot thinking it was simple smoke, but naw. When I got home I rolled up a joint &amp; smoked it with my mrs. It smokes cool &amp; the high was mellow at first. This caused me to wanting to smoke the roach in a bong. After that, the high kicked in hella heavy which caused me to puke my brains out &amp; passing out .. After that I took in key lime pie carefully and cleared the rest of that quarter ounce .. Again Key Lime Pie is one of those leafs that will fuck you up if your not careful, be sure to smoke this with ease not in beast mode .. It took me a while to handle the high but I still managed to smoke the bag up&#128077;&#127998; Dat Shitz Stong&#128170;&#127998; tho!! &#128537;&#128168;&#129316;

Vkey lime pie: \u000a25.5% THC harvest date 11/22/2016\u000aGrower: Elevated North Gardens LLC\u000aRetailer: Bud Commander\u000aKing-size RAW Cone\u000a\u000aInitial lights up includes sweetness like a lime candy on the sweet receptors, while a prominent diesel/citrus taste on the sour and bitter areas of the pallet.  The sweet lime candy taste lingers for a good 20 minutes after the smoke. \u000a\u000aKLP provides a nice sweet citrus smell mixed with notes of wood and hash on the nose. Halfway through the joint I start to feel a heavy head and neck high/relaxation, another benefits almost immediately is this strain&#39;s ability to crush anxiety and depression.  \u000a\u000aAs you drift off into key lime bliss, your body starts to get heavy, resulting in a super smooth smoke that is not too harsh for beginners. \u000a\u000aAlthough this is a great smooth smoke for beginners, beware of the high cannabinol content; start small. For a phenotype of GCS, this strain is my personal favorite. \u000a\u000aThe only negative I see for this particular strain is the popcorn size buds from the grower. \u000a

VVery stoney hybrid. Type of stuff that leaves me a bit stupefied but still somehow focused. Smoked some of this before I was supposed to start cooking and it took at least twice as long as it should have; definitely cut those carrots up perfectly though and had a great time doing it. Great taste and scent, creamy lime taste that&#39;s reminiscent of a Sunset Sherbet but much more lime. Relaxing and mind erasing, great for stress and clearing your head.  4.5/5.

VKey Lime Pie is one of my favorites for relaxing and enjoying myself. It makes my stress and anxiety just melt away leaving me feeling comfortable in body and mind. The effects are similar to some pharmaceutical painkillers I&#39;ve used because the pain is still present, but I just don&#39;t care that it&#39;s there. I only use it in the evening or at night, and the good feelings last into the next day for me. And then there&#39;s the lime taste. Sometimes it&#39;s subtle, others it&#39;s quite evident, and it&#39;s very tasty.

VBeen trimming this strain for Rainier Alternative Medical access point. To echo the description; the yield on this IS great! Dense buds, and a fair amount from each medium sized plant. The purple on ours jumped out quite a bit. Which isn&#39;t surprising considering its March in Seattle. The taste and smell are superb! Key lime pie has a reputation for fragrance and this is definitely hitting the mark. \u000aThe indica effects are very pronounced. My hands ache from time to time and this strain really provides the pain relief without necessarily putting me to sleep. You may experience couch-lock, but if you can hang with it and are experienced with bud this strong and specific, you&#39;ll be very helpful leased! \u000a

VBeen trimming this strain for Rainier Alternative Medical access point. To echo the description; the yield on this IS great! Dense buds, and a fair amount from each medium sized plant. The purple on ours jumped out quite a bit. Which isn&#39;t surprising considering its March in Seattle. The taste and smell are superb! Key lime pie has a reputation for fragrance and this is definitely hitting the mark. \u000aThe indica effects are very pronounced. My hands ache from time to time and this strain really provides the pain relief without necessarily putting me to sleep. You may experience couch-lock, but if you can hang with it and are experienced with bud this strong and specific, you&#39;ll be very helpful leased! \u000a

VSome similarity to Girl Scout Cookies. High not as cerebral. At end of high I always fall asleep (within 2-3 hour of smoking). High also not as long lasting.

VA fast acting indica hybrid. This strain carries the smell and taste of the Durban Poison parent. Very piney and astringent aroma, with some underlying earthy tones. The flavor is sweet and piney, and definitely a bit sour. The buds are a sticky dense bright green, with flecks of purple and dull orange.\u000aThe effects come on quickly, start in the shoulders, and settled in the mid back for a while. They were leaning toward the OG parent. Pleasantly relaxing. Nice for stress and anxiety. Effects lasted for 2 hours or so, and the come down wasn&#39;t too heavy.

VWhat do you get when you cross GSC with Cherry Pie?  The glorious Key Lime Pie. The high is fantastic and worthy of top shelf status. The taste is even better, I found it taste like a limoncello a little bit on the inhale, more key lime and cookie crust on exhale. Absolutely spectacular and a must cop!

VGreat Indica, very different taste, this is some Fire. First off the taste is crazy. I don&#39;t even know how to describe it, it&#39;s a Cookies cut but doesn&#39;t look or smell anything like regular Girl Scout Cookies, I mean you can see where the flavors come from, but they come together completely different.The buds are crazy dense, bright lime green, becoming purplish on the tips and it&#39;s completely covered in trichomes probably some of the frostiest bud I&#39;ve ever come across. And it tastes as good as it looks. It has this crazy lime candy flavor with alot of earthiness to it with a slight hint of mint, it&#39;s a very clean tasting weed. Definitely an indica, as soon as I smoke it my eye lids feel heavy and my muscles feel nice and relaxed, it&#39;s very euphoric but with a boost to your focus and creativity. So if you like Indica and want to try something really good and really different give this one a try.

VThis was a dark horse favorite on a big cannabis shopping trip. Even Mango Kush couldn&#39;t top it!\u000a\u000aI have depression, so for a sativa to really affect me it has to be pretty strong. Not only did this strain perk me up in a great way, but it gave me very nice &quot;tingles&quot; and a very good physical sensation. No dragging down! Just good vibes from head to toe. The flavor is also spot on for the name. You don&#39;t think it&#39;ll taste like key lime, but it absolutely does. I&#39;d recommend it as a refreshing Daily Strain to anyone using cannabis for depression.

Great all around high to use for pretty much anything.   Just really depends on your mindset.   It&#39;s a good couch lock do nothing high and a go out and get things done high.

VThis is Key Lime Pie from The Green Cross on Mission, Not a promotional smoke: purchased medicine. Indoor and SATIVA, not indica.\u000a\u000a(That&#39;s a larger point, how these names really get to meaning a consistent thing - or purchase, or product, or strain. Strains I associate with sativa or indica I sometimes find reverse labeled, or retailers rename the supply they buy toward their clientele&#39;s ear, or call it something cool. The thing about &quot;O.G.&quot; being ocean grown is something to pin down, verify and label correct. It makes something solid to build a taste wheel around. The taste, the salt hints I or any aware user can pick up in the smell and smoke of O.G. are real products of region, grow method and what plants are fed. That&#39;s just one example. Then there&#39;s the million things we like or mean when we use different trade names for our herb. I&#39;ve only written one other review here because the labeling itself can be so problematic, because it doesn&#39;t mean the same thing city to city, or even collective to collective. Add to that: one day this will be in doctor&#39;s desk drawers or pharmacies, so they&#39;re not gonna prescribe you &quot;Cat Piss&quot;.) &lt;-- &lt;-- THIS IS IN PARENTHESES.\u000a\u000aWas bright and crisp out of the jar - the tender said it got in today (Oct 6, 2015). Springy, acridity to the smell, like almost vinegar is something I notice about fresh weed. Not vinegar, but a salad dressing vibe- oil and greens and vinegar...\u000a\u000aSmokes delicious: not too sweet, but very present even lightly sprinkled in tobacco. Nice acridity to this strain.\u000a\u000aThen I got some Dutch Treat (the other review I have up here), which smells terrific. It&#39;s one of the few strains, really, which I&#39;ve been able to find with consistent qualities at different times - and even at different dispensaries. This Dutch Treat has the same nose area as the Purple Star one I wrote about, so I hope the smoke will maintain the same rainforest vibe....\u000a\u000aThen I got a gram of Cookie Monster kief.\u000a\u000a90 somethin dollars.\u000a\u000anext stop: rainforest....

VSmell is sour, sweet, and earthy; definitely smells like lime. It hits pretty harsh on the back of your throat, and will probably make you cough. Not very smooth for smoking, but the high is pretty great. Very calm and happy. Anxiety completely melted away. It has a noticeable body effect, relieving tension in your muscles a bit. Good for relaxing after a long day. The high lasted for a good amount of time, and slowly makes you sleepy and ready for bed.

VCherry Pie X Lime Haze \u000aAmazing day time smoke. Kept me focused, and motivated and I was very content with everything, even a little giggly. There was a bit of a body high, but mostly a head rush and uplifting sensation. Tastes amazing too. Usually lemony strains are harsh, but the Cherry Pie in the genetics comes out and evens out the lemon taste with sweetness. One of the best strains I&#39;ve tried, and it seems to be pretty hard to find.

VThis amazing phenotype of GSC is a GEM. It&#39;s definite lineage of GSC is noticed within the first minute. The high comes on strong and fast with tart notes and smells all around like lime, especially after grinding and heating. The high, oh my lawd. The high is great! The sativa effects bring you to life immediately, the same way that GSC does, it wastes no time knocking on your brain&#39;s door. Surprisingly enough the body high and the indica dominance waltzes in about 5 minutes later. Not overpowering, but your going to get a little more couch lock and focus with Key Lime Pie as opposed to it&#39;s sister, Girl Scout Cookies; both being equally impressive strains. Try it in the evening watching a movie! I got mine from The Clinic on Colorado Boulevard. GO THERE.

VThe lime taste is very prevalent upon exhale and it even has a slight minty finish. I find it has a unique body to mind high that is very equal in effect. Both the indica and sativa characteristics of this strain can be felt without one dominating the other. I thought it would couch-lock me, but I feel quite alert and focused. I like this strain for mid-day or early evening sessions for relaxing. It feels like I have a force field surrounding my body..unique buzz.

VKey Lime Pie is my favorite dessert; thus if you call ANYTHING Key Lime Pie, I have to try it.  &quot;Key Lime Pie Dog Crap&quot;?  Give me a pound.  &quot;Key Lime Pie Vomit&quot; - let me at it.\u000a\u000aDefinitely a lime taste - reminds me of Sour Kush; must have similar terpenes.  I was impressed.  There are reviewers that state they can even taste the crust of the pie.  I don&#39;t agree with that, BUT - pack a bowl of 50/50 Key Lime Pie and Animal Cookies?\u000a\u000aTHAT combo definitely tastes like the pie, as the Animal Cookies adds the missing vanilla, baked good flavor.

VKey Lime Pie is an excellent, reliable and predictable strain being a Girl Scout Cookies phenotype, so if you&#39;re familiar at all with the great indica hybrid that is GSC, there&#39;s only a little more to describe with Key Lime Pie. It definitely leans more to the indica side and its OG Kush parent as its smell is a fuel-like, piney kush smell with an almost berry-like sweetness present in the background. Has a righteous body stone with some cerebral effects and is great for insomnia if consumed at the right time, or getting things done, or relaxing, or pretty much any use if consumed with the right mindset. This versatility is definitely a part of what makes this a memorable GSC variant that makes it a good choice anytime.
