VI actually enjoy this strain alot. I found this strain to be better suited for smoking while out and about. Not a good strain to smoke and watch TV at 9pm.. I personally liked this strain I found it euphoric and energetic. I have had very small amounts of paranoia but nothing bad at wll. Overall I actually like this strain and going with 5 stars.

VMost cultivators will admit that mastering the cure is much harder than growing a weed. With that being said, my sample was not cured to my plate. Smelled mostly like hay and had a powdery crumble when ground. I liked my P-Wreck effects just fine. Clear minded Sativa feeling medicine. Was not harsh when smoked and there was no visual burned or dead leafs. Under the alfalfa mask I did found citrus &amp; pine, explaining the great feel that this strain provides. Upbeat, mood enhancer with a long steady giggle. Chicks dig it.

VI am from S.Fl, I am a pretty heavy smoker. For the last like 3 years at least I\u2019ve been smoking consistently, daily. I guess the tree we got down here isn\u2019t all that because I went up north and a buddy of mine had some of this packaged up. Now understand there was a point in time I felt like I couldn\u2019t get high anymore, my tolerance is crazy high (I guess for the shit down here). We rolled up two joints of this stuff, six heads, after I few hits I felt like how I did the first time. Strongest shit I\u2019ve ever smoked. I was space cadet, booted off my ass. I wish I could find this again at home. My favorite strain thus far.

VBe cautious of this heavy hitter, the effects take place almost immediately. Platinum Wreck is a hybrid of Platinum OG &amp; Trainwreck. It\u2019s a 70/30 sativa dominant hybrid that keeps you energized and focused while the indica leaves a tingling sensation along your body. This kind of high is highly recommended for going to a party or concert, this one hitter-quitter is sure to get the party going. Be ready to share though, it has an enticing aroma that can be sniffed out blocks away. There\u2019s an upfront citrusy, subtly sweet taste that leaves a smokey essence. As they say in the Bay, \u201cThis is that Loud\u201d\u000a-7.8

VPlatinum wreck is one of the best strains I&#39;ve tried. It is a good body high, relaxing and still allow you to be functional. I bought it from Yavapai Herbal ~ Cottonwood and as always, the staff is wonderful.
