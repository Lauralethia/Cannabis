VThis is the first weed I&#39;ve smoked so far that feels like what everyone describes about an indica. I was incredibly cozy on my couch, couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t really want to do much, but almost in a bad way. Like in a &#39;cocaine crash&#39; way. A bit restless and my body felt super heavy. Just smoked some silver haze to get out of the super tiring high. Definitely an amazing night time strain for people who have trouble getting tired and getting to sleep. Definitely stay away during the daytime as you&#39;ll just feel lethargic.\u000a\u000aFull disclosure, I hadn&#39;t eaten in about six hours so it may have hit me harder since I was fairly weak and hungry. I had two hits off a joint.

VSmells like lifesavers! Grape, bubblegum, candy smelling. Hints of kush. \u000a\u000aFeels like a benzodiazapene. Great for relaxing. Very pleasant euphoric high. Great CBD to THC ratio.

VLifesaver is by far my favorite strain to date.\u000aAs a caregiver and grower of 10+ years, I find that it can and does help w/ a myriad of health issues. Not just for me, but for so many of my clients!\u000a\u000aThe only warning is: make sure you are somewhere where you can relax and fall asleep!

VI absolutely love this strain. I am dabbing on some Lifesaver live resin right now to relieve some of the worst cramps I have ever felt. I almost went to the hospital but after a few dabs, I am able to stay home and deal with it. I highly recommend it.

VI found this strain better (more powerful) than Purple Mr. Nice AND Durban Poison.  I am a frequent smoker and can smoke 2 gm a day easy, so I guess my tolerance has increased over the years.  But I very much enjoyed Lifesaver.

VGrew outdoors yrs ago, kinda put em in and forgot about em.  They turned out awesome, but because of my neglect....I only got a oz per plant.  BUT....for no work but putting some good dirt in, and never watering, that&#39;s cool with me.   Believe I got the beans from &quot; spice of life&quot; seeds. Like I said...years ago!!

VI highly recommend this strain if your looking to wind down and chill. I experienced an immense but gentle body high. A beautiful balance of CBd and thc. I experienced very clear and focused thoughts. Lifesaver is calm, comfy, clear, light, sweet, aware, and content. So far this is one of my all time favorite strains.

VGreat strain, a real lifesaver.  Excellent at knocking out pain, keeping me focused and alert.  I could see myself using this at the gym, where it&#39;s so important that I get activity but so hard when everything hurts.  The flavor is sweet and, yes, reminiscent of a pack of lifesavers.  Highly recommend.

VA highly underrated strain in my opinion. You can&#39;t beat it&#39;s berry sweetness that accompanies the nice mixture of head and cerebral highs. This strain took me on a fun little roller coaster! \u000a

VI just got this strain today. I immediately tasted the berry and sweetness to it. Much harsher on the lungs than I expected. The smoke coming from the lit end is blue but it changes to a pale yellow when you exhale. I felt overall happy and very satisfied. The nugs have a nice density to it and the kief on it is notable. I really feel a good body high which makes it great for pain.
