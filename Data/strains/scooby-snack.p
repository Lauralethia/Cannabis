VThis is the best strain that I have found to treat my M&#233;ni&#232;re\u2019s disease. After using Scooby snacks for a month the tinnitus in my left ear is significantly lower. Obviously, this stuff has some serious anti-inflammatory properties. Strangely enough though, Purple Train Wreck is still better for treating Crohn\u2019s disease in my opinion. I imagine Scooby Snacks would be useful for treating joint pain as well. As for the effects, Scooby Snacks is extremely euphoric, spacey, dreamy, and blissful. Destroys depression completely, and even though it is dreamy you remain very lucid; for example it does not spur any crazy thoughts or make your mind race. It purges you of all negativity. Scooby Snacks did affect me differently than some other reviewers in the sense that it did not make me sleepy at all, and it did not give me the munchies any more than any other strain. Scooby Snacks has a reputation for being very potent but that was not my experience either and my samples were extremely high in THC. I would say this is an excellent strain for novice users because it is so happy and mellow. As for negatives \u2013 you will not get much done with Scooby Snacks it is best for watching TV and listening to music. It is not a particularly creative strain and is not very arousing either. The high does not last very long. It is an extremely strong smelling strain so be aware of that. Also, as another reviewer said Scooby Snacks does not like an idle mind, and you can feel a little antsy if you do not focus your mind on something. But nothing major, I would never want to scare anyone away from the strain because it is one of the most wonderful out there. As a M&#233;ni&#232;re\u2019s disease suffer I will never be without it. This review is for edibles that I made with Scooby ironically.

VScooby Snacks is a great strain for relaxing after a stressful day at work! After the first bowl, I was already feeling better. This very rarely happens for me, unless I&#39;m coming off a smoke break. So I was pleased. Honestly, I think Leafly has it spot on, in that it &quot;brings on stimulating cerebral effects that weigh heavy on your eyes and slowly relax the body&quot;. Mine smells good, I pick up sweet pine &amp; lemon. After six hours of pretty frequent &#39;Scooby Snacks&#39;, it didn&#39;t make me too tired, nor did it give me the munchies too badly. This of course will likely be different for other people. Also for me, it does a great job of warping my perception of time and made me very talkative! I have really enjoyed it.

VScooby snacks are a culinary masterpiece. And the cerebral high never lets me down. Just mellows me into a soothing body high. Even its name brings to mind the stoner classic Scooby Doo. Shaggy &amp; Scooby: two potheads that always got the munchies.. And this strain can do it. Kind of couch potato stuf. Tastes so G00D though. This kind I got lends a lot of its taste from the Platinum GSC side of the family. Its sweet taste I heard best described as like chocolate, cherry &amp; mint with a hint of lemongrass all at the same time. Now take that along with some earthy  undertones of its parent Face Off OG, and my compliments to the chef.

VScooby Snacks is a pretty potent strain with good flavor, aroma, and appearance. The flowers are a fluffy, sappy, pungent green with a tremendous amount of crystal trichomes coating the buds. The parent strains to Scooby Snacks are extremely potent strains that give it a nice kick. The flavor is very pleasant that is not harsh at all. A nice skunk/flowery aroma with the same in the flavor with maybe a tad of pepper/spice on the exhale. The effects do seem to be like a true 50/50 hybrid, uplifting and relaxing.

VTried some of this for the first time a few years back and thought it was ok/decent. I&#39;ve smoked it here and there in the last few years. \u000a\u000aJust picked up a little today since I was looking for something different from what I&#39;ve been smoking lately. This time round though who ever grew it did a great job. I really like strains that have a piney taste and have to say this is some really tasty stuff. High is suprr nice too. It&#39;s relaxing but, not too relaxing. Kinda in that sweet spot for me. Definitely a great strain if grown and cured right.

VScooby snacks are a culinary masterpiece. And the cerebral high never lets me down. Just mellows me into a soothing body high. Even its name brings to mind the stoner classic Scooby Doo. Shaggy &amp; Scooby: two potheads that always got the munchies.. And this strain can do it. Kind of couch potato stuf. Tastes so G00D though. This kind I got lends a lot of its taste from the Platinum GSC side of the family. Its sweet taste I heard best described as like chocolate, cherry &amp; mint with a hint of lemongrass all at the same time. Now take that along with some earthy  undertones of its parent Face Off OG, and my compliments to the chef.

VScooby Snacks is a pretty potent strain with good flavor, aroma, and appearance. The flowers are a fluffy, sappy, pungent green with a tremendous amount of crystal trichomes coating the buds. The parent strains to Scooby Snacks are extremely potent strains that give it a nice kick. The flavor is very pleasant that is not harsh at all. A nice skunk/flowery aroma with the same in the flavor with maybe a tad of pepper/spice on the exhale. The effects do seem to be like a true 50/50 hybrid, uplifting and relaxing.

VScooby Snacks is a great strain for relaxing after a stressful day at work! After the first bowl, I was already feeling better. This very rarely happens for me, unless I&#39;m coming off a smoke break. So I was pleased. Honestly, I think Leafly has it spot on, in that it &quot;brings on stimulating cerebral effects that weigh heavy on your eyes and slowly relax the body&quot;. Mine smells good, I pick up sweet pine &amp; lemon. After six hours of pretty frequent &#39;Scooby Snacks&#39;, it didn&#39;t make me too tired, nor did it give me the munchies too badly. This of course will likely be different for other people. Also for me, it does a great job of warping my perception of time and made me very talkative! I have really enjoyed it.

VThis strain is really awesome if you have a hard time sleeping. Relaxed, happy, sleepy. Appearance and taste is pretty much gsc, with a small lemon-pine og hint to it. Honestly if someone told me it was gsc I would believe them, there\u2019s not really a clear og taste or smell, you\u2019d probably taste it more in some oil rather than in some flower. Solid hybrid though, more indica I\u2019d say. I\u2019ll buy it again cause the name is cool and it\u2019s bag appearance is good enough to impress all your friends or that bohemian chick you\u2019ve been digging lately.

My mind feels energized, yet I don&#39;t feel stressed, and my body feels relaxed, but I can still focus as long as I&#39;m not learning a brand new task.

VA fun, giddy come on that\u2019s strong and noticeable, yet overshadowed by what feels like a weight on top that\u2019s almost bending me over. That may just be how the distant mental state is interpreting the physically relaxing aspect of the high. It\u2019s not bad, just pretty distracting. Learning to gel with and embrace it. Despite how gone and distant everything feels (like your brain\u2019s wrapped in a thick sweater), it has a clear, functional core right at the center that provides sober-levels of stability. There\u2019s a soft euphoric thrill bubbling up from the chest, but impressively nothing edgy or uncomfortable. One-of-a-kind concentration and focus that lets you tune out stuff you\u2019d be less able to sober. The weight of the high does suppress music and inhibits deep emotional connection. Still immensely stimulating of the mind with a stoney, spaced out mental space and synesthetically enjoyable physical response that makes listening enthralling, even if it doesn\u2019t register that deep. Overall, great both physical and emotional medication with moderate lethargy and droopiness - but the mood elevation&#39;s enough to pick you up out of it. 7/10
