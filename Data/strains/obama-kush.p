VFantastic strain with deep purple color. Dark, almost culinary scent with pine and fruit being the main bouquet. A little skunky, but it worth it. The effect is at first a little like with other kush strains, but after 10 minutes the full effect roles through the body and a warmth a calm settles in for about 90 minutes - 2 hours. If you can find this strain, I&#39;d recommend it.

VI live in Los Angeles, but when I was in Portland, this stuff was amazing. I definitely miss this strain. People here have never heard of it, and it&#39;s hard to explain how good of a balance it has between an indica body high and a sativa mental high.\u000a\u000aThis is absolutely a must try if you have the opportunity.

VThe main problem, out of many, is constant intractable pain. I have to rate all strains on this primary basis. This strain provides superb pain relief as well as the &quot;trippy-ness&quot; (let&#39;s call it, say, &quot;Euphoria&quot;) necessary to allow a truce between the physical and the mental. I call it &quot;ghosting,&quot; as one&#39;s consciousness returns to one&#39;s control; rather than being hijacked by overwhelming pain. The mind becomes free to explore and inhabit any idea that it chooses. There are only a few strains that provide an ideal amount of this quality while allowing one to move about and to stay awake. This strain provides about 80% of that ideal; there are only a few that can do better. Very nice.

VStrain: Obama Kush (Afghani / OG Kush cross -- Indica)\u000aTHC: 20.54%\u000aCBD: 0.46%\u000aLocation found: Puddletown Organics \u000aDate purchased: 3.24.16 \u000aPrice: $10.00/g\u000aWeight: 1.0g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: It is a very berry and pleasant smell to me. Overpowering Kush type smell without much of the Afghani highlights. Almost a Lavender smell present too. \u000aLook: Very dark dense nug with purple, dark orange hairs and a hint of darker green in the background. Very frosty. Good representation of the strain from others I have seen and smelled. If the sugar leaf was trimmed better, most of the purple would be gone.\u000aTaste: A violet Kush taste overpowering the Lavender flavored Afghani. It was nice to have a flash of some other strains from just the exhale of this strain. Along with the Blackberry and Ras(z)pberry Kush strains, so sweet and flavorful smells and then the flavor is there in the smoke but it is just not overpowering like the smell emanating from the jar. I really enjoyed the taste, don\u2019t get me wrong. I just love when the smell from the jar is dwarfed by the taste or smoke hanging in the air. \u000aRecommendation for medicine: The first time I smoked this strain I lost four hours and the sun in the sky to the moon. I think it is a good slow down and focus strain...for a little bit anyways. Then zone out and be could be the follow up. For an Indica strain, it is an anomaly. Relieved some pain for me, almost a little of euphoric body detachment. Not really a good sleep type Indica for me; too much up in the head. It is a slightly \u201cintense\u201d strain and I would recommend trying some other Kush strains (not 25%+ THC) for a beginner (or a space to chill out for a few to four hours!).

VI&#39;ve heard that this is a re-branding of David Suzuki&#39;s UBC Chemo strain, but you know how it is with these things, word of mouth is like an adult version of the telephone game, so have fun playing it however you like.\u000a\u000aNomenclature and Politics aside, the flower is able to speak for itself.  Fully formed calyxes like lavender petals, two toned, rich sage green and deep purple often on the same calyx, inside and outside like a reversible jacket.  It has a pungent skunkish aroma like OG Kush, with sweeter notes of berry and fruit.  A Pleasure to smoke, I miss it when I don&#39;t have it.  The high is exceptional and pure feeling, no headaches with this beauty.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s anthocyanin purple is found in produce that are regarded as &quot;Super Foods&quot;, blueberries, blackberries, acai and the like.  Green leaves are able to turn blue and red light into energy with ease but it cannot absorb light of its colour, purple leaves thrive on this excess energy - even gaining nourishment from some of the light that is reflected off of its green neigbours! All in all, this is the most medicinal strain I&#39;ve encountered, and it is my every day go to strain.

Great to enjoy while vegging out on your favorite shows.  Very nice body-high allowing for a pain-free experience.  Not overly couch-locked and not one that will put you out fast like a lot of Indicas.  Having said that, evening use is definitely recommended.

This is a standout indica hybrid that when scoped at 200 X, all visible triclombes are full and completely milky full with delicious cannabinoids to com once I have vapourized it fully.

VI have never had a bad experience with this strain. When I first tried Obama Kush, I knew that I had found something special. This beauty gives me all the painkilling effects that I need without any couchlock or sleepiness. In fact, Obama Kush gives me energy. I don&#39;t get quiet or akward, no anxiety- just happy, goofy, content, pain-free joy! This is one of my top 5 favorite strains. It WAS my very favorite for awhile, but I&#39;ve recently found a few new contenders. Anyways, no matter what your preference is concerning cannabis strain types, Indica, Sativa, Hybrid, etc., I believe Obama Kush truly has something for everybody. Thanks! \u270c, &#128152;, and Understanding.

VThis has better ratings than the man himself, and understandably so. The effects are great. A deep body relaxation. It isn&#39;t felt in the head very much. It does still leave some energy to function on too. The flower has some nice purple highlights to it with a nice layer of trichomes over the whole flower. The flavor has the deep myrcene flavor to it as well as the smell. THC 19.75 CBD .23

VI am just back from Cancer treatments in Rochester, New York, USA and we took a day trip to see my friends at New Yorks finest Dispensary where picked up some happening Obama Kush.\u000a\u000aI am always down for essentially landrace strains which can be a trick to find, while Obama is a mix of Afghan x OG Kush.  This is a standout indica hybrid that when scoped at 200 X, all visible triclombes are full and completely milky full with delicious cannabinoids to com once I have vapourized it fully.

VI have never had a bad experience with this strain. When I first tried Obama Kush, I knew that I had found something special. This beauty gives me all the painkilling effects that I need without any couchlock or sleepiness. In fact, Obama Kush gives me energy. I don&#39;t get quiet or akward, no anxiety- just happy, goofy, content, pain-free joy! This is one of my top 5 favorite strains. It WAS my very favorite for awhile, but I&#39;ve recently found a few new contenders. Anyways, no matter what your preference is concerning cannabis strain types, Indica, Sativa, Hybrid, etc., I believe Obama Kush truly has something for everybody. Thanks! \u270c, &#128152;, and Understanding.

VWhat a fantastic experience! An easy smoking strain caused almost no coughing and an easy exhale. Taste is sweet fruity and a bit of a mossy finish. The high starts with a nice focused lift and quickly arrives with heavy eyes. Soon a great body high sets in that is a relaxing but not tiring high. Focus is lifted and mood is lifted. All in all a great experience. Slight dry eyes and dry mouth and pretty stoney eyes are the only negatives. Don&#39;t miss Obama Kush!

VHaven&#39;t had some Obama since one of my local dispensary got shut down. A new local dispensary I took interest too due to the 4.5 8ths. I don&#39;t go through many delivery dispensaries because most of the time, these people come through with some skank &#39;grew this is my backyard&#39; outdoor weed with the the scent of bad shake, or no scent at all yet due to the buds not cured all the way yet and it&#39;s usually a mess &#39;cause I don&#39;t like &#39;outdoorsey&#39; bud. A lot of people are down with the outdoor grown and preach how the sun makes the best weed. Sorry, I like my shit like my Obama right here. Hydroponically, nurtured, and fresh with that pine smell from the kush that almost burns your nose hairs. This Obama got purple in it, frosty as fukk, got a little pink in it and beautiful nugs. I smoked some Obama instead of taking my xanax and good weed like this helps me wing myself off these stupid pills that they give out and give it to you for so long... I get seizures and need to take them cause cutting these cold turkey after my doc had me on them for 5 years now- could very possibly end up in death if not medically supervised and winged off professionally with treatment... stick to Obama, all natural.

VObama Kush is a beautiful flower. Greens, purples, orange hairs, and a milky white dusting of trichomes. The taste is nice, earthy and a little sweet. The buds have a nice \u201cfull\u201d appearance, fluff balls of colorful kush. The high is strong but not extreme, very relaxing with actually a small amount of energy at first. Overall, a very good strain. Obama Kush has very good bag appeal, has a pleasant aroma that is earthy with a scent of cream, a flavor that is similar to the aroma, and a nice high that is not overwhelming.

It&#39;s just a huge yes for me. this is a killer sativa for me. no anxiety at all and I have it bad.... usually can&#39;t touch a sativa! no paranoia feeling. I had to 5 star this big guy. massive pain is now gone. overall: good for anxiety/ depression/motivation... happy!

Vwhen I rate my bud it&#39;s usually determined by the speed in which my thoughts start to transform from negative to positive and how deeply my...and my need to take another hit. I&#39;m a high strung individual with anxiety disorders and a good healthy dose of  ADHD. Although my mind was still on warp speed..it felt like I was in control.    Obama chilled me the hell down in a matter of minutes.. two gravity bong hits and I&#39;m good...oh wait, I hit the one hitter too.

Also it didn&#39;t make me tired, which I really liked. I&#39;d definitely recommend it! *I miss Obama! But I wish he did more to decriminalise the plant on the federal level.

This is good to put on the pen before heading out on the town for the night.  Plan on getting some food, the munchies start setting in after an hour.  The buzz is creative good for chatting about life or dancing to good sounds.  This is a really fun cartridge.  Has a chemical berry taste.\u000a

VObama Kush is a beautiful flower. Greens, purples, orange hairs, and a milky white dusting of trichomes. The taste is nice, earthy and a little sweet. The buds have a nice \u201cfull\u201d appearance, fluff balls of colorful kush. The high is strong but not extreme, very relaxing with actually a small amount of energy at first. Overall, a very good strain. Obama Kush has very good bag appeal, has a pleasant aroma that is earthy with a scent of cream, a flavor that is similar to the aroma, and a nice high that is not overwhelming.

It&#39;s just a huge yes for me. this is a killer sativa for me. no anxiety at all and I have it bad.... usually can&#39;t touch a sativa! no paranoia feeling. I had to 5 star this big guy. massive pain is now gone. overall: good for anxiety/ depression/motivation... happy!

VSweet smelling with hints of pine and citrus. This strain is a heavy indica that can be very relaxing to just puff on and even induce sleep in larger doses. Best to save this strain for after work or class. Great strain. One of my overall favorites.

Smoking it was so smooth and had a great flavor.

VSweet, spicy, and skunky!  This is a great &#39;purple&#39; strain with more kick than your usual Purple Afghani or Thai type strains (likely from the addition of OG Kush).  You get the sweet smell and flavor of &#39;purple&#39; mixed with a nice OG Kush spice/funk.  The high is very balanced; giving you the full body relaxation of an Indica mixed with a soaring creative head high than you&#39;d expect from OG Kush and it&#39;s relatives.  Not too much munchies, but also not too &#39;racing&#39; or anxiety inducing.  All in all, a really nice strain that mixes the best of two worlds together for a balanced and very fun high.  It reminds me of &#39;Diablo&#39; (Diablo Kush) which is also an OG cross that exhibits purple tendencies.

VI really like this.  Got a half gram cart from Select at Urbn Leaf.  All Select carts work just perfect so no dramas there.  This has a really nice head-y high.  It\u2019s not going to drop you into couch lock after the first hit but it has a nice relaxing head high.  Great for those nights that you want to have some conversation beyond \u201cwho ate all the Cheetos?\u201d  Speaking of Cheetos, not a lot of munchies with this strain.  Once your ready to call it a night this one will help you get there.  Wouldn\u2019t do it during the day if I had much to get done but it\u2019s not as heavy as some indicas or indica heavy hybrids I\u2019ve had.  Treat yourself to an evening with Barry O.  You\u2019ll dig it.

Definitely a recommendation for nerve issues and a good time. \u000a(I&#39;ve tried oil, and flower with the same effect, which is rare)

VI admit I am rather disappointed with Obama... the strain, however, is GREAT!\u000a\u000aMy nug was from &quot;The Bloom Room&quot; in SF, California. It was big and fluffy for just a gram, which is great since I consume about two eighths a week. It&#39;s purple color and extremely fuzzy exterior make it easy to recognize and the sweet aroma is pungent and alluring.\u000a\u000aOverall the high isnt perfect on its own unless you are using to medicate. I like throwing in some sativa to balance out the high if I plan to be active. 9.5/10 simply by my preference: 10/10 overall

VIm a recreational user and I absolutely love this strain. My local shop, Thurman St Collective, referred me to this strain and i&#39;ve loved it ever since! \u000a\u000aI tend to grind and smoke out of a pipe, so I usually like fluffy-type nugs with less stems.\u000a\u000aBeing that this is an Indica I was very pleased with how it grinds and smokes! \u000a\u000aIt came in tested at 25%, so exactly what Im looking for as a daily smoker.

VThis strain is tied for my favorite of all time with Blue Cookies (Blueberry and GSC, everyone should try it). It provided me with an extremely euphoric but uplifting high throughout. Definitely indica, but I was able to stay awake with my friends and enjoy the high for the majority of the night. A very potent strain. My friends tolerances aren&#39;t as high as mine, but I&#39;ve seen them smoke a bowl of this delicacy, and could not stop laughing for quite some time. 10/10, everyone NEEDS to try!!

VIMO not much flavor compared to other strains.  If anything slightly menthol.  Sits center chest about three inches above the sternum and moves up to the top of your tongue.  Effects are light but not so much to put me in the couch for hours.  I feel slightly motivated and had an amazing walk in the park.  Pain is gone, no pain at all which is always amazing.  Took about three hits on the vape pen at 320 degrees.  Felt slight effects in about six minutes, and full effect in ten to twelve minutes.  A new favorite to watch movies, do dishes, some light baking, and fun conversations.\u000a\u000aUPDATE EDIT: After using this for a couple weeks, it&#39;s more menthol than I like.  In addition, the vape pen cartridge cracked when I bent over in my pocket.  Went everywhere.  The effects are great, just too much like smoking tobacco IMO.

VI got this from MindRite in portland. When i say purple buds i mean Barney. Yes It was fire. Fire on a level of Presidential, top tier, dank. This is what I mean when i say weed aint just weed. You aint buying this weed at the ugh spot. This is what the rappers be smoking and talking abt. High quality bud fool

VPhenomenal strain. Everything you want an Indica to be. Superior relief of stress, negative thoughts, and joint pain. Has definitely made a positive impact on some hip joint pain I&#39;ve been experiencing from running so much lately. I really enjoy that it is not a coma-inducing Indica that parks you on a couch all night. Instead, it provokes imaginative thought, and inspires creativity all while keeping you extra chill. This is a perfect strain for that &#39;right-after-work&#39; smoke. Quite possibly my favorite strain to date.

INSTANTLY cured nausea from some medication side effects I was having. Pain is melting away in that wave of tingly relaxation feeling you get sometimes. All in all, so far so good, could possibly become one of my top 2 or 3 strains.

VI really like this.  Got a half gram cart from Select at Urbn Leaf.  All Select carts work just perfect so no dramas there.  This has a really nice head-y high.  It\u2019s not going to drop you into couch lock after the first hit but it has a nice relaxing head high.  Great for those nights that you want to have some conversation beyond \u201cwho ate all the Cheetos?\u201d  Speaking of Cheetos, not a lot of munchies with this strain.  Once your ready to call it a night this one will help you get there.  Wouldn\u2019t do it during the day if I had much to get done but it\u2019s not as heavy as some indicas or indica heavy hybrids I\u2019ve had.  Treat yourself to an evening with Barry O.  You\u2019ll dig it.

VTurns out you can smoke hope and change! Obama Kush induces a strong relaxation and calmness, leaving you feeling pleasant and at ease. The genetics of Obama Kush seem to be up for debate; some say it&#39;s a cross between Afghani and OG Kush, others suggest a cross between Mendocino Purple and Bubba Kush, and still more suggest an Afghani x OG Kush father crossed with a Skunk x Unknown mother. One thing that&#39;s certain is that you need to give Obama Kush a try.

VObama Kush provides a rich sensory experience that lets my imagination wander, but profoundly relaxes my body (and provides great pain relief doing so).  Interesting, tingly body high that I can feel from my head to my toes - feels kind of like a summer breeze.  Don&#39;t expect to be too alert after trying this strain, but you may be talkative/verbose.  I likw to take this before bed; I feel more alert the next morning.  Overall, would recommend.

VI got to try this earlier and I gotta say, wow. I was not expecting it to be this good. I&#39;m not really a indica person either so I was impressed. It&#39;s a very nice solid indica left me high for a good 4 hours or so off just one bong rip (that&#39;s crazy considering I smoke every other day) so good overall but It gave me the WORST cottonmouth (drymouth) I&#39;ve ever had. Maybe I just hit it to hard but when I hit it earlier today it was fine. Still a pretty nice strain good high and good flavor.

VI admit I am rather disappointed with Obama... the strain, however, is GREAT!\u000a\u000aMy nug was from &quot;The Bloom Room&quot; in SF, California. It was big and fluffy for just a gram, which is great since I consume about two eighths a week. It&#39;s purple color and extremely fuzzy exterior make it easy to recognize and the sweet aroma is pungent and alluring.\u000a\u000aOverall the high isnt perfect on its own unless you are using to medicate. I like throwing in some sativa to balance out the high if I plan to be active. 9.5/10 simply by my preference: 10/10 overall

Definitely a recommendation for nerve issues and a good time. \u000a(I&#39;ve tried oil, and flower with the same effect, which is rare)

VSweet, spicy, and skunky!  This is a great &#39;purple&#39; strain with more kick than your usual Purple Afghani or Thai type strains (likely from the addition of OG Kush).  You get the sweet smell and flavor of &#39;purple&#39; mixed with a nice OG Kush spice/funk.  The high is very balanced; giving you the full body relaxation of an Indica mixed with a soaring creative head high than you&#39;d expect from OG Kush and it&#39;s relatives.  Not too much munchies, but also not too &#39;racing&#39; or anxiety inducing.  All in all, a really nice strain that mixes the best of two worlds together for a balanced and very fun high.  It reminds me of &#39;Diablo&#39; (Diablo Kush) which is also an OG cross that exhibits purple tendencies.

VWell so far I am very happy to say that Obama has finally done me right. The strain I purchased was from Oregon Bud Company (Beaverton Location) and man let&#39;s just say wonderful heavy head high, but not to heavy, bud taste a lil fruity and has a hint of menthol to it, wonderful fruity earthy smell. won&#39;t give it a five just because it&#39;s not on the level of Gorilla Glue I have purchased from there but THC content not as high, great smoke and definitely recommend to anyone that loves that good old fashion head high that makes you just wanna chill.

Vyou&#39;ve seen my reviews and it&#39;s UBC Chemo. Not Obama LLama Mohjarra whatever. Now available in seed, UBC Chemo was invented by Dr. David Suzuki in the low 1970&#39;s for cancer or chemotherapy patients. Dr. Suzuki knew what indica to invent by the High THC vs. CBD and CBN that most benefited the ailed. A substantial chemistry discovery to a massive cerebral to body combination was invented by him. To say the least the high CBD and CBN content in the plant is being sought after scientifically more so than socially, leisurely, and recreationaly. I&#39;ve been sent from direct usage to elaborate this true testimonial. Sent me into three hours of paranoia, anxiety and all around F*ck&#39;d up. Wanted to hide out with guests present. Massive THC production combined gives terrible munchies after initial rush vanished. Hate chocolate but had a milkshake and liked it. Can put you as one within,. Top grade medical rails.

Definitely indica, but I was able to stay awake with my friends and enjoy the high for the majority of the night. A very potent strain. My friends tolerances aren&#39;t as high as mine, but I&#39;ve seen them smoke a bowl of this delicacy, and could not stop laughing for quite some time. 10/10, everyone NEEDS to try!!

Finished a few things around the house here and there for a good hour or so but Smoked some more and I was asleep in minutes. Definitely a late night, ultra-relax giggly strain. I was laughing at the dumbest shit while laying down. I&#39;m not sure if I was exhausted or the strain put me to sleep. Pain is relieved very easily. Muscles relaxed, mind relaxed, giggly as hell.

VIMO not much flavor compared to other strains.  If anything slightly menthol.  Sits center chest about three inches above the sternum and moves up to the top of your tongue.  Effects are light but not so much to put me in the couch for hours.  I feel slightly motivated and had an amazing walk in the park.  Pain is gone, no pain at all which is always amazing.  Took about three hits on the vape pen at 320 degrees.  Felt slight effects in about six minutes, and full effect in ten to twelve minutes.  A new favorite to watch movies, do dishes, some light baking, and fun conversations.\u000a\u000aUPDATE EDIT: After using this for a couple weeks, it&#39;s more menthol than I like.  In addition, the vape pen cartridge cracked when I bent over in my pocket.  Went everywhere.  The effects are great, just too much like smoking tobacco IMO.

VI received a fresh batch of Obama Kush. this indica is very heavy when consuming in large quantities. I smoked a large joint to myself and laid down with headphones on listening to some Led Zeppelin and the next thing I know I felt like I was tripping. My body felt as though it was vibrating. I suffer from a back strain right now, and I didn&#39;t notice any pain for that night into the next day. this strain is amazing, and I will definitely be looking forward to receiving it again.

VVery nice indica strain great looking frosty light green with spots of purple throughout. Taste is very different it has a sweetness to it but I can&#39;t really detect any other flavor that I usually get with a sweet tasting bud just a woody flavor with a hint of something skunky. Anyway usually I smoke sativa when I want to keep awake and have things to do and indica when I&#39;m ready for bed but this strain while deffinetly feeling all indica doesn&#39;t make you feel sleepy at all. So if you like indica and don&#39;t want to be headed off to bed half an hour after smoking this could be a strain for you but if you&#39;re battling insomnia and looking for something to help you sleep look somewhere else.

VTasty, burns good and goes down smooth, oh and smells great. Gives you a good relaxed body high but also lets you stay a little active and social. The only downside I felt was, when I smoked a little bit too much and it made me a little paranoid.\u000a\u000a

VBombdigity butI grew my own and was tested at 21.9% because I obama care. I couldn&#39;t get enough of the flavor and the buzz can be a bit of a creeper but nothing overwhelming for the light weights. If its grown organic at its best it will have a earthy chocolate licorice taste thats like no other you can find. Its not a heavy indica at all as I write this I just smoked a bowl out the B-rizzle and I feel super deedooper like scoobydoo and the Gang weed to me. It makes me want to get into whatever I do and investigate deeper, I love weed like this because it has a multi effect.

VI think the euphoria, relaxed; but not sedative feeling this strain produces is good but still not as good euphoria as a strain like OG Kush or Trainwreck. Still a good classic strain that\u2019s been very pleasant in all of my experiences, considering all of this I would say Obama Kush is a good strain to try if you like euphoric strains.

VI love the taste, but it seemed a little dry to me and weak. I have a mini pipe but I haven&#39;t smoked in months and usually one or two hits will get me but I really didn&#39;t feel much. I was a bit tired after the second bowl but it was also 11:30 at night. I&#39;d say give it a try but it&#39;s a little weak. The app made it seem as if Green Theory was more affordable but it was $50 for two grams which seems a bit steep to me.

The buds are tight and huge like most Indica but this is 65% - 35%! It is a creeper, and when viewing the bids you will see a bright orange in about 60% of the bud! But when ground, it turns purple! Highly recommend anybody to try this one! This is a blend that was done right and has been around for years!

So it&#39;s great for portion control. \u000a\u000a3/5 - High doesn&#39;t seem to last too long roughly 30-40ish minutes. Re-Vaped 3 more times to kinda keep it at a 5-6ish level

I never liked to smoke A LOT as it didn&#39;t do anything special. Obama Kush changed that for me wish I was smoking 24/7-Life would be good.

VJust got done curing some from a grow I did and it was some frosty weed to say the least. Golf ball sized buds mostly and extremely dense. Taste&#39;s like grapes and a hint of chocolate.  I really enjoyed the buzz from it. Hit&#39;s you right away with a lot of power. You could easily go to sleep right afterwards, but if you can manage to stay awake, which isn&#39;t easy, it really turns into a euphoric buzz, that is good for watching movies with pizza.   Definitely is a Bubba Kush x Mendo Purps cross, not OG Kush x Afghani, like Leafly has. You can tell by the taste and the buzz. Tastes just like Bubba and Mendo exactly. OG Kush is more lemony and Afghani has a more dank smell. This OBK is quick growing and decent yielding. Very dense buds once again, covered in resin.

VWhen my friends that partake get together for a weekend, there often is a sort of strain theme that casts its haze over the event. This past weekend that haze came from Obama Kush. Oddly enough I had this Indica on my mind before the weekend but was unable to pick some up before heading to the coast. When I arrived at the resort, I found that two of my friends had the same thought! We smoked Obama Kush all weekend, starting around noon and continuing into the night. \u000a   I gave it a cautious 4 stars this time around, but expect it will gain another star with more experiences.

VFirst off, fuck Barry.\u000a\u000aThat said, I acquired a small amount of this as a sample, from a source I failed to record. Very nice well balanced strain. Relaxing and clear, focused at the same time. Possible anxiety for light weights I would guess.

VThis stuff really lives up to it&#39;s name.  Since using it my taxes have doubled and my insurance has tripled.  It must cause paranoia as well as I often feel the government is watching me and listening to my cell phone.   It also gives me feelings of compromised national security and betrayal of allies.  Thankfully munchies can be addressed with a government approved ration of apple OR banana.  Too powerful for my liking.
