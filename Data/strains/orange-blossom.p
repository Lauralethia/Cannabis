VThe description is very accurate. This is a uniquely tasty strain that will leave you feeling as comfortable as possible. Great for anxiety, it is heady and friendly.

VThe first strain I tried from Falcanana and it was delicious. Super citrusy and a subtle aftertaste, this 60/40 Indica Is still a great option for a not too heavy high and a light munchie session

VHas a nice citrus smell and taste to it. Very nice relaxed high for me. Would be disappointed if there was no orange smell/flavor to it since it has orange in the name.

VWhen I smoked this strain, I felt instant happiness and positivity. This is a great strain for depression. Absolutely no paranoia. The only negative thing I have to say about this strain is that the landing is kind of abrupt.
