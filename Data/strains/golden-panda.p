VSmells and tastes delicious but not heavy, it reminded me of a lemon tree leaf. Very tingly and happy afterglow lasts a couple of hours.

VI like this. Currently dealing with my monthly curse so I needed something to take the edge off of these cramps &amp; help ward off my fatigue. I had a pre-roll (3 hits). This high is light but my body feels light, not stuck in the couch. But I feel nice.

VI typically deal with depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. This strain was on sale so I thought I would try it, and it was a really good choice. It helped my body relax, relieved my anxiety/depression, and definitely got me stoned and it let&#39;s you watch netflix all night but still have the energy to get up and cook dinner for the on coming munchies. \u000a\u000a(PS. I wrote this stoned)

VDefinitely gaining an appreciation for this strain! Didn\u2019t initially think it did much, but then realized I\u2019d cleaned, played w/ the dogs &amp; made food for my sexy (this makes him even sexier) man.  \u000aSorry... i just smoked a bowl &amp; feeling it (a creeper).  This makes the mind go to fun places! \u000aFor a girl who must have MMJ multiple times throughout the day, I\u2019m loving this! Not euphoric or scattered. Just happy! And my pain went from level 7 to a 5.  I normally need a damn stoney indica or hybrid to do that, but then couched for an hour. Very high tolerance!! \u000aThis is a keeper! Reminding myself to pick up 1/4-1/2oz later. Perfect daytime med!

VI&#39;m reviewing the stuff I got from bloom Phoenix indica. Its great it really reduces anxiety significantly helps with pain a nice amount, I use it throughout the day without any problems with munchies. Be careful it&#39;s strong however, might be sitting down initially after the the beginning then something kicks in after 30 mins or so and you want to do things. All while having a nice happy pleasant time. Migraine relief is there but it&#39;s temporary for me as it always is.
