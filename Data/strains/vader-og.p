VGreat strain for just kicking back and relaxing. This kush made me feel really cozy and want to watch TV and eat. Definitely a strong strain for memory loss in my opinion. I always forget shit and get confused. But I really like this strain.

VIntense flowery piney scent and nugs completely frosted with trichomes. Didn&#39;t get numbers but had to be THC in the mid to high 20s. Basically makes my eyes close the second I smoke it. Does a give a burst of euphoria at first but I use it mostly as a sleep aid since it&#39;s such a day ender for me.

VI only smoke Indicas. Vader is a bit of a creeper, definitely going straight to a body high with a tiny bit of cerebral high around 10-15 minutes.. It&#39;s very relaxing and melted my stress right away. I can&#39;t comment on its effects on pain yet but overall it&#39;s very chill. I bought this at Natty Rems downtown Denver.

VBeautiful smooth light and uplifting feelings, without the sedating type effects, brought on by most Indicas. \u000a\u000aI am diagnosed with epilepsy, and I found this strain to help me smooth out the jolts brought on by a seizure as most Indica do, but without falling feeling super groggy. \u000a\u000aIn most cases (aside from high CBD strains) I cannot ingest MMJ during the day since I have a very low tolerance and I tend to fall right asleep. This - not so much the case. It has all of the CBD goodness, but with a nice clean, airy feeling about itself.

VThe buds I had, had a few hairs and crystals but, they were pretty dense. The taste and smell again didn&#39;t really stand out to me. A mild sweet smell &amp; a mild spicy taste is the best I could describe it. Then come the effects and they are awesome. My mind would bounce around playfully as the nice body relaxation creeps in eventually putting me to sleep. A great night time strain. FOUR AND A HALF STARS!!
