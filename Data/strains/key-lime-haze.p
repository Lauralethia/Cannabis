VThis strain was great for the first week, then it seemed to lose all of its potency and allure.\u000a\u000aIn the beginning, it was very fragrant and gave a fairly intense head high that lasted for a few hours.\u000a\u000aAfter the first week, though, it didn&#39;t seem to have the same punch that it once had. We found ourselves needing more medicine for the same desired effect.\u000a\u000aThe fragrance was nice, a very clean citrus scent with a hint of the woodsy outdoors. The taste was a delicate citrus flavor at first, but diminished into a more acidic, pine flavor over time.\u000a\u000aOverall it&#39;s just a mediocre strain in our opinion. This was fine for a one time purchase, but we won&#39;t be going with this strain again.

VExtremely dank/pungent smell. Filled my room almost instantly when I opened it. Bud looks really nice, crystals and orange hairs upon close inspection. The smell could be a little better though, as it doesn&#39;t match the obvious lime smell of the flower. I give this a 4/5

VOooo this may be a new under-the-radar classic! Very little known about this strain but I received a batch and it\u2019s phenomenal!! The buds look like textbook indica, dark green with dark orange fibres laced throughout, and the high is the perfect 50/50 which leads me to say this is actually an Hybrid. It smells like grass, reminding me of classic, highschool weed and the high has been nostalgic af! Don\u2019t let this regular lookin strain fool ya!

VA touch of lime flavor is nice on the nose.  This Hybrid Sativa is enough to give you an energy boost by not too much that your eyes water and you have enough energy to run a marathon (although those are great at times).\u000a\u000aDrying and Curing spot on!

VBeautiful sweet buds, large and dense with vibrant orange hairs. The buds smelled strongly of Lime, and the smoke even had a lime after taste. The bud was very strong and gave a huge head high. In my experience it was a bit too intense. My body felt tingly and I felt a little bit anxious and paranoid. If smoked in a lower quantity I could definitely see this strain being used to treat depression and to handle stress.
