VPitbull is from Stoney Girl Gardens Portland, OR. This stuff is for serious users only. THC content sometimes as high as 36%. This stuff knocks you on your ass. It was like bullet to the head, instantly high! This is some great third generation ganja! Great work breeders.

VThis strain has become my go-to for pain relief. I suffer from chronic, intractable pain as a result of a spinal cord injury so I was looking for a strain that would help relieve the pain. On exhale, I was already feeling less pain. Three bowls in and the pain is no longer as significantly noticeable. Very mellow high, but still strong enough to kick your ass to bed if you need it to. I absolutely love this strain.

V        Pit bull is supposed to potent like close to 30% or above it. when I buy from dispensaries in Oregon where this stuff is from it&#39;s always in the low teens. So I got a few clones and grew this stuff indoor. It completed flowering in 6-7 weeks and is very potent. The sugar leaves might as well be flower because they are covered in resin, even the fan leaves are covered. I wish I knew the THC level but I don&#39;t. It hits you with a strong body high that melts away pain and anxiety. This strain will do the same even with low THC content. The high slowly moves to a relaxing head high for me. This is one of my favorite strains, in my top 5.

VI was pleased that this strain nearly lived up to its lofty namesake - Pitbull. I smoke a half a joint of this stuff late at night sitting in my car, and proceeded to jam out to some tunes w/ my Beats headphones. I can&#39;t remember when music sounded that good! It definitely hits fast, though not hard (for me) as advertised. A really chill high - it was juuuuust right. This phenotype had a pleasantly skunky footprint too

VThis is the first strain I wont be smoking again...and i think it has more to do with me than the strain itself. My tolerance is pretty low especially compared to other new smokers, so i tend to get high pretty easily. But after smoking this i could feel the high coming on after about 3 or 4 minutes and it started with my vision. Had that wobbly effect which i dont mind... kinda enjoy it actually. But then i got a heaviness in the bottom of the back of my head and top of my neck. Just felt like it was really heavy and that there was lots of pressure. over the course of the next 40 minutes or so the &quot;weight&quot; slowly left my neck and crawled down the rest of my body. Shoulders, Chest, Arms,. and then my stomach... it wasnt pleasant for me cuz it felt like i had a 50 pound bowling ball sitting on my gut. It eventually passed and i enjoyed it after the &quot;weight&quot; left my body... but this is the second time it happened so i wont be toking this anymore. \u000aMy wife is a huge fan of it and her tolerance is quite a bit higher so she didnt have the issues that i had... she did however also have that heaviness at the top of her neck she said. \u000aFull body high was too much for me

VI vaped this from a Pax Era pod from Avitas and I had the same negative experience with this every time I used it. This has the body heaviness of an indica but it was also an extremely cerebral high. It made me feel paranoid, anxious, and my mind would spin obsessively. I felt very creative and I was able to come up with some good ideas, but I found myself hyper focused on them. This is just a bad high.

VThis is the first strain I wont be smoking again...and i think it has more to do with me than the strain itself. My tolerance is pretty low especially compared to other new smokers, so i tend to get high pretty easily. But after smoking this i could feel the high coming on after about 3 or 4 minutes and it started with my vision. Had that wobbly effect which i dont mind... kinda enjoy it actually. But then i got a heaviness in the bottom of the back of my head and top of my neck. Just felt like it was really heavy and that there was lots of pressure. over the course of the next 40 minutes or so the &quot;weight&quot; slowly left my neck and crawled down the rest of my body. Shoulders, Chest, Arms,. and then my stomach... it wasnt pleasant for me cuz it felt like i had a 50 pound bowling ball sitting on my gut. It eventually passed and i enjoyed it after the &quot;weight&quot; left my body... but this is the second time it happened so i wont be toking this anymore. \u000aMy wife is a huge fan of it and her tolerance is quite a bit higher so she didnt have the issues that i had... she did however also have that heaviness at the top of her neck she said. \u000aFull body high was too much for me

VSweet sweet SHATTER! The nectar of the gods! Worth more than gold even. PITBULL shatter is golden amber and hits with a little kick to the back of the throat. But it is some seriously sweet and fruity citrusy tasting concentrate and I tell you what it packs a punch that will put a stony smile on even the most veteran smokers face. I&#39;m baked! I just took two phatty dabs and my brain and chest feel tingly fuzzy and warm. My eyelids are feeling a bit heavier but I feel alive and happy  and I feel  like if I get out and do something now before the indica effects kick in I could actually function and have a really good time but have that full body indica baked buzz going on at the same time. I do in fact plan on going out to the bar tonight because my brother is in town for Christmas! This Pitbull shatter is the cherry on top of my night out for sure! :D  Very nice!

VThis def the strain for nights I can&#39;t sleep and/or need to go to bed early. Headache pain (4-5) started latter end of my work day. Nausea (5) after I got home from work. Was pretty irritable too. Made dinner &amp; medicated &#39;round 1930. Does not take more than 5 minutes to work which is fan-freakin-tastic. Headache pain gone. Nausesa 3 @ worst before going to bed. Do not take Pitbull if you need to be alert or are going to be driving. Cuz you aint gonna do nuthin but pass out after Pitbull! Eliminated irritability as well. Very nice, mellow high. Only reason I had any anxiety is from arguing with my hubby right before medicating.

VGood, aggressive strain, and while indica-dominant, it is actually more of a hybrid strain. It smells quite flowery and sweet, with some citrus including pineapple and lime.  It&#39;s buds are nice and dense. Green with some red and a slight gold.

VThis was the first strain I ever tried when I was 14 years old. I thought it was the best, until I tried other strains of weed. Pitbull is definitely on the low \u000aend of the spectrum.\u000a\u000a

VI don&#39;t understand how this stuff made it through the rigorous testing procedures. I refuse to mention the quality of this because it is important to point out to any new smokers (I&#39;m a seasoned smoker) that weed/bud, when purchased at a smokeable moisture level should DRY OUT when left in the open. I&#39;ve HAD SOME OF THIS NIGHTMARE ON A TRAY in a dry, warm room for 3 days, and THE SHIT IS STILL MOIST!!!!  Whatever young punk thinks it&#39;s okay to add some kind of chemicals to &quot;keep it from drying out&quot; needs to STOP growing pot.  These &quot;moisturizers&quot; probably worse that the chemicals in tobacco.  Beware &quot;PITBULL&quot; .  Might as well smoke Marlboros.  It has been infected with chemicals, and the buzz is mild at best. Doesn&#39;t taste too good either!
