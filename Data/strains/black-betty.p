VThis Sativa dominant hybrid is a cross between AK-47 and Sour Diesel. Rather spendy at Oregon&#39;s Finest, $14/g. But it is rated at 28% THC. Purchased a gram and rolled it in a wrap to celebrate being hired at a local dispensary with a friend. Immediately felt a head rush, which subsided into a nice upper body and head high. Has a nice light citrus taste, with that earthy diesel finish. Was alert enough to drive to a local food truck for a sandwich. Effects were rather short-lived, but I imagine a concentrate of this same strain would last longer. Very good strain for a party or outdoor setting.

VI have been using this strain for over 4 yrs now and truly enjoy its medical properties. Always grown to perfection, its as easy to grow as any other sativa dominant, indoor or outdoor. We will soon have Black Betty-Jack Herer cross that is super tasty and very serious head and body medication. Black Betty will always be a great flavor and one could never go wrong in purchasing a few choice nugs.

VBlack Betty - smell? check, good and piney\u000a\u000asmokeable? Yes extremely smooth for a newbie wanting this type of high.\u000a\u000aHigh? No, not for me. It chills you out, does not stop you from being productive. Although it is a minor struggle. It does allow you to focus, albeit a bit forceful you will need to be. I would suggest this to someone who already knows how to do a task, but wants to do this task better. It will not allow you to do it better while high on this, Hell barely even practice. It will slow you down so much mentally that you will see ways to do this task better, you will catch yourself making mistakes. After you are off the high make those changes, it is hard enough to do a task on black betty. Again not the one for me.

VBlack Betty, by Hilltop Growers in WA, is an amazing high. The bud is dark purple, almost black, wispy and airy. I was concerned that it was maybe a bit too dry, but after smoking a couple bowls, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.\u000a\u000aThe smell is pungent, sweet, and flowery; while the taste is full of sweet berries. The smoke goes down smooth, and the high hits hard and fast. Be prepared to do a whole lot of thinking, giggling, and not a whole lot else.\u000a\u000aLittle update to this review - after grinding up my second big nug of this, the taste ran heavily to lapsang tea.

VI found some Black Betty at Sweet Leaf Illusions on 82nd across from cartlandia. This Black Betty is some of the prettiest weed I&#39;ve seen, and testing at a impressive 29.5% on THC. Got in before noon and got 10% off the order for just being in before noon.

VThe flowers I got were horrible. There was no pungent smell, besides the smell of wet hay. Absolutley no crystals within the flowers. And they were a dull brown color. To me  it&#39;s no better than mexican weed. Exactly what the high feels like too. Heavy head high that lasts 20 min.
