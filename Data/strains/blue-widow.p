VSuper-long hairs on the bud I got. Had a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. My grinder reeked after I ground this up in it. Had a dirty, sour taste while hitting, and reminded me of food afterwards. Reluctant to catch a flame and burn - wanted to curl out of the bowl when I was smoking it. Very heavy upper-body high, but still able to focus on tasks. Helped reduce my anxiety, but came with some couch-lock. I found myself very tactile-sensitive, an effect I don&#39;t often experience. It wouldn&#39;t be an issue except that it makes me sensitive to the cold, which can be a problem where I live. My dry throat was so bad I had actual thirst; def. worse than with some other strains. After some time I found I had the munchies as well. Had some trouble with my handwriting. Complex effects make me wonder if this strain is worth smoking on days I have other things to do.

VOn occasion I experience anxiety that is so overwhelming it won&#39;t ease off. I don&#39;t like pills and Xanax is a definite no as far as an answer to my attacks.  So I just deal with it.  Until I tried Blue Widow, a friend of mine offered me some when I was having a bad anxiety attack and it was amazing.  The pressure in my chest eased off, my mind was relaxed but not tired.  The feeling is truly hard to explain, but it is definitely something I want in my medicine cabinet to help me through stressful times.  This works so much better than prescription anxiety medicine.

VBLUE WIDOW- INDICA DOMINANT (Blueberry/White Widow)\u000a                               To start: Buds smell of an amazing berry aroma, was impressed.\u000a                               Very smooth, flavors filled my mouth and nose and were quite enjoyable.\u000a                               Did not kick in incredibly hard, it was more of a gradual uplifting mind and body buzz.\u000a                               Mind is clear and sharp, would recommend as both daytime and night time treatment.\u000a                               Body feels very loose and relaxed, but not doped or medicated feeling.\u000a                               Come down: I will let you know in a few hours ;-)\u000a                              Over all Review \u2013 I give it a 10 for quality and effect.

VBlue Widow is one of the best strains I have used to date. Vaping a bowl of this fabulous strain I experinced a wonderful taste through out the first 4 hits. Very tasty and the high really hits you in the head and then late settles down though out the body and reduces pain level to zero ! Never thought the quaility of medicine grown in the desert south west could match that of the North West.

VReally like this Blue Widow.  I actually asked for Blue Mystic at my dispensary, but got this by mistake.  So, I thought, what the heck, I&#39;ll give it a try since I&#39;ve never had it.  NICE!  This strain is very smooth on the intake, with thick white clouds of smoke.  The smell is highly indicative of the potency... both were very strong!!  My hubbie and I are joking around with each other in a light hearted manner and I realize this is a really good strain.  Taste isn&#39;t bad, but  I like the sweeter strains.

VTranquility in a flower, This strain is great if you vape it. The strong blueberry sweet flavors really come out, there is some spicey undertones to it, that is due to the white widow in the cross. \u000a\u000aYou feel a strong kush like high (euphoria / uplift / body numb / energetic). a little goes a long way. \u000a\u000aIf you plan to vape all day using this strain will guarantee you will sleep like a baby if you consume more.\u000a\u000aExcellent strain for pain relief, can be taken in the day, however more preferable to evening or late afternoon. \u000a\u000aThe Blueberry really shines, if you have tried Blue Dream... Blue Widow is an upgrade to really potent genetics. \u000a\u000aYou have close to 18 percent THC and medium amounts of CBD in these genetics. \u000a\u000aThis strain is pretty balanced out but leaning heavily towards the indica side.

Head high made me very social; enjoyed dinner quite a bit with my fam. Tastes like pepper &amp; diesel to me. Crashing hard 2 hours later. Recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea! :-) Really enjoyed this one; gonna hafta try dis one again to decide how I feel bout it.

VWow! \u000aThis is one of the best highs I&#39;ve ever had from weed. I underestimated the potency and it kicked my ass! I&#39;ve never been this high from smoking weed before. A  little goes a long way with Blue widow.\u000a\u000aThe high is VERY clear headed and psychedelic like!! I felt literally &quot;high&quot;. I could think logically well and also be very creative. \u000aI felt uplifted and euphoric. Music sounded orgasmic, I got extreme munchies and holy shit, does food taste amazing on Blue Widow.\u000aThe high kept on getting stronger and stronger like an edible and it lasted well over 3 hours. (Note that I have a low tolerance). I watched Ace Ventura Pet Detective and I couldn&#39;t stop laughing from beginning to end. \u000a\u000aAbsolutely amazing strain. Medically speaking, this is definitely one the best strains out there. You gotta try Blue Widow at least once in your life! \u000a&#128076;

VBlue Widow is a very mellow, relaxing strain. It provides good pain relief without too much of a cerebral &quot;high.&quot; It is better used in the evening as it can make you feel somewhat sleepy within a couple of hours of consumption. This strain causes some serious munchies so if appetite stimulation is what you&#39;re looking for, it is very effective in that regard.

VThis is by far the smoothest concentrate I&#39;ve gotten from Minerva Canna Group. Being that concentrates are generally harsher than bud this allowed me to take big, long lasting hits from a bong with a ceramic nail. \u000aBeing that this is definitely a butane-made concentrate, I can&#39;t comment on flavors being that everything is masked by the taste of the solvent. \u000aI&#39;m feeling uplifted and happy now, this seems like it&#39;d be good for depression, slightly euphoric, but it did agitate my tinnitus but that might not be the medicine. That&#39;s not a big deal to me though. \u000aOther than that I&#39;m very happy with this concentrate. Bravo to whoever made it.

VThe newest phenotype of this strain from The Station is off the chain!!! Great chill mind numbing stone. Classy heavy indica that smells orgasmic, a hint of Blueberry with that sharp fresh tasty White Widow scent! Helps me get to sleep and slow down my thinking. No raciness or paranoia at all. I&#39;m so glad they finally did this strain justice by growing it right. The previous phenotype I had was really weak, this new one from The Station is definitely NOT weak at all. Smoke/Vape enough of this and you&#39;ll be in dream land. If the nugs are frosty, give this a try!!!

VThis Blue Widow is really nice. Has the sweetest grapey taste to it, while the buds look almost blue in color. It&#39;s really beautiful. I feel a rush in the head first, followed by a nice relaxation that is pure mellow. I feel just great right now :) You know that feeling? Where you just smile and have no worries? That is what this strain seems to do. So it&#39;s very nice. I feel as if Blue Widow could be great for night or day use (I&#39;m currently vaporizing it at night). I originally gave this strain a 4 at the beginning of writing this but I now give it a 5. Real clean high that is so relaxing, yet uplifting and happy in the head. I think I have finally found the perfect hybrid. Now that I think of it, I&#39;m getting a really nice pine taste on top of that berry flavor. For those suffering from asthma, this would be good because the a-pinene terpene is a wonderful bronchodilator. I&#39;m so sorry I&#39;m rambling so long on this review! I better stop before I can&#39;t stop. Blue Widow is an amazing flower. Go pick it up if you get the chance :)

VThe first time I had this strain was 3-4 days ago. I picked up 40$ from a friend&#39;s connect and it was very crystallized and dank. This strain hits you hard after a couple hits, depending on whether you smoke repetitively or not. If not, then it&#39;s very harsh to the lungs. Overall had good experiences with this high.

VEXCELLENT !\u000ai am what i call a cheap date when it comes to cannabis, i don&#39;t need much to get high so i regularly microdose. I must say this is a very potent  strain, it doesn&#39;t come on immediately but after 10 minutes you just get hit with a wave of kinda like a &quot;welll helllooo there&quot; feeling. after another 5 minutes it&#39;s just completely euphoric, yet your mind is clear enough that you can write without a hassle (writing this high). My favorite part about this is that i have no anxiety from it, many strains give me anxiety. Even my beloved gsc makes me freak out from time to time but not this.  I really love it, i feel amazing.\u000a\u000aFor the smell it has blueberry smell with a undertone of licorice and some earthyness. A very nice smell indeed, not as fruity as other berry smelling strains. As far as the taste, again a littlebit of that berry taste mixed with pine. The palette feels clean, no dry mouth. (smoked out of a mini bong)\u000a\u000ai&#39;m in love.

Then I discovered that it creates quite a bit of kief in the grinder so that&#39;ll be nice to enjoy later.  This is a really nice smooth smoke as well.  The smell is quite nice - almost a piney or balsam quality.

VNice compact beautiful dark green and purple buds, with some dark orange calyxes spread through out. The frostiness of the flowers are definitely reminiscent of the widow side. The smell is spicy and skunky. The taste is sweet with a bit of spiciness. It almost reminded me of rotten berries.  \u000aIt&#39;s a pretty euphoric high, which takes a little bit to settle in. But once it does, it settles into a nice relaxation. I found it stimulated creativity, and was a bit stronger than I expected.

VGreat strain over all. This bud didn&#39;t exactly take the cake as far as looks go, but let me tell you one break and trichomes are very apparent. It&#39;s makes up for it in the smell and taste. First initial scent is an earthy almost slightly pumpkin and carries on into a sweet juicy berry aroma. Very smooth smoke, not harsh at all on the inhale. Great for physical pain and or depression. As soon as you take a puff, a heavy indica effect sets into your body. About 5-10 minutes afterwards a nice subtle sativa tone reveals it&#39;s presence. This is a savy hybrid fond of bringing relaxation and hunger. This is a good all day smoke, and an even better treat when the moon is in the sky. If you&#39;re looking soothe yourself from pain or discomfort this is a great strain for you. If you&#39;re fond of happy feelings from the blueberry genetics and are a fan of Indica, then you will love this strain.

VI smoked guys at 7am, when I woke up to early this morning, after several nights of drinking, while still laying in bed. What an awesome body high! My bed felt like it was made of water and I could&#39;ve sworn my arms and legs were unattached to my body. My mind was so calm and relaxed as I thought about various &quot; to dos&quot; in my life. I was comforted, not overwhelmed, by all the work I had to do. I fell back asleep for several hours, and woke up again feeling so refreshed!

VThis Blue Widow is really nice. Has the sweetest grapey taste to it, while the buds look almost blue in color. It&#39;s really beautiful. I feel a rush in the head first, followed by a nice relaxation that is pure mellow. I feel just great right now :) You know that feeling? Where you just smile and have no worries? That is what this strain seems to do. So it&#39;s very nice. I feel as if Blue Widow could be great for night or day use (I&#39;m currently vaporizing it at night). I originally gave this strain a 4 at the beginning of writing this but I now give it a 5. Real clean high that is so relaxing, yet uplifting and happy in the head. I think I have finally found the perfect hybrid. Now that I think of it, I&#39;m getting a really nice pine taste on top of that berry flavor. For those suffering from asthma, this would be good because the a-pinene terpene is a wonderful bronchodilator. I&#39;m so sorry I&#39;m rambling so long on this review! I better stop before I can&#39;t stop. Blue Widow is an amazing flower. Go pick it up if you get the chance :)

VI enjoyed this strain. It was testing lower around 18% THCa and was on sale so i picked up an 1/8th plus i was interested in trying a strain with some white genetics for the 1.2% CBGa content and stomach relief. The buds didn&#39;t have pistols but were a rich darkish shade of green and were sprinkled heavily in trichomes. The scent that came through to me was a musky-berry scent which was very pleasing to the nose. Vaping this strain didn&#39;t provide a distinct taste however i stuffed a cone and it was a very blueberry flavored smoke sesh with that jay. Definitely was a relaxing, uplifted high from this strain but I was also ready to go to bed after a long day and smoking some of this before bed. Nausea was relieved and stomach pain from eating too much from other strain&#39;s munchies was relieved. The higher CBG content made my stomach feel pretty good thanksgiving weekend when i vaped/smoked this 1/8th.

VFantastic strain, tastes wonderful and kicks like a mule. Smells like crazy when you crack open a nug, almost like a pine-sol household cleaner type smell. It will smell your place up and the neighbors will know what you&#39;re up to ! Incredibly potent smoke and a little harsh and expansive on the exhale. I &#39;m an experienced smoker and I was pretty much whacked after 3 good hits on a joint about 2/3rd&#39;s the size of a cigarette. After finishing the entire joint I was pleasantly cooked and pain free for a few hours. Definitely will buy this strain again .. A+++

Vive been a blue smoker for yeeeeaaaars....by far my fav strain for its consistency in effects. this particular strain of bw i got was fantastic....not quite as narcotical as my all time favs gdp and larry og but deff works fast and stays with me, relieving pain from a broken neck and a tore up shoulder (both were surgically repaired, but many can attest, repaired doesnt mean the pain is anywhere near gone)..im a indica smoker and this is deff a top shelf indica...ive also suffered from insomnia and severe anxiety for a long time....as with most buds the bw will cause a short spike in anxiety upon the initial high but quickly fade into a very peaceful state...this allows me to finally relax and get some rest....between this, gdp, larry og and the original blueberry strain i think ive found the proper meds for my issues.....now if indiana would just get their head out of their.....and this isnt the 1st time ive had bw, ive just decided now after experiencing it enough to give a hobest review...

I felt like my body was static on a T.V. and my mind was in the clouds, but I was still very able to hold and make conversation. It took roughly 15-20 minutes to fully set in for me, but stayed strong for a good hour, and finally settled into a mellow Indica-like haze for a nice hour to 1.5 hours afterwards. A more than solid Hybrid in my book.

VI&#39;ve always been envious of cannaseurs who can &quot;smell &amp; taste&quot; different aromas in their bud.  I usually feel like, yep it smells like weed and it tastes like weed.  I&#39;ve never had the ability to detect different notes.  UNTIL I tried Blue Widow.  I said, &quot;Hey, this smells like mints&quot;.  I thought maybe I was imagining it, but my husband noticed the same thing.  Then when smoked, it TASTES slightly minty!  Not sure if anyone else noticed this with this strain, but we sure did!  I was thinking this was good for the giggles (a fun high) but I may have smoked too much, because it really relaxed me and then I was in bed and down for the count!  Great for pain relief, sleeping, and relaxing.... but not the &quot;fun&quot; high that I was hoping for.  Great strain overall.

VNot very strong but I do like the effects. The effects are pretty simple, mellow, relaxing, a little euphoric, and a mild body high. No negatives. If only it were stronger... Which is why I made edibles out of it. Vaping it didn&#39;t result in much effect, just a very mild mellowing. To get where I wanted with vaping this I&#39;d have to vape more than I&#39;d want. Drinking home made cannamilk with Blue Widow on the other hand was super mellowing and relaxing, allowed me to chill out after work and then get to bed more easily. My advice with this strain is to make an edible or drink like I did out of it.

VI have been experimenting with many different strains to find relief for the pain I suffer due to a broken neck in 1999.  I have bone, muscle and nerve pain that are almost constant.  Of all strains I&#39;ve tried to date, Blue Widow is the only one to knock the pain completely out.  It&#39;s pretty potent, as well.  First time I felt high from weed in quite a while.  They try to keep it at my local dispensary for me, but it&#39;s worth the search!  \u2764\ufe0f

VI smoke for medical reasons and am not an expert. I&#39;m giving reviews based on my experience with each strain, coming from a beginner perspective. \u000a\u000aI have Multiple Sclerosis, fibromyalgia, under-active thyroid, and am B-12 deficient. I deal with bad chronic pain, constant fatigue, insomnia, headaches, numbness, vertigo, and muscle weakness and spasms. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m not one of those people that enjoys the smell of weed, I actually don&#39;t care for the smell at all, but this one has a really nice fruity scent. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m only giving 3 stars because I&#39;m really not getting to feel any of the benefits besides sleep. I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s helpful with pain, spasms, or depression. Within 30 minutes all I want to do is have a snack and go to sleep. If that&#39;s something you need help with, this is the best I&#39;ve tried! It put me into a nice, deep sleep for several hours, which my body really needed, but I couldn&#39;t do anything else on it. Smooth, with a slight blueberry flavor and mild smell. It does give some wicked cotton mouth. \u000a\u000aI will keep a small amount in regular rotation, but only for when I have insomnia.

VThis shit was good. It took away my anxiety, kept me mellow and super productive. \u000a\u000aI gave this strain to my married friend and the second she smoked it, her skin turned blue, her husband died, and now she&#39;s a blue widow.\u000a\u000aSo if you have a uterus and you&#39;re married, I wouldn&#39;t recommend smoking this unless you hate your husband and have a thick set of makeup to cover up your blue skin.

VI have alot of nerve damage from sooooo many surgeries. It really help with the muscular pain. Others have a tendency to where I can feel my heart beating in the spasm and it&#39;s not pleasant. This seems to help for that particular problem.
