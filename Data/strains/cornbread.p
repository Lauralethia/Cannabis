Vpicked up an 1/8 at Reef in Las Vegas, was very excited to try this again. Opened the jar and took my first smell, definitely not what I smelled at Reef or ever before. This flower smelled like a wet towel that sat on the floor in a boys locker room for a month. Threw a little in a V2 and sat back to enjoy a smooth inhale and cornbread taste upon exhale. Very functional high, totally forgot about all my worries and pain to zone out on the tv. Slept like a champ at night 45 minutes later

VOne of my new favorite indicas,the buds were fluffy, colorful and gave off an aroma that almost made your stomach growl, like someone was preparing food in the kitchen it smelt so good. Smooth smoke and a great taste. And a great keif yield when I tossed in my grinder. Definitely in my new top 5 favorite strains

VThis is a great strain. It relaxes me. I had one of the most deep and emotional (in a good way) talks with my wife last night after imbibing. The only thing is... it seems to act more like a Sativa for us. It is very rare for me to fall asleep faster while high. My wife on the other hand is the exact opposite of me. She sleeps very easily and quickly after smoking. Well, if this strain has kept her up for longer than normal on multiple occasions, I know it isn&#39;t just me. It actually took me a bit longer to get to sleep than normal. \u000a\u000aSo, while I love this strain and it&#39;s smell and effects, it just doesn&#39;t seem to be a nighttime strain, for me.

VI&#39;ve been seeing Cornbread around the dispensaries lately and my interest was piqued... asked the budtender about it, she said &quot;heavy indica, define couch lock.&quot; Funny thing is, it doesn&#39;t give me couch lock at all. It&#39;s relaxing, makes me happy, and it makes me get very into whatever I&#39;m doing/watching/taking about. Maybe it&#39;s just because it makes me feel so pain and stress free, but I remained alert and attentive with no sleepiness for several hours while smoking Cornbread. I highly recommend it.

Vthis strain has a taste similar to cornbread being slightly to no sweet but maybe a little touch of spice or peppering but it has a very subtle feel, you could smoke this and function easily through your day, body mildly buzzed but not couch locked. let&#39;s say that.

VThis is my new favorite strain to smoke. Corn Bread isn&#39;t rated as a strain that brings out euphoria, but that is its major effect on me. Not only does it relax me, it brings out my sillies. That makes it the perfect companion for late night standup specials on Netflix or comedy podcasts. Try listening to Tom Segura after some corn bread. I doubt you&#39;ll regret it.

VAfter struggling with high anxiety levels, this bud completely calmed me down and gave me a nice body high and comfortable head space. felt very euphoric, and completely uplifted. overall a really good strain if you struggle with high anxiety and depression.

VLook I went to the green room in the D and they wanted my meds. ..and I could see why lol great people great place but this day had little to entice me didn&#39;t have anything that I wanted on the menu sold out which is good so as I&#39;m listening and smelling and looking at some meds I hear the guard say that the cornbread got his eyes buggy as he complains to his computer screen and I loved it so much that he said that. ..lmao so I got an 8er then some forum cut gsc and no shit review that next lol... this is straight perfume and lemons from a cup winner in the green room nice trim on this but not so much on the pineapple trainwreck ...cornbread looks amazing tastes better

VLove it! Very relaxing, and rather intense. Love the  strong  earthy/citrusy smell an taste.  It&#39;s my top choice for relaxing, forgetting my problems, watching the tube and it really helps me with insomnia.  My lone complaint is that it is a bit hard to find this strain.

VOhhhh shiiiiit. So good that it was instantly my favorite indica. Head-in-the-clouds, no anxiety, giggly. I suffer from low appetite and Cornbread is proving excellent for my appetite. Body heavy in an enjoyable way -- Pacific Ocean waves, glittering in the late afternoon summer sunlight, crawling slowly and evenly to and from the shore-- that&#39;s how I feel (shit, see? Nice!).

VGreat medicine. Tight, almost leafless and stemless buds. The high is truly balanced. NIce body feeling and euphoric head space but wont put you into &quot;couch lock&quot; like a heavy Indica. The flavor and delicate taste/aftertaste of this strain is very pleasing. One of the best from the summer of 2016 and DD.

VAH this is such a unique amazing strain!!! I specifically love when Craft 710 processes this into hash - I&#39;ve rarely had the flower version of this strain.  I love the sweet corn kushy taste that comes through - the name is very true to the flavor lol.  For me not a super heavy hitting indica but one I enjoy after a long day at work that helps me relax and unwind but not get so couch locked and sleepy - which I enjoy!
