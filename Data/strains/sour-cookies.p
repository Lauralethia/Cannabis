VA great strain for just enjoying your day. Has an abundance of crystals on it, looks like someone sprinkled sugar on it there&#39;s so many. The classic cookie strain taste is definitely here with some diesel after taste. Very uplifting and clear headed high. Anyone who&#39;s a fan of cookie strains will thoroughly enjoy this one.

VSour cookies from Rollwithus. \u000aSour cookies is a great hybrid, at first your uplifted and happy (uplift is very temporary)  then it transitions into a full body relaxed, slugging around the house type day. So I would use small amounts duing day,  then  serveral b-rips at night would put you right out. Nice tight and crisp buds. The taste was not like sour diesel, I got some of the cookie lineage taste but this  was more sweet and flowery. Definatly high in Thc, you can tell &#128521; + long lasting body buzz sticks around about 3 hours. Also felt aroused in that first hour.\u000aMy Scop B+

VEwww, that smell is like formaldehyde. Or, old animal skins. I&#39;ve had sour cookies by a few different growers i.e. Elevate and weed are most memorable. Tight dense sticky lime green nugs with reddish orange hairs. Yellow trich caked all over. Taste breaks down into sweet and stinky. Creamy and skunky. Hints of citrus and diesel. Very euphoric and uplifted. Tingly in body and fidgeting a little struggling to steer the blast of euphoria that teeters on anxiety. Just relaxed enough to let my thoughts race in ignorance as my eyes dart around while I&#39;m cheesin. Dry mouth and dry eyes is noticeable. Appetite up after an hour. I like sour cookies for wake and bakes. Grinding on some video games or getting mindless tasks done. I don&#39;t recommend this for beginners. This strain is very potent.

VThis strain has a very smooth, yet very strong taste to it. It gives off a sweet strong scent, that not only gives you a preview of the taste, but reassures you have a good time with it. On every inhale, the taste feigns harshness to the throat until inhaled fully. The come up is expedient and last for hours from just 2-3 hits but, it being so fast, also helps warn against smoking yourself &quot;stuck&quot;. Its a very pleasent strain to sleep on and workout with. Now my favorite  strain.\u000a\u000aThe combination of the &quot;engange&quot; and &quot;relax&quot; feeling, works perfectly with how I function on days I get to relax alone.

Incredible sour pungent diesel buttery cookie scent covered with tight nugs coated in crystals. Best of both worlds. Strong upbeat effects that immediately put me in a great mood, creeping stronger into a full out stoned feeling. Seems to lean little sativa, not drowsy but still a heavy stoney high. Highly recommend.
