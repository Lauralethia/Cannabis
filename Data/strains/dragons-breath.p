VThis strain is something! The nugs are coated in Trichomes and have a very distinct skunk smell that comes from the nugs! The high from this is amazing everything goes by in like a frame by frame type of visual, and time goes by pretty slow other then that the high is a total wreck!

VDragon&#39;s Breath, Five Star. Initially it appears to be made up of very big fluffy nugs in texture, deceiving to the eyes, they were actually quite dense when the meds were broken down. Prior to rolling up, in the breakdown I noticed nugs were sticky but still manageable enough to do so without a grinder. The scent is dominated by a nostalgic pungency and an earthly taste, equipped with an energetic buzz that can be enjoyed both indoor and outdoors. It smokes well in a moderately tightly wrapped cigarillo. I enjoyed my high.

VMy first time trying Dragon&#39;s breath caught me off guard.  The high was really strong, but not unmanageable or uncomfortable. For me, the high went back and forth several times between my head and body. The head high resulted in increased focus and calmness. The body high gave me tingling waves and limbs made of lead.  The cotton mouth is brutal with this one.

VPhenotype I tried leaned mostly to the Jack side and effects matched, although slightly heavier. Type of sativa leaning hybrid that puts me in a mellow, focused mood while still having a pretty strong calming body buzz that sets in after a few minutes, very similar to Jack Frost IMO. Anyone who enjoys Jack Herer will love this. 4.5/5.
