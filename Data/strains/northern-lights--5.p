Vmm dank smelling, sweet pine, flowery, and a bit oaky! Packed 1/2 a bowl and I couldn&#39;t even finish, first hit got me high... very light and smooth smoke. Hits heavy, be safe when using this strain. Tastes like sweet pine, flowers, and mineral/dirt. Helped my tendon pain 5/5, dislocated ribs 4/5, neuropathy 5/5, scar tissue pain 2/5, inflammation 5/5, and I felt super chill 5/5, however it hasn&#39;t helped with mental anxiety or depression. This inspired me to try it with a flavored paper, I chose &quot;Black Magic&quot; flavor from Juicy Jay papers - 5/5 baby! Tasted like grilled fruits, it&#39;s so amazing... highly recommend if you like rolling joints - this combo was super amazing! Feels like a hybrid hit - some in the body, some in the head.

VEasily my second favorite bud(AK-47 being my first). Very intense high, almost trippy in a way. Really messed with my concentration. Perfect little buds. Smoked some of this when I was a delivery driver, went to turn around in a driveway only to find out it wasn&#39;t a driveway at all, just some family&#39;s front yard! Lucky that was my last delivery for the day.....

VAmazing strain. My absolute favourite. Great for depression. Personally, it makes me feel like a kid on Christmas morning. The colours are brighter, the sounds are crisper, all of a sudden life is okay and I&#39;m just happy to be a part of it. It&#39;s great for pulling me out of a dark (or ambivalent) headspace. \u000a\u000aAlso, one of the only strains that makes me want to be adventuring outside, rather than curl up under a blanket and eat snacks. Although both options end up being wonderful. After coming down, I immediately crawl into bed and it helps with my insomnia.

VThis is my favorite strain. Even though it is not the best, it tastes great, gives me no negative side effects, and gets me high as hell.  When I smoke this stuff, I feel like making all kinds of stuff like bongs, pipes, steamrollers, and even get creative with joints like cross and diamond joints.  I made a bong out of a supersoaker that we called &quot;The Shotgun&quot; while on this.  Incredible stuff, I recommend this to all stoners, new and veteran.

VI am still pretty new to using marijuana for medical purposes. I have a hard time finding products that do not cause difficult negative effects along with the positive. Some help my pain, but make my anxiety go off the charts, others calm me, but don\u2019t help my pain.\u000a\u000aBut this strain has changed EVERYTHING for me! It makes my pain melt away, I feel happy and light hearted and my anxiety disappears. Plus, despite being an Indica, it makes me energetic and motivated. I have been finally starting to make huge improvements and live more normal days for the first time in years! I don\u2019t feel overly goofy, and feel more like myself than I have in a long time. It helps with my chronic back pain, fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, stomach issues including Gastroparesis, IBS and acid reflux and to calm the neuropathy and muscle spasms in my feet and legs.\u000a\u000aI can\u2019t be more thankful for this strain giving me my life back! My friends and family say that they can see how much better I feel and how much happier I am, but that I don\u2019t seem high. They are actually surprised when I tell them I vaped this because I seem just like my normal old self from before I had these medical issues!\u000a\u000aI used this strain from a Cresco Reserve LLR cartridge. Thank you Northern Lights #5!!

It was so bad that my wife and I started calling the event &quot;the green beast&quot; because I was on the loose scavenging for food all the time.

VHigh was very average. Nothing special at all whatsoever. I got this weed and from my local dispensary and it was &quot;okay&quot;. In fact it was claimed to help PTSD and Anxiety, and yet had a short, minor, and very unenjoyable Panic Attack after taking first couple hits, once this was no longer an option I had to take a xanax 1mg football to calm down. After smoking succeeding the past insident, I was able to enjoyably get high off it, but still nothing special about this high whatsoever.

VNorthern lights #5 x Silver Haze most likely from Sensi seed.  Very vigorous grower, can handle as much fertilizer you can give it without paranoia of nute burn or plant death.  Lush, deep green, almost Burgundy vegetation, medium long internodes, airy, almost tootsie roll smelling buds.  Did well with daily bending and stalk breaking, awesome fungus and mold fighting ability.  Long vegetative time, 90 days.  Short budding time, 45-60 days.  \u000aBuds finish with very little smell after harvesting and curing.  However, when broken up to consume, strong Ammonia/lemony/pine hues abound!!  Strong hitting and euphoric, calm buzz when smoked. Smooth hitting, like smoking from orange juice bong, citrus in palate. Very cerebral!  \u000aGreat Strain overall, but yields per plant are limited when growing in soil/soiless mediums, with a high nutrient intake, hydro should be implemented when concerned with yield.  Also, this strain is also a light hog!  From the moment it springs from a jiffy pot, it quickly grows, overshadowing all other species in the plot...throughout its lifecycle of roughly 150 days!

VWas feeling a little wound up, with racing thoughts, so I decided to try some Northern Lights #5 while watching the 1967 Suspense-Thriller &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; for the first time. It took quite a few hits over about 1/2 an hour to finally feel kind of stoned. I kept getting distracted from the film but gradually faded into a nice high. I would call it a very &quot;curious&quot; high because I kept thinking of things I wanted to look up online. I still felt productive and coherent but I didn&#39;t seem to be able to zone out too well. I ate a bunch of food and then finally went in search of something comedic instead, settling on the british comedy series &quot;Saxondale&quot; for the thousandth time. Overall I think it&#39;s an ok high - glad I tried it but probably wouldn&#39;t seek it out again. It did take the edge off of my anxiety by getting my mind occupied with other things.

VThe first thing I noticed [as I loaded the &#39;reserve live resin from  [Mapleglenn Dispensary] about Northern Lights #5 was a slight fizzy Pepsi taste. Smooth smoking and fresh fruity citrus smell and taste also. It took  a few minutes before the effects came on, and did it  ever. A head and chest excitement like waiting for an old friend or relative you haven&#39;t seen in a while. Then the sensation of full body euphoria like your getting a massage. Pure blissfulness and I think I feel a big smirk coming over my face. This whole family of Northern Lights, Jack Herer, Super Silver Haze, Skunk are #1. Top shelf like no other.

I really loved it.  It was heady, potent and intoxicating.  It definitely felt like an indica, but had a little more energy to it than your average indica.  I could have easily stayed on the couch all evening, but then again I could have gone out and not been too sleepy.   Overall it is a pleasing and versatile strain that has the  potential top please a lot of different kinds of smokers.

VI smoked some &quot;Northern Lights - Five Star General&quot; I bought at One Draw Two probably six months ago.  My blood pressure went down from 160/110 to 128/82 within a half hour. Dosage was perhaps 1/20th of a gram. I was skeptical of all the reports on the Internet about marijuana lowering blood pressure because the legitimate medical web sites are not emphasizing it. So I bought my own blood pressure monitor and am experimenting with it. I am not and have never been on any blood pressure medication. Along with the reduction in BP, however, your heart rate will go up 10 to 20 beats per minute for about an hour. The blood pressure monitor showed both the increase in heart rate and reduction in BP as expected. If you don&#39;t smoke weed every day, however, it&#39;s been reported that your blood pressure will INCREASE for the first hour after smoking before it goes down. It only goes straight down if you&#39;re a daily smoker like I am. Smoking indica to help me sleep is perhaps the reason I&#39;m still alive. I didn&#39;t know my blood pressure was so high, and also did not know I was lowering it every night by smoking weed. It&#39;s 12 hours later now and I&#39;m up to 157/104 so I&#39;ll take another hit. Heart rate is back down to 73. Millions of people are taking blood pressure medications they don&#39;t need, they could switch to smoking Indica and indica dominant hybrids to reduce blood pressure. The pharmaceutical industry will certainly try to repress and dispute this information since it would mean they lose billions of dollars. Buy a blood pressure monitor and see for yourself.

I loved falling asleep on this; those silly flights of creative fancy i get before i fall asleep became  comical.

VThis is one tasty smoke with sweet citrus pine with a earthy aspect, I smoked it down to the roach. The effects come on very smooth and slow compared to other strains that can be intense. A wave of relaxation slowly moves throughout your body putting you totally at ease. After a while you get a very mellow trippy psychedelic high to go with the total feeling of peace and contentment. Sitting back listening to music was great as I really connected to the music. I have to say this is the most relaxing feeling of just total contentment. Beautiful strain!

VProbably one of my all-time if not favorite strains. Amazing head/body high, great for my pain and insomnia. This strain had a sweet pine like aroma with a very mellow hit almost no harshness. The taste was over the top on this particular grow. It was like smoking a camping trip in Alaska, sweet mossy undertones with what i could only describe as a wet earthy cold running creek smell and taste in addition to the taste of pine.

VI mistakenly actually wrote this review on the regular northern lights I now realize that the strain was actually this one so please disregard that previous review. ... Now Going in anxious and stressed - First thing you notice is happiness and I\u2019ll be honest it doesn\u2019t hurt that the exact second that I took this damn the nearest popped up on the screen that LeBron James signed with the Los Angeles Lakers my favorite basketball team so that helped but definitely a very happy and relaxing stream I went into this anxious stressed out and not too happy and it completely flipped my mood. If I used a bit more of it it would definitely be a great knock out for later in the night but ultimately you for severe anxiety and severe situation as this is a great heavy medication. Will have you laughing and feeling amazing. I see why it\u2019s Reserve. It\u2019s truly a peaceful strain. So amazing it checks all my boxes. Cresco has been killing it. This is amazing.

VBy far my favourite strain I have ever smoked, within the UK and the Netherlands. Immediate effects of just a general happier being, stress is almost forgotten and any negative thoughts vanish after a joint or two. Would only recommend this to experienced smokers as I feel less experienced may feel a bit manic as it can be a powerful high. Brilliant strain you can smoke throughout the day as there is no fatigue whatsoever but I&#39;ve had a couple of instances where I have suffered mild headaches if I don&#39;t drink loads of water if I&#39;ve smoked over 4 joints in a day but I feel this can be avoided if it is smoked more frequently to keep the buzz alive until you need to sleep. If smoked with a bong the high is obviously much more intense and colours seem vibrant and it has a vague trippy feel but is extremely enjoyable.

It looked fake, so much wax/keef all over. It was not ideal for rolling joints unless you dried it out more.  This was purely one hit and quit stuff back then.  Good memories, good weed!\u000a

VNorthern Lights is a legendary strain lineage, but #5 is a show stopper. Improved taste, improved resin production, easier to grow and even more enjoyable then it&#39;s predecessors. It&#39;s citrus and woody taste mixed with the incredible body stone are what set it apart.\u000aExcellent for a night smoke, but still great doing the day if you are not doing anything really serious. This is one of my all-time favorite strain.

VAfter the first hit I noticed a shift in time everything was slowing down and I was moving really fast. A deeper sense of breath, calm relaxation over my body, very sweet and berry smell/ taste. Reminds me of the effects of another b;ueberry very very strong body but hyper and uplifting attitude different heavy body effects could either be an 8 or a 0, not a fan but I&#39;m going to give this an 8.2 the best of the best ive had so far if taken lightly.

VFull disclosure, I&#39;ve always loved this strain, so I may be a bit biased.  I picked this up at a local San Diego dispensary.  It tested at 28.39% THC, 0.00% CBD, and 0.05% CBN.\u000a\u000aThis batch certainly had bag appeal \u2013 look, smell, and feel were all there \u2013&#160;and it did not disappoint.  It was a bit darker of a light green, if that makes sense \u2013 an army green.  Good looking structure, a fair amount of orange hairs and a decent covering of trichomes, but not super glimmery or sticky between the fingers.\u000a\u000aThe smell when first opening the bag is sweet, fruity, with a bit of pine \u2013&#160;maybe even a bit tangy, as others have noted.  A little whaft of earthiness seems to come through as well.  The buds are denser, not giving too much with a squeeze between the fingers.  They feel pretty sturdy, not at all &quot;airy&quot; or &quot;popcorn-ish,&quot; but didn&#39;t stick to the fingers.  When ground up, the aromas intensify, a sweet pine coming more to the forefront.\u000a\u000aI packed a bowl for the bubbler \u2013&#160;the taste/inhale/exhale is similar to its smell, but much, much more pine comes through.  A delightful taste, bringing back memories of smoking this strain in the Eastern Sierras &amp; Yosemite.  \u000a\u000aI&#39;m a longtime cannabis user, but have scaled back and generally keep my use to night time, so I&#39;m pretty used to indicas.  This batch was definitely relaxing, but helpful in getting the creative juices and ideas going, as well as allowing one to expound on those ideas.  My body was relaxed, but I could still write.\u000a\u000aWhile I love this strain, and may be a bit biased, this batch didn&#39;t quite reach that amazing, 5 star connoisseur level.  The smell and taste were fantastic; the structure and look were good; and the effects were great \u2013 relaxing, yet uplifting to allow creativity and ideas, with enough focus to expound on those.  I don&#39;t know \u2013&#160;on the edge of 5 stars, but knowing my bias for the strain it wouldn&#39;t feel fair.  \u000a\u000aI&#39;d say 4.5/5 stars, would definitely pick up this strain/batch again!

VIT was around 99. We are all at a table in a real nice town home complex in the northeastern US.  The table has a random collection of items.  Taboo the board game, a metal bowl, some nachos and dipping sauce, some playing cards, old Nextel phones we all used for 2 way, a few PS1 controllers, a dugout and its one hitter, a grinder, utensils, and (most importantly) Northern Lights #5.  Now, please forgive me for not understanding the gravity of my situation at the time.  This would be something I would not see again for almost 13 years.  And if I knew then what I know now? I would have not been so well known for sharing. So here is the kicker, and if you have stayed with me this long for this particular review in a sea of reviews? Here is your payoff. . . . the table included my best friend of course, and two more later.  But we had a playboy playmate (not then, it happened a year or so later) whom we ALL wanted to get with. . . she was sort of renowned in High School.  And her dad played major league baseball. As in the ML-CURSEWORD-B. . . . Also at that table? A super young high school grad who could have went pro and was coached by said playmates father if he didn&#39;t mess up his chances in college. Man the things you remember when someone mentions something that triggers your memory.  We had one of the most memorable night as friends. It was all you could ask for in a conducive environment.  So I came here to say thanks to Fr*%%&amp; for getting that for us from your cousin in the city.  That was a memorable time in my life.
