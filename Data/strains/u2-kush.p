VA somewhat prompt come on that slaps you across the forehead. Feels like a tide pulling your consciousness further and further away, creating extreme dissociation. Watching things is ridiculously fun, the high accentuating vision and giving it an appealing lustre. It just looks cool. That is very familiar to Bubba and, come to think of it, also shares a scintillating physical high. Sense of touch is heightened, evoking complexly detailed and almost overwhelming pleasure. As good as it feels, the emotional state is contrastingly subdued. I appreciate how stable it is, but too stoic. Feel solid as a rock and that\u2019s affecting my emotional state too much. Socially capable, maybe not to party for how heavy/stoned it is. Definitely find myself wanting more mood elevation, but almost excusable from a zenned out, meditative perspective. Music is ok, but really not the best. Not bad cotton mouth. 6 out of 10.

V3.5 Stars - Doesn&#39;t quite work well for Insomnia unfortunately, tried it two nights in a row vaped, about 3-4 10 second hits... according to the average reviews this seemed like it would be a great sleeper. Nope. Felt relaxed but mind was far too active. Buy a small Gram first, test it out for yourself first.

VThis is a fabulous strain if you want to just pass out sleeping. It hit me really quick with a relaxed, body buzz, and an insane need for sleep. I suggest taking this one RIGHT before bed. It comes fast. I did feel like it went away pretty quick though, but I did need to stay up a bit longer. Sleeping with this and smoking a bit more than 2-4 hits and that would make for some really great sleep. Didn&#39;t remove my pain too much, maybe if I didn&#39;t have to move it would feel better. Great strain.

VI am an avid cannabis user both recreationally and medicinally. My first thought was how pleasant the taste was. It is definitely creeper bud. Very strong head rush which smoothly turns into and all around head and body high. They do not lie when prescribing for muscle relaxation. Overall great strain

VMy favorite strain in the world!!!\u000aThis stain must be on everyone&#39;s bucket list! Always makes my day with its uplifting qualities, you can&#39;t be in a bad mood even if you try. As a benefit to positive thinking this stain unlocks your creative side and will progressively relieve pain and relax your body. Its a strain anyone can enjoy as it is very easy to handle and can be enjoyed by both experienced cannabis users and people who are new to cannabis.
