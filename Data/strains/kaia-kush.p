VOne of my all time favorites.  All of my mates and i have been smoking for years, but when everyone is over for a braai/BBQ i only need to roll a long thin toothpick size joint and you are so super lifted that you cant believe you only had 2 or 3 drags of a skinny join.\u000a\u000aLeaves on the tree grow bigger that a fully grown mans hand.\u000aSuper easy to grow, very short stocky tree and surprisingly resilient against bugs, mild frost and drought tolerant.  Super dark green leaves and buds.\u000aLove this strain

V&#128100; Very Good Sativa! It&#39;s effective nature definitely gives you an upper hand against PTSD. The benefits are certainly worth the wild. &#128175;

VBuds had a nice integrity, not dense though, light and fluffy. Took as big a rip as I could on the first to get as full a sense of the flavor as possible. Very smooth, and you can feel the flavors unfold, if you will, rather than explode on the inhale. Earthy, but with subtle hints of fruit and spice. No cough despite the huge hit. Description says onset can be slow, but I&#39;m feeling this pretty quickly. Buzz is clear, colorful and vibrant, no hindrance to getting some work done while under its influence. I hope more growers start producing this one!

VI&#39;ve only smoked this as a BHO (by a company that makes fantastic BHO products, 710 Extractions) - but it was completely unlike any strain I&#39;ve ever smoked. It&#39;s a stimulant! Not unlike 3 shots of espresso, without any of the caffeine jitters or caffeine &#39;crash&#39; later. Hands down the single greatest &quot;morning smoke&quot; of all time. Dab,  jump right into work, be insanely productive for several hours straight, look up at the clock and wonder where all the time went. Another dab or two, back to work. Don&#39;t smoke this before bed! :) \u000a\u000aPrior to running out, I went back to my dispensary and bought quite a bit more. I&#39;ll buy it every single time they get it in stock.
