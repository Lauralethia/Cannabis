VI tried a variation of Afghani Bullrider, a strain called SD Bull Rider***CBD*** that I bought from Point Loma Patients Consumer Collective (PLPCC) in San Diego.  It&#39;s listed as a hybrid, and the SD Bull Rider weed I tried definitely has strong Indica qualities.  It made me sleepy and gave me a very nice and relaxing body buzz without of a head buzz.  I really like this strain because it took away my back pain and made me feel good all over.  It have me the munchies and serious dry mouth, so I was very thirsty.  I didn&#39;t experience any other negatives.  I am ready to go to sleep with this stuff.

VBlazed it up at the pad after work with a roommate. We were watching a movie eating pizza, wings and drinking you know, just a regular night of relaxation and I say within the first hour of the movie we ended up crashing on the sofa and not waking up until about 3 or 4 in the morning to go our rooms to sleep in our own beds. Talk about a good time. This is the good stuff and it is were I want to be. I highly recommend this for a good time with friends or help with sleeping troubles.

VIn 2010 we were lucky enough to find this Strain &quot;Jeff Tek&#39;s Afghani Bullrider. This was a beautiful plant growing to around 2 meters in a 40 gallon smart pot. This was the unique thing about this strain was the Trichrome height. The trichromes were at least twice the height of any other strain we have cultivated. So tall that they fell over onto eachother creating a mat that resembled &quot;White Mold&quot; from a distance. Then after a closer look we found it was just an enormous glistening mat. I have never seen or heard of this strain since 2010 and after asking in both the US and BC Canada I&#39;m afraid it my be a &quot;clone only&quot; strain that has went extinct.

VI am not usually an Indica smoker, but this strain has become one of my favorites soon after medicating. I appreciate that this strain is not like other Indica strains as it doesn&#39;t have the sedative feeling. I highly recommend this strain for anxiety or pain. Afghani Bullrider is easily a medical grade smoke. Light green, larger buds covered in orange hairs. Do not recommend for first timers or occasional smokers.

I was, however, not very social with this strain &amp; found opening my mouth to communicate with others to be burdensome. This a great strain for chilling alone or focusing on a creative task at hand. This really helped with my general anxieties as well as keeping my emotional state neutral, which is great for those with BPD. Great &quot;body high&quot;.

Vfound a stiva pheno of afghani bullrider... suppose to be from the winner of one of the recent Toronto breeder/grower competitions... and it sure looks/smells/feels the part! terp profile is straight lemon zest, and the flowers are coated in shiny trichomes... really up/focused/energetic high, with no burn out... could see this strain giving novice smokers possible paranoia or anxiety.

VAt first I thought the name was kinda funny... but after smoking it makes perfect sense, I was actually able to feel my brain relaxing with this strain. It has enormous, sticky, dense buds with a pleasant sweet pine smell. The high starts with the head making it feel almost 3x heavier, followed by the rest of the body seeking a couch to melt into. It&#39;s the perfect strain to end the day as it doesn&#39;t make you tired it lets you do fun stuff and then gently drift to slee...zzz....p\u000a\u000a10/10 Highly recommend

VThis is probably one of the most powerful and intriguing of all the AFGHANI strains out there.  Not even the stony hybrid, X97 x AFGHAN KUSH, had nothing on this one!!!!!!    Good strain for relaxation, the sedation is far none.
