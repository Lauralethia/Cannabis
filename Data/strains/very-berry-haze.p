VBy far the best weed I have ever smoked for my personal chemistry. Thank god who ever made this strain. Works amazingly with stress and anxiety which is what I am trying to treat. Please make a cbd  (swiss tsunami) strain so it doesn&#39;t hit me so hard.\u000a\u000aA marriage of two of the best strains to treat stress and anxiety that we know of. Both with different paths they go about in the brain to accomplish this. They come together and make things so clear but yet fun. I can get computer work done on this even with it being 23% THC. Keeps me awake but lets me go to bed when I want to. I&#39;m typing this review on it. \u000a\u000aI drove an hour to get it and back. Because I&#39;m coming from super sour diesel and ending here. You have to follow the legacy of the strain for medical. Super Sour Diesel to, Super Silver Haze. Trying another one out that is said to help stress and anxiety, strawberry cough. And trying to find a place that would put them together for me. Thank you guys! Your farm Rocks! Apothecary Genetics thank you so much! Some people will just smoke anything to get high. And some smart people turned it into medicine.

VI am more of an Indica/Hybrid type of person and the representative at the store that I got this strain from said it was an Indica so I ended purchasing it. Boy was I wrong, the first time I took a hit of it, I loved the taste but it kept me up at night and I can&#39;t keep still. This is definitely good for the day time though.

VVery Berry by refine listed as a hybrid I think it leans sativa. THC is 66.58% and it&#39;s consistency is sugar wax.\u000a\u000aHigh was a nice energetic euphoric and happy\u000a\u000aSmells like poop and crunch berry cereal which was unique to say the least. Taste was a sweet berry with none of the poo smell at all.\u000a\u000aEnjoyable dab!
