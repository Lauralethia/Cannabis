VI have problems with relaxing and my body is often filled with stress. This one is maby the best i have ever tried for relaxing. I melted like syrup and i felt absolutely no stress in my stomach. Im often physicly stressed also, moving feets, cant sit still etc. No problem after a 0.5 grams of this.\u000a\u000aMy body got some well deserved relief with the orange bud. I have tried many types off relaxe weed, this one is the best so far. \u000a\u000aThank you Amsterdam. \u000a\u000a

VExtreme amounts of pleasure, very uplifting, energetic and inspiring, I grew on my own from a Dutch Passion seed, easy to grow and cure, you can&#39;t go wrong, very good strain to learn how to cultivate! \u000aIf you are looking for something to relax at the beach, play your favorite sport or have a good time with your girl, go for this one.

VI bought this several time while I was in The Netherlands.  The buds are a nice dark green, which a zillion orange hairs, as it&#39;s name suggests.  The smell is out of this world.  The first time I smelled it one of the guys at the coffee shop was like &quot;man you have to smell this strain.&quot;  Orange Bud tastes great, obv like oranges, and gives you a nice high.  It is 50% sativa, and 50% indica, so for those of you who enjoy both head and body highs, this is a great strain for you.  No the strongest strain; about 15% THC content.  To put that into perspective, the average strain of skunk in Amsterdam Coffee Shops is between 18-19% THC.   Nevertheless, the high makes you euphoric, hungry, and relieves some pain along with giving you a nice light head high.  Great strain for those of you who enjoy head and body highs, and for those of you who are connoisseurs of great tasting marijuana!!!!!

VVaped with a Crafty at 356f\u000a\u000aThe only reason I&#39;d give this strain 3 stars is because the effects are really short lived. And because I like to be stoned with as minimal as possible, this just doesn&#39;t impress me much. \u000a\u000aI will say that because it&#39;s so short lived that it makes a great quick dose of medication.\u000a\u000aIt does give a wonderful high, almost like a happy hug. :) \u000aAfter that, I&#39;m happy and a bit more centered feeling. \u000a\u000aI like it before working out, makes it more enjoyable and even when it sucks I&#39;m too happy to notice. \u000a\u000aGreat for hiking or just being in nature.

VAn awesome strain that is!\u000aVery nice smoke, burns to white ash if grown organic and cured well. Best to be cut at 70% white and 30% amber trichs - that&#39;s when it&#39;s most potent... It usually takes about 63-65 days of flowering to get there.\u000aWhen smoked in smaller quantities, it gives a very nice uplifted high. Absolutely opens my mind up for ANY ideas... Of course, the more you smoke, the more ideas become less understandable when not high, but it&#39;s like it clears my mind up...\u000aAfter smoking a bit more, the trippy part comes in. It starts with a very nice relaxing couch-lock and a many trips. Then, after like 2 hours, it sweeps you off your feet and you&#39;re ready to dance and have a lot of fun.

VOn first opening the bag of Orange Bud, an aroma of what I considered a damp forest diffused into my airspace.  The nugs had a light green appearance with spots of orange hairs on it and came bone dry and dense, which meant they were easy to pick and impeccable to grind.  Could see that a considerable amount of crystal filtered down into the bottom compartment of my five tier grinder, which of course will be getting saved to when I come to the end of the batch.  Gave off a much better but more subtle flavour than what was first feared from the smell and safe to say it&#39;s quite smooth on the chest.  It doesn&#39;t hit you straight away, but boy when it does it mellows you right out. I made the mistake of sampling some with a pal right before I had to go uni, which is about a 10 minute walk.  It&#39;s safe to say that was a tough walk. Personally I think this strain isn&#39;t one to give you the knock out effect but would be great for social aspects in a relaxed environment.

VI had a bad experience.\u000aMostly this must be down to me but after arriving in Amsterdam I used my ID to buy a 8 euro gram of &#39;orange bud&#39; claiming to be sativa (my regular smoke back home)\u000aI rolled the gram into a cone and smoked it all in like 30 mins, this normally on high end weed would be fine, however I ended up dropping my camera on the floor, the whole room moved and I ended up feeling like I was gunna throw up sitting behind a car in Amsterdam central for 2 hours. Overall not a great experience and i&#39;m a daily smoker. I&#39;m giving 3* because I should have not smoked a whole gram straight off the bat, but with Amnesia, white widow, OG, cheese or any other strains i&#39;m good to smoke a gram.

This particular strain gets you faded off of one hit and it makes you feel as if everything is a dream. Be prepared to feel buzzed for quite a long time.

I feel the body high more in my legs when i smoke it. After eating an edible of this strain, i felt more of the indica and felt sleepy, i would recommend to micro-dosage if you want to make an edible with orange bud.

VI&#39;m bit unsure on the ratingsystem. But, for me is the Orange Bud from www.Dutch-Passion.nl one of the best strains ever manmade... Easy to grow and get cuttlings from. Easy to grow and expand to an fullrupture budplant!\u000a\u000aIt don&#39;t gives you so much, 20-40 grams, but what a buds!!\u000a\u000aStrong, heavy, hammerblow in the effect and when you use it... No pain what so ever... I can do what ever I whant because I do not have any pains!\u000a\u000aBut there&#39;s a downside. You&#39;ve to smoke a joint once in an hour...  ;-)

First you feel like you aren&#39;t high, but after you smoked another bowl it hits you like a ton of bricks. \u000aIt gives a mellow headhigh with a nice body stone. It makes you very happy and everything in life seems nice. \u000aIt is an indica dominant strain so it makes you rather hungry and as you start to come down sleepy. \u000aOverall a very nice strain.

VOn first open of the jar, these buds smelled a bit like orange beef for the local Chinese food place.  Some kind of funky meaty smell backed by some dried orange peel.  There is a faint smell of fuel, far off in the background of everything else. When breaking it up, however, the smells really changed.  A pungent, oniony smell with a metallic/hazy backbone comes forward.  Lots of crystals, sticky, lots of auburn hairs, dense nugs that are better to cut than to break apart with fingers. The effects are energizing, but mellowing enough to promote focus. I noticed a change in my hearing after smoking this; Certain things were very loud when focus on, but the ambient noise had kind of a tinny guitar wah wah pedal sound for some time.

It literally smelled like I was in room full of oranges and the taste wasn&#39;t far behind. Despite these wonderful qualities, the high just wasn&#39;t anything special. If you&#39;re specifically into taste and smell then this one may be for you. The kind of high that I usually get just wasn&#39;t there.

Anyway the skunk flavour is very present and leads to a focus and aroused state of mind which is very suit for anyone wants to stay aware and energetic for a good moment. I love the global effect and the pure fruity smoke taste.

VI&#39;m bit unsure on the ratingsystem. But, for me is the Orange Bud from www.Dutch-Passion.nl one of the best strains ever manmade... Easy to grow and get cuttlings from. Easy to grow and expand to an fullrupture budplant!\u000a\u000aIt don&#39;t gives you so much, 20-40 grams, but what a buds!!\u000a\u000aStrong, heavy, hammerblow in the effect and when you use it... No pain what so ever... I can do what ever I whant because I do not have any pains!\u000a\u000aBut there&#39;s a downside. You&#39;ve to smoke a joint once in an hour...  ;-)

VI was able to get me some of this strain in the stud coffeeshop in amsterdam.\u000aAs far as i know, they are the only coffeeshop in amsterdam that sell it.\u000aThe high its quite weird, definitely sativa and not indicouch, but not that uplifting as i thought it will be. JH/LH/SSH are far more suited for that purpose.\u000aAll in all, a nice strain and great bang for the buck - 3.2 grams for only 20 euro!

VOut of all the strains I have experienced (which is extensive) this one is like none other.  First, and most impressively, it&#39;s a total mood changer.  Your mind feels positive even in the face negativity. I&#39;ve never had that before.  I&#39;m in my 30&#39;s.  This has the potential to put benzodiazepines out of business.   \u000a\u000aThe body high is smooth.  I also use for medical purposes.  This bud is a real pain distracter.  I&#39;ve been able to lose myself in a T.V. show; before I vaped I wasn&#39;t able to keep track due to pain and discomfort.  \u000a\u000aI hope you give it a try.  I really hope you have the same reaction I have.  \u000a\u000aGood luck.

VNice bud. Smells very citrus like, orange almost. First you feel like you aren&#39;t high, but after you smoked another bowl it hits you like a ton of bricks. \u000aIt gives a mellow headhigh with a nice body stone. It makes you very happy and everything in life seems nice. \u000aIt is an indica dominant strain so it makes you rather hungry and as you start to come down sleepy. \u000aOverall a very nice strain.

Very good for socializing and going indoor, outdoor, coffee, wine or whatever energizing schedule you are up to! Very relaxing for body pains, but in high dossage the body starts locking...

VAlso known as Lemon Glue, this strain can get messy. I tripped OUT. After rolling a fatty and smoking over half in the bath the first thing I noticed was a tingly relaxation with a ray of energy shining through. Once this developed after going back for more I was reminded of how important life is I poured my heart out to the misses. It enough a lot of feeling back that had gathered dust and the next day I woke feeling relaxed and close to the misses. very trippy, dryest dry mouth and crazy appetite. This was potent for me and I have a lot of experience. Hard to.come by, keep your eye out and ride this strain.

VYep, this is my favorite strain so far! The high it gives is absolutely exceptional: Quite mellow, but not dysfunctional (infact, i got alot done on this!) It makes you feel, good in body and mind without the side effects i often get with weed (anxiety being the main). The best selling point however is the talkative nature of it: you can chat away to people whether they are on it or not and your words don&#39;t come out as gobbldygook :D I found on my many smokes of orange bud that everyone was on the same level and could get stuff done. overall a balanced bud which makes for good holiday and gathering fuel.
