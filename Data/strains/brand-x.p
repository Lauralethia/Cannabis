VI became intimately familiar with Brand X back in 1984, and I loved it, as it was infinitely better than anything else available at the time.... I&#39;m glad to see it available once again.

VWhen you cannot sleep because of sleep disorders &amp; insomnia, it isn&#39;t fun &amp; can lead to health issues. I&#39;ve tried every prescription drug in the pharmacy without any relief. My friend tried to convince me in giving medical cannabis a try. I was hesitant because of the stigma associated with it. So glad I gave in. Tried many that promised sleep but, not that effective until I used Brand X. Wow, after using it I have been sleeping very well. I don&#39;t know how to judge weed, but it was hard, stinky &amp; tasted great. I am very thankful for this life changing discovery!! &#128512;

VBrand X  The name didn&#39;t move me. I actually went for some Anonymous and since the Bud Tender recommended the Brand X I grabbed a quarter. I went home fired up some Anonymous and it was very mellow. But the Brand X, Oh my God ! I&#39;m a veteran, been smoking since 1974 and the $hit made me woozy &#128563; Tell you what, the only weed I had this good was Gandalf, and I had never heard of it before either.

VI did some research on this Strain &amp; Google had all kinds of information on it. Very Popular in Michigan &amp; nice to see it here in Seattle. Very strong indica, helped a great deal with my stress &amp; pain, then after a long duration I went right to bed. Overall, dank, beautiful &amp; most of all the effects were on point. Isn&#39;t that the point? The effects?!

VA ultimate Michigan Indica strain that is difficult to find. Earthy, pine &amp; mint flavor that looks beautiful &amp; hard nuggets. Was good at taking my pain away, calmed me down, gave me the munchies &amp; then put me to dream land. &#128514; I love strong Indicas &amp; this one delivers. I found it at Cedar Leaf in Lansing.

VWhen I opened the jar it smelled of fermented lemonade &amp; earthy. The nugs were dense, dark green &amp; very crystal coated. The smoke is smooth, but expands a bit hitting you pretty fast. The buzz starts in the head &amp; moves to relax you completely, eventually caused me to get tired &amp; I slept well. Great for napping.

I usually wake up several times through out the night, but not last night! Also, the budtender said this was a Michigan strain, which we don&#39;t see a lot of around here, so glad I tried it &amp; have some on had. Warning: Very strong medicine
