VI definitely think it still smells weird but the taste is good. people who like being creative should definitely smoke this and try it with banana juicing rolling papers.

Vthis was a really nice strain I got from the Okanagan in BC - says sleepy but this was that strain that really is a pick me up and gets you going and focused - I found this to be a nice smoke - very relaxing mild nice tasting smoke - very relaxing yet focused a the task in hand - this strain does have a hard crash - bit if your looking for something that will really give you a little jolt of energy and put you Nina nice relaxed state of mind this is it- I highly recommend using this strain in the early evening - smoke a few and maby end off the night with a indica for a nice sleep - worked great nice strain

VA fantastic, but rare, BEAUTY!! Smell and taste immediately makes ones senses perk right up. Such a perfect combo, A Happy Mellow, relaxing all is good, best time of the day for sure! A delicious, frosty, blueish green bud appearance makes one almost feel guilty about disturbing this lovely prize winner, ENJOY!

VI love it. It is definitely uplifting like the other gentleman said, and Bob Marley is perfect music for the journey with Frostbite. I&#39;m probably going to write rhymes,creativity is probably so nice on this. What can I say? $mooth, with a nice and subtle popping taste to it. Interesting. The taste is like chewing a very mellow tea. Nice, in an odd way.\u000a10/10 for the peaceful atmosphere Frostbite creates. Mama Ganja! :)

VA cool sativa. \u000aI&#39;m using it for my pain\u000aMakes you want to dance.\u000a\u000aAnd that is my haiku about frostbite..\u000a\u000aOverall a decent sativa, it gets the job done. It&#39;s a 4 star strain, not too potent so anxiety prone consumers shouldn&#39;t have any problems.\u000a

VI smoked this one while watching a heavy storm front move through. It was perfect because you&#39;re relaxed but you&#39;re still fully engaged mentally. The lightning show was spectacular and seemed to take on an added edge with the weeds effects. This is a great smoke for enjoying something that&#39;s visually stimulating. I sure do recommend this one.

VThis strain is comparable to white widow for my partner and I. A lesser version of white widow. Very uplifting and euphoric. Lazy feeling but not too bad like being sleepy. Definitely periods of couch-lock if the tele is on. Overall nice high, definitely will do again.

Vthis strain had me in my bed hearing the sounds of the universe. Perfect for when youre feeling low and need a boost. I felt like I had the knowledge of everything. It gave me the giggles and produced a memorable high. Definately worth buying more than once. c:

Vonce again, over rated sativa. what is with you sativa people? there&#39;s nothing to me more rewarding in a bag of buds, then characteristics of indica. low stems. not stringy. grown right. this sativa, like all sativas is inconsistent and frankly, the powder puff of football. I like my weed like I like my football: hard hitting. this is so not hard hitting
