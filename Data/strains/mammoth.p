VThis strain does really good for my multiple Sclerosis. It&#39;s almost as if it knows morning from night. It acts as an energetic high during the day, and is calming in the evenings. It dulls my pains and smooths out my spasms immediately.

VJust picked up about an 1/8th off my boy of this and this is my favorite strain to date. I&#39;ve smoked a lot of different strains but this is by far the one I will count on from now on. It&#39;s not a stoned feeling so I can act normal in front of people and it just is a perfect day smoke. 10/10 will be smoking often.
