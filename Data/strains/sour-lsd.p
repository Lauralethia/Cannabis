VIncredible strain. I recommend it for celebratory use. I couldn&#39;t stop laughing at the dumbest thing like my breathe or my feet. After aimlessly walking around the same few streets a few times I suddenly noticed a double railed banister and I ran so fast to the top and slid down: I did this for a solid 45 minutes. I smoked this on a Friday after a long week of school and many hard tests. I was in a great mood to be done with all of them and this made my mood so much better. Makes anything that other wise would be boring fun. I smoked it before studying for another big test and I wasn&#39;t very productive but I had so much fun doing it.

VThis is such a good smoke and vape! I prefer to vape it because it has such a clean and fresh flavor, which comes through purely in the vape. It&#39;s great to smoke as well, either pipe or rolled. I picked some up at Sky High and it rocks!

VSigned up for an account just to review this strain. Have tried all sorts of strains here in WA. Enjoy all varieties I&#39;ve tried. Except for Sour LSD. Wow. I had read about the auditory effects, but assumed they would be positive in nature. Wrong. I got the described combo body/head high as expected, but also suffered some disagreeable auditory effects. Not like what you might be expecting, like music sounds better or anything like that. Instead, it&#39;s almost like having a cold in your ears, where everything sounds tinny and worse. In fact, trying to enjoy some of my favorite music, it all just sounds horrible. Ugh. Now I&#39;m stuck with this weird, uncomfortable auditory distortion for who knows how long. May try some Platinum Girl Scout Cookies to counter the ill effects. Bottom line: Please be advised that the reported auditory effects from Sour LSD are no joke. At least for me, quite an unpleasant experience.

VI\u2019m new to smoking weed, but I really like this strain. It is nice and relaxing, and gives me those great creative thoughts. I like that I can stay awake and enjoy it, but after a while it brings on a pleasant sleepy feeling. Will be buying this again.

VDespite the over the top name, this is a strain that I didn&#39;t find to have much in the way of psychoactive effects, let alone any &quot;heavier&quot; effects such as super munchies or sounds becoming more prominent in music and television. Spicy snd slightly bitter, this is a strain that packs quite a little body high punch, albeit a hastier one than I would have liked. Sour Diesel or Green Crack would be better alternatives to this strain, however in a pinch it is a strain that at least will give some pleasant benefits.
