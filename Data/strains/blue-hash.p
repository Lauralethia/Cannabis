VHad a bowl in the great hot Texas outdoors this afternoon! The second me and my buddy stood up and took a couple steps, we each had a &quot;woah&quot; moment. The body high is suupperrrr intense and it feels like your body gained an extra 50 pounds. \u000aDefinitely gonna have some more tonight to take advantage of that heavy body buzz for some couch time &#128076;&#127996;\u000a\u000aFive F***ing stars &#128588;&#127996;

VStrong body high. Starts off with a bit of euphoria and then transitions into strong relaxation. After smoking you\u2019ll have a about 25 minutes to get into a position you will most likely stay for the rest of the high. What I don\u2019t like about this strain is the very dry mouth and eyes. Occasionally it also makes me paranoid.

VI acquired some as a free joint at the dispensary I visited when purchasing Corleone Kush. As you can see by the two star rating, I did not care for it. The cerebral buzz was practically non-existent, which is something I like to see in all indica / indica-dominants. Instead it even made me feel a little unhappy,. However, the body high is pretty decent. I smoked this joint three times before smoking it all up and giving this strain a bad review. But each time I didn&#39;t care for the high. \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re someone who hates the cerebral effects of cannabis but wants something for pain, this might very well be your strain.
