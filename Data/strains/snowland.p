VI buy this if I see it.\u000a\u000aSativa effects pronounced at the start, but without anxiety. Its fluffy fast, not focused.\u000a\u000aThe comedown is sleepy.\u000a\u000aBut it is a nice high, stoney and fun.\u000a\u000aTaste is kinda nutty pine. Not unpleasant, but nothing special.

VSuch a wonderful strain! Within minutes my lower back pain, muscle cramping, and anxiety was lifted! The smell was sweet and subtle, not too skunky or earthy, the hits are gentle (for me), and the density of each nug is thick and frosty. I felt my mind stop racing within minutes, was able to have a long but clear headed conversation with my husband, and followed it up with a long nights rest. The only side effect was cotton mouth. If snowland goes on sale, DONT miss out on a great strain.

VWhen it comes to playing guitar SnowLAnd is my absolute hands-down favorite.  I have a great time, every time.  It&#39;s easy to find my groove and everything that comes out sounds super-satisfying (to me, anyways!)  Seriously, this is so much fun to jam with.

VLet me just say that this strain might be my favorite as of this moment. Everything on it from the flower to the terpenes; it all fits my liking perfectly. As such, I highly recommend that this strain be tried by anyone after a potent yet balanced high. It hits a little heavy for me, which incidentally I&#39;m into right now. Extreme creative bursts are felt constantly throughout. It&#39;s a bit hard to feel &#39;active&#39; at the moment, although the cotton-mouth is actually mild enough to the point where food doesn&#39;t seem so difficult to obtain anymore...

Vfor me personally, I love the smell and I loved the taste. I was unable to enjoy it though. it gives me intense anxiety attacks and doesn&#39;t help me to relax. I really wanted to love it, it&#39;s a beautiful bud.

VPicked up an eight of NWCS legends brand. listed as 30% thc. A little harsh, even vaping, it made me cough more than usual.  Very nice happy high, relaxing too, nice tingling sensations in my toes. LA confidential is one of very favorites, and shows up in this strain, just like LA CON, Snowland is a great strain for musical enjoyment.I&#39;m a very long time fan of reggae, and this is one of those strain that really brings another dimension to the sound. I bought this from Clear Choice Cannabis in Tacoma WA for I think $18.00 just amazing what you can get for your weed dollar now days. Love it!

VJust got this as a strain to try while on a budget cause you cant beat $89 for 28g and its awesome . Gives a nice high and would be great for someone who is still starting out, or someone looking to try stronger strains, Id def recommend this one. if you have a high tolerance, like me, it still gave me a pretty good high and it helped me sleep right away without making me crave the entire kitchen pantry to eat.

VLooks great smells almost as pungent as a good Dutch treat. Very fruity. 26% thc. However the high doesn&#39;t match the looks or smell. Average high. Still worth a try. Maybe a different farm may do better
