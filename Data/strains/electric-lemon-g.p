Vthis is 1 of my favorite strains. im not really an sativa type of guy due to getting paranoid, but this shit is the bomb lol. no anxiety, great uplifting feeling, leaves u giggily. smells great, will stink up ur surroundings but in a good way. i mean this shit smells strong. super smooth smoke, inhale and exhale, with a lemony, sour after taste in your mouth.

VNice fruity lemon smell and it tastes so good. aka Biscay in CT. I just took a hit of this and did a short workout, I\u2019m listening to music and even this BS I got on my playlist like Asia sounds soooo good.
