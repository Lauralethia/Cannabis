VA really nice everyday strain. Doesn&#39;t lock you into the couch, but has a good body high. Is a bit of a creeper so just wait a minute.  The cerebral high lets you enjoy your mind, or anything else, quite nicely.

VFantastic , beautiful strain. BUT you need the right pheno . Only one pheno will do, forget about anything else that pops up and bin it. Unfortunately out of 10 seeds you will get different pheno&#39;s but the true one that is buku and the one pictured by the breeders should be and should grow exactly how the breeder describes.  Some pheno&#39;s take forever to flower and have fluffy buds and basically are not the true strain. The buku you want starts with big thick leaves and extremely short nodes , it&#39;s flowers easy within 8weeks of 12/12 , it even looks ready after 6weeks and can be cut at 7weeks  depending on your preference. It should be a short tight plant and bud formation should be tight heavy dense and extremely frosty . You will know if you have the right pheno on your hands as its so frosty it looks like something of pure beauty that&#39;s glistening white. The buds are as hard and as dense as the hardest dense buds out there.  It is also a heavy yielding plant if grown right because the weight of each individual bud makes up for what looks like lack of quantity. Topping and super cropping is a must with this strain as you need as many heavy bud sites as possible to achieve its potential .  My tips with this strain would be plant extra and check early and only keep the plants with very thick leaves and possibly keep a mother as these two methods are the only way of getting a true buku . Don&#39;t just pop a seed and grow it and be disappointed with a strain that wasn&#39;t buku because if you grow the true pheno it will be a pure pleasure and it will reward you with the most frosty , heavy dense buds ever.

VI&#39;m really impressed by the effects of this strain.  I enjoy sativas for my daytime activities but would like a little relaxation later in the day when I&#39;m gearing down.  Burmese really fits the bill here.  I&#39;m not looking for a classic Kush indica that&#39;ll knock me out but one that&#39;s just mellow enough to make the couch fit not adhere.

VBurmese Kush is a darker brownish green color with dense medium size buds.  The smoke is a little bit harsh &amp; will cause user to cough so may not be best for those with breathing issues.  If a little hacking can be handled a full bodied as well as very heady buzz will follow.  Starting out both sativa &amp; indica influences can be felt with equal ferocity.  This herb is no joke leaving the person who partakes both pain free &amp; uber stoned.  After about a half hour the munchies kick in &amp; after that the buzz goes almost completely body leading to a period of rest.  There is no doubt this strain puts me into the relaxation zone every time.

VI love this strain, it\u2019s my go-to nighttime strain as I find it more indica dominant. I use a vape pen from CT Pharm, CT code name (&#128580;) Fioraden D. Dosing low it\u2019s consistently a very chill and mellow high. I usually don\u2019t have any issues with anxiety with this, except once when I got a really big hit off my pen, the resulting high was intense and had me bugging a little bit until I fell asleep. So for newbies I recommend dosing low n slow with this to find that sweet spot. Besides that, it\u2019s a great nighttime smoke to curl up and relax with and after a while it will pull me right into sleep.

VI don&#39;t know why I&#39;m writing a review, because everyone has it pretty dead on already. Dark, dense nugs... sour citrus smell, like spoiled orange juice... mellow taste... somehow deeply relaxing but keeps you focused and motivated. The name is perfectly descriptive, really. This is exactly what you&#39;d expect from a OG / kush cross.\u000a\u000aBy the by, I&#39;m a heavy smoker and I didn&#39;t finish the joint I rolled. Smoked about 2/3&#39;s of it and felt so good and so relaxed I just sort of... forgot I was smoking. Just blissed out on life.

VI just smoked my first bowl of Burmese Kush.  I blasted off immediately.  Within minutes I was VERY heavy, VERY stoned.  Deeply relaxing, pensive, inward high - without any anxiety or paranoia.  Just a very melting sort of stoney feeling.  You WILL sit or stand in one place for long periods of time reflecting on nothing in particular.   I am a heavy medicinal user with PTSD, neuropathic issues and 43 bone fractures from several bad accidents. These  are thick, fat and dense nuggets.  My little batch is cured perfectly.  The buds are dark green with tons of red and golden hairs, it leaves a sticky residue on your fingers immediately.  You can see the crystals on the trichomes if you put the buds under a nice light.  It is a pretty bud.This weed came from Nectar, one of the top 3 dispensaries in Portland in my opinion.  It tested out at 27.47% THC and 0.08 CBD.  Great strain.  Will definitely be back for more.

VA wonderful connoisseur strain.  Sweet and pungent, this one is so much of what I love about a good Indica  dominant strain.  A nice smooth smoke with no touch of  harshness at all.  A wonderful grow at 26.12%.  Very complex aroma is consistent with a complex cannabinoid and terpene profile and a seriously complex high, stone, and buzz.  A sweet fruity high note against a subtle piney with touch of diesel background with a dark, sweet heavy, honeyed licorice finish on the nose.   I concur with the &quot;creeper&quot; weed status of this strain that seems to be prevalent.  The initial buzz is almost immediate and there is no doubt that you are smoking something special from the start, but 10 minutes after two hits has me riding on an increasingly soaring and intellectual high,  multitasking - watering out back, 1 serious and 2 amusing trains of thought going on at once,  watching CNN, and writing this strain review.  Definitely a strain I&#39;ll keep a lookout for in the future...if I remember it.

VMellow, pleasant, flavorful smoke on both inhale and exhale. Not the strongest pot in the world - takes a bit of time to take full effect, but once it does it&#39;s a nice relaxed high. That said, this batch is claiming 27%, and I have to say, I&#39;m skeptical. Very frosty looking under the magnifier light though. Good for early evenings, when you want to wind down, but aren&#39;t ready to crash yet.

A great balance of sativa energy and slight indica body relaxation (minor lower back and legs tingles) where you can smoke it at any time of the day and still get things done. The taste is sweet but not fruity or citrus and also has a hint of spiciness.
