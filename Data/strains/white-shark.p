VGreat strain, smoked a small joint and it got me high for hours. A strong cerebral high followed by a stronger body high. Tastes citrusy, almost lemony and a little earthy and smells like fruit. It made my eyes very dry and red so I wouldn&#39;t smoke this if you need to go somewhere important. I would put this bud at a 3.7 - 4.0, Definatley a must try

VI have a white shark-green crack combo so they are OD sativa buds, which I think is dope. Two of the hardest hitting sativas in one strain. Fast-thinking, conversational effects. The taste really accentuates the dry mouth. It smells very citrusy with a combination of wood and earth scents. It&#39;s crystally as a powdered donut, and it&#39;s fluffy yet dense.

VGot some shake to sample from AZCPC. It was a little ugly, and not much taste. And the euphoria was low. But!! Did a nice number of relieving pain from a Toothache thats been bothering me, and also did well for my arthritis and back pain &quot;muscle &amp; spinal&quot;. Also was really smooth to smoke, and leafy! Got COPD? You might be happy with this! Shoulda rolled one with it, and I will next chance I get. Had a nice mixture of Uplifting yet sedative. So had to rate this just above medium - only because of flavor and appearance. But still worth having a little on hand. And I did enjoy it!!

VAbsolutely phenomenal strain. I know there&#39;s a lot of strains &amp; a lot of people saying they should try certain ones.

I&#39;ve smoked this in the evening when I was looking to combat fatigue.\u000aTaste 5/5 Sweet dank taste, this is how I want all of my medication to taste. It&#39;s actually very smooth to dab, for my birthday yesterday I took a HUGE dab. Normally I spend the next 5 minutes choking and when I&#39;m done I feel like I have a 6 pack of abs. But I for once could actually hold it in.\u000aBuzz 5/5 Comes on almost instantly, strong body buzz, gives you a nice amount of euphoria, a lot of motivation and creativity, and just the right amount of energy. \u000aThis strain would make a great edible.\u000aI never usually get anxiety from weed but for those that do might want to use caution when smoking GWS. The effects show themselves almost immediately so you shouldn&#39;t have a problem gauging how much to do.

Everything you need to know about this strain is in the name: White because the buds are literally some of the whitest shade of green you&#39;ll find compared to any other strain; Great because the strain is well, damn GREAT; and finally Shark because there are so many amazing strains out there that this one definitely needed to be recognized as a top-dog and fine competitor for the position as an elite alpha-all the characteristics of a shark indeed. Hopefully my babbling didn&#39;t go on too long, I&#39;m incredibly high as I write this. Point is, try the damn strain! Because it won&#39;t be your last

VIgnore whatever strain you were thinking of trying and GET THIS ONE! The buzz it provides is unreal. Strong body buzz and an energizing mental buzz. GWS is a rare gem and is as potent as medicine can come. If you&#39;re prone to paranoia or anxiety you might not want to partake. GWS isn&#39;t for the faint of heart. \u000aIn my top 10, GWS will impress those who buy it&#39;s flower - covered in what looks like a bud with snow on it the trichomes give a preview of how strong it is. I have came across the shatter (on my bday) and it was a discounted strain because it was a little dark in color so $15 for a half gram. Thanks to my bday got another $5 off. $10 for a half gram of the most potent shatter I&#39;ve ever had. I wish I would&#39;ve got 7 grams of this but when I went back (a day after it hit the shelves) it was gone. \u000aThis strains hard to find but not necessarily rare so keep your eyes peeled at your local dispensary. I got mine from Nova in Mesa, AZ.

VWhen this strain is grown properly, it is primarily white in colour with a lime green accent, it has lengthy amber hairs that obnoxiously stretch throughout the bud reaching a good amount of area. Your eyes fixate on the abundance of trichome as the indubitable aesthetic quality of this strain. A nice whiff gives an inviting smell with a certain sweetness to it. When you break into the bud and squeeze it a bit this strain gives off a more pungent, sweet + piney smell. It tastes great ! smooth with a good level of expansion as you hold it in. The high sets in at a medium pace, quicker/heavier if u force cough, it gives a clear buzz with just the right amount of sedation that you hardly notice - which makes the high somewhat motivating (I like to do errands and early morning studying with this strain). Effective for depression and anxiety also.

VOne of my all time favorites. Smoked it many times. Very strong almost onioney mixed with grapefruit smell. Taste great delivering a insanely fast acting cerebral head rush. Leaves you feeling great with an instant mood boost. Can sit you down if youre not an experienced smoker. A well rounded strain that has the ability to fulfill many purposes. Buds  ive had almost always very dense round spear like nugs. Mild green color with so many trichomes it almost gives it a new color itself. Cant say enough good things about this strain. A must try for sure!!!

VFirst thing noticed off the Standard Farms Cart is your body wanting to lay back and just chill. Your body moves so much slower like it\u2019s in marmalade. You can hear music differently notes come out that weren\u2019t heard before. I notice a more attentive feeling guess it\u2019s good for ADD. Also feel mentally relaxed but not in a heavy or tired way it\u2019s a stress free chill way. Happy not overly happy but like normal haha so you don\u2019t seem like a giggling weirdo in public. It\u2019s a great strain for anytime and for PTSD to get things done as it helps with body relaxation and mind stays alert unlike most strains that are good for PTSD.\u2019nice chill not overpowering sativa. Another great job by Standard Farms truly capturing the full plants Cannabinoid breakdown and terpene profile.

VWould not recommend if you have important errands to run or if you need to be socially coherent. \u000a\u000aThere are two components to this high, the rolling body buzz and how quickly it zaps your cognitive processes. \u000aWhich effect you feel first varies from session to session as GWS seems to induce a slightly different high every time.\u000a\u000aExperienced users will be delighted with this strain. GWS has a way of catching even the most perma-fried users off guard with its heavy body high. Amateur smokers might feel a little overwhelmed in the beginning due its potency. One minute you&#39;re feeling a little giggly, and next thing you know you&#39;re stumbling your words and completely couch locked to the point of non-functionality as a human being.\u000a\u000aAll-in-all, a potent strain that is worth smoking in your lifetime, but do not underestimate its prowess!

VI got this at Tokyo Starfishin Bend Oregon along with two other strains of flowers. I absolutely loved the body high with this the best. It relaxes me without knocking me out and I was able to enjoy the evening. The bud tender, Troy has been so helpful each time I&#39;ve talked with him and all of the people at Tokyo Starfish have been awesome. They have a great selection for your needs and the products are so fresh and true to strain. If you haven&#39;t tried them you should . They are located in the old mill district in Bend. Ask for this strain and enjoy your day ! \u000a

VI have purchased a small batch of this perticular strain &quot;GWS&quot;  and I will deffinitly admit the money was well spent. The smoke is quite smooth and the Budz have &quot;white outs&quot; of THC crystals on them. The elevation is very calming as this strain is very good at relieving the constant thinkers. Sativa dominant stain so I was uplifted with more energy and less couch lock. Great  to enjoy in the morning forsure.

VIt&#39;s a quite good strain, perhaps little too harsh for bong hits and any form of glass products. My feeling towards to this strain will be much better designed for joints and blunts! However it does give out that soothing effect, leaving you stoned and happy. I personally wouldn&#39;t buy it again but it is recommended to try it out! Stay lifted people! &#127809;

VI bought a gram or two of a strain of weed whose name I didn&#39;t bother to ask for. I&#39;m a lightweight, and have only been smoking small amounts (.1 - .3 grams) at a time to avoid over-smoking and causing me to trip too much because I&#39;ve been doing that a bit too much recently, and also so I don&#39;t waste all my weed at once. I&#39;ve smoked this weed about 5-8 times now, the first half of those times being hit out of a pipe or bubbler, and the past 4 times being from pinners rolled with just .1g.\u000a\u000aHit from a pipe or bubbler, I remember my highs being great. Relaxed, but not super tired, and very euphoric. Made it easier to enjoy a movie or game and also made lots of things funny (even though they often weren&#39;t very funny), lots of giggling, and impaired my typing and texting a little bit, which is a point at which I know that I&#39;m high enough to stop smoking and enjoy myself, but that I could still probably smoke a bit more and get more fucked up. With this strain, I&#39;ve never pushed it that far, because I&#39;ve been smoking lightly as I mentioned. I&#39;d hit this in my pipe or bubbler, go inside and play some League of Legends. Making stupid decisions like taking bad champs for the wrong roles and building stupidly is one of my favourite things to do high, and that&#39;s what I&#39;d do after smoking this weed, every time. I found it fun to experiment and when I&#39;d die and screw things up as a result of my dumb champ/role picks I&#39;d find it hilarious. It would be hard to bring my mood down while I&#39;m high on this weed.\u000a\u000aIf smoked in a very small joint, it gave me a strange sensation in my body. As I&#39;d walk, I&#39;d feel my loose pant legs touching each other and felt like it wasn&#39;t the fabric over my leg I was feeling, it was just my leg. Hard to explain. It made me feel like my body was very transparent - that&#39;s the best word I can think of the describe it. Even though it didn&#39;t clear my head (and probably did the opposite as weed usually does), my head felt transparent, clear, weightless as if my brain wasn&#39;t in there anymore. It was an interesting experience with all of the feelings I&#39;d have in my body, but it didn&#39;t provoke my anxiety at all (most highs that make my body physically feel weird trigger massive panic attacks). I&#39;d become much more talkative, although my mouth would go dry (after the first or second pinner I found myself refusing to smoke them without a drink on me). My mood wouldn&#39;t be very elevated, but I&#39;d feel content with whatever I was doing. Because I was only taking a few hits of a .1g joint, these highs were very modest, and as you can see by how the high was when I&#39;d smoke more in a pipe or bubbler, the amount (and perhaps method) you smoke really does make a huge difference. I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d feel if you smoked a very large amount.

VGood mix of Sativa headiness with a good body buzz, but not too much of a &quot;couch lock&quot; effect really. Picked up an 1/8 and shared a bowl with a friend at about 4:00 - it&#39;s 6:11 now an I&#39;m still feeling pretty content. At first toke this bud has a good earthy flavor with an intertwine of fruit. In the bag it smells skunky - not overpowering, but noticeable when I pull my bag out. There&#39;s also a tinge of what I can only describe as it smells the same way dehydrated mangos taste, if that makes any sense. That part of the smell hits my nose strongly. It caries out in the exhale when you smoke it as well. Overall not the most impressive hybrid but hey, does the job for two hours. 8/10

VI like to think I know my weed pretty well and this one was definitely one of the best I&#39;ve had. It was a high grade variety specifically called Great White Shark that I&#39;ve had many times before and has always been subpar. However as a high grade strain it is extremely nice with a very clear and clean buzz. The buds are sticky but dries out nice and is very resinous. Very nice, strong sativa smell, not skunky at all but much cleaner. Clearly a very sativa dominant buzz with little downside, it doesn&#39;t last very long and finishes clean with little burnout.\u000a\u000aGrown properly this can be an awesome smoke.

VRolled a pinner/joint with about .2g of Great White Shark, a bit more than I usually roll with because I was out of GWS and so was the person I bought it from, so this would be the last time I&#39;d smoke it until I found it again (if ever). Smoked it in my friend&#39;s backyard sitting on some lawn chairs just talking about our week and such. I suffer from bad anxiety and even when I get a strain that is good for my anxiety, I often overthink things at the start of a high and stir up anxiety anyway. GWS never aggravated my anxiety, but I&#39;d sometimes freak myself out when smoking it. This time I felt no anxiety at all.\u000a\u000aI smoked half of it (the person I was with quit weed) and put it out, and made some more small talk. We then turned on my camera and played different beats on his phone while he freestyled over them and made videos of it. I&#39;d be beside him dancing and doing silly things like we were in a music video. After a little while, we went inside to get my friend his dinner as he hadn&#39;t ate yet. I felt relaxed and had that &quot;dumb&quot; high feeling that&#39;s hard to explain. However, the exchange I had with his mother will help anyone who&#39;s had that feeling understand right away: I said &quot;hi!&quot; to her, she said hello, and I just looked at her for a good 5-10 seconds and then walked away (normally I&#39;d follow up with a how are you or something, but my mind went blank). I thought that was kinda funny afterward. My friend ate and we went back outside to make more videos.\u000a\u000aBeing about an hour after I smoked the first half of the joint, I smoked the rest of it. I was having a blast being pretty much a hype man for my friend&#39;s rap videos and doing a bit of dumb freestyling myself. I laughed at a lot of things and ended up eating an entire bag of chips. I was really enjoying the chips, I definitely had the munchies, but for a short while I felt a bit sick. Not like I was going to puke, just that I should stop eating. But I continued and finished the bag, and a bottle of Pepsi, without feeling more sick. The night continued the same and I eventually went home.\u000a\u000aI got home 3-4 hours after I got to his house and I was quite tired, and ended up going to bed about an hour after I got home. I slept through my alarm in the morning and missed school. Worth it though, a great night with the last bit of one of my favourite weed strains!

VGreat White Shark is an excellent hybrid strain that can be prescribed to treat a full spectrum of ailments, making it an ideal bud for Sativa and Indica lover alike. The Great White Shark is Indica Dominant strain, yet has hints of tang and citrus that bring out the euphoric qualities. Some patients swear that it&#39;s best use is for &quot;couch-lock&quot;, relaxation, and sleep. Others say that they use Great White Shark to inspire creativity and energize their brain. Either way, the Great White Shark is my &quot;go-to&quot; strain for all around comfort!

VI don\u2019t think this is a Sativa. Has to be a Hybrid. 3 pulls leaves you a strong Indica body buzz and a strong euphoric head buzz. No couch lock, but boy this strain is heavy!

VGreat White Shark is an awesome strain that produces a very heavy body buzz which makes this sativa a great pain reliever! I would only use this in the evenings because despite it being a sativa it is quite strong and does result in an intoxicated feeling. Overall a wonderful strain to take the pain away....:o)

VI grow several strains outdoors yearly in my garden for personal use. Last season, I grew one Great White Shark plant from seed. (Greenhouse Seed Company) The plant grew vigourously and it yielded 132.5 grams, which is sub-par. Due to impeding poor weather, I harvested the Great White on Sept 25th, but I wanted to go a week longer. However, rain during that time of year can prove to be very problematic for plants and rain was with us over the next ten days.\u000a\u000aI do not smoke and use all my produce for baking, which gives 100% clean absorption of the medicine. I am an experieced, seasoned grower with cannabis experiece dating back into the early seventies, so I have encountered many fine cannabis strains. In my experience, I find the Great White Shark to be unremarkable. Last night, after an adequate curing process I tried a 1 gram cookie and found the experiece to be mediocre and unsophisticated from a perspective of cerebral qualities. There was very little creativity involved and the energy induced by the plant was rather stagnant. Appetite stimulation was also mediocre, but the body stone was reasonable, however  not really suitable for pain managment in my opinion. I do not recommend Great White Shark and will be working with another strain this season.

VThis strain was an interesting one for me. Delivered a very potent energy but gave me a hefty crash in energy about an hour later.\u000a\u000aHowever, I will say the hour is pretty pleasant. For me it was a productive energy, not so much a &#39;socializing&#39; feeling.\u000a\u000aThe smell is also very interesting, I&#39;d argue it smells very funky and cheesy. An almost offensive smell but it makes you want to smell it again.\u000a\u000aOverall, this isn&#39;t an impressive strain but it&#39;s a contender for a decent sativa.

The high is like I remember taking my first dab of trainwreck I believe it was and then smoking 2 bowls of Agent orange after....STONED! It definitely relaxed my mind.

VI bought a gram or two of a strain of weed whose name I didn&#39;t bother to ask for. I&#39;m a lightweight, and have only been smoking small amounts (.1 - .3 grams) at a time to avoid over-smoking and causing me to trip too much because I&#39;ve been doing that a bit too much recently, and also so I don&#39;t waste all my weed at once. I&#39;ve smoked this weed about 5-8 times now, the first half of those times being hit out of a pipe or bubbler, and the past 4 times being from pinners rolled with just .1g.\u000a\u000aHit from a pipe or bubbler, I remember my highs being great. Relaxed, but not super tired, and very euphoric. Made it easier to enjoy a movie or game and also made lots of things funny (even though they often weren&#39;t very funny), lots of giggling, and impaired my typing and texting a little bit, which is a point at which I know that I&#39;m high enough to stop smoking and enjoy myself, but that I could still probably smoke a bit more and get more fucked up. With this strain, I&#39;ve never pushed it that far, because I&#39;ve been smoking lightly as I mentioned. I&#39;d hit this in my pipe or bubbler, go inside and play some League of Legends. Making stupid decisions like taking bad champs for the wrong roles and building stupidly is one of my favourite things to do high, and that&#39;s what I&#39;d do after smoking this weed, every time. I found it fun to experiment and when I&#39;d die and screw things up as a result of my dumb champ/role picks I&#39;d find it hilarious. It would be hard to bring my mood down while I&#39;m high on this weed.\u000a\u000aIf smoked in a very small joint, it gave me a strange sensation in my body. As I&#39;d walk, I&#39;d feel my loose pant legs touching each other and felt like it wasn&#39;t the fabric over my leg I was feeling, it was just my leg. Hard to explain. It made me feel like my body was very transparent - that&#39;s the best word I can think of the describe it. Even though it didn&#39;t clear my head (and probably did the opposite as weed usually does), my head felt transparent, clear, weightless as if my brain wasn&#39;t in there anymore. It was an interesting experience with all of the feelings I&#39;d have in my body, but it didn&#39;t provoke my anxiety at all (most highs that make my body physically feel weird trigger massive panic attacks). I&#39;d become much more talkative, although my mouth would go dry (after the first or second pinner I found myself refusing to smoke them without a drink on me). My mood wouldn&#39;t be very elevated, but I&#39;d feel content with whatever I was doing. Because I was only taking a few hits of a .1g joint, these highs were very modest, and as you can see by how the high was when I&#39;d smoke more in a pipe or bubbler, the amount (and perhaps method) you smoke really does make a huge difference. I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d feel if you smoked a very large amount.

Picked up an 1/8 and shared a bowl with a friend at about 4:00 - it&#39;s 6:11 now an I&#39;m still feeling pretty content. At first toke this bud has a good earthy flavor with an intertwine of fruit. In the bag it smells skunky - not overpowering, but noticeable when I pull my bag out. There&#39;s also a tinge of what I can only describe as it smells the same way dehydrated mangos taste, if that makes any sense. That part of the smell hits my nose strongly. It caries out in the exhale when you smoke it as well. Overall not the most impressive hybrid but hey, does the job for two hours. 8/10

VI&#39;&#39;ll echo what a lot of others are saying, it hits hard and it hits fast.  Nice euphoric sativa high.  Makes me feel very content and a little giggly.  It&#39;s not a lengthy high, which is good or bad depending on the use and circumstances.

VGreat White Shark feels more like a hybrid than any other hybrid I&#39;ve ever smoked (even though it is considered Sativa). My eyes instantly dropped down low and all the stress and anger that had been built up throughout the day instantly melted away. Now I&#39;m generally a anxious and grumpy person but with the effects of the Great White Shark I felt happy and I was able to joke around without taking things to seriously and boy was I giggling. I felt happy and carefree. I was play fighting with my fianc&#233;e on the bed and when I fell off I hardly felt any pain as I slammed onto the hard floor. After about a good hour or 2 the effects shifted and although I still felt very relaxed, I began to feel sleepy. This strain does wonders on sleep. I tend to suddenly wake up throughout the night but when I fell asleep this particular night, I slept the whole night through and woke up more well rested than I can ever recall feeling.

For me it was a productive energy, not so much a &#39;socializing&#39; feeling.\u000a\u000aThe smell is also very interesting, I&#39;d argue it smells very funky and cheesy.

VI grow several strains outdoors yearly in my garden for personal use. Last season, I grew one Great White Shark plant from seed. (Greenhouse Seed Company) The plant grew vigourously and it yielded 132.5 grams, which is sub-par. Due to impeding poor weather, I harvested the Great White on Sept 25th, but I wanted to go a week longer. However, rain during that time of year can prove to be very problematic for plants and rain was with us over the next ten days.\u000a\u000aI do not smoke and use all my produce for baking, which gives 100% clean absorption of the medicine. I am an experieced, seasoned grower with cannabis experiece dating back into the early seventies, so I have encountered many fine cannabis strains. In my experience, I find the Great White Shark to be unremarkable. Last night, after an adequate curing process I tried a 1 gram cookie and found the experiece to be mediocre and unsophisticated from a perspective of cerebral qualities. There was very little creativity involved and the energy induced by the plant was rather stagnant. Appetite stimulation was also mediocre, but the body stone was reasonable, however  not really suitable for pain managment in my opinion. I do not recommend Great White Shark and will be working with another strain this season.

VGreat White Shark is an excellent hybrid strain that can be prescribed to treat a full spectrum of ailments, making it an ideal bud for Sativa and Indica lover alike. The Great White Shark is Indica Dominant strain, yet has hints of tang and citrus that bring out the euphoric qualities. Some patients swear that it&#39;s best use is for &quot;couch-lock&quot;, relaxation, and sleep. Others say that they use Great White Shark to inspire creativity and energize their brain. Either way, the Great White Shark is my &quot;go-to&quot; strain for all around comfort!

VRolled a pinner/joint with about .2g of Great White Shark, a bit more than I usually roll with because I was out of GWS and so was the person I bought it from, so this would be the last time I&#39;d smoke it until I found it again (if ever). Smoked it in my friend&#39;s backyard sitting on some lawn chairs just talking about our week and such. I suffer from bad anxiety and even when I get a strain that is good for my anxiety, I often overthink things at the start of a high and stir up anxiety anyway. GWS never aggravated my anxiety, but I&#39;d sometimes freak myself out when smoking it. This time I felt no anxiety at all.\u000a\u000aI smoked half of it (the person I was with quit weed) and put it out, and made some more small talk. We then turned on my camera and played different beats on his phone while he freestyled over them and made videos of it. I&#39;d be beside him dancing and doing silly things like we were in a music video. After a little while, we went inside to get my friend his dinner as he hadn&#39;t ate yet. I felt relaxed and had that &quot;dumb&quot; high feeling that&#39;s hard to explain. However, the exchange I had with his mother will help anyone who&#39;s had that feeling understand right away: I said &quot;hi!&quot; to her, she said hello, and I just looked at her for a good 5-10 seconds and then walked away (normally I&#39;d follow up with a how are you or something, but my mind went blank). I thought that was kinda funny afterward. My friend ate and we went back outside to make more videos.\u000a\u000aBeing about an hour after I smoked the first half of the joint, I smoked the rest of it. I was having a blast being pretty much a hype man for my friend&#39;s rap videos and doing a bit of dumb freestyling myself. I laughed at a lot of things and ended up eating an entire bag of chips. I was really enjoying the chips, I definitely had the munchies, but for a short while I felt a bit sick. Not like I was going to puke, just that I should stop eating. But I continued and finished the bag, and a bottle of Pepsi, without feeling more sick. The night continued the same and I eventually went home.\u000a\u000aI got home 3-4 hours after I got to his house and I was quite tired, and ended up going to bed about an hour after I got home. I slept through my alarm in the morning and missed school. Worth it though, a great night with the last bit of one of my favourite weed strains!

VI like to think I know my weed pretty well and this one was definitely one of the best I&#39;ve had. It was a high grade variety specifically called Great White Shark that I&#39;ve had many times before and has always been subpar. However as a high grade strain it is extremely nice with a very clear and clean buzz. The buds are sticky but dries out nice and is very resinous. Very nice, strong sativa smell, not skunky at all but much cleaner. Clearly a very sativa dominant buzz with little downside, it doesn&#39;t last very long and finishes clean with little burnout.\u000a\u000aGrown properly this can be an awesome smoke.

VWhen this strain is grown properly, it is primarily white in colour with a lime green accent, it has lengthy amber hairs that obnoxiously stretch throughout the bud reaching a good amount of area. Your eyes fixate on the abundance of trichome as the indubitable aesthetic quality of this strain. A nice whiff gives an inviting smell with a certain sweetness to it. When you break into the bud and squeeze it a bit this strain gives off a more pungent, sweet + piney smell. It tastes great ! smooth with a good level of expansion as you hold it in. The high sets in at a medium pace, quicker/heavier if u force cough, it gives a clear buzz with just the right amount of sedation that you hardly notice - which makes the high somewhat motivating (I like to do errands and early morning studying with this strain). Effective for depression and anxiety also.

VI was directed to this strain when my dispensary did not have Acapulco Gold.  I was told Great White Shark is great for pain.  This was the most disappointing strain ever.  Super dry nugs that fell apart when you touch them.  High lasted about 30 mins tops.  Nothing to write home about.  Not worth the money I gave away for this junk strain.

VLike I&#39;ve seen in other reviews, this strain hits fast - I found it quite strong.  Fairly decent body buzz for a sativa, which becomes  more apparent as time passes. When I&#39;m high my vision usually gets a little blurry, and I noticed it waaay more with GWS than with others, probably due to its muscle relaxing properties. The only reason  I dont give it five stars is due to what I found to be slightly  thick and harsh smoke. I&#39;ll probably vape it next time.

The buds, look, smell and taste great as well, I coughed only once yet I have a sore throat. This is beyond godly, best weed i have ever smoked. My back feels like Im still fifteen. Try it.

VI bought the seeds from Green House Seeds company, and grew organically in outside here in the Czech rep.\u000a\u000aI grew another 2 strains, but this strain was the only one that grew fully mature, the buds were very big, sticky and had very pleasant berry aroma. Moreover, the yield was handsome, I grew 2 plants of GWS, and I&#39;ve got around 450g of dried buds.\u000a\u000aThe effect is very nicely balanced, I always feel the sativa side at first, but it&#39;s not overpowering yet, it gives you a nice body relaxation as well. Most importantly, it finishes very smoothly.\u000a\u000aI often go for a walk or do Thai-yoga as having a joint. It&#39;s simply enjoyable. One of my favorite strains so far!\u000a\u000a

VI was expecting a good energetic sativa high, but it was the complete opposite for me. I had GWS shatter and loaded it into my Kandypen and took a couple of good puffs. I felt a little energy in my head almost instantly and then a very strong indica body stone. My muscles were relaxing throughout my body from head to toe. I started to feel such a deep sense of relaxation and euphoria that I fell asleep. I woke up and hour later with slobber on my arm lol. I couldn&#39;t believe how hard the GWS hit me. it&#39;s definitely not a strain you should plan on doing alot after smoking. I think it&#39;s good if you want a strain to get some sleep with. Definitely a keeper for me.

Vgood bud not the best looking from what i purchased but im willing to bet it could look better if grown better. color is  light green with very light colored red/orange hairs. not to much on the sparkly side. the bud i picked up is an outdoor WS and has the out doors taste not much to rave about. after smoking one fatty of WS i went about some errands and i have to say that the high kicked in nice , i was surprized at the effect of just one bowl very satisfying high real relaxed but not sleepy id say perfect for video games, movies , a cruz in the car. .7/10

VVery happy high. Kicks in fast. Only three stars because it didn&#39;t last as long as I would like and after long usage effects don&#39;t really work as well.

VThis strain is a quality sativa. Got a rush of energy when smoking this. This strain was great for pretty much everything. After smoking this strain i felt happyness wash over me. Hands down quality. Top pick for sure. The high was happy, energetic, and exciting. It was like my first time getting high all over again. Great bud, great price, could not be more happy with this purchase.

VThis was a pretty nice and potent sativa with a very trippy head high, almost psychedelic, and a noticable indica body high. This is one of those strains were the high creeps up on you. When I tried this strain I got pretty strong auditory hallucinations. It felt like I had a music editing program in my head. I could control sounds in my head and it was pretty freaking gnarly! I also got mild CEVs.  The taste was wonderfully sweet with a sweet orange smell and had fluffy light green buds coated with crystals.

Vgreat white packs an initial punch that makes me giggly and smiley... not even cheesey but just on the ticklish edge of enjoyment. dark to bright green medium density nuggets with light odor. Has a sweet, yet very sour smell, with an icey thunderfuck undertone, melded with a light touch of skunk. great to throw into your normal rotation for something a little different. Very clear for an indica, quite potent.

VPicked some of this up from collective, guy was raving about his new crop and all so I got an 8th. Bad mistake. took it out the bag when I got back and the canister itself smelled like a wet cigarette. it made the other bottles smell bad :(! Well I cracked it open to see if I had wasted 25 bucks, and it didn&#39;t LOOK bad on the outside. but the inside showed what I thought. A mix of Mite webs and budrot. didn&#39;t even smoke it, showed it to a friend, asked if he wanted to MAYBE decarb and use it for edibs. but we threw it away. DONT SELL YOUR FIRST TIME CROPS ON MARKET.  I&#39;m very glad I only got an 8th.
