VGreat sativa! Makes an akward person like myself super happy and social. Very talkative and giggly. Fun and euphoric high! Great fruity aroma and flavor. My go to flower when I&#39;m in for a long, busy day.

V- [ ] My body is in constant aches and pains from the abuse of BMX all my life so I was looking for a strain would provide some relief but still allow me to go ride and not effect my abilities .  Honestly, I wasn\u2019t a fan at first but I started to really enjoy this strain as I used it more and felt the results. I especially found this strain super nice to vape at around the 190-210 temperature just before going for ride. I found this strain to give a instant head buzz but then mellows out. Another note, is the smell. The distinct smell of this strain over power everything else I find. Seems like no matter how many times I cleaned my gear all I smell is Stella Blue still. \u000a

VMade me awake with what I would descibe as a clear headed but heady high.  Tasted good and made me happy, some throat burn though.
