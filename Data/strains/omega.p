VI tried Omega for my first time awhile ago and still till this day it&#39;s one of my favorites... Earthy pungent hard hitting weed with a hint of blueberry.

VGrab your spaceship and buckle up! I smoked just over 1/2 a J with a couple friends. While they were content with chillin on the couch, I went for a walk to explore. This dank took me on a journey. When I returned to my friends, they were still locked in on the couch and non of us could portray what was going on in our own heads. The high lasted a good few hours and was enjoyable.
