VI got some Terminator on a $6/gram special and I scored!  Mine tested at 25.82% THC and .08% CBD.  Just like Arnold Schwarzenegger this strain is strong!  I&#39;m feeling the effects after only a few hits and I have a high tolerance / blaze every day, so... :)\u000a\u000aThe only reason I don&#39;t give Terminator 5 stars is that the flavor in the particular batch I got is mild, and perhaps that&#39;s why it was on special for $6/gram.\u000a\u000aWhile I&quot;m stoked to be the first person to review Terminator on Leafly, I wish there were more reviews of it so I could get a better feel for what I&#39;m supposed to be tasting here.  It&#39;s a pleasant taste, just mild...to me it smells and tastes a bit like sweet pine. \u000a\u000aI feel a lovely indica induced relaxation and this jazz music that&#39;s on seems extra ka-pa-pa-PA.  \u000a\u000aI look forward to reading more reviews of Terminator!
