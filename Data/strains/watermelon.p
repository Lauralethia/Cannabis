VThis review is for Nameless Genetics&#39; strain watermelon, which may be different than the Indica version listed here on Leafly. It&#39;s more often labeled as a sativa-dominant hybrid &#39;round these parts, but then, you can&#39;t really trust most dispensaries&#39; menus (but that&#39;s drama for another time and place).\u000a\u000aSo here&#39;s the dilly. I scored this medicine from Green Wolf in LA, having heard great things about Nameless&#39;s work, and it turns out the hype is REAL, brothers and sisters.\u000a\u000aThe nugs are light, lime green, not too dense (which also makes me think this isn&#39;t an indica), totally covered in crystalline frost and perfectly trimmed &amp; cured. The aroma is maybe the best I&#39;ve ever encountered-- a blend of ripe banana peel and watermelon candy with the tiniest hint of spice in the background... It&#39;s quite literally like opening a pouch of Watermelon Big League Chew on a summer afternoon. Seriously, you will keep returning to the jar just to sniff this one, like a spun out truffle pig. Your significant other will worry that maybe you&#39;re taking this &quot;weed thing&quot; too far. But you know what? This shit smells like magical candy. It&#39;s bud fit for a Hufflepuff slumber party, and I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it.\u000a\u000aANYWAY. Flavor-wise, the watermelon is still totally present when vaped, but it&#39;s joined by other more familiar OG-type flavors of pine and citrus. It&#39;s tasty-- SUPER tasty, in fact-- but I think it smells even better than it smokes (or vapes, in my case).\u000a\u000aThe effects are a unique and satisfying blend of weed&#39;s best qualities, with a sativa-like jolt of energy and euphoria at the onset (pressure around the eyes, giggles, goofiness) followed by relaxation and pain relief, with a trancey mental state. It&#39;s good and strong, but not &quot;heavy&quot; feeling-- I was able to dose repeatedly and stay functional until bedtime, at which point the body high eased me into a peaceful slumber. You get the benefits of a sativa-type rush without any of the raciness or insomnia that some flowers stick you with.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I consider this world class stuff. The scent, flavor and effects are all top notch, and between this and the Mega Wellness I tried recently, Nameless Genetics are doing incredible work. If you&#39;re in SoCal, do yourself a favor and track down some of their flower...

VHands down my favourite bud. Specifically the Astroboy cutting that is oh-so-delicious. Delicate flower, certainly has a strong indica footing but a certain Sativa glitter to the high. Very focused and creative high, long lasting with a warm glow to the entire trip. Very flavourful, sweet, fruity taste that lingers well after you are done smoking.

VIt&#39;s absolutely an amazing indica, only 15 minutes into the session and I&#39;m experiencing extreme euphoria and numbness around the body, just really relaxed vibrations. Plus it&#39;s an almost genius combination of indica and sativa (80/20) and what little cerebral effects are there gently compliment the intense wave of the body high.

VThis is a very exciting strain for me.  I have a number of problems, including chronic pain and anxiety, and for several years have not been able to sleep without taking xanax - until I tried Watermelon, that is.  It relaxed my body and soothed my pain; it relaxed my mind and soothed my nerves.  I drifted comfortably off to sleep and woke up BEFORE MY ALARMS, (I set 3 alarms to wake me up, since that&#39;s what it usually takes), feeling alert and energized.  Definitely one of my favorite strains.

VI bought a gram of this earlier to try and here&#39;s my review! \u000aI asked to see the bud and the budtender opened the jar and the nugs were just completely covered in trichs and pretty dense. Didn&#39;t smell it til I got home but the smell was really unique. It smelled like berries kinda but it had this smell of watermelon that was sorta overpowering the berry smell and it was so weird because it smelled like I cut open a watermelon when I broke it down. The taste was not at all the same as the smell. I rolled a joint and from the first hit it was just harsh on throat and it kinda reminded me of like kush. It was still bomb though. I&#39;m pretty high right now and it&#39;s super nice on the body. My legs feel so nice and being that I haven&#39;t slept in 26 hours that 80% is hitting me hard. I&#39;m gonna have to grow this one.

I could still get up and move around without being too gone. This also relaxes me completely. I suffer terrible anxiety and stress, this strain puts it to sleep.

VWatermelon has a noticeably fruity smell, the berry profiles seem to be blueberry and strawberry, although I could be mistaken. Using a pipe will ensure the full terpene experience. The texture was quite brittle and I did not have to use a grinder - the trichomes were covered in crystal and the hairs were a light orange, similar to Chernobyl and Pineapple Express. Extremely powerful strain. I was quite groggy the next day which is fantastic if you prefer a powerful indica.

Vso the one thing that I will say right off the top is that this is some of the loudest smelling flower I have ever come across with. every single time you open up the jar the room explodes with the happiest fruity smelling Bud ever. on top of looking quite miraculous in the Sun or on its own it&#39;s pink hairs and neon green leaf are clearly reasoning for the name. the flavor and smoke on a bong is some of the smoothest and fruitful exhales I have ever had. innevape The Taste comes through even more with a mix of berry and melon this is hands-down my favorite strain and why I pick up on every occasion possible

VGotta say, i did not like the taste of this strain. Was very try and almost a wood-like taste to it. Not sure if that was just the bud i had, or if the taste doesnt do it for me. That being said, the high and after is well worth the taste. incredibly relaxing, and uplifting high. So fsr has been by far the best strain for my depression.

VPicked up on some watermelon grown by Nameless Genetics. The buds look beautiful with lots of trichomes and is nice light green in color. Has a melon smell but it&#39;s not that pungent like Mega Wellness or Mega Glue. Honestly the taste was not that strong and it didn&#39;t leave much of a taste. It smoked nicely and had a bit of expansion on the exhale.  The high was uplifting and clear headed. The high felt more like a sativa then an indica strain. It didn&#39;t leave me dreamy or sedative but still had a bit of euphoric feeling. I&#39;m thinking maybe the buds were a bit dry and lost some smell and taste. Gonna try to find a fresh batch and see if it makes a difference.

VThis is a rather hard hitting strain.  The name is not what the taste is whatsoever, but the smell is quite nice.  When I put it into my Vape, I noticed that it burned quite nicely and the taste was rather pleasant.  The only real complaint I have is the fact that it makes me cough a bit.  It is not as bad as Chem Dawg or Cheese, which is a really good thing.  But after 1 bowl of this stuff I noticed that it hit me hard for a THC of 12.7!  I was surprised about that.  I went to go to the bathroom and I noticed it even more when I would move and lift a few things.  My concentration was not affected much at all.  I gave this 4 stars because of the coughing and slight nose irritation I get from this.  I would have gave it 3 stars for the weak THC levels, but that is just not a factor as this really is more potent than I was expecting.  Overall this does relax you, and as for pain, I did notice that I was able to eat about a 1/4 of an ice cream tub without my teeth hurting from the intense cold, but for other pains like my heels and my back, it took a bit more than just the edge off, but the pains were still there but very manageable.  I had about a total of 4 or 5 bowls, and after that I was very relaxed.\u000a\u000aOther than being relaxed, I felt rather tingly and a bit giggly, not too talkative, and mildly to moderately aroused (Due mainly to the tingly aspect) :)  OH and you WILL get the munchies!  (Note the Ice cream tub mentioned above!)\u000a\u000aWould I buy this one again?  Hmmm.   I will say yes ONLY because it is one of the cheapest if not the cheapest that Tilray sells it which is at $8/g.  (I am not sure if Tilray sells any at $7/g I would have to check but I don&#39;t think so) and the fact that it really is more potent than you might think/expect so in that respect you get quite the bang for your buck.   So if you need a strain that is just for relaxation, and just watching a movie or whatever, then this will be good for you,.  If you want pure pain relief from something more severe like arthritis or something like that, then this will not be what you are looking for unless you take more than 6 or 7 bowls, but there are more potent strains out there for that which will not have you use up so much Watermelon to get close to the same relief.

Vso the one thing that I will say right off the top is that this is some of the loudest smelling flower I have ever come across with. every single time you open up the jar the room explodes with the happiest fruity smelling Bud ever. on top of looking quite miraculous in the Sun or on its own it&#39;s pink hairs and neon green leaf are clearly reasoning for the name. the flavor and smoke on a bong is some of the smoothest and fruitful exhales I have ever had. innevape The Taste comes through even more with a mix of berry and melon this is hands-down my favorite strain and why I pick up on every occasion possible

VGreat for depression, anxiety, RLS, insomnia.. Smells like watermelon bubble gum, awesome! Smooth smoke, sweet taste. I was able to use it for daytime (in small doses) and still be functional. Mixed with a strong sativa,.. &#128076; \u000a\u000aRecommended &#128077;\u000a\u000a&#128483;&#128168;

VWatermelon has a noticeably fruity smell, the berry profiles seem to be blueberry and strawberry, although I could be mistaken. Using a pipe will ensure the full terpene experience. The texture was quite brittle and I did not have to use a grinder - the trichomes were covered in crystal and the hairs were a light orange, similar to Chernobyl and Pineapple Express. Extremely powerful strain. I was quite groggy the next day which is fantastic if you prefer a powerful indica.

VOnly reason I gave 4 stars is because this strain made me waaaaaaay too sleepy! But that being said, I used it to wake and bake so that was my bad. If you can&#39;t sleep, smoke some watermelon and I promise you, sleep will come!\u000a\u000aTastes great, small hint of watermelon. Smoke through a clean pipe for that nice flavour.

VGotta say, i did not like the taste of this strain. Was very try and almost a wood-like taste to it. Not sure if that was just the bud i had, or if the taste doesnt do it for me. That being said, the high and after is well worth the taste. incredibly relaxing, and uplifting high. So fsr has been by far the best strain for my depression.

VBest strain I&#39;ve had in a while! Very fruity taste (not watermelon though, in my opinion) made my mouth water every toke, very dense buds with an extremely high THC levels. Will be getting this strain regularly if it&#39;s available!
