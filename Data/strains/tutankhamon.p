VAt the 33% tested and confirmed batch of Totankhamun strain, the psychoactive properties of THC can turn an atheist to an agnostic. Light phrodisiac and high body high on this strain; even for a shatter head, or a cannabis cookie monster. Heavy strain for a pot head, mild strain for a beginner shatter user. And in my scale of expertise, Tutankhamon bows below a 45% tested and confirmed batch of Oracle strain, but still is the king of all strains. Well deserves it&#39;s name.\u000a\u000a\u000aMusic to listen to while high on this strain &quot;Sax On The Beach&quot; Mixtape Part 1 (Melodic Saxophone Deephouse)\u000ahttp://soundcloud.com/brdly/sax-on-the-beach-melodic\u000aFrom the minute 25.00

VReally awesome strain. It&#39;s definitely the best sativa that i&#39;ve ever had. I dont recommend this to anyone who is just starting out, this is a very strong strain and it makes me experience psychedelic activity. so don&#39;t smoke this if you&#39;re not into that stuff. Otherwise, a really fantastic high.

VAbsolutely the best strain I&#39;ve ever had. I purchased the HUXTON line of KING TUT. I have a pretty high tolerance by now, but wow! This strain kicked my butt in a great way. The regular King Tut and HUXTON King Tut are both fantastic in smell,taste and THC- Super &quot;high&quot; in THC-High 20&#39;s... If you haven&#39;t experienced HUXTON, You Should! \u000aA very happy Strain!\u000aCheers

VRolled this king tut up tightly in a j and pulled up the relaxing rocking chair and lit up. I smoked through half the j with some worry as I didn&#39;t feel much at all but like a rush of wind hitting your head it engulfed my brain into a trance. The music sounded better the air around me arouse. I felt extremely relaxed as I busted out some homework. I&#39;m extremely pleased with this long lasting light weed.

VHoly High Batman! This strain is not for beginners. Very intense and wonderfully uplifting high, definite mood booster and stress reducer. But in very small doses. If I smoked half a joint of this I don&#39;t think I would be coherent or functioning beyond half-hearted grunting. Between chronic back pain and my myriad of Injuries from my military service, along with chronic anxiety, depression, and mild PTSD, it is not simple to try to get out of that head space. Yet that is exactly what this strain does. If you are having a really rough time, this strain is for you 100%.if you want to be stoned off your ass, get some of this for sure if you still want to have some function in your extremities. If you are just getting into cannabis and you hears about this awesome super potent strain that you have to try... DANGER WILL ROBINSON, wait a bit, let your tolerance build and get used to some stronger strains or this will lay you out like an uppercut to the jaw. Enjoy and good luck!

VGreat, another smooth ride from the producers at #Huxton via @monarchaz #MonarchArizona keeps getting it on the money when it comes to #product. Specifically in the HUXTON products, not to say I haven&#39;t picked up some other fine #chronic product their (i.e. The Louis Tres of late) which I actually went back and re-upped on because I like to keep things in stock. Am finding the Arizona market has ongoing product fluctuations.  Back to the Tut!  The #AK47 ancestry really comes out in this #strain with all the &quot;even flow&quot; of the #hybrid. Great for focusing on writing or having a great night out with friends.  Takes the edge off when things are intense...A sweet ended #tokes with a great &quot;earthy&quot;  #flavor on the tail, beautiful, white ash and no snap, crackle and pop, gotta love people who understand how important the #flushing ,#cure and #finishing is to quality of the end #cannabis. The key process that makes good #weed become #greatweed ...You can tell that \u201crush to #market\u201d, does not take precedent over product #quality and delivery from Monarch&#39;s #Huxton line.

VWhat a brilliant sativa! King Tut is truly a wonderful strain. One of them rare to come by, heavy hitter sativas that stands true to its nature. It has a light earthy/flowery flavor with trails of sweetness softly tucked behind each hit. Wonderfully energizing, just minutes in a nice uplifted feeling kicks in relieving stress and mental tension allowing for a relaxed recharge of vital energy. For how heavy hitting this strain is it manages to keep you clear headed allowing you to focus on the tasks at hand without the build up of anxiety. The stress and anxiety relieving properties of this strain are amazing! King Tut has a very nice potency to it that may put a novice or even experienced user in a paranoia lock (if too much is consumed) so I recommend taking precaution with how much you&#39;re consuming if it&#39;s your first time trying this strain. All in all King Tut is a great uplifted, energetic, anxiety relieving masterpiece that&#39;s a great daytime balancer for anything from enjoying a walk in nature to juggling the everyday tasks at hand.

My plant branched out like crazy hence all the clones ( looked like a fucking mess when it was growing till I took clones). my clones are not branchy just the mom maybe 1 or 2 clones will be like mom but I&#39;m cool with that more clones or lots of training and defoliating.

VI bought Tutankhamun from original sensible seeds. They are a very CRAPPY place to buy seeds, and only one survived out of 4, but that one plant was phenomenal!! It grew to about 16  inches and I got about one and half ounces, but the quality was dynamite! They were rated at 33% THC, but mine one plant did not finish. They were still about 24% when I harvested the plant. The reason was I only had a small closet to grow them in, and that was only my second grow! Still, all in all, I would HIGHLY (pardon the pun!) recommend this to everyone who wants to get really high!

This hits like you would expect out of a sativa, with good focus, elevated mood, and more motivation.  What I&#39;m not getting, however, is any sort of racy feeling or paranoia. Everything feels pretty calm. \u000a\u000aIf you have PTSD, ADHD, and/or Anxiety, and are looking for a sativa to try, give this one a shot.

Perhaps divine intervention? ;-)\u000aI am using this to treat daytime chronic pain from failed back surgery syndrome. I&#39;ve also found it to be incredibly helpful with my anxiety and depression. A little bit of medicine, and all three just melt away. Seems to help out with the ADHD symptoms too. \u000aHands down 5 stars. Treats everything. Better than any of those pills the MD&#39;s push.

VI talked tot he guys at pyramid seeds and I told them I wanted the giggliest sativa auto they had. They recommended Kryptonite and Tutankhamon. \u000a\u000aThe auto plant was easy to grow and it followed a very compact and orderly pattern exposing all the buds to the light and they all developed dense and at the same time.\u000a\u000aThe effect is spot on: definitely giggly, it is the only one of the strains I have right now that definitely makes me laugh. It is not too euphoric however, but definitely not stony, I would say it is mellow with a giggly edge. It doesn&#39;t feel that potent though but after it reaches its peak it slowly ease you down to peace without being stony and in the end, it lets you sleep well. One of the more-sativa, more giggly autos out there. The smell is sweet mango, the taste is a bit citriousy . One of the best weeds I have, really good option to grow on auto.

VBought a gram of this on someone else&#39;s recommendation. Definitely a winner. The high is clear headed and it does not slow you down. Each time I smoked it I felt a very powerful mental calmness about it, helping me to keep all my thoughts on positive things very easily. Terrific strain for watching movies or documentaries, seems like time slows down and there is more time to absorb all that is going on. I watched a couple of Marvel movies that I had already seen a few times, but I was able to pick up a ton of subtle details that I had missed previously. \u000aHighly recommended for a relaxed clear headed buzz that leaves a positive mindset even as it wears off.

VWoW is all I can say.  wow wow, this Tutankhamon is no joke, take at your own risk! Trippy as hell, scary stuff NOT for first timers or light weights. 1 joint of this medium size is equivalent to about 3-5 of a typical strain. Amazing spooky looking plant when flowering, looks like something out of Halloween with so much resin. Tutankhamons trips will take you back to when you were a kid no joke! Strain hates gnats, beware with this strain when cultivating.

VLovely plant to grow, grows like a Christmas tree. Dont cut too soon, she likes a much longer flower than most of the guides tell you. Tastes very earthy with a slight citrus but there is a second pheno type i have observed that tastes like pure AK47 so that was a nice experience. Very potent stuff this one and when dried and cured it makes AMAZING tasting hash. BHO runs are also a must but very potent so careful.

VI really like this strain- and contrary to its name I was not mummified by its effects! \u000aA nice compact bud, burned evenly in the bong, smoke only made me cough if I tried to be a piggy lol Smooth smoke that slowly lifted my mind and spirits. A nice high, felt clean and focused, increased creativity and libido for sure &amp; was excellent for date night ;) Not too intense, might be ok for those who worry about Sativa induced anxiety. High lasted for quite a while and the let down was not a total crash and burn scenario. Only disadvantage I had was pretty intense dry mouth but hey that&#39;s what good craft beer is for! Haha this one&#39;s a keeper.

VAlert. That&#39;s the best word to describe this. kind of racey, buzzy, in your head mental intensity. very functional, little fuzziness but the alert factor is there. good sativa here,reminds me of cinex in the clarity. fast comedown that mellows out nicely. mixed with some plushberry to even it out.very nice! mine was 23% but hits your head harder. good sativa with little body effects.

VToday I entered King Tut&#39;s tomb and it was everything I hoped it would be. I was immediately whisked away to the lands of the sandy hills. There I met King Tut himself, this majestic creation of energy and happiness. I was not worthy in front of such magnificence. He assured me however that I too was a King! For he had put the Tut Curse on me, transferring some of his powers on to me. I must say, this is a potent strain that will hit you fast and stay with you as you roam about your day. I sweet and citrus smell combined with a cool but &quot;tickly&quot; sensation on the inhale.  \u000a\u000aWood Strain?\u000aYes.

VTut is the best strain I&#39;ve smoked and grown out of hundreds! Taste, smell, and potency are off the charts!! The only downside, is growing it is very tricky, easily you can turn a plant, accidentally of course, into garbage where the buds are small enough to look like lavender. If you have the skill, or can buy it from someone who does, definitely try Tut and you should love it too!!
