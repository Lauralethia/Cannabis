VThis is some of that wake n bake n fall right back asleep type shit. Relaxing on both the body and mind. Potent indica that completely handles insomnia, appetite problems, pain, anxiety, depression and more. The batch that I have my hands on is one of the densest buds I&#39;ve had to date. The smell is a mellow pine/skunk with a smooth sweet grape back note it. A true purp strain. A must have for indica lovers and medical patients in my opinion, but be careful with this one it&#39;s easy to forget where you are, fall asleep in the middle of stuff you shouldn&#39;t, and eat loads of junk food, even for experienced users like myself.

VDarth Vader OG is a current strain from one of my gardens and I am enjoying it as much as the Skywalker OG parent strain crossed with Purple Kush and it&#39;s a very purple strain at that.  This hard hitting indica strain is definitely not for those that prefer mild strains. As this is a heavy indica with recommendations that night time use is when it would be most appropriate to use.  I would recommend this stain to the more chronic users out there that this is an excellent strain when you are up very early in the morning.

VI tried Darth Vader OG for the first time and it gave me a nice, mellow high. I didn&#39;t know anything about DVOG, other than that it was an indica.  I expected it to be a little more psychedelic due to the OG lineage but it was still a pleasant high.   my mind was clear and concise, fully able to focus on the task at hand.   I gave this a 4 star cause it was not as heavy of an indica as I would have liked it to be.  In the end, I highly recommend trying the Darth Vader OG for a relaxing high at the end of the night.

VBecame a favorite almost instantly. Sex was great, the conversations were great (even though I was mostly listening, I could kind of follow conversation but I couldn&#39;t formulate my own thoughts very well), music was incredible. my body and mind both felt a mild euphoria. the only downside for me was the dry mouth, dry eyes, and (very) mild paranoia. definitely a good one to fall asleep to or spend with someone one on one that you enjoy. definitely got lazy and tired, not something to do if you have plans. have water and snacks handy Because you really won&#39;t want to move. the embrace was incredibly warm and uplifting, and the &quot;after high&quot; lasted quite a few hours. a little visually impairing.

VSmells like grape soda. Heavy indica that will make you want to sleep. I&#39;ve smoked heavy for a while now and this put me out. I didn&#39;t even have to take any sleep medication.

VThis is a very nice hybrid with tight resinous buds.  Don\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t get that \u201cone hit\u201d blast.  This strain does have several gears and a nice \u201ccreep\u201d effect.   I enjoyed this strain a lot.  Excellent anti-inflammatory effect as well.

VBought a quarter of Darth Vader today after checking this sites reviews and description. The buds are a very bright green, no sign of anything purple. When I opened it the first thing I noticed was that it had \u201cno\u201d aroma or smell. No smell whatsoever. Odd. After smoking two bowlsful, I barely felt anything.  No signs of indica traits. Odder. It must be a creeper, I\u2019m still waiting. Just a very slight relaxed feeling. I\u2019ve smoked for 50years and have never been so disappointed. I wish I\u2019d only gotten an eighth. I\u2019d say this is a good strain for beginners

VBecame a favorite almost instantly. Sex was great, the conversations were great (even though I was mostly listening, I could kind of follow conversation but I couldn&#39;t formulate my own thoughts very well), music was incredible. my body and mind both felt a mild euphoria. the only downside for me was the dry mouth, dry eyes, and (very) mild paranoia. definitely a good one to fall asleep to or spend with someone one on one that you enjoy. definitely got lazy and tired, not something to do if you have plans. have water and snacks handy Because you really won&#39;t want to move. the embrace was incredibly warm and uplifting, and the &quot;after high&quot; lasted quite a few hours. a little visually impairing.

VIt&#39;s very potent and *exceptionally* relaxing, one of the strongest strains I&#39;ve ever done. Stress, anxiety, insomnia, poof, gone. Body high is outstanding. It slows you waaaay down. Not to be consumed before balancing your checkbook, nor before a workout, and you won&#39;t feel like getting up to clean your house. Dreamy and reflective. Perfect for settling down with a movie, book, cat, friend, etc.
