VThis strain is excellent for day time pain relief. It has a sweet, tropical taste to it. Though the taste comes through much, much more when vaping versus smoking. When smoking, I get a vague sweet tropical taste. When vaping, I actually get a heavy pineapple, which is really pleasant.\u000a\u000aLove this, really appreciate what it&#39;s doing for my pain levels and how much it&#39;s allowing me to function again.

VThis strain is my go to! Theraplant did a fantastic job with this one the flower is good but their shatter was amazing fruity sweet tasting profile with a hint of pineapple that crushes depression doesn&#39;t induce anxiety yet let&#39;s you function through out the day with a nice mellow euphoria.

VI concur with what many have said..great morning strain and a great way to battle depression. Im going hiking soon after having this strain in a tincture. Great for vaping in the morning and great for when you are about to do it!

VSmoking Pineapple Fields (Zainavir) prerolls from Theraplant. At first this one didn\u2019t stand out to me particularly\u2014 it\u2019s a slightly cerebral high with just enough focus to get some things done, curbs depression, gets you feeling a little talkative and silly. Then I realized this strain (to me) feels just like how the high was when I first started smoking when I was younger. It\u2019s hard to overdo it with this and it\u2019s a great social strain to have and pass around with friends. Recommended for new users since it won\u2019t hit hard and doesn\u2019t induce anxiety. This will be great for those times you just feel like hanging out and not doing anything that takes a lot of mental energy and want to get a nice creative buzz going.

VVery intense cerebral high. Slight pressure at the temples. Gets me very stoned without heavy sedation. oUt has a fruity inhale and even tastier exhale. Grade A on taste. But the high of this strain can either intensify my anxiety or make me forget about it, which is why I give 4 stars. But overall some great bud to smoke after a long day of work or if you&#39;re stressing.

VFirst off this smells soooo good!! Citrus, pineapple, and that diesel mixed together. I\u2019d wear it as a perfume. The flavor is carried over when it\u2019s smoked. Rolled myself a little joint cuz I\u2019m waiting for my piece to come in the mail but I couldn\u2019t resist how good it smells. Felt a nice sense of relaxation and my pain level was decreasing. I\u2019m going back for more!

VGreat for wake n bake purposes. Fantastic way to get your day started. I usually follow with a microdose of pure CBD/Indica to take the anxious edge off. The onset can be stifling if you&#39;re not aware of it but it can easily be shaken off. Otherwise, its an awesome, clean and very energetic high. There is a body aspect to it that can be quite intense at times, depending on dosage. Tingly and goosebumps followed by a flush. This has not happened every time I&#39;ve consumed however during longer sessions I have noticed it.

VOne of my favorites in flavor, this truly has a great pineapple flavor. Very tasty and smells so good. Buds were cured to absolute perfection! A strong high, too much will be too much but just a little is all you need! The flavor is truly incredible. Little tired on the comedown, but mentally feeling great even after its over.

VYour typical sativa here. A slightly more active high. This is right on the borderline of &quot; Wake and Bake &quot; strain and &quot; I just wanna get high &quot; strain. It is not as debilitating as most and it&#39;s almost light enough to go about your day as normal .... not quite though. \u000a\u000aThe flower smelled very citrus like which is to be expected considering the name. The taste of the flower when smoked is somewhat of a tropical and earthy flavor. It is very light and does not have a strong taste to it ( to me ). It sort of feels like somebody put a very loosely woven beanie around your head. \u000a\u000aThis strain just sort of fell into the forgettable category also. It does what you would expect of a sativa and it tastes rather good doing it. If you see it , yea pick it up. \u000a\u000aMeh ....
