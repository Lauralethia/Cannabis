VVery nice stuff. Long-lasting cerebral effect. Pleasant, happy, chatty, floaty high. Is quite effective on nerve pain, which is impressive for a sativa. I&#39;ve had indicas that are better, but this stuff does a bang-up job. I will definitely buy this strain again for a daytime pain relief medication.

VThis strain is one of those love/hate ones - I love it sometimes but it has a few drawbacks for me. Of course everyone is different. The particular plant I have been medicating with is aquaponically grown. \u000a\u000aI like the high and for me this weed is a bit of a creeper, like it slowly seeps into my headspace. It makes me focused but can also make me carry a bit of tension. Sometimes I am nicely uplifted and refreshed and sometimes I get a headache from the smoke of this bad boy. Or it makes me clench my jaw. I do like how it is potent enough to rip up a long time user like myself but doesn&#39;t create a huge burn out quickly as some high thc strains can. I actually have found this strain is good for physical activity days. Going hiking, spring cleaning, chasing littles, or even like moving day. If I sweat and discharge the tension then it&#39;s a good strain for giving a boost or pushing through bad pain on a &quot;must do&quot; day. I don&#39;t mind the smell but the taste is kinda blah to me. In fact, I taste celery haha and ammonia, not my idea of a yummy time. That being said, it is easier on my asthma than a lot of other strains and that&#39;s a huge bonus while smoking is still the cheapest way to consume. I&#39;d prolly go 3.75 on this one but that might change when I smoke it from soil grown flowers. It&#39;s a good one if nothing better is around or if you love celery :P

VI am not normally a fan of sativa, but this strand is so bonkers that I just had to post how much I loved it! When I say &quot;bonkers,&quot; I mean energetic, talkative, and pretty much off-my-rocker energy. I cleaned my whole house\u2026AND DID THE DISHES!

VSticky buds, the inner stems were like wood and had to be removed as I broke up the flowers.  Tasted like berries and honey. \u000aIt was &quot;up&quot;, talkative, happy, fun. Not the best for pain, but it took a bit of the edge off and gave me a lift after work for more than an hour an a half. In a fog as I came down. I will be vaping an indica soon for relief, though.

VVery nice daytime sativa strain. Light color green with blue tint, fully covered in trichome&#39;s. Appealing smell, Fuel, sweet, Very kind. Helps nausea caused by digestive problems and hand pain from carpel tunnel becomes a little more bearable. Scored my sample from MMJ total health care online and am a very happy customer/patient. Will be trying this strain again and will source seeds so I can grow this and have it full time. Would love to try shatter/rosin/bubble hash from the blue satellite. Would be some perfect medicine to reach for in the morning. Give it a try if you have digestive issues/nausea and carpel tunnel syndrome.

VThis sativa is unlike most for me.. Almost feels like an indica in ways that help manage pain and promote relaxation. I get awful migraines and sativa strains can be quite big triggers for them. That being said... this quickly became a new favorite for me. I highly recommend this to all needing strong anxiety and stress relief. I battle with migraines, bad anxiety, nausea, vertigo, neck pain, stress and severe mood swings. . That being said, after smoking blue satellite all my troubles and pain have truly melted away\u2764\ufe0f

VBlue Satellite has beautifully dense and compact buds with a purple hue that blends in with its yellowish green colours. I love how easy this strain is to smoke, definitely light on the lungs. A very nice high that is almost psychedellic and the comedown feels like an indica. A great overall strain.

Vjust tried this for the first time last night.  right away the smell from the bag was very pleasant. it smoked well in a traditional joint however it needed to be put down occasionally as the conversation began to flare. the strain came from a very reputable grower and is one of the nicest looking strains of sativa I&#39;ve yet had access to. looking forward to some snowshoeing or music making with this.

VWell, i can&#39;t promise impartiality with this one, for it is truly one of my all-time favorites. Smoked it a couple of years ago and couldn&#39;t find it again until very recently. Every time i smoke this particular strain i seem to have  so much fun. Off course you can never attribute all of it to the herb you&#39;re smoking, but the uplifting and social -high it provides are a big helping hand for sure! Recommended highly for social anxiety and stress.

V&quot;What the fuck? What the actual fuck?&quot; That&#39;s exactly what I thought when I looked at the $5 gram of Blue Satellite that I bought from a nameless dispensary. In the little \u000a\u000aZiplock bag -- the kind of bag you usually would associate with a dimebag sale, circa 1989 -- were exactly three untrimmed, scraggly, buds, each one a little bigger than my \u000a\u000athumb nail. The label, which looked like it was printed with someone&#39;s 1995 inkjet printer, said the bag contained 1.00 gram of buddage. One gram, my ass. I know a light \u000a\u000abag when I see one and I was looking at one right there. Ok, so I&#39;m only out five bucks and sometimes, good things come in small packages, right? WRONG! My first warning \u000a\u000awas the THC content: 13%. That&#39;s not a good sign that you&#39;re about the smoke some premium bud. The second was when I went to pluck apart one of the nugs and it practically \u000a\u000acrumbled into dust. Ohboy  . . . well, might as well blaze it. Touch the flame to the bowl and instantly half the contents go up in smoke, followed by THROAT HARSH and an \u000a\u000aeye-watering coughing fit. For a strain called Satellite, this one certainly failed to launch. I was high for like 10 minutes, buzzed for maybe another 15 and then \u000a\u000aeverything crashed back down to Earth. Sure, the whole ride only set me back a fiver, but it was like paying for half a hand-job: it left me tantalized, but ultimately \u000a\u000aunsatisfied.
