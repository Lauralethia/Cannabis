VVery nice smoke with a unique smell and taste. Taste of spices and very smooth smoke with NO coughing.   Beautiful big sticky buds from my dl collective.  They do it all the time.  This stuff could put you under the couch unless u r careful.  All my pain is gone now.  Better than 2 Percocets for relieving my nerve pain and tight muscles.  This big bud is for me (u 2 if you can find it)! Hope so if u need pain relief.

VGot some shake of this from my local dispensary. It&#39;s nice and frosty still with small nugs, good indica high yet still uplifting in mind. Good with bongs or joint for a nice clean pull. It&#39;s a little fruitier than other indicas in mouth taste. Great for people looking for a fruitier and lighter hitting indica that still soothes body aches. I would recommend this to people new to indicas looking for effective pain management.\u000a\u000aHave an awesome day!

Vi&#39;ll be honest - i really wasn&#39;t happy with the way this strain worked. not sure if it varies person to person, but for me it was a very cloudy kinda high. i also had to smoke almost double the amount of it to get any considerable effects. it&#39;s a creeper so i felt the onset of the high about 10 minutes in. the high itself reminded me a little bit like how norco feels and thats the last thing i want to feel like. i felt ...loopy, i guess? and not in the good way. anyways, im not gonna purchase it again but i would be down to trying it again sometime.

VI really like this. It hits me slowly but it calms me down, helps me relax and makes me feel pretty happy. It also makes me weirdly creative but I like it lol. The high usually lasts me for 3-4 hours when I smoke a little bit, but when I smoke a lot it takes me straight to sleep... the kind that an insomniac really misses

Although my mouth did get dry just as fast it was the least of my worries because the high was so pungent my mind just drifted off. I can still interact with people and play video game as well.

VI think I smoked Diablo but SkyHigh had a strain called Diabla which I found to be my strain. It&#39;s everything what weed should be. Brings you peace of mind, relaxes you, uplifts you, then right towards the end brings you down to a nice relaxing body high. I smoked this with my boyfriend and this strain spoke to us. Things became clear. We started out giggling and watching funny youtube videos together and then ended up lying on the floor looking up at the lazer lights reflecting off the ceiling, played some videos games and had no trouble going to bed. Slept like a baby and woke up refreshed. :-) Good weed.

VI cant think of any other bud Ive ever smoked that gets me more of a body high and good overall fade but especially the great feeling that it provides. Some diablo strains are weak but very few! most are strong! Always a good choice.  My favorite and im damn picky! Smells strong and there are virtually no leaves on the nugs just a few random ones for flavor but very very few. Its like all buds! Thats how you can tell a solid heavy high from a weak high you get from loose leafy buds. Anyway, DIABLO!!! TRY IT!!!

VLifted me right from feeling pretty down to outright happy and eager to socialize. Headspace and hallucinogenic vision and sound are especially unique. Upbeat, cheery disposition makes it fun tripping out to entertaining degrees of dissociation. Visuals are most evident in the periphery like shrooms. Looking around feels like looking at scenes in a movie - but with a hallucinatory bent. Extremely easy to socialize to point of attempting comedy. It just comes easier. Music is fascinating to take in. It\u2019s not overwhelming, but does sound really good. To be honest, I do find myself wishing it did more, but it shouldn\u2019t be faulted too much; 70% for music. Similar with watching things, there\u2019s such a distinct mood adjustment that doesn\u2019t really go that deep. It\u2019s a light, fun, not-serious mood. Overall, great demeanor, perfect party strain (socializing and good music), plus something that\u2019ll pull you out of a bad day without sativa\u2019s typical raciness. 8/10

V(Diablo OG) The high ressembles the high of the girl scout cookies. This high gets me so aroused it&#39;s really crazy. I would almost smoke this above anything else. The high is a great mix of a body high and a head high, your head feels like its in cotton and you feel like you have fire on your skin, but not hot. Really it&#39;s strange and very satisfying.

After some intense workouts outs that leave my body bruised and battered, this takes away all the pain and allows me to move again without aches and joint pain.  Just an incredible strain.

Definitely best for Pain, Spams, Insomnia &amp; Nausea, wish I had like an infinite supply because it&#39;s so good. If your lucky enough to get this top shelf do it immediately, I guarantee you will not be displeased! Stay green all, enjoy this one!

VHas the typical OG smell that I assume most indica lovers would die for. I open the container and the people in the room always comment on it from a distance. I normally smoke 4-5 bowls or 2 joints to myself on one session but I&#39;ve only needed 2 bowls of this to medicate properly. The sensation goes from the back of my head down to the rest of the body. I normally boast a high tolerance but tread carefully with this strain.

VNot recommending if you have an unbalanced emotions or Bipolar disorder.  This brought out the emo and angry side of my friend, but Diablo treated me nicely lol.  Helped with inflammation, my back wasn&#39;t on fire like usual.  I was a bit slower than usual, like my responses or talking.  I ended up being a little dizzy, but I was relaxed enough to stay in one spot until the dizziness faded.  My friend said they felt like a gargoyle statue from the cartoon, Hunchback of Notre dame. Hilarious.  They wouldn&#39;t move for like 3 mins at a time.  Heavy pine, mildly sweet berries, and a little woodsy when vaped.  For my roll I used Grape Juicy Jay paper, I couldn&#39;t taste the pine, but I could taste like a peppery flavor as well as more earthy notes, and leather.  Yep.  Leather.   This might be great for ADD/ADHD folk, planted me in one spot for a while, slowed things down so I could think.  Helped with mental stress, relaxing, and my legs were tingly - I got super high and my friend was just pissy.  Great to try at least once, but again, if you&#39;re naturally emotionally unstable or you have Bipolar, I don&#39;t recommend.  Seems to be a hit and miss with some people, but it hit me, hit me real good!

VDiablo [OG] is a true indica in many ways but with a stronger, more intense head high than many indicas. It won&#39;t put you to sleep quickly like many indicas but it will eventually and couchlock is a definite possibility if you take a high dose. This is also a great pain management strain. Cures my hip inflammation pain instantly while many strains only help a little bit. The only downside (for me) is that it causes ridiculously extreme munchies but that can be wonderful for anyone needing an appetite stimulant.

VHas the typical OG smell that I assume most indica lovers would die for. I open the container and the people in the room always comment on it from a distance. I normally smoke 4-5 bowls or 2 joints to myself on one session but I&#39;ve only needed 2 bowls of this to medicate properly. The sensation goes from the back of my head down to the rest of the body. I normally boast a high tolerance but tread carefully with this strain.

VMisleading that Diablo OG Is labeled as an indica. Smell is reminiscent of many Haze strains and the high definitely gives way to some Frontal Lobe action without much sedation.

VI wasn&#39;t expecting to get this strain when I originally went to purchase from a new delivery service in my area; however, I am super impressed with this. Cost was well worth the fourth I bought of it. I love smoking it before work, it makes the beginning of my day go a lot smoother and faster. It does give me slight shaking and definitely a cotton mouth; but overall those effects do not outweigh the positives. If I smoke even just one bowl of this to myself I am set for the morning, any more than one bowl though and it can get me too high though.

VTight smallish buds, lotsa dark red in there, modest but gorgeous aroma of earth and alfalfa and spice. Cut into thin slices while fresh with scissors turned out to a make a nice, long and  a clean burning doobie. Like forever. Mild and spicy burning flavour, easy on the chest. Reminds me just a little of a wonderful Honduran cigar aroma I recall from way back when. Was worried the medium-ish THC would disappoint, but this strain has an interesting character all its own and is quite enjoyable. Mellow and reasonably clear headed, relaxed. Great for doing odd jobs and crafts (safe things...), surfing fun sites, working on something that would otherwise be boring, or watching a decent movie with hot popcorn and a cold drink. Recommended for after work/evening, and rainy days with nothing fun to do. You&#39;ll think of something.

Personally i find that this strain is fairly smooth when smoked and has an interestingly unique taste that is sweet, earthy and a bit spicy. This weed is perfect to smoke when you are planing on relaxing or watching a movie. Going on walks in the woods also goes really well with this strain of weed. A must try.

VI use Indica to help me relax and sleep at night. This strain didn&#39;t help much on with the sleep, but provided a nice relaxing body high that kept me calm and well relaxed.  My first bowl gave me a headache, but no issues after that.  Not a bad smoke, but not a favorite.

VOne of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked. Buds are super sticky but not wet. Grinds to perfection and aroma is overtaking. Ridiculously dank and covered in crystalline trichomes. Tastes like sweet herb with a pungent and dingy compliment. Taste is 10/10. High is 10/10. Smell is 10/10. Very potent Indica and is a for sure one or two hitter-quitter. :) Superb herb strain with pokey piney dense buds that will stick to your fingers. Overall 5/5, give this strain a try!

Your eyes will struggle to stay open at all.  I suggest you keep water and candy nearby because your mouth will get very very dry.  More than any strain I have ever smoked.  Took this for pain and anxiety, and wow!!  No need for any pharmaceutical supplementation with this - profoundly effective!\u000aAlso, this is a very dry high.  Water, candy, gum....put them on your list.  Very dry mouth.

While this plant was very susceptible to PM unlik my Bay Dream plants, it has been a strong grow.  Only a month in veg and it looks like a 7 week flower.  Bud is very pungent and should be a great smoke.  Let me know if any growers out there need some help.\u000a\u000awill review again when consumed

VI wasn&#39;t expecting to get this strain when I originally went to purchase from a new delivery service in my area; however, I am super impressed with this. Cost was well worth the fourth I bought of it. I love smoking it before work, it makes the beginning of my day go a lot smoother and faster. It does give me slight shaking and definitely a cotton mouth; but overall those effects do not outweigh the positives. If I smoke even just one bowl of this to myself I am set for the morning, any more than one bowl though and it can get me too high though.

VTight smallish buds, lotsa dark red in there, modest but gorgeous aroma of earth and alfalfa and spice. Cut into thin slices while fresh with scissors turned out to a make a nice, long and  a clean burning doobie. Like forever. Mild and spicy burning flavour, easy on the chest. Reminds me just a little of a wonderful Honduran cigar aroma I recall from way back when. Was worried the medium-ish THC would disappoint, but this strain has an interesting character all its own and is quite enjoyable. Mellow and reasonably clear headed, relaxed. Great for doing odd jobs and crafts (safe things...), surfing fun sites, working on something that would otherwise be boring, or watching a decent movie with hot popcorn and a cold drink. Recommended for after work/evening, and rainy days with nothing fun to do. You&#39;ll think of something.

VThe nugs were dark green and dense with a pungent, skunky-spicy/herbal scent. Really liked. Smokes a bit harsh, but no problems otherwise. The body buzz is a bit heavy, but this has a strong, uplifting head high. Crept up on me.. A++++!!

VThis is a really good strain. It tastes a little bit hashy but also sweet. I grew my own because I can&#39;t get it from the medical dispensaries in CO. I ordered 10 strains from Cannabis and Seeds, and this was one of them. I&#39;m not disappointed at all. The yield is pretty good. It&#39;s a little bit finicky to grow and doesn&#39;t like the cold at all, but if you&#39;ve grown before it&#39;ll be no problem.

Vmost noticeable effects are calming nerves. provides an effect similar to a sativa, can definitely taste the sativa in its lineage. 20% THC , 1% CBD, over all not bad but nothing impressive. flavonoid profile is where it lacks in my books.

VI have been trying this Strain for about a couple of weeks now and here is what I have to say about it. \u000a\u000aFirst I have grinders my Marijuana up and ready to try out a new strain. I have gotten my bong with cold water inside the water chamber. And I have lit up the Marijuana and inhale a smooth spicy sweeten flavor. I have cough a but due to the spicy aroma. After a couple of weeks I like to use it during  the day to get the focused and relaxed and dizziness effect. After quite a while I cannot say say this is my favorite strain but it is quite a good one I say.

VIncredibly smooth smoke. I love the spicy after taste right at the end. it&#39;s perfect, not too little and not too much. it has a very tropical smell when it is burning, almost like a citrus orange/pineapple.  Hit me super fast. my typing speed right now is slowing down as it seems. Overall, its dank AF. I can see where this strain gets its name. There&#39;s no playing around with Diablo. Complete body high, but no munchies.
