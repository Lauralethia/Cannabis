VI&#39;m big on this strain. I&#39;ve only had the flower and it does the trick. You&#39;ll have a nice light high while being able to perform daily tasks. This was my &quot;before work&quot; fix. Definitely worth trying. I love the taste as well as it&#39;s rather unique.

VI like the high from this bud,the taste is okay but not great.The feeling is energetic,yet relaxed at the same time.The taste is citrus,flowers,and earthy tea leafs,with a slight sweetness.Overall a pretty good strain,but not mind blowing in my opinion.

VThis is one of my top 5 favorites. I usually only stay in my &quot;peak&quot; high for about 15-20 minutes. With this strain I feel it for at least an hour. Giggly, happy, creative. Love this for nighttime unwinding.

VI\u2019d give this 4.5 Stars.  I picked this up at The Giving Tree in Mesa, AZ.  Top shelf at 24% thc.  This a great daytime strain or a good strain to do when you get home from work.   Very relaxing yet energetic strain.  This strain is deffinetly a stress reliever, very uplifting.  I mostly love Blue Dream and the strains that Blue Dream makes.  If you like Blue Dream you will love white dream,  it\u2019s more sativa-like than Blue Dream.

VI loved this strain. Definitely a sativa dominant response for me. I&#39;ve been following it up with Blackberry kush for a more body type buzz. Pain and PTSD beneficial for me.

VTried this strain in shatter and ohhh man! It\u2019s a great balanced, mellow high. Obviously definitely stronger than the flower! Only stating that because I\u2019ve tried the flower and it wasn\u2019t so hot. This strain in shatter is the way to go if wanting to try this specific strain.

Vleaning towards the sativa side. the batch I picked up from the wonderful people at greenhouse of flagstaff was chunky bright green with and abundance of trichomes and orange hair. smell and taste showcased the blue  dream in this strain in the best of ways. high was long lasted with great mind effects spacey yet energized. 10/10 would pick up again

VI highly recommend Cloud 9 across town if you haven&#39;t been yet. Bought a nice nickel of some there -- incorrectably being sold as &#39;White Water&#39; -- but is in fact actually &#39;White Dream&#39; = white widow X blue dream. And baby...it&#39;s mmmhmm omg&#39;sh enjoyable. Can be intense, but not hard to master. It&#39;s definitely fast. Definitely a sativa dominant hybrid. Peak usually around an hour.\u000a\u000aBooya
