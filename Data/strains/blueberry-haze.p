VThe distinctive Blueberry flavor mixes with the spicy Haze influence to form something akin to a mixed berry kind bud slushy. Very smooooooth smoke. It&#39;s high was a really good mix of both indica and sativa, good head high and a solid body stone as the night progressed. You could say it was the type of weed that would make going to the Post Office a slightly less torturous experience. The one real downside in my opinion was that my mouth turned into the Sahara shortly after smoking. DRY! So grab a favorite beverage shortly before light up or you&#39;ll regret it.

VBlueberry Haze prefers some pampering, but when given proper love and attention, she delivers a high that will turn heads.\u000a\u000aHazes have increased in popularity over the last few years, especially in breeding programs. They are aspecially suitable for crossing. The pure Haze, an equatorial, offers and exciting taste and high, but can be too much toruble for the average home grower. Hazes are long season plants that grow very talland lanky, demanding space and patience without the high yields that the other plants provide under similar conditions. Once crossed with shorter season plants, the Haze&#39;s flowering time and size may both be brought back into a range that is reasonable for the average gardener. Blueberry Haze crosses a secret haze with the signature DJ Short Blueberry, a more compact plant with purple-blue foliage, a berry-flavor to the smoke, and a popular high. The result 9-10 week flowering period. This hybrid likes to branch and darkens to a forest green late in flowering. The buds are nice-formed tight nuggets.\u000a\u000aStill, Blueberry Haze is a plant for people who like to garden, not for home or commercial growers seeking an easy crop. She can be persnickety and will show her displeasure if the garden is not kept clean and well regulated within favorable light and temperature conditions. But smoke connoisseurs are likely to find Blueberry Haze worth the effort. This hybrid inherits the taste that goes with the name: a succulent berry flavor with a bit of the fresh herbal hue of the Haze. The true reward is quality of the high, which builds from a mild feeling of wellness to euphoria, inspiration, and perma-grin. The potency and gradual onset require some experience and pacing; overuse may turn an enjoyable buzz into sweet dreams as overwhelming drowsiness kick in.\u000ahttp://www.kindgreenbuds.com/marijuana-strains/blueberryhaze.html

VI was smoking this the other night and my grandmother commented on the Blueberry smell (she had no idea what she was smelling). I told her to take hit, and tell me how the high was. She was relaxed, happy, tingly, and had no body aches bothering her. She&#39;s found this strain and she&#39;s going to remember it.

VFrom the Blueberry Haze that I have smoked I can say that it was an enjoyable high, but not my favorite by far. It has a very strong and great scent, and of course its blueish color. \u000a\u000aI would say that it&#39;s a strain to be smoked to just have a good time and chill out and jam to some tunes or watch a good movie.

VOk, so this is the 2nd getting this strain. Loved it the 1st time around and same with this batch. It&#39;s tested at 28% THC and you can definitely feel it. I notice a heavy tingling sensation that goes over my whole body after roasting a good bowl or two. It&#39;s a trip its like water under my skin, goosebumpy feel throughout my whole body. Feel very mellow and relaxed. Idk if that sensation is from the strain or the combination of me having a cold while smoking (even tho I have no chill, no pun intended) or maybe pesticides in my herbs? Either way it feels amazing and better than when I tried Molly.

VA very good strain, has a deep blueberry/earthy aroma. Quite strong, two hits from a HVY had me on my butt. A quick sharp lift off with a falling-leaf come down, with a nice buzz that lasts for a few hours after you&#39;re sober. Be careful with this one, one toke over the line will most likely knock you out. One of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked in a long time. Next up, vaporizing it!

VI expected big things from this stuff. I&#39;ve had various hazes before, and the original blueberry and loved it all, so figured what could be better than a Blueberry X Haze hybrid. Well.. this batch is good, but nothing i&#39;d write home about. After a few hits you get that patented haze-y head high, along with the slow moving body effects. Then the blueberry kicks in and you become unable to concentrate on anything for too long, and feel all nice and fuzzy. Good stuff, just not the strongest i&#39;ve had.

VI&#39;ve always been really keen to blueberry weeds. So when I saw this, I had to snag some. It came on quite slowly, and I smoked a second bowl because even after a good half hour I felt little effect (I have a high tolerancy), and boy did it creep up on me after that. It was a pretty mellow high...I wanted to just sit down and play some xbox, but it did however make me super duper happy. Not a worry in the world. Very euphoric as well. Great taste. Wore off pretty quickly for me. Not my favorite blueberry strain, but its definitely worth picking up if you can find a good crop. Happy smoking!

VSold as shatter (but more like rosin). Wasn&#39;t expecting much at $30/gm., so I wasn&#39;t let down when 1 hit was very mild. 15 minutes later I became very spatially aware of sound and noticed that it had crept up on me. A bit sleepy on the comedown. 2 tokes every 1.5 hours kept me pain free and social on the holiday, which was exactly what was required. This stuff is mild but pleasant, tastes very blueberry, and 2-4 hit doses does the trick nicely.

Newbies beware! \u000a\u000aTaste is sweet and earthy with a smooth draw that won&#39;t make you cough your chest apart. The high is a mix of cerebral and tingly effects, with some potential for synaesthesia if you&#39;re the type to smoke with music playing. \u000a\u000a11/10!! A new favorite.

Uplifting mood, calming, energizing and keeps your mind sharp and ready to get things done. Does not increase your appetite nor make you sedated. My favourite strain so far!

VAwesome and powerful strain. THC at 28% for the version I got. Grown with love, these buds were perfectly grown cured and manicured.. as mentioned in other reviews this hybrid strain seems to start off with a more sativa buzz and then slip into an Indica coma! also I would reiterate the warning that a few have given to not overdo it unless you were trying to hibernate for a while. Smoke a little bit then wait about 10 or 15 minutes to see where you were at before smoking more. Awesome taste although this version I have taste more citrusy to me than it does blueberry ish. definitely something for the top 10 connoisseur stock. Barry a mason jar full of it now and enjoy and 4 years!

VAye, I picked this up in concentrate form. The CO2 company cartridge. Threw it on my vape pin. Now, I&#39;m a indica freak I don&#39;t really fuck with hybrids or sativa. I actually got this for my wifeet but I took a couple drags from it and liked the effects. I only took two small drags that&#39;s all it took for me is was feeling good as hell. This is not really a strain you wanna of over do it on, it will funk you up.I think the reads on this was 58% THC  2% CBD the taste was almost chocolate like and earthy the exhale smell was very dank. Not a bad strain into would grab it again if there wasn&#39;t anything else that caught my eye.

VLOVE! I absolutely love Haze anything and I love the Blueberry strain. They have some of the best qualities and traits and effects and together the make one of my favorites. Blueberry Haze is very potent and the way the high effects me is more intense then what almost all other strains have on me. It&#39;s just the make up of the strain. She was dense and light colored with almost a bluish looking hue to the nugs. Light fat hairs that hugged tight to the bud. She smoked really smooth and very flavorful and I was blowing out thick clouds of milky smoke. The smell in the air was dank sweet and just loud. Not pungent... Just sweet and very very noticeable?  ahaha Man I love this bud.

VI recently got some Blueberry Haze that I was told was Blue Dream. It tastes different because blue dream is blueberry x super silver haze. It&#39;s more sedating the blue dream, but has similar effects and tastes better. I wouldn&#39;t buy it again though

VPleasant, energetic high! Almost immediately has you feeling good and makes you want to move around. Good for a little boost when you&#39;re feeling down or about to spend a night out with friends. You can definitely stay in control and alert and can stay focused on simple tasks. Doesn&#39;t really have a &quot;stoned&quot; or couchlocked effect for me whatsoever, but it&#39;s a simple, pleasant, energetic experience!

VIt is a very potent strain. However it has good euphoric, happy, tingly effect, if you over do it you will have a really bad experience. It is deffinetly one of those strains that you DO NOT want to overdoo. I felt like time has stopped seconds were minutes, I felt dizzy, paranoid, my heart was racing and I actually thought I am going to pass out.\u000a\u000aSince then I smoke it with great care and I always have a great time with it. I&#39;d recommend it smoking with some friends and just have a laugh or two. It also has a great taste and it smells so sweet and fruity, best smelling strain I ever smoked. Very social strain that lasts for up to 2 hours after a smoke.\u000a\u000aWould recommend it but again DO NOT underestimate it.

Overal loved it taste was bad smell was great, smoke was different and disguised by it&#39;s blueberry scent, good for smoking in public. Good for that afternoon toke or energizing spliff before a late night call of duty game. But yea definitely worth buying an quarter because it&#39;s a very fun smoke

VLow priced, low grade, but does the trick. very positive affects in the line of happiness and chillness. the biggest negative affect in my opinion would be the paranoia, one of the worst experience I&#39;ve had for paranoia but can easily be overcome if your in a calming environment.. if in bad environment for that matter. I wouldn&#39;t recommend.. great for watching Television and gaming but wouldn&#39;t suggest for work or anything public and anxiety causing

VBlueberry Haze is one of my favorite strains to date. The first thing that I noticed about it was just how frosty looking the buds are;Beautiful! There&#39;s a nice citrus smell that&#39;s slightly earthy too. The smoke wasn&#39;t too harsh and tasted on the citrus side also.If  you really pay attention at the back of the inhale, you&#39;ll taste that unmistakable blueberry just at the back of your tongue right before you exhale. This strain was quick to hit me but actually kept me going without any paranoia or lethargy. There were a few times though when I just wanted to veg out, relax and laugh at...well, anything really. Maybe I went a bit overboard, oops: ) great daytime smoke and really just a beautiful strain all around.

VBlueberry Haze cannabis strain is a hybrid combination of the two popular strains: Blueberry and Haze. It merges well known pain relief effects of Blueberry with psychedelic, stress relief effects of Haze. Blueberry Haze marijuana strain is good for daytime use as it will put a smile on your face, boost your energy level and relax your body. Blueberry Haze marijuana strain induces relaxing body high along with uplifted cerebral euphoria. Prompts giggles and social interactions. Uplifts mood, alleviates depression, relieves stress. Relaxes the body, has mild analgesic properties. I give this strain a 4.5 out of 5.

I have severe depression and anxiety, and it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s been wiped away. Music is AMAZING on this strain! I highly recommend putting on upbeat songs, because this strain will make you want to dance to it in the most carefree manner. It feels like I&#39;m enveloped in a warm, tingly hug. This is also amazing for pain. I highly recommend this strain.

VI would sample this regularly at the local-skewing Smoke Palace in East Amsterdam (southeast corner of Oosterpark) and it got me through many days of cycling and writing in that city. A kind, gentle friend, Blueberry Haze acts like a kitten nestled in your mind, safely buoying your more creative impulses into fruition, without clawing at your hand later.\u000a\u000aAll in all, a solid &quot;every day&quot; smoke. This little gem can sustain a full day of smoking without any of the lag you get from more powerful strains.

VI had this strain last year, and it was insane. I had a bit too much, though. I was painting a picture, and I started focusing on painting this raven like my life depended on it. i spent an ungodly amount of time doing this. When the high was gone, I discovered that I couldnt have painted an uglier bird. This is a very creative and pleasant high though you feel like youre on another planet.

A perfect strain for listening to music and imagining crazy visuals as if they were actually real.

VEXCELLENT taste. Very light blueberry with a touch of earthiness on the inhale, gets much heavier blueberry on the exhale. Loved that part off this strain. That being said, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just a weird coincidence or my particular body and type of pain or what, but I got little to no pain relief from it. Decent high, pretty euphoric, very mild munchies, great smoke for an out n about day time flower, if you&#39;re able to resist taking more than a puff or 3....more than that, I almost immediately felt the euphoria begin to fade, and an EXTREMELY intense headache set in. I did smoke quite a bit more than I regularly would, mainly attempting  to find this elusive &quot;pain relief&quot; everyone talks about with this strain. I never found it. I&#39;d say try it out for yourself to see if it works for your specific pain type, just because, even if it doesn&#39;t, it tastes excellent! Another positive, I slept like a dead person every single time I smoked during later hours, which was pretty nice, given I generally only sleep for an hour or 2 at the most because of my pain.

VOne of my most absolute favorites in oil form. I have been using this strain for weeks and have found many physical and mental benefits. Within the first hit you feel a sweet fruity taste kiss your tongue. A euphoric feeling immediately runs through my body and within minutes I drift into a hazy high that is very productive and focused yet relaxing and can be great for about any occasion. Whether it\u2019s a productive day full of errands and focus or a lazy day to watch movies and listen to music, I\u2019ve always found this to be my go to and have had very positive enlightenments in all aspects. Little hits had went a long way but for high tolerance users beware of the strength as over consumption can cause minor headaches but within time balance out to medicate your body.

Not fuzzy at all, dry to the point of just crumbling to nothing in the packaging, had a very strong grass smell. So many stems and sticks that it hardly left anything to actually smoke.

My thoughts got very loud and I was giggling and cheerful. I got very good sensory effects, enjoyed some new music and savored some delicious food. There were some munchies. The next day, I finished off the oven on medium after about six hits. Effects were similar.
