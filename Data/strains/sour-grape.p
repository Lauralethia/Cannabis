VGreat stuff! Smoked some of this with my buddy and the taste is phenomenal IMO. Had a nice sour earthy/grape taste on the inhale and you could taste the diesel on the way out. Very nice! \u000a\u000aEffects: My buddy took one hit out of the bong (he doesn&#39;t smoke much) but hit him good apparently. He was sitting down trying to text but he gave up after about 4 tries;) For me, it was very relaxing but could stay productive though if I wanted to. Really chilled me out and when I stretched my legs out I&#39;d get this nice warm feeling. Highly recommend&#128077;

VWhen people ask me at the shop, what strain do I have thats smooth and tastes delicious? I show them Sour Grape! It is one of my faves and even after trying a few other ones here and there I always go back to this one. Super frosty trichomy. The high is perfect 5050 hybrid great for a mellow night or a hike in the forest. The high is mellow not too couch locked but not too heady. I love this strain perfectly balanced for me and doesnt trigger any anxiety just keeps me mellow and happy!

VPurchased in Bend, Oregon from a friend who is a caregiver/grower. I had previously never heard of Sour Grape, but this stuff is absolutely exquisite. The buds are stunningly beautiful, lots of purple throughout and almost completely white from all the trichomes (I have never seen buds quite this crystal-covered). This particular crop came in at a whopping 27% THC.\u000a\u000aIt does indeed smell and taste like sour grapes, mixed with that famous Sour Diesel fuel aroma. The effects lean more towards indica, but are uplifting enough to balance it out and prevent going full couch-lock. Overall, dreamy and extremely relaxing, pain-relieving, calming, and euphoric. This may be one of the most balanced and pleasant strains I&#39;ve ever had, and this will definitely be a staple in my rotation. HIGHLY recommended.\u000a

VIn terms of strains that could help me focus and study, this is the best I&#39;ve found.  Still has some standard spaciness, it is marijuana afterall, but I found it definitely quieted a lot of the standard ADD noise in my head while reading.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d use it for cramming for a test or something, but it makes me happier to pursue my own interests.  For doing errands around the house I&#39;d prefer Blue Diesel.\u000a\u000aThe body high is wonderful and warm once it kicks in.  Definitely sets in pretty heavy.\u000a\u000aMunchies are very light, which means the increased focus kind of drowns it out entirely.  This is a small negative for me as I generally like some munchies.

VSour Grape is a strain I believe to be by Gage Green Genetics. If so, it makes sense, as this strain is some real quality. The sample I had was a little under-grown, yet somehow the trichome coverage was still unbelievable. When I first picked it up, I was smoking it along side some really heady indicas, and it stood out by really relaxing me in a way the other could not. I found myself reminiscing of traveling the country, deep in my own thought, and enjoying every moment of it. Though the high is slightly more introverted, it lends you creativity, insight, and some unbelievable moments of serenity. If you have a chance to pick some up do, you will be very happy you did.

VThis review is on Sour Grape sugar wax by Slaughter Genetics.\u000a\u000aWhat do get when you put together two of the most singularly tasty strains out there?  Sometimes garbage but not with these two, Pure Gold.  The terpene profile is the perfect mix of sweet grape and (of course) sour diesel.  I can say the exact same for it&#39;s balanced effects.  It takes after it&#39;s parent strains in the best ways.  I only wish I had bought more.  10/10

VAmazing! For every smoker! Smooth, welcoming taste and aroma give way to an even smoother smoke. The buds are sticky and fluffy. Beautiful trichome presentation with a hashy and hasty residual return that&#39;s indicative of the favored hash plants. This bud can be enjoyed in moderation by the beginner or by sweet mass by the veterans. This bud smokes well as a joint, bong,  pipe, chillum...you name it. smells great, and the experience only grows from the initial introductions. superb!

VThe small buds appear dark with hints of purple, the sparkle that comes from the bud is exciting to look at. Extremely sweet smell from the baggie, you really can smell grapes. The buds feel dense and slightly hard. The small bud I ground up didn&#39;t fluff out too well, it did smell amazing however. It appeared to be slightly crisp and dry along with a lot of kief falling from it. Always a good sign. \u000a\u000aI rolled up a one pinner and the good vibes came after. I felt very relaxed as my mind wondered off into the great high this strain gives you. I wanted to sit back on the grass and enjoy the views but at the same time I wanted to get on my bike and go for a long cycle. I was super talk-active, normally I feel very anxious when it comes to conversations but this strain took away them anxious feelings and I could not stop rambling. My mouth became super dry and I couldn&#39;t get enough water into me. Have liquids at hand along with some much for this one. \u000a\u000aA new top shelf Hybrid for me. I look forward to smoking more of this. High doses can turn you into a couch potato however, same goes for any strain really. \u000a\u000acouch&gt;

Sit on the high for a few and enjoy the small creep as it runs down your body and straight to the back of your head. Your head starts tingling and the rest of the night is just straight bliss as the relaxation from this flower takes you over. \u000a\u000aThis is a great hybrid strain. The smell is not bad, does have a very fruit sent. The taste is enjoyable, on my palate anyways. I have a heavy grape flavor and I enjoy that with my flower. I would recommend this to folks who need a good body relaxant but yet still have some energy to get some things done. I also felt happier as I enjoyed this flower.

VI&#39;ve tried over 30 strains and this one really does it for me!  I&#39;ve had Sour Diesel and it comes in a close 2nd, but the Sour Grape is definitely my go to strain!  Love it too much!  LOL  I definitely recommend to all those looking for pain and stress relief. If  you find this strain grab it while you can!=0)

VTHE BEST STRAI  IVE TRYED BY FAR, I love it I just simply love it. Is a hybrid 50/50 which keeps you relaxed just extremely relaxed, but not at all lazy, you can go through your day without feeling tired and it makes everything your doing more pleasant. Last for a long time and even for heavy smokers this one right here is Strong . One hit and you can feel the buzz all over your body. I can say you can take on a bad day with this strain and still smile through the whole thing . Sour Grape just makes everything ok. I love this strain. This is also a good antidepressant, you won&#39;t find a euphoria like this one . A strain recommended for beginners and experienced smokers. If you see it try it and make sure is Sour Diesel n GDP

VI&#39;m just now venturing into the world of indica dominant, and fully indica strains and this strain strikes my attention right away. It&#39;s a mix between GDP which everyone knows and has loved it at first taste. This hybrid is just a bit calmer version of GDP mother, only with the sour diesel taste added in. The high is a very chill indica like but with the added comfort of not getting too couch locked too soon. Taste is very nice and smooth smoke to accompany.

VIn the words of the great Homer Simpson: &quot;mmmm...grapes&quot;. Or maybe it was donuts... The point I&#39;m trying to make is the how much Sour Grape tastes and smells like the fruit of which it is named. And as with many Sour Diesel variants the skunky taste linkers in your mouth like a sour patchIn the words of the great Homer Simpson: &quot;mmmm...grapes&quot;. Or maybe it was donuts...The point I&#39;m trying to make is the how much Sour Grape tastes and smells like the fruit of which it is named. Like other Dour variants a delayed skunky aftertaste lingers much like sucking on a giant sour patch kid. The high is cerebral with the usual face numbing that usually comes with Sour Diesel. Great high either for night or day. Medicinally best for depression and stress.

The buds were a little loose in appearance, but completely frosted in white crystals. I can&#39;t remember a strain that offered such a unique flavor.

VSour Grape is a great hybrid combo. Euphoria and anti stress along with a relaxed body. Smelled like diesel and grape as soon as i opened the bag. Bit of a harsh smoke but very potent even for a seasoned smoker. Burned my throat out of my bong on the inhale but the exhale was smooth. Grape aftertaste. Very high
