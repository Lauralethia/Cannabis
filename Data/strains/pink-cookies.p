VPure bliss! All around I love this nug! Smells/looks/taste &amp; buzz all top notch! Pink Cookies will leave you floating in an extremely relaxed and worry-free state. Clears your mind of frantic thought and elevates the body into a tingly buzzing feel, through to the core. \u000aMy favorite part about this strain is it&#39;s lack of negative effects. No paranoia, no anxiety spikes or heat flashes, minimal burnout. I&#39;d say the only downside to this bud is it really takes you for a ride so be prepared. There aren&#39;t many others like it!

VThe PC that I tried is an indica that instantly offered pain relief and relaxation. Eyes very heavy, soothing body high hitting muscles/bones/joints. Love the taste...even the aftertaste that doesn&#39;t seem to end was pleasant. Leafly&#39;s flavor profile and a few previous comments sum it up well. Cheers

VWow, my favorite cookie strain. The smell is sweet and stinky. Like a creamy over growth of eucalyptus with exotic wood and a hint of grapes. I can\u2019t stop enjoying the aroma. Taste is the aroma extremely amplified. Relaxed, euphoric, creative, uplifting. Tight compact buds of various greens from light to dark with purple scattered. Nice amount of bright neon orange hairs. Decent amount of milky trich. Oh, the smell I can\u2019t get enough of.\u000a\u000aI recommend pink cookies for getting normal. I get this strain constantly. Check out NWCS private reserve in WA state. It\u2019s amazing. This strain puts the brakes on me trying other strains now.\u000a\u000aPink cookies, yes.

Vlove this pink cookies!!! its the private reserve by NWCS can&#39;t go wrong with anything by NWCS, but this is in my top India&#39;s I like to keep on hand. Im a serious smoker haha I know what I like, and I know what I want. pink cookies is great for relaxing and unwinding after a long day at work. I don&#39;t get the munchies, but I do have self control and dont wanna get fat. a light daze feeling. my body is kinda numb right now. Im laughing on the inside, but I can&#39;t feel my face!!! so no smile. I&#39;m pretty tired too. this is one of the only strains that make me feel high.. I swear Im immune to most pot. I smoke to much.

VThis is my Favoirte Strain. Period, The End.\u000a\u000aWedding cake is a good other name for this strain because she is best waifu of weed. Northwest Cannabis Solutions knocked it out of the galaxy with this. Every time i run out of weed I buy this. Even when I want to try other strains, I get a gram at least of Pink. \u000a\u000aLong lasting body effects gives this strain a huge longevity of high. You peak early, but then you settle into a nice plateu of hazey mindfulness that you can just couchlock for 4 hours and be chill. And this is coming from an every day smoker for 5 years.\u000a\u000aBest Strain.

VNWCS in WA state. 24% Eighth for 20! It has different shades of green with hints of purple and small orange hairs. Super crystally and dense. Smells weedy/earthy with hint of sweet citrus. Smoke felt heavy in lungs and didn&#39;t take much to get there. Comes on slow and eases you into a relaxed, uplifted state. Heavy in body and mostly a lazy high but doesn&#39;t force you to stay on the couch if you don&#39;t want to.  Will definetly buy again.

VNormally I&#39;m all over these hybrids but something about the Pink Cookie strain has me unsatisfied. 1st, it doesn&#39;t kick your ass. Even for a good quality strain it&#39;s relatively mild I find. 2nd, the 3rd or fourth bowl i hit has been sleepy af. I prefer a more acute stimulation of the mental senses. This one is a brilliant balance but it doesn&#39;t have a sharp central effect. More of a softer, dreamy state. Still an enjoyable smoke but it wont wow you.

VSoo dense and sticky. Top shelf indica dominant with great head effects. One of the few indicas I&#39;ve tried that makes you feel both high and stoned at the same time. Meditative and mentally relaxing with a touch of creativity and introspection mixed with some body melt.. yes please. I think in the future any indica dominant with GSC genetics will be a baseline for fabulous phenotypes and crosses to come

Very potent indica, had me walking around around like a blissed out zombie. Pretty pricey at $55 for an 8th but great as a special occasion smoke. Shout out to Local Roots Bothell, they have the flame!

Dense, dark green &amp; dark purple in color &amp; are covered in bright dark orange pistils with crystal trichomes. Scent &amp; flavor was interesting kind of a sweet &amp; spicy. Effects made me happy &amp; euphoric followed by relaxation without being sleepy unless i over smoked or it was the end of the day. Indica dominate with 18% THC.\u000aPEACE ECAEP
