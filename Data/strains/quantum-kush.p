VI got two fat beautiful 2 gram size nugs each with an awesome sweet smell. This strain really is an awesome sativa wakes u up or keeps you awake. My only issue is how paranoid it makes me and then sends me into a small anxious rollercoaster!! It&#39;s not hazy at all, very cerebral. Regardless if you love hardcore sativas, this is it!!

VA really nice head stash sativa. It really reminds me of a bit of sour Diesel. The smell carries some funky earthy OG tones and some sweet fuely aromas. The taste is smooth with some definite distinct &quot;Kush&quot; flavor, and I got a very noticeable grape flavor on the exhale. The buds themselves were fluffy and sticky. They were bright lime green with flecks of emerald and dark amber calyxes. Very very very frosty. The effects were creepier than one might expect. They really set in after about 15 minutes or so. It&#39;s a well balanced and relaxing buzz for a sativa. Very chill. Awesome for anxiety, depression, and appetite. I enjoyed this strain very much. Can be on the harder side to find.

VThis strain was leaning more on the indica side with it&#39;s pungents gasoline and skunky undertones not to be fully masked by the sweet disel smell. It wasn&#39;t sure a bit sticky to the touch and smelled wounderful and dense. It was a surprize thats for sure, and just because it has Kush or OG in the name dosent nessasarily mean its a straight up indica or straight kush expectations. SFV OG Kush is a good example, the batch I had was very sativa leaning and still had nice rockhard nugs with that OG funk but instead of having a lazy as expected day I was sprung and didn&#39;t sleep as hard but still levels off to a sleepy good buzz.

VMy first time purchasing Quantum Kush made me want to instantly buy more. This stuff is wonderful. The smell of it is quite interesting as well. Exactly what I would describe as &quot;DANK&quot;. The buds smell a little sour, skunky, and earthy, with a hint of herbiness to them. This gives the buds an overall strong and unique smell. Extremely dense, tightly packed buds with nice orange hairs on them. These buds are also covered in trichomes, giving them a nice frosty outer coating. This stuff is simply beautiful to look at, but let&#39;s get onto how it smokes.\u000a\u000aOh does it smoke. The taste of the bud is quite earthy, but still pleasant (lit bowls with hemp wick). A few bowls of Quantum Kush had me on my ass pretty quickly. This weed made me feel extremely euphoric and calm. I was still able to function normally and complete some homework while smoking the stuff. Great for if you&#39;re going out to a party or to the bars and don&#39;t want to spend money on drinks. \u000a\u000aOverall, Quantum Kush gives the consumer everything they&#39;re looking for in quality cannabis. Great looks, smell, taste, and high. The only reason it doesn&#39;t get my 5 star rating is because it didn&#39;t have me losing my mind over how good it is. Still a fantastic strain.

VI&#39;m a light user, maybe go through a gram in a few months, so I have basically no tolerance  \u000a\u000aGot a gram of Quantum Kush and a bubbler with my tax return (god I love legal rec), and took a good hit on my Friday night. \u000a\u000aTasted very mild and pleasant, with hints of blueberry and grape, with an aftertaste not unlike cedar. Effects hit after about 10 min, comes on very slow and mild, you barely register it coming on. \u000a\u000aIt has the typical sativa energy, but there&#39;s no paranoia or anxiety, just a nice mellow energetic feeling, great for having in a small group and shooting the shit. Makes you SUPER talkative and annoying to sober people (just ask my wife). I felt giggily but not obstructively so like with Lavender Jones. \u000a\u000aMunchies hit about 30 min in, but were not kitchen destroying, just helped appreciation of food mainly. \u000a\u000aOn the bad side, I did get a bout of nausea an hour in, and the next day effects leave you very drained. Don&#39;t smoke this if you work the next day. \u000a\u000a5/5, WILL buy again

VQuantum Kush is a potent Indica, it relieves a lot of pain and makes me extremely tired. Personally, I found the vapor created from the oz I had to be rather pungent and harsh on the way down as well as the following cough it produced. As an option it is very good, it isn&#39;t perfect but it will get the job done if you have issues with pain, nausea, sleeping, etc.\u000a\u000aTypical AAA Indica.

VQuantum Kush Review\u000aBy Agro Mechanix\u000aTHCA UNK %\u000aTHC 16.4%\u000aCBD 0.28%\u000aHarvest/Cure:4/10/2016\u000aReview Date 24 May 2016\u000a\u000aThe nuggets are more loose and fluffy than most and look like a collection of small green nug shaped balls that all clump together to make the overall bud. The tiny brown hairs mix with the dark green to give the appearance of an OD green color with lime accents around the base and a yellow peach fuzz that covers it entirely. This is a very pretty flower and under magnification looks like an undersea wonder; Its just a yellow slurry and that is nearly all you see.\u000aIt took me a while to pick out the smell. At first when you open the bag and bury your nose in it you smell a sweet hay odor, but when you break the bud apart and rub the terpene\u2019s around Oh my God! Now that is a beautiful cheesy smell! Not a very strong smell, but a wonderfully pleasing one to the olfactory senses. \u000aIt has a mild flowery taste with a note of spices, a very smooth smoke. Even at such a low THC % I feel very euphoric and free of stress, pain, yet aware of my self, my surroundings, energetic as hell but not anxious, very calm and very, very clear headed. An awesome strain to use for any day activity or task and pretty good for pain. \u000aAnd finally my wife\u2019s finely tuned nose tells me that this strain only makes me smell like campfire smoke and not pot smoke and her nose has to be right up against me to even pick it up.  so this could make it a strain you can use in public without having the \u201cPot Head Alarm\u201d go off in the head of everyone around you. \u000aI hope that this review has been helpful and made your cannabis experience more enjoyable. And remember, set the oven to 420 and bake till done\u2026

VQuantum Kush is a potent Indica, it relieves a lot of pain and makes me extremely tired. Personally, I found the vapor created from the oz I had to be rather pungent and harsh on the way down as well as the following cough it produced. As an option it is very good, it isn&#39;t perfect but it will get the job done if you have issues with pain, nausea, sleeping, etc.\u000a\u000aTypical AAA Indica.

VUsually I like to smoke indica strains, but Quantum Kush is one of my favorite sativa strains so far. It has a very uplifting high that makes me super happy and relaxed yet it isn&#39;t one of those fast paced racy highs. The taste is that of strawberries and another citrusy fruit mixed with the hint of a rich soil. Similar high to Lodi Dodi but it isn&#39;t nearly as giggly for me - just creative. This is a perfect strain for me for walking into the forest and enjoying the simplicity of nature with.

VThey don\u2019t say it\u2019s creative but it hella is. It brings out your true nature. I didn\u2019t feel like food was out of this world, it\u2019s not an indica in the way you become a slave to your body. It\u2019s more like become a slave to your mind. \u000aSmoked this before a party and I had everyone I talked to laughing, it accentuated my wit. \u000aOn point with a great sativa (I had a hybrid version but still with a great energetic buzz. Doesn\u2019t make you sleepy. \u000a\u000aFriends were jamming infront of me and the music sounded good, and they were good, but not earth shattering-more of a mind strain. Needless to say I walked away from the jam sesh to have a conversation.

VAs a full time artist who sits down a lot at a computer, this has helped in not only pain application but my concentration has also improved whenever I get the chance to procure this particular strain for its many, many uses. Of course, this is but one of the thousands of choices so naturally I am sure there has been something better but as far as local strains go, Quantum Kush has been top tier all the way and is a great &#39;head-high&#39; for those seeking a good mental boost without too much of a drag on still being physically active. For someone like me, that is perfect and I hope I get a chance to smoke it again in the future.

VMy batch of Quantum was very potent. The high was fairly clear headed with a pleasant head buzz. I felt it very strongly in my teeth and the sides &amp; back of my head. It tapered off into a sleepy calming body buzz. It had noticable pain relieving effects. I found it to be very helpful for runny noses.

VLove this stuff, have it in a C02 honey oil and a live resin crumble. Both have a sweet inhale and kushy exhale. The live resin also has that fresh plant stank to it that I love. Dabs of both gives a very robust and energizing high, but with a nice vibrating body high. Fulfills all my sativa Kush dreams, similar to kandy Kush but no burn and a bit tastier. Good day smoke.

VPungent and earthy but moderately sweet aroma, and medium smoke harshness. This one starts with a bang. Very hard hitting head buzz and an electric body, almost like being pulled forward in space. I can definitely see where it gets it&#39;s name from. About 30 to 40 minutes in it starts to mellow out into a very focused mind and an energetic body. However, do not smoke this strain before bed, as (in my experience) it always resulted in nausea. Great for video games or music, though. Overall, very recommended from me.

VOverall this strain is pretty mild, in spite of a name like &quot;Quantum&quot;. I found this flower to be pretty enjoyable on a nice quiet morning. The sativa doesn&#39;t hit you overwhelmingly like a Green Crack or a Jack Herer, however this is a nice little perk to get your morning started. Almost like a mild coffee, not over the top, but enough to get your motor in gear. \u000a\u000aThe Citrus and Woody aroma is quite pleasant, mild while not being very pungent, and a smoke that was smooth as silk. \u000a\u000aThe High is very calm and enjoyable with the general feeling of happiness during consumption. However for a sativa, I feel this strain is pretty mild compared to it&#39;s cousins. \u000a\u000aSide Effects include: Sorting through old music files to jam out to
