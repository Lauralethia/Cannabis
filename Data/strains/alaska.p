VAlaska is a high THC strain. It has a nice uplifting high. It helps with my pain relief without having to use a lot of it to obtain the effects.

VFasten and tighten your seat belt for the ride upward after three or four inhalations. The sativa jazz here hits strident notes in high THC octaves. This &#39;arctic&#39; strain is not for the inexperienced, or faint of heart, and for me it generated far to much anxiety, racing mind, internal flutter as a by-product of a near vertical trajectory for 30 minutes, that will spin you out unless you are going to the disco. I am sure for some people, all this buzzy adrenaline chattering of teeth in the bake light of Alaska is right up their alley in preference, or specific medical needs, but for people over 60 this may be just too much of a &#39;good&#39; thing!

VAlaska, first time with this fantastic sativa, very smooth, smell and taste is phenomenal, earthy mint, keeps you afloat on a steady ride. Perfect gram count, fresh and ready for action. I always vape, but with this strain I actually had to go back to the roots with a fatty aswell. Either way, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Love how quickly my parcel arrived, and those lockable containers, brilliant, i&#39;d love if all my LPs used them for my medicine. On the higher price point scale, however with shipping fee included in the gram price, it seems like the price is on point with other LPs. If you order by 1pm, you&#39;ll receive your order next day, beautiful thing. I find this to be one of those strains that helps me with headaches, daily body pains/fatigue. Alaska is definitely worth it, looking forward to trying out a few other strains from MedReleaf.

VFor a strain with roughly 10% THC, it\u2019s a bit deceptive about its potency. A very active high, I enjoy the energy I feel under it\u2019s spell. A great aroma, earthy and not overwhelming, Alaska is a great name for this strain. Quality is great, though it dries out quickly.

VGot mine through Med Releaf.  Plenty of aroma when I opened it, the flavour (when vaped) was a bit sweet, a bit minty, with a good dose of earthiness.  The effects started to kick in pretty quickly, starting off in the stomach, before moving up to the forehead, then face, then down to the solar plexus/chest area.  Feeling relaxed but clear headed, a little sleepy but not overwhelmingly so.  A faint ringing in the ears, but nothing crazy.  Very nice.
