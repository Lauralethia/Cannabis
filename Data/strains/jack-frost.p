VI love Jack Frost, nice euphoric feeling. It&#39;s a good strain to smoke if you want to just sit back and relax. Dank ass buds, nice and dense. Love it. Stay high man.

VAwesome\u000aWinter \u000aKush.\u000aI smoked a 3.5 gram blunt to the dome in a sticky sweet swisher cigarillo wrap and to my comprehension this strain had a very piney Forrest taste that I found quite enjoyable with a cup of coffee a overall great strain good one to call in sick and drink coffee on the porch.

VGonna preface this by saying I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my specific plant batch, but here are my experiences: \u000a\u000aSmell: Traditional Sativa spicyness, it smells &quot;fluffy&quot;. I don&#39;t that doesn&#39;t make sense, it is what it is. \u000a\u000aTaste: The taste lingers and is also &quot;fluffy&quot;. Another description for the taste (or smell) would be milky hay. \u000a\u000aEffects: CREEPER. Is stronger than most Sativas but I get absolutely no body relaxation or pain relief from this. Just the old sativa happiness, accelerated thoughts, and some energy I guess, although I really had to placebo in that last effect. I&#39;m under Jack Frost&#39;s wings right now and I can tell you I am still too lazy to get up and go clean. \u000a\u000aPossibly more anxiety/paranoia when consumed in large doses. \u000a\u000aA good sativa, not the 5/5 goddess I&#39;m looking for though.

Vthis is up there in my top 5, has the best smell of any bud ive ever experienced.  The bud came in freezer zips and i was burying my face in those for days after i put the nugs in mason jars.  The high was the most euphoric ive experienced, ive tried to think of another reason to explain this away as a fluke but consistently every time me or anyone i was acquainted with smoked this bud they got euphoria that was comparable with their prior usage of ecstasy but not to the same intensity, just a light warm relaxed sensation in the back of the neck, euphoria, and talkativeness obviously more so than normal if to be worth mentioning.   better than 9 out of 10 of my medical pick ups and it was in a non med state, CO born tho.

VSo I smoked a lil bowl of this and took about 3 hits and was quickly put into a euphoric heady high state. After about 10-15min with head high I then found myself with a full body affect. I then laid down and just couldn&#39;t move. I should also add that I&#39;m a light weight. I usually have some back pain and couldn&#39;t feel any pain. I can say when the body high kicked in I was a lil paranoid, but other than that is was good strain tried. Recommend to higher frequent users !

VOne of those strains that hits you so hard you forget you&#39;re smoking about halfway through. Very strong eye high with a pleasant euphoric sensation. It tastes like you&#39;re smoking a pine tree. Incredibly earthy. Nothing like it. This one is right up there with Sour Diesel in my strain hall of fame. \u000a\u000aIf you like earthy, potent sativas, do not pass this one up! It is hard to find, so I end up having to go searching for this strain.

VA new all time favorite &amp; believe me, as I work in the cannabis industry I&#39;ve tried A LOT of strains. As a pain patient, I was shocked I got immediate relief from my back pain after only 2 hits. It also did this for my husband who usually has to resort to strong edibles for his severe  spinal pain (just had fusion surgery on C4/C5/C6) and lower back (recent fusion of L5/S1). I got a gram of this from Pure Life Alternative in Chatsworth &amp; went back THE NEXT DAY because it was just so good! Make sure if you&#39;re a pain patient that you give this a fair shot, even if you&#39;re not a fan of sativa dominant hybrids. I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.

VThat wide-eyed effect from Jack is noticeable immediately. The high comes on quickly with a pepped up mood and presence in the chest. Disassociation gradually grows deeper and deeper, which is fun to observe from Jack\u2019s familiar crystal clear headspace. It\u2019s definitely energizing, like taking a shot of espresso, but more feels like what I imagine the rush of crack to be like (Wolf of Wall Street). Enjoyable and easy to socialize. Talking comes naturally and is especially funny. Good party strain. Unfortunately, not great for watching stuff. It\u2019s so bewildering, it\u2019s a struggle to keep up with what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a real distance between you and what\u2019s happening. Although, it seems to excel sort of passively. It\u2019s good if you\u2019re a little zoned out and more absently absorbing it. So, nature documentaries or poetic, abstract, surreal content. With music, you can lose yourself and be encompassed by it. It\u2019s sharp and present, though a bit constrained and distant. It&#39;s mostly elevated and compelling. Chest feels light and uplifted, mood is euphoric with an irrepressible smile.

Jack Frost performs well inside. Outside, in the cold, makes Jack Frost weak. Smoke about 3-4 with a friend. You&#39;ll feel good maaaaan. You&#39;ll feel like your in space with Ash and pika chu but were all stuck in the 1980s type shit. I can&#39;t explain. I&#39;m very pressed right now.            I&#39;m very    pressed.

VBest tasting buds ever. The whole feeling one gets when just smelling it is in itself soothing. For me, this is one of those strains that just works so perfectly, it was versatile and applicable to any situation. If I needed it to help me relax, best relaxation ever; if I was needing energy, it was there to pack an uplifting punch that never gets in the way.\u000a\u000aI am still learning about what works with my own chemistry, but I am generally after a few main things: I have chronic fatigue and depression, restless legs, anxiety, pain, etc. I look for strains that lift me up while not making me feel anxious or beside myself. I like to feel grounded in the here and now, while also being able to feel comfortable in my own skin. This does the trick.\u000aOther strains that work for me in similar way; NYC diesel, white sage, green crack. But Jack Frost by far is the best tasting.

I can never put a taste with, though the taste is quite lovely, this is because whenever I smoke it hits me instantly and I just start to feel really good. Jack Frost is great whether you want to veg out or get up and do something. Doesn&#39;t give me crazy munchies, no cotton mouth, does give me the typical stoner face, though. Lovely strain.

VJack Frost leans more to the heavy weight class of hybrids. Cultivated from Northern Lights #5 and White Widow, Jack Frost&#39;s potent effects will leave you relaxed and happy. A sativa dominant hybrid version of this strain can also be found with a mix of Northern Lights #5, White Widow, and Jack Herer. Jack Frost has a mixture of different textures when smoked. On some occasions the strain can have a lemon flavor that lingers in your mouth, however, people have also reported the strain having an earthy taste as well. Jack Frosts highlight quality is it&#39;s delightful taste when toked. Jack Frost has a strong freshness when hit and hits very smoothly. The after taste is very pleasant, almost turning into a creamy texture for several moments. Jack Frost is great for stress and also for those who do not sleep well. However, Jack Frost can come off a little lethal if smoked too much. It&#39;s potent effects can quickly become overwhelming if smoked too quick in large amounts making it quite uncomfortable especially to beginning users. Jack Frost as a whole is a very nice hybrid developed over years of breeding and is a must buy for those looking to relax after a stressful day.

VMan, this is a warm clear sativa. Makes places more interesting, hardly has a body high. Good dreamy effect on the eyes. Energetic but not harsh. Had me grinning a lot with my friend and being silly but otherwise for me its a very controllable and concealable high. Its a \u201cI tagged along for subway wile high and am now writing my first review while high, in subway\u201d kinda strain. :)

STRONGLY RECOMMEND for those who are struggling with depression and social anxiety or even ADD/ADHD.  Allows for focus without getting that depressed mood if something doesn&#39;t go your way.

VThis came in at just over 20% THC, but it hit like a much stronger strain from my bubbler pipe. My dispensary categorized it as a sativa-dominant, and I&#39;d agree -- I was clear headed, happy and uplifted -- but the indica from Northern Lights came through strongly as well, with a relaxing, slightly tingly body high all over. The high was strong for three hours, but it took six or seven to fully wear off.\u000a\u000aThe second time I smoked it (in a joint) the experience was much less pleasant. I quickly became disoriented, slightly nauseous and anxious. After about 20 minutes though, the anxiety and nausea passed, leaving me with a strong, concentrated head high and and less pronounced body high. \u000a\u000aGood strain, but I&#39;d recommend starting slow.

VI can honestly say that this particular hybrid is one of the classiest I&#39;ve smoked. The smoke notes are a bit piny and have a very distinct flavor. The taste is actually very reminiscent of Northern Lights (big surprise there, haha!) The smell is quite bold, but not overbearing. It&#39;s piny, a bit sweet, a bit fruity, and light on the nose. The high hits fast and hard. It won&#39;t have you on your ass, not at first at least, and instead brings joy, upliftedness, positivity, and gratefulness in a very heady high before mellowing out into a more relaxed body high consistent with indica strains. Overall, a great strain for anyone looking for some quick uplifting.

VThis is the second time in two years that I&#39;ve had this strain from our crops and it has improved a star rating. I loved it then and more this time around because of the intensity of the high lasts longer. The high gives me more energy and relieves my pain completely from my injury. Every morning I wake up I take my morphine and Roxicodone. Then I take a puff off my one hitter and my pain subsides so I can function without pain. I love the euphoric head high it gives and the body high feels like I just ate a &quot;cookie&quot;. It has a nice woodsy aroma and a sweet taste to boot. Of all the strains I&#39;ve had in my long career of smoking it&#39;s still one of my favorites. I prefer hybrids the most to alleviate pain. I can also concentrate better with them. Crossing strains is the way to go and seems to be most users preference also.

VVery long lasting high. It is like if Jack Herer had a kid with severe ADD and let it out to play with the dog. It doesn&#39;t have the aftertaste of Jack but it does have that finishing taste. The taste while very Jack-like doesn&#39;t have the father&#39;s polish. I picked up a gram of this at the Heights Collective in Rowland Heights for $15. I might even like this better than it&#39;s father. I actually got really horny and got laid immediately right after.

Head high &amp; clear, body relaxed, arthritis pain is gone away. I would not use this before bed, too peppy. This is a standard go-to strain when I want Sativa without surprises.

While I wouldn&#39;t say I experienced couch lock, I certainly didn&#39;t feel like doing much of anything other than closing my eyes and laying down. I could have gotten up, but didn&#39;t want to. Sounds were amplified. I also had a pretty spiritual experience while on this bud. I swear I got a &quot;message&quot; from my deceased father. It had me crying and freaking out a bit, but it felt necessary and healthy somehow. My body high was interesting. I felt heavy in my upper body but light in my lower. My legs feet wanted to keep moving, but my chest and head didn&#39;t. I would definitely smoke again.

VIt didn&#39;t take much of this strain to get me high. About four hits off of a joint and I was good gone. While I wouldn&#39;t say I experienced couch lock, I certainly didn&#39;t feel like doing much of anything other than closing my eyes and laying down. I could have gotten up, but didn&#39;t want to. Sounds were amplified. I also had a pretty spiritual experience while on this bud. I swear I got a &quot;message&quot; from my deceased father. It had me crying and freaking out a bit, but it felt necessary and healthy somehow. My body high was interesting. I felt heavy in my upper body but light in my lower. My legs feet wanted to keep moving, but my chest and head didn&#39;t. I would definitely smoke again.

As far as my high with this bud i got a very happy and uplifted high with a bit of a tingle in the body. Very strong on my debt perception and everything i did felt like it took an hour lol. I love these kind of highs and this bud did it for me , beautiful buds with a fantastic smell. With this high i was able to engage in some fun conversations and munched very hard.

Vthis is up there in my top 5, has the best smell of any bud ive ever experienced.  The bud came in freezer zips and i was burying my face in those for days after i put the nugs in mason jars.  The high was the most euphoric ive experienced, ive tried to think of another reason to explain this away as a fluke but consistently every time me or anyone i was acquainted with smoked this bud they got euphoria that was comparable with their prior usage of ecstasy but not to the same intensity, just a light warm relaxed sensation in the back of the neck, euphoria, and talkativeness obviously more so than normal if to be worth mentioning.   better than 9 out of 10 of my medical pick ups and it was in a non med state, CO born tho.

VI&#39;m not the first person to say this but GREAT FOR SEX. It gives me really vivid super tingly body highs and gives me an almost entirely clear head, so sex and Music feels great. It also gives munchies like none other tho so be sure to have more than one box of cereal handy.

VGave this a 4 star because it made me feel paranoid and manic at times.  Only sometimes, and it wasnt nearly enough for me to *not* enjoy the strain, but it was enough for me to search for another strain other than this one.  What i would do for a strain that makes me feel relaxed and not anxious!

VTook a break from smoking for a week and picked this bad boy up from a friend. Shared a small bowl with my best friend HOOOO BOI we were gonerz by the first two hits. This strain is danky, smells amazing right out of the bag. Even better after after grinding. The first 10 minutes, we were zoning out in perfect contentment with life and the universe, but smacking our lips bc mouth was dry as hell. Then we started babbling, stuttering like idiots but laughing like crazy, making hilarious stupid jokes that probably weren\u2019t even that funny lmao also BODY VIBRATIONS ARE A THING haha smoked another half a bowl, went home and whacked an entire package of cookies lol fell asleep feeling like I was laying on a cloud. Awesome strain. Do keep some water around when smoking though.

VI had this strain in Seattle a few years ago and was just blown away. Fantastic focused and energetic head high, but the showstopper is the taste and smell of this bud. Pine and citrus that stick with you for a bit and a happy and energizing buzz that doesn&#39;t stop. Definitely a bucket list strain and I hope to find some more soon.

VHaven\u2019t tried the green, only the distillate.  Was not impressed.  A bit harsh (had some difficulty controlling the hit), solid early peaking high, but not much else for me.  Not particularly sexual, not intellectual, not musical, not munchy, not sleepy.  Will probably try it a few more times \u2014- until I get something better.\u2014 but not a fan.  Might be a good base for a blend if can control the harshness.

VThis is the second time in two years that I&#39;ve had this strain from our crops and it has improved a star rating. I loved it then and more this time around because of the intensity of the high lasts longer. The high gives me more energy and relieves my pain completely from my injury. Every morning I wake up I take my morphine and Roxicodone. Then I take a puff off my one hitter and my pain subsides so I can function without pain. I love the euphoric head high it gives and the body high feels like I just ate a &quot;cookie&quot;. It has a nice woodsy aroma and a sweet taste to boot. Of all the strains I&#39;ve had in my long career of smoking it&#39;s still one of my favorites. I prefer hybrids the most to alleviate pain. I can also concentrate better with them. Crossing strains is the way to go and seems to be most users preference also.

Vif you can control jack then he will show you a good time in the cool, frosty uplifting land he calls home. a mellow energy will affect you quickly, in just a few puffs, most likely telling you to lay down and enjoy a nice book, or even dance and stretch with some soft music in the background. beware of a little dizziness, just stretch your neck  and shoulders and you will feel great. enjoy!

VGood strain for casual nights when you just want to chill out, possibly have sex with your significant other, and actually get some stuff done around the house.  Smoke too much and you could be about to be on the ride of your life.  Smoked too much and felt very, *very* paranoid and anxious.

VWant that bud that would start any day off the right way and make you high as hell, try this Jack Frost. It&#39;s a crazy hybrid that from my first hit I got a headache but after a while it started to go away. It makes you feel stress free which is always a plus for me and care free as well. Even though it has a few negatives in my opinion it still worth trying out for any marijuana smoker. Jack Frost has that nice chilly taste to it which I love and that nice fresh bud smell. I&#39;m grateful to have smoked such a great strain.

VThis strain balances calming with energizing. I need to be doing something when I smoke this, because i find it to be a little too stimulating for watching TV, but I&#39;m very functional when I medicate during the day with this strain. It&#39;s very uplifting, and I can still focus. I also really love the bright, citrusy aroma and taste.

VBased on the reviews I&#39;ve read I think the strain my girlfriend got was laced with something. It goes down real smooth as long as you don&#39;t take a strong hit. When you do take a strong hit it feels like your stomach is going to come out through your mouth. At first I thought it was because we smoked a huge blunt the first time we&#39;d ever had JF but now I know it&#39;s not that. Jack Frost is really potent and can get you pretty far gone in a few hits. But after that few hits is when everything changed my life. I started feeling really trippy. Everything freaked me out. Walking was a fucking process. It felt like everything was shifting around me. It also turns off the stop-eating-you&#39;re-full switch. Every time I smoke this weed I eat until I feel like my stomach is going to burst and that trips me out more. I have to focus on TV to keep myself from freaking out. Overall I gave Jack Frost here a high rating because my girlfriend doesn&#39;t really trip out like me but she does trip a lot with this strain so it&#39;s probably laced. I&#39;m sure that if it wasn&#39;t laced Jack Frost would be a favorite. Don&#39;t let my review keep you from trying it just make sure it&#39;s not laced otherwise your life will be miserable while you smoke, after you smoke, and when you wake up the next morning.

VPurple Nurf is a sleeper strain producing a fine feeling of well-being and confidence and focus. Nice high, too \u2013tho many will pass it by because it clocks in at just under 18% THC. Why mess with that (for a non-medicinal need) when Durban Poison will deliver nearly twice that? Like me, they probably don\u2019t know about THC-A.\u000aThe PurpNurf has a THC-A level of 17%, too. We now know that THC-A, in the presence of high-ish heat (according to Google, at least above 350C ), converts into the psychoactive THC. After that, you\u2019re looking at 34% of THC with this strain. There\u2019s little body high in this sativa strain (purchased from Silver Stem on NE 40th, one of the few places in the city carrying it).\u000aBut back to the high. By itself, PurpNurf is perfect for anything requiring clarity and focus that you want do in a relaxed, pleasant, manner with consistent cerebral engagement. It really helps me be emotionally present but not stuck in my head. And I generally feel at ease with what I\u2019m doing and myself. Compared to, say, Green Crack, I feel nicer on PurpNurf, though not as driven, bloodless or strategic. Oh, and then there\u2019s the increased tactile, taste and texture sensitivity and easy sensual (not necessarily sexual) stimulation, too. \u000aThe Nurf is perfect for waking and baking and use through the day, for getting chores done on a relaxed Saturday, or at dinner with friends who enjoy thoughtful or clever conversation. I really enjoyed it for these purposes. The high lasts 3-4 hours, though hitting on this exclusively over several days brought a curious heaviness around my neck. \u000aPurpNurf plays very well with others. I smoked it alone, and in combination with Cinex, Durban Poison and Green Crack, all what I call cranial smokes. What I found (all vaped 50/50):\u000aWith Cinex: This was the bomb! A bowl delivered a great feeling of relaxed yet full confidence and ease; long-term planning and long-term memory both strong. I felt enjoyable engagement and productivity with this combo, perfect high for a wake n baker and throughout the day.  \u000aWith Green Crack: I thought this would be great. It wasn\u2019t. A 50/50 vape bowl of this softened the drive of the Green Crack, not much else.\u000aWith Durban Poison: This combo is better with a higher proportion of PurpNurf. That lightens the intensity and occasional tendency for Poison to take you down the rabbit hole of meta. Poison is such a strong strain that it overwhelmed most of the other characteristics of the PurpNurf.\u000aI deffo encourage you to check this out; a strong high with relaxed self-awareness and confidence.
