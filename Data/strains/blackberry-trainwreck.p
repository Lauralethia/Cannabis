VVery good strain for pain relief. I have yet to find anything better. My only gripe is that the pain relief only lasts for 2 to 3 hours, but while it is working I love it. I have a very bad case of sciatica. The burning needles and pins pain sensation makes my single encounter with shingles seem like a paper cut. Imagine taking a red hot knife, stabbing the outer thigh of each leg and slicing upward. Then imagine complete relief for 3 hours. NO PAIN FOR 3 HOURS!! Please work on lengthening that 3 hours to 6.\u263a\ufe0f

VI purchased a half ounce of this and it&#39;s the only strain that has managed to still give me a good head buzz after smoking it for weeks.

VBlackberry Trainwreck was something i hadnt heard about at all. Got a couple Z and first thing i was underwhelmed by was the smell. You can tell it has blackberry genes from the smell, and the smell tells you its potent, it is just very bland. The nugs where bright green and orange, conic and very dense, and absolutley caked in trichs. so much so that u would get a pile of keef every time u grind it, and there would still be alot left on the bud as well. The taste, like the smell, was very bland. But, it hits you like a ton of bricks. i was suprised how ripped i was off 1 hit, bring strong cerebral and body effects. Not total couchlock,but your will be sluggish. Would be awsome to make hash from.

VDark, dough-y consistency.  Bitter fore-taste, but pleasant aroma and aftertaste.  Overall high is decent, better than bad, but not premium.
