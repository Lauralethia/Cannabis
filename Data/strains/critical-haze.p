VOh you can smoke lots of strain, but if you really smoke &quot;some strong sh*t&quot; choose this. Critical haze is the most reliable strain when you wanna get high af. If you smoke very good genetics and quality grow; almost 4-5 hours you&#39;ll f*cked up. You&#39;ll relax more, you&#39;ll laugh more and you&#39;ll thank me later. Also, i think it&#39;s not good for daytime use, because you will feel your legs are very heavy.

VAfter a brief lack of herb this strain was a great welcome back. It was quite intense at first shortly settling into a mellow high which lasted a fair amount of time and caused me to consume much food. It does smell fruity and strong enough that there&#39;s little room for discretion when storing it. Good smoke, HIGHly recommend it.

VI smoke this strain..what a high!! 100% relaxed on the bed..but not sleepy. Not the best taste but the smoke is too sweet with citrus influence. This strain fucked me, shit..real mental trip. Moreover, i had very very dry eyes..RED EYES. One of my favourite strains..five stars!

Vthis strain was very nice for me i bought it from my guy and after buying it i sat with him for a smoke he took out his bong and we grinned up the critical haze cannabis i put some weed in the bowl and started to smoke the smoke was a bit rough for me although not horrible but when i finished smoking i could easily feel the nice high i had and it was great i stared at the white wall for about 2 minutes while his laughing at me (i didn&#39;t even notice) and when i did notice i started cracking up i think the thing i like the most about this weed is that you start with a very sativa high with allot of laughing and making weird noises with your friends and after a sativa high of about an hour and a half you have an indica like down and you just want to sit on your couch cuddling your blanket while watching TV all alone with no one to bother you this weed will not make you sleep but it does make you want to just RELAX\u000awhich is awesome \u000ai did encounter a bit of stress with this weed and i was very clumsy and could not concentrate at all\u000a(the bud was absolutely beautiful and full of brown hair&#39;s and crystals was one of the nicest bud i saw with a sweet smell)\u000a\u000alove it!!!!
