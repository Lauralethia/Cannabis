VI was lucky enough to come across a legit batch of this great flower. Mine was a good all day smoke although it was good at night too. I was glad I tried this, I would like to grow some of this because it smells so good.

VNice melt away of anxiety and a rotten headache after smoking a small bowl. This strain was fairly smooth to smoke and tasty. The buds are a lighter green and large, with moderate density and a good display of trichromes, and it showed up in my head first. I\u2019m an Indica girl mostly, as head highs can translate into jaw clenching, anxiety inducing messes for me, so I use Sativas carefully! This one was lovely! No anxiety, no clenching and tension, just a bright, happy wash of feeling that left me able to function fine, but I can absolutely feel the mood improvement it induced. 10/10 a great experience, highly recommend if you find Straight Sativas a little too zippy! \u000a\u000aAt about 30 minutes in, the high went from head to body, leaving me feeling fuzzy and snuggly, ready for a nap. Not so much for me for sleep at night, but a fantastic daytime strain to get you smiling and productive and then relaxes you as a reward for your work!

VDidn\u2019t quite care for the taste, but the high was fantastic! It creeped up on me then hit me like a ton of bricks. Pain gone and moderately productive for about an hour at best then i hit a wall and chilled in the pool. Nice

VThis has me stuck stuck stuck. Took to destroy joint pain and get me to sleep. Mission, success.\u000a\u000aThis strain is AMAZING! Bought on a whim based on other reviews. It&#39;s so good and I have to admit hits me like an Indica with the perfect amount of sativa bonuses.\u000a\u000aA phenomenal and peaceful high. Take out on your porch on a summer night and enjoy. \u000a(Then, enjoy a phenomenal sleep).

VI almost skipped this one, kinda glad I didn&#39;t.  Made my eyes watery so that was a nice change.  It also gave me a solid body buzz.  Slightly hard on the lungs by the end of my smoke session.  This one would be a little difficult to get work done while using.  A good anytime of day med.

VThat fresh pine aroma this strain gives off gets me everytime. It just smells soooooo good. makes me feel like taking a long walk into nature and being surrounded by trees. The taste is also amazing, a real nice earthy flavor with small notes of lemon. BUT the high isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had. It does leave you relaxed with a clear mind but it wasn&#39;t that potent for me (although I&#39;m not sure what thc percentage I was smoking on) so overall I&#39;m very pleased with this strain but it&#39;s not gonna punch you in the face if your a cannabis conousour. Maybe I just need to take a tolerance break and see Tina Danza at it&#39;s finest. \u263a\u270c

VA great strain with everything you&#39;d want from a sativa leaning hybrid. The pine smell is very pronounced along with hints of lemon and pungent. Smokes well and tastes great.\u000a\u000aWhen I broke the first nugget open I experienced something I&#39;ve never seen before. There was bb pellet sized ball of pure resin nestled inside this very tightly packed nugget. The goo was stretching and stringing as I pulled the nug apart. It was like having a pocket of &quot;naturally occuring&quot; rosin within the nugget. Incredible. It only happened with that first nugget but I was blown away. \u000a\u000aThis morning was really bad for me but this strain completely turned my mood around and I was excited to seize the day.

VBy FAR, this is my FAVORITE hybrid! Immediate head high that trickles down and makes you feel tingly.  Very relaxing and soothing in the body for pain, without the heavy groggy feeling. Wish more dispensaries carried it!

VAfter one deep hit off of flower I felt it creeping into my head, after 10 mins flowing smoothly throughout my body. \u000a A very enjoyable euphoric high without couch lock or racing thoughts.\u000aLasted about 1 1/2 hours from one hit.

VI really enjoyed this strain... for me, the high was gradual, usually I get an immediate in ur face and sudden headache type high. Not with this tho, it was so mellow, nice body high, like I was floating lol&#128514;....hopefully I can get to sleep with this one, kinda feel like it will keep me up, we shall see lol
