VGrunk is a perfect &quot;get your chores&quot; kind of weed. It energizes and motivates you to get up and moving while still letting you be high. If you smoke this strain to sleep you better go to sleep right away or you just may find yourself at the gym at 11:30 at night.

VThis one snuck up on me. Halfway through the cone and I kept questioning whether I was stoned, which inevitably led to some crazy out of the ordinary thought patterns- thus answering what inevitably was a rhetorical question; YES- I indeed was stoned. Very relaxing high, yet still able to spark the creativity I was looking for; docking a star for taste- not the best.

VThe Original Grunk can be viewed in the Cannabible  #2. It&#39;s a Florida strain, a cross of a very SATIVA heavy Grape and a Skunk #1, not Grape Ape The buzz is extremely racy, puts Green Crack to shame.. I have heard there was another version out there and now it is confirmed.

VEverything&#39;s spot on as described. Grape skunk smell and smoke. Neon purple and lime green with neon orange hairs. Top of my list for curing bad moods. Euphoria and happiness does get haunted by bouts of paranoid anxiety. This experience was on a low tolerance. On a high tolerance it&#39;s more chill and creative. Less euphoric and noid.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend to treat mood disorders.

VThsi was a fun strain that really evolved through time. Started with a real flavorful smoke. Lots of berry notes and hashy skunky pine notes. The high sets in behind your eyes with a nice mental uplift and clear head. Focus is increased and a little body high sets in during the second wave. Creativity and even more body high complete the first 30 minutes. Not a long lasting strain but a real enjoyable experience worth a try.

VThe Grunk is one of the best strains I&#39;ve had in a long time. Just came into my regular shop in preroll. But now they have flower! I  can&#39;t wait to get my grinder ready for a bit of work. And get my bong super clean to smell the beautiful aroma and taste of cannabis I remember as a teenager. \u000a\u000abtw... Issaquah Cannabis Company in Washington State is the best shop around.
