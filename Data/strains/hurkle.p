VI though this strain hurkle was very berry tasting and had a 11.56%c.b.d 7.68% t.h.c so I defiantly like this strain for my depression, anxiety,and pain purposes I would rate this strain.\u000a a 8 but the stars don&#39;t go that high.

VThis is like the &quot; Miller lite &quot; of marijuana. \u000a\u000aI can always find it very cheap and its pretty good. This truely is the coors or miller lite of pot. It could very easily be your every day smoke. Its pretty good too. \u000a\u000aThe smell is pretty traditional of most cannabis . Sort of that skunky and pungent smell. It is going to get you high ... a nice mellow high , nothing too crazy. The 1:1 THC/CBD ratio pokes its head up pretty early on. You feel the CBD creep up on you as you start to really relax. \u000a\u000aThe flavor is like the weed itself. Very mild. I got a sort of burnt nutty taste ... its not overpowering at all and would almost lean towards tasteless. \u000a\u000aNot too energetic but not too tired. This is a hybrid if there ever was one. The sativa , the indica - The yin and the yang , they both fight for your mind and end up somewhere in the middle ... a draw in the war of preference. A slight wrap around your head. You start to wind down and feel pretty darn swell. This is it ... nothing is going to blow your mind. If you are looking to shoot to the stars this isnt for you. It&#39;s nice and mellow ... medium. It would be great for someone new to cannabis or with a low tolerance. No paranoia .. everything is just ok. Yea I could see using this frequently and you will too. Thanks Hurkle !

VAside from serious cotton mouth and a bad case of munchies, this smooth strain is absolutely wonderful!  Get&#39;s rid of nausea, melts away stress, and is totally safe for newbees new to cannabis, great day time strain, no couch lock, even if u vape all day long.  I love the clear minded relaxed feeling.  It is not a super invigorating high like some sativas, but then again there is no paranoia either. Much like it&#39;s parent Harlequin (who is descendant of my old favorite Columbian Gold) I love the way it eases pain and stress.  It&#39;s other parent Querkle ensures that this true hybrid is so well balanced u will want to vape it all day long.  GREAT stress reliever.  It is a fantastic strain to meditate to.  Have some ice water and snacks ready :) enjoy

VA high cbd strain with around 10 % thc. This is a really food smooth smoke. It has a tropical taste to it i cant put my finger on but it is a tasty herb. Great for pain insomnia and general deppresion. Who will want to get up and go. This herb got me up and at em. Got to say this is a home run strain. I am a higj tolerent smoker daily but this low thc ganga can keep up with tje big boys with only 10 % thc and 8% cbd it is classed as a 1/1 ratio hybrid and is a keeper for anyone especially people who like ligjter smoke with higj cbd. Great weed.

VThis batch is 7.0% THC and 12.4% CBD and was my 2nd medical Marijuana strain I ever tried.  I vape it and find an immediate relaxing effect in my head and body, my arthritis dissappears in about 30 seconds while taking the edge off the rest of my chronic pain.  In about several minutes it starts to eliminate my nausea without making me overly hungry.  I find it works really well for shutting down stomach aches/spasms associated with IBS-D as well as improving my bowel movements which I haven&#39;t found any other strains to help with.  The effects of this strain kick in quickly but don&#39;t really last that long compared to others and is gone in about 2.5 hours.  The initial anxiety relief doesn&#39;t last that long and I find it I feel slightly jittery and heart palpitations after that, nothing too bad.  It hasn&#39;t consistently helped with my mood, nor sleep.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.\u000a\u000aIt is relatively easy on my throat not too much coughing.  It tastes delicious, savoury with some salty/sweet flavours as well.  Unlike other strains it doesn&#39;t cause my mouth to be very dry.

VHurkle&#39;s got my vote.  This is the first nearly 1:1 ratio strain I&#39;ve tried, and I have to admit, I&#39;m impressed.  4.8  on the scale for me.  This is a great strain for nightime use, as the CBD gives you a numbing body high that destroys pain, and the THC gives you that same numbing, comfortably warm effect to the mind.  If you get the chance, try it!

VI love this strain because it&#39;s high in CBD and low in THC. It makes me feel relaxed but not sleepy. It takes the nausea away associated with Crohn&#39;s Disease and it helped me get through a flare up. It also gives mild munchies which helped me pull through the flare up. It has an earthy and chocolate smell.

VThis strain requires the right time and moment to smoke. The more I smoked, the better it got. BUT, I probably wouldn&#39;t smoke this or purchase this strain again. Hurkle is not a social weed. It is meant for relaxing on the couch, and probably for laying down. I smoked this before I went to a hockey game and I had no emotion. I just watched the game in a daze. It did make me a little dizzy, which then made me nauseous. When I smoked this later while in bed, it was better. I was not sleepy, but I was relaxed. The strain hit first in the head, then later spread to the rest of the body.  Again, do not smoke this with friends - this is a loner strain.
