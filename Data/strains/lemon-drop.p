VI got some live resin of this strain and its smell is just as strong as if I got the plant form. I taste strait lemon with a bit of sweetness mixed in there. Defiantly an indica strain making me laugh like a monkey in KFC and relaxed as sloth in a mattress store. Defiantly a good strain. It&#39;s lit as some would say\u000a

It is great for thinking and being abstract. You also find all of those thoughts funny! This bud is a very slap happy bud. Overall a pleasure to smoke, would highly recommend.

VGreat for beginners. My partner is wary of weed because she&#39;s had some bad experiences in the past. I vaped this first and greatly enjoyed the buzzy tingling and euphoria. She loved it when she tried it as well! Such a feel-good high with no paranoia or anxiety. For both of us, we get super giggly with a shorter attention span than usual. I find a quirk for me is that I have a harder time taking things figuratively when I&#39;m on Lemon Drop. I keep focusing on the literal...which has a bonus of making friends laugh. \u000a\u000aThis is the strain that made me text &quot;oh my bake, I&#39;m so fuck,&quot; if that gives you an idea. That was a full bowl in on the Boundless CF.

VRelaxing yet not overpowering if it&#39;s indica leaning (says Leafly). Roiled a J Bird of this and smoked half. I&#39;m in utter bliss. Perfectly calm and centered. No edge what so ever. If you tend to get somewhat anxious easily or paranoid this strain won&#39;t cause any of these symptoms. Just a lovely ride on a cloud.

VNice, chill, mellow strain. Yet, it kept me almost jittery &amp; wired. Got some jolts of energy &amp; gave off a nice, smooth, cerebral buzz effect. Guess that&#39;s why they call it a Hybrid. The taste after you blow out a hit is sweet like candy! Nice lemony-earthy smell &amp; taste. I&#39;d definitely try it again.

VThis shit defiantly has a lemony smell to it and the taste is also very lemony but that&#39;s why its called Lemon Drop lol The high from Lemon Drop is more of an giggly, uplifting, feel good buzz. I smoked some with a few friends and it made us kinda goofy and we were laughing at the stupidest shit lol The grow that we got though was more Sativa based but it did have some Indica moments in the high lol

Interestingly, I could  tell I was high due to some pressure in my temples, but didn\u2019t feel very Stoney.\u000a\u000aInstead, I could tell that the lemon drop was making me extremely euphoric in ways no other strain has,, but in a very clear headed way.

VBefore even getting any of this, I loved the smell of it. Really sweet and lemony. With each hit, I got a nice earthy flavor. Hits smooth, smells awesome, and kicks in pretty quick. It got me real relaxed and left me clear headed. I found myself thinking more mathematically and scientifically. Which is weird for me. It got to the point where I was staring at the smoke after each hit and was watching the wind. Very relaxing. Afterwards, I got into a working mood. I was running around cleaning the house up as much as I possibly could. After cleaning, I sat down and played some GTA. I got really caught up in that too. Playing GTA in first person while high on this was a fucking trip. I can imagine playing with a VR helmet. I&#39;d be gone for a few hours. I read through some reviews and read that it didn&#39;t really work that well for some others out there, so I&#39;d recommend getting an eighth and trying it out first. I personally love it, but that&#39;s just me.

VThe herb I came across, was crossed with OG Kush but although there was the combination this strain was very uplifting. The buds were very dense, covered in orange hairs, and appear as though they were dipped in a sugar dish. Lemon Drop OG maintained a mellow scent (even through the breaking up buds to smoking it) of sweet, citrus-y lemon with under note&#39;s of dried pine logs. The cerebral effects are the first to take place from the first exhale, to the energetic effects taking play within the first 10 minutes. Definitely would consider this to be a good starter in social groups, as it inspires talkative, creative, and even giggly mannerisms. Continued use of this indica-dominant strain can lead to it&#39;s &quot;indica&quot; qualities settling into a body high. A subtle tingly sensation assists in relaxation and the melting away of anxiety, muscle and joint aches, and prevent nausea even improving appetite.  When using as an early daytime medicine I began receiving stuffed nasal-ways which lead to a sinus headache; when used in afternoon to late evening leads to a great conversations around the dinner table, or extra sense of euphoria watching the sunset. Overall pleasant strain with a mellow scent and flavors of sweet lemon pine.

VThis has to be my new favorite strain. Purchased in flower form, smells so wonderfully like lemons. Harsher smoke but can be conserved by taking smaller, slower hits. \u000a\u000aI instantly feel more peaceful. Calmer, more focused, more willing to cooperate, more careful. Wanting to have fun and relax or get absorbed into something like reading. Smoking while studying for an exam, gave me more motivation &amp; I&#39;m very focused. Existing conditions/state include ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety &amp; panic disorder. State is usually agitated, depressed, scatterbrained- prior to smoking was ok. Lemon Drop made me more focused and more willing to experience things. \u000a\u000aLove the smell soo much. So lucky to have found this at my local dispensary and inquired about it. Budtender didn&#39;t know much but the smell reeled me in...! and the name. Lemon drop top.

You will feel &quot;high&quot;, however those around you likely wouldn&#39;t even notice.  Feels like a sativa...upbeat heart rate, and I cannot sit still. Walked the dogs for nearly an hour, ha. Others wrote that it&#39;s a great motivator, and I agree - it will get you up doing things. Definitely worth buying a gram to try yourself.

VSo this strain amazing. First off, the lemon aroma and flavor is insane. It sort of reminds me of pine sol. It is a hybrid, but the effects definitely lean towards sati a, the indica portion just compliments the high with a mellow body buzz. The sativa portion gave this great happy euphoric vibe that really pairs well with the body high. The effects hit me minutes after I took two rips, but when they did, I felt great. I had a non-stop smile I my face and everything was on a happy filter in a way. All around, this strain is one of the best I&#39;ve had and for sure the best smell and flavor. If you ever have a chance to pick some up, do it. I would even pay a little extra.

VThis strain is amazing if you\u2019re looking for an uplifting, happy, giggly high. My boyfriend and I (both occasional smokers), were recommended to try this. We split one joint and it was more than enough for a solid 2-3 hour high. The high creeped up after about 10 minutes of smoking. Both of our faces got pretty tingly. Had about three peaks in the three hour high, each one followed by a good 10-15 minutes cry-laughing fit for both of us. Highly recommend! Great strain!

VReally nice strain. Picked this up and was told it was more of an indica hybrid but I think it&#39;s probably more sativa. Buds are fluffy, lemon green colour, thick coating of white crystals. Smell is very strong sweet and sour lemon, you smell it and want to smoke it immediately. Tastes a bit sweet/lemon but was expecting something stronger from the smell. Effects where mostly cerebral, some indica body high but not a huge amount, can still function normally whilst using this strain, no couch lock. I don&#39;t know the thc content of the sample I have but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s massively high, it&#39;s a very nice smoke for day time, mellow and floaty high, nothing too intense. Would certainly buy again

VFirstly, are you guys at Leafly sure this is an Indica? Other sites and my dispensary said it was sativa hybrid. \u000a\u000aAnyway, what I had smelled good. Didn&#39;t sense much Lemon, but still nice. No hint of stinky cheese like other varieties, no berry smell. Something like citrus and menthol maybe.\u000a\u000aFirst time I didn&#39;t inhale enough and it felt like it was weak. But next time I felt it and it was very pleasant high. It onset softly and  in my case I felt a soft cloud sensation, not particularly sleepy like pure Indica, and not steamroller wheels amped. It gave me energy and raised my concentration to be able to listen to and enjoy music, which normally I cannot for longer than 30 seconds.\u000a\u000aLasted normal time. Only side effect is I had some dry mouth and tingly hands. Also raises appetite.

VThis strain did wonders for my lower back pain. I have a herniated disc which makes it hard to sleep at night. Definitely relaxed me. Also major case of the munchies, I can deal for the relief it gives me.

VAfter an eleven hour gaming session, an energy drink, and a half dozen tacos, the only thing keeping me awake at this point is the crazy head rush after every hit of this Lemon Drop. I think I can probably make it to 4 a.m. with this next pack...

VHad some tasty out door nugs. Great motivator, energizing. Big citrus taste. Helped with my chronic fatigue and cognitive issues. I was able to focus on a task for a long sustained period. Great for the infamous Chemo-Brain. Highly reccomended.

VA very sweet and tangy taste, light and soothing high. Got a smiley, drifting feeling, no tiredness or psychedelic effects. Decent motivator. Not very strong but great if you want to smoke a lot of something and not go crazy. Not what I would usually go for, however I could see how some people would benefit, especially if one is socially anxious. Really good taste!
