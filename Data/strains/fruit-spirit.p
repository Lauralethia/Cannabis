VA good strain for someone who has something to do today, creeps on slowly and leaves you in a euphoric haze but still allows you to concentrate and get things done. Only complaint is the quality of my buds; flowers weren&#39;t cured correctly and left only partially dried.

VGiving it flat 4/5 for its body relaxing effects mainly and its ability to numb my brain and think less (a welcome change once in a while). would only reccomend for relaxing high and would definetly have again before going for a massage... really highlights your bodies aches n pains while amplifying stretches and rubs within localized area of pain. would literally have me being putty to a masuse i reckon! remember to take every review with a pinch of salt #staytuned #CGMurray

VThis strain is really everything for me.\u000aAlthough it is not as fruity as its name stands for, it is very subtle and mind blowing at the same time. \u000aIt really has a bit of pepper into it and tastes a bit harsh, the buds are quiet dry and it is not sticky in any way.\u000aThe formation of this strain are not huge buds but meduim sized.\u000aIt&#39;s good for mainlining for the experienced growers and it&#39;ll yield greatly in that method.\u000aIt also do well in scrog.\u000aIt&#39;s a strain from heaven, it&#39;ll clear your head with positive thoughts and you&#39;ll feel very nostalgic. It really brings up memories from ones childhood and makes you really happy and euphoric.\u000aI smoke this strain for a year now everyday and the only reason I give it 4 stars is because it&#39;s a bit harsh on your throat. Besides that, its a wonderful strain with very high potency that can really knock you out of your feet. \u000a

VI was looking for something to smoke in the mornings that would help me get my day going and this joint of fruit pebbles did the trick. You can smell the fruity scent off the bud as soon as you open the bottle. Good for getting the day going and keeping it going.

VThis strain is nothing less than a gift from the gods. It&#39;s feels like your head gets wrapped in cotton candy. You&#39;ll laugh a lot and feel super relaxed while your body remains active. Also, it is a nice strain to  smoke at a party because while your mind gets sucked into the music you&#39;re still being able to dance for hours. Definitely one of my favourite strains

VA menos de 5 minutos de haber fumado un bowl completo me siento en total relajaci&#243;n corporal. Justo despu&#233;s del primer levant&#243;n se siente ligero el cuerpo y los pensamientos. Un poco despu&#233;s se pone algo entumecido el cuerpo. relajaci&#243;n absoluta.  No es el caso hoy, pero estoy seguro que debe ser muy buena en caso de ansiedad o depresi&#243;n.

VThe aroma i got from this strain is the most unique i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. In jar cure is going to make it even better i reckon. I can only describe it as light menthol butterscotch cream. Reminiscent of the sweet/candy Murray Mints in smell. There are berry undertones sitting there also which i hope increase over the curing period. When burnt there is an earthy fresh classic resin hash smell which is extremely pleasant to be surrounded by after you exhale. My new favourite strain.

VReally good Sativa leaning hybrid, great to focus with. I study and workout with this strain works well every time. When growing this plant in flowering the plant becomes slightly more picky and sensitive to nute changes. One can easily lock this plant out and kill it. First time I grew it almost happened, this being my second time all systems seem good thus far 5 weeks into flowering.

VWhere is the &quot;Fruit&quot; in Fruit Spirit????  And no there is no half stars here.  2 is all it gets.  Flavour is more floral than fruity.  Makes me cough almost as bad as Cheese and Chemdawg did and the ONLY thing I can say that is good about this is the appearance and the fact that it lasts a decent amount of time in my Davinci Vape... The smell is fairly good, I will say that much for it.  I will not buy it again.  The only thing I liked about it is that it was a great addition to one of my blends where I mix 3 or 4 strains together to get a blend that does what I like it to do.  The buds were a bit too dry in my opinion and that even though I put it into a mason jar with an air-tight lid, it still seemed to get stale fast.  Not sure how long Tilray had it stocked on their shelves but it just was not that good for me.  Pain relief was not that good, I could not go more than a bowl due to the coughing and the relatively lack luster taste.  but once I mixed it with a few others, it fit right in nicely!  This review however is not about the blending I do but the actual strain on it&#39;s own.\u000a\u000aIf I had to make a decision between this and cheese (The other 2 star review I gave) then I would have little choice to have this one come in  JUST BARELY ahead of Cheese and that is ONLY because Cheese makes me cough my  bronchial tubes out more than Fruit Spirit does and the taste as well as the smell of cheese is a bit worse to me than this one, but not by much at all!!!
