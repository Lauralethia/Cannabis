VGot some of yhe CBD Rene. Probably my favorite CBD strain I&#39;ve tried so far. Has a 1:1 ratio and a nice rose and pine flavor. Definitely not a super potent high but has a nice uplifting effect with pain relief on sore joints. I usually add this to other strains to bump up there CBD content or mellow them out a bit.

VVery tasty herb. Taste like freshly cut lemon pectin combine with pine needles. Not very strong but still allowed some mind exploration. Great for beginners to initiate them to cannabis.

VThis is a good all around cheap strain that I always seem to get when its available. Mostly because its 60$ for 1/2oz and because it still surprises me in how decent it is. This one relaxes and mellows me, not the best for needing to do tasks and focus. Good end of day strain to just chill and watch movies to

VCBD Ren&#233; is amazing!! One nice bong rip had me feeling good. Took another one and another one another one. So relaxing, no more stress. I\u2019m a light smoker. Like 1g a week. But with this CBD I was so comfortable with it 5g in one night. Best sleep I had in a while 17 hour sleep. Knocked me the fuck out.

VBy far one of my favourite strains ever . Love the story behind it . \u000aThe names that people have come up with for strains is unbelievable . For me , having strains ,named after important people in marijuana history , just like the Jack Herer . Love that these strains are a part of a legacy . To me , whenever I see these strains actually think about the person that faught the laws to make cannabis a more available to everyone . Not sure I like the legalization of weed , think the governments shouldn\u2019t be allowed to to get any money from the legalization till reparations are paid back to all those charge for it in the past and have problems getting jobs and lost a part of lif in prison . I\u000aI hate the fast that government hated weed and done nothing to bringing attention to all the good in marijuana . The ones that pushed it ...as good . And now the government sees the money and thinks they should get there piece . Fuck that . \u000aGod bless Renee Boje ! Wish I could get chance to meet you and pick your brain .

VNice, smooth and relaxing strain, gives an uplifting high, expected since it is a mix of Himalayan indicate and skunk #1. It&#39;s my go to sativa for a rainy day, makes all your worries and burdens melt away, and helps me allot with my chronic back pain.

VI&#39;m always a little wary of Hybrid Strains but Rene hits it out of the park. This Sativa dominate cross between Skunk&amp; Himalayan is potent and not recommended for rookies. This smooth earthy Sativa is great for morning and afternoon but if you hit this mother too late you will have a long busy night. Rene comes on a ton with clear creative high with easy steady peaks and valleys. My dispensary suggested it for stress and pain , well done bud tender .... well done. I do , however suggest a cut off time and a solid Intica to help you sleep which I discovered at 11:30 while watching Key Largo with Boogie ,Bacall  and Edward G. But I digress. If you get a chance to pick up Rene... do it man ! \u000a

VI found this strain to do literally nothing for me. I purchased 1 gram of Rene CBD to try thinking it would be a good daytime strain to relieve pain. I vaped about as much as I do other strains to get the right dose and felt nothing other than a bit dizzy. I topped up the dose and sill found very little effect. I would definitely never purchase this strain again.
