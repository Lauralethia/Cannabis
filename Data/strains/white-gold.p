VKind of a middle ground strain. When smoking alot and sitting on sofa or something this can be make you relaxed like indica, but when you start to move it goes up to the head and starts acting more like sativa. Citrus taste is very present which is nice. I ahve smoked it and vaped it. When vaped it isn&#39;t that strong, but I think this is due to the vaporizing since it&#39;s not burning.

VI absolutely love this strain! it calms me down and makes me feel absolutely wonderful, it&#39;s a great mood lifter and it smells delicious too. my only critique is that when ground and packed into my bong, it&#39;s a little difficult to smoke/start smoking, this strain is so fluffy that you need to pull pretty hard to get the hit going. but the upside of that&#39;s that it saves bud! you don&#39;t need to take that big a hit to get high with this stuff. definitely dope.

VI turned away one of my favorite strains to get this and I am 100% satisfied by my decision!  This is a must have and probably my new favorite all time!  I absolutely love a great hybrid that will not give you munchies and keep you up and going.  A fantastic happy uplifted high that will make you feel like telling a story for hours haha!  Do not pass this strain up if you get the chance.  Good vibes to all

VSuper compact bud, sticky, reminded me of a soft hash. very pungent smell, smell  changes on fingers to a hash smell. Many flavors come through on smoking, fruit, citrus and a herb taste, very pleasant indeed. The high, its a creeper, slow build up and very nice, very relaxing and a great pain reducer. Two bowls was more than enough, for us anyways. Mild harshness to the throat. We really enjoyed everything about this

VAfter smoking one bowl of this strain I was stoned, it\u2019s very powerful. When I was sitting down in my chair I had a nice relaxing vibe to it I felt at peace with myself, and when I got up the sativa part of the strain hit me and I was dancing without music. The reason I did not give this strain a full five stars is that the paranoia is a little higher than any other strain. But this is still the strongest weed I\u2019ve yver smoked and it smells a bit like a tropical. Pineapple

VIncredibly mellow to hyper-paranoia to bliss in no time at all. The good times are really, really good. It&#39;s a rollercoaster for sure but it&#39;s worth the price of admission.
