VIt made me write this:\u000a \u000aThe Mad Poet.\u000a\u000aTitle book: Ramblings of a Madman, By Jonathan Kondziolka.\u000a\u000aCore of story: plot of Like Mike\u000a      -change characters to downtrodden lower class, Black males.\u000a\u000a      -Militaristic Government=LA Nights Management\u000a\u000a      -Ultimate goal: to change the global opinion of the Black peoples, thereby uplifting the spirit and state of pride in the United States of America. This then causes for an unionized organization of the Governmental bodies. A truly motivating tale of a lowly child improving the life of not only himself, but of the global populace.\u000a\u000aEnding: It is the arise of the Black male in America. A speech of peace and unity amongst the people of the globe. The use of &#39;basketball&#39; as a term of the current socio-economic policies of the time. In the end, the world betters.\u000a\u000aAt the very core of the united, multinational, mentality is the that in which all peoples are intoxicated through marihuana and are thereby influenced by the drug.\u000a\u000a\u000aThank you, Like Mike.

VNebula is a top strain for the effects I&#39;m after - powerful, clear head high plus an uplifting body sensation, lasts a good length of time. Extreme eye-reddener. Conversation can be a challenge due to frequent space outs.

VAn excellent choice for those who want a light high that&#39;s less dissociative and more stimulating. You&#39;ll have the best conversations with people as you&#39;re more mentally present and less far gone. You&#39;ll be In harmony with the moment. The light buzz of this bud skips the burnt out feeling after most strong strains so it&#39;s great for smoking in the day as you&#39;ll keep awake. It&#39;s not however a good night time strain because it&#39;s not as potent and sedating as other strains. Smells like honey too! Overall a definite favorite of mine, if you get the chance to try it it may prove to be your new daytime strain.

VI smoked this in the morning to relieve my headaches and inflammation from my cold/flu. It worked exceptionally, the taste is very mild and the flowers are absolutely drenched in trichomes. I found that this strain could be considered &quot;weak&quot; if you were using it as a night time smoke or are a avid smoker, but this strain was perfect for my condition. It was not overpowering and i did not necessarily feel &quot;high&quot; for very long, however it provided me with perfect relief from my headache and cold symptoms. Overall Nebula is a great daytime strain for when you want relief but don&#39;t want exceptional hypnotic effects.

VGet out your good headphones, this strain makes music amazing. The smoke has a sweet woody taste, and leaves a sweet aftertaste in your mouth. The high is nothing short of amazing but it can be a bit psychedelic so it&#39;s not good for a working environment. It&#39;s great for being creative at home and makes music absolutely incredible to listen to. I imagine this would be a great strain to smoke at a club, as it also helps with my back pain

VVERY mellow, laid back strain without the couch lock whatsoever. Leaves you feeling like you have 0 problems in the world. Great for depression or anxiety. When you break up the buds you get a very pleasant  smell of honey with a slight bit of peanut. Taste is pretty much the same. I would buy this strain again. Would recommend after a long day at work or if you&#39;re just feeling down.

VWhat a great flower! To this day this is my favorite strain. I&#39;ve only been able to find it once and I am still looking for it. The high was like none other. Immediately I felt the stress and anxiety from my day wash off and it felt as if any tension I was holding in my body had relaxed. I smoked it in a hot tub and afterwards meditated for a long while with incredible bodily sensations. I believe that this is a perfect example of how a hybrid strain can be incredible with the combination of mind and body giving you a feeling of intense and euphoric connection. Do not pass this strain up. Its effects as a whole took me to a more psychedelic space than any other strain. It is a one hit wonder and can have profound beneficial effects.

VForm: Shatter\u000aTHC: ~70%\u000aTaste 5/5 HONEY!! Really does taste like honey on the exhale along with earthy undertones.\u000aHigh: 5/5 PARC Dispensary had this strain mislabeled as indica dominant I saved it for right before bed. It definitely has psychedelic properties. It wasn&#39;t so much hallucinogenic, but that almost mind numbing high? Really great for meditation.

VI&#39;ve only had Nebula once in my life,  in Canada. Me and a friend smoked it all week long and never in our lives had either of us stayed that high, not even in high school.  It was the strongest high from such a weak smelling plant.  Light spicy honey is the only aroma and a matching flavor.  Was honestly expecting beasters right up until it chinked my already stoned eyes.  You see, me and my friend had never been not high for years.  24/7 tokers.  This is literally the only modern domestic strain I have ever experienced that brought me to another level when I was already on edibles. \u000a\u000aI put the Nebula high above the real OG highs.  And it came from a pack of Paradise seeds.  I would definitely seek out Nebula if you can find a pack of regs.  This shit needs to be bred into something with better flavor and nose. Nebuler OG,  where is you?

VSmell is incredible, was suggested by a local budtender in Kelowna. BC. Very white with crystal, taste is amazing, a little nug goes a long way. I find it can put me in a good relaxed mood, but for me personally I found it gives me paranoia which stems to anxiety, I mix the Nebula with a more mellow classic strain to help take the edge off a bit.

VGot this off my guy a couple weeks before christmas. Smelt very potent even outside of the bag. Rolled up a J with probably a bit too much in. Half an hour later I was shivering on my bed in the fetal position having a panic attack. My heart was racing like a lab rat. Was quite blown away by it&#39;s strength and managed to calm myself down a little bit but had some very dark and depressing thoughts running through my mind. About an hour later, I still felt high but felt much better. I initially thought that this was a sativa strain as I&#39;d never felt like this before and I&#39;d heard horror stories of getting high when hungry; which is something I like to with indicas so I can demolish some munchies but even eating before hand hasn&#39;t helped. This is not a bash at weed guys, I&#39;ve been smoking a long time but this strain made me want to quit. Smoked some later with a lot less weed and the effects were the same just not as amplified and nowhere near as bad. I bought a 20 bag literally 2 weeks before christmas and I still have 2 joints worth left and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll smoke it.

VI had a very well grown bud of this heavy little Bastard. After a little tolerance break i decided to smoke a little bowl. I immediatly felt that it overwhelmed me and I had to sit down for a Moment, but the sitting felt very uncomfortable. Two friends of mine who didn&#39;t quit smoking for a while had a very nice uplifting high so I guess it was just because of my Lack of tolerance I&#39;m going to try the same buds again in a week or two when my tolerance has increased a bit.

VThis strain is chill as f***. My housemate who also smoked it with me, has decided she is a weed connoisseur after smoking this strain. It hits as heavy as an indica, but your head stays clear throughout. Everything is just a lot more confusing and a lot more fun. As my housemate says : &quot;I can do a lot of tasks, but the tasks make no f***ing sense.&quot; 10/10, one of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked yet.

VSmell is incredible, was suggested by a local budtender in Kelowna. BC. Very white with crystal, taste is amazing, a little nug goes a long way. I find it can put me in a good relaxed mood, but for me personally I found it gives me paranoia which stems to anxiety, I mix the Nebula with a more mellow classic strain to help take the edge off a bit.

I was up and walking around talking to my friends who had popped by. \u000a\u000aHelps listening and being attentive while gracefully high \u000a\u000aNext day, got up early after about 6 hours of sleep and was clear headed with next to no left over buzz.\u000a\u000aWas overall  happy with this strain called Nebula.

VGot this off my guy a couple weeks before christmas. Smelt very potent even outside of the bag. Rolled up a J with probably a bit too much in. Half an hour later I was shivering on my bed in the fetal position having a panic attack. My heart was racing like a lab rat. Was quite blown away by it&#39;s strength and managed to calm myself down a little bit but had some very dark and depressing thoughts running through my mind. About an hour later, I still felt high but felt much better. I initially thought that this was a sativa strain as I&#39;d never felt like this before and I&#39;d heard horror stories of getting high when hungry; which is something I like to with indicas so I can demolish some munchies but even eating before hand hasn&#39;t helped. This is not a bash at weed guys, I&#39;ve been smoking a long time but this strain made me want to quit. Smoked some later with a lot less weed and the effects were the same just not as amplified and nowhere near as bad. I bought a 20 bag literally 2 weeks before christmas and I still have 2 joints worth left and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll smoke it.

VTHIS STRAIN WAS F****** CRAZY \u000ai have never had a strain of weed make me feel like this has I went bowling after I smoked it and all the lights and sounds were so crazy and intense I felt like I was on some psychedelics it was one of the weirdest/best highs I&#39;ve ever had.. only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I also had the worst and most uncomfortable cotton mouth of my life &#128514;&#128557; but greatness come with a price I guess lmao\u000aNot a good strain if you have a low tolerance or are just beginning smoking\u000aThis review also took me a good 20 minutes to type out because I am still baked 3 hours later &#128566;

VOne of my favorites, near the top. Used to grow this small little precious sativa hybrid, the high it produced was amazing, very psychedelic, trippy, gets you out there and high, creative and thinking about things, with an excitement and energy to move.\u000a\u000aGave one of the bud heads to my friend, like a 5g piece, his girlfriend made edibles out of that and afterwards she proclaimed the experience to be the strongest experience she had have with cannabis :)

This is also the first strain I have used that covered all my complaints. Finally, after 30 years of constant pain, I finally slept one whole night free from pain. Would definitely like to see this strain more widely available.

Vgrabbed a 1/4 of this from my caregiver, and was sold just by looking at it inside the bag.  Back to aka Starcloud, my buds surely came out and represented characteristics of the strain itself.  Not only was the bud visually stunning, but the smell n taste were right on also.  Very unique smell n taste for bud, but good, like sweet honeyed fruit with some stank on it.  It was also very smooth smoke n the taste rly comes thru n stays on exhale.  One, rly unique item to mention is the effects, they come on basically instantly, right after u blow out first rip.  In addition it&#39;s a very &quot;feel good&quot; high that the indica and sativa (50/50 hybrid) aspects r vry well balanced.  For me it&#39;s important to have at least a half indica influence, well Nebula cuts thru in a clean way n even picks u up a bit.  Making it a great daytime smoke or if u need to do something it won&#39;t bog u down.  Def. on my top #10 strain list now, not to mention the buds I got were just dusted with resin.  Early Xmas present to myself :)

VReal strong strain, good for a late night smoke. Doesn&#39;t send you to sleep straight away but helps you drift off very easily a bit later. Before that it sends you to space (which explains the name) it made thinking clearly a bit more difficult but I often expect that with stronger strains. Decent strain, will definitely buy again.

VDefinitely a fun little hybrid we&#39;ve got here. Was lucky enough to have a dispensary carry this and decided to try it out after eyeballing it. Bright green nugs with an extremely pleasant and sweet smell. One of the best smelling dank. Hard to tell exactly what the sweet profiles are but definitely along the lines of flowers and honey. Provided me with sativa-dominant buzz. Great mood lifter and I&#39;d recommend this to anyone dealing with anxiety, stress, or depression. Strong heady high that will keep your mind tingling for a few hours. Music was AMAZING in combination with Nebula, and probably the biggest bonus with this strain is the free-flowing creativity it provides. Lovely find !\u000a\u000aLook: 5/5\u000aScent: 5/5 (sweet)\u000aHigh: 5/5\u000aBurning out: 5/5\u000aOverall: 5/5

VI&#39;ve only had Nebula once in my life,  in Canada. Me and a friend smoked it all week long and never in our lives had either of us stayed that high, not even in high school.  It was the strongest high from such a weak smelling plant.  Light spicy honey is the only aroma and a matching flavor.  Was honestly expecting beasters right up until it chinked my already stoned eyes.  You see, me and my friend had never been not high for years.  24/7 tokers.  This is literally the only modern domestic strain I have ever experienced that brought me to another level when I was already on edibles. \u000a\u000aI put the Nebula high above the real OG highs.  And it came from a pack of Paradise seeds.  I would definitely seek out Nebula if you can find a pack of regs.  This shit needs to be bred into something with better flavor and nose. Nebuler OG,  where is you?

But i wasent feeling much so i was like fuck it I&#39;ll finish he whole thing.... well i was alright and felt okay still nothing! Then BAAM! I went for a walk and the high smacked the shit outta me! I was so fucking high! And it was heady as shit! But i felt it in my body too. As the high went on my heart was pounding! And i started getting so much anxiety and slight paranoia . But ik if i would have just waited for the high instead of smoking more it would have been more enjoyable . Id say id smoke it again but this time gradually.  I see why its called nebula

VThis is an excellent strain for a dreamy, thoughtful, and pleasantly uplifting experience. No paranoia or cognitive impairment, just a mentally-active and physically pleasant buzz. Ideal for a solitary afternoon doing chores, reading, walking the dog, doing cardio on the treadmill. I haven&#39;t been around people while on Nebula, but I think it might be a good social enhancer, too. If you want a pleasant uplift without couch lock sedation and paranoia, this is an excellent choice.

V[edible review] ~ 0.2gm/brownie\u000aSWIM ate a brownie and within 30 minutes began to feel relaxed (anti-stress). Music sounds amazing with this strain! SWIM just kept headphones on. Listen to electronic, Erykah Baduh, w.e. you want. It&#39;s absolutely beautiful. SWIM typically ends up playing Zombies and let me tell you, it&#39;s a trip, 4x more difficult but the experience is awesome! SWIM has also taken some pictures while using this medicine and the creativity is great. Very spiritual high. Could probably enjoy going to church or meditating with this as you can feel very introspective. Amazing strain but SWIM likes something a bit more euphoric and giggly. SWIM recommends a long night with your significant other when enjoying this strain.

VI&#39;m a newbie to all this so based on research and speaking to some experienced users, it was suggested that I start my weed journey with strains that have an equal or higher concentration of CBD to THC in them. So, I bought the Nebula-2 (not listed here) and my results were nada. This did absolutely nothing for me. So maybe I was a little too cautious with my strain selection. And I also think that maybe, the fact that I&#39;ve taken some strong pain meds for extended periods of time, I underestimated my bodies potential tolerance to a higher THC concentration strain. Whatever the case, I&#39;m going to be buying one with a much smaller CBD concentration to see the effects. Hopefully, this review was helpful to someone out there.

I find this strain very calming and euphoric - it gives a new dimension to music! \u000a\u000aMild body high, relaxation of muscles. No dizziness, just a mellow creep-in-slowly blanket of happy descending on your mind. \u000a\u000aPuts me in a creative mood for deep thoughts and deep reading. Doesn&#39;t addle my mind too much while reducing anxiety and stress - which I love. \u000a\u000aDefinitely good day time, or after work medicine.
