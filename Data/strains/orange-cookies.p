VI picked up some of this today and wasn&#39;t really sure what to expect. As I get home I crack open the bag it was sealed in and the sweet and pungent smell of fresh oranges and dank fill the room. So naturally I sit down, pack a bowl and smoke. It really is a relaxing high, it snowballs so you can&#39;t really feel it with the first few hits but before you know it you&#39;re sitting there pain-free, happy as can be. I didn&#39;t notice the body effects because of how relaxed I was but once I got up I felt like a limp dick trying to walk. Aside from all this it did not make me sleepy, just extremely relaxed. There wasn&#39;t any mind-fog either, I was able to focus on tasks quite well.\u000a\u000aAll in all: 10/10 would smoke again.

VFirst time trying his strain. It is a really great strain to unwind with, def give me an indica sleepy effect. The buds were bright light green with highs of purple running thru it as it was caked it trichomes and you could see the Orange Juice/California Orange genetics. It smells like orange peels and smokes great.

VThis strain is grown pretty exclusivley  at TLC Collective, and to correct the description, their orange cookies is Orange Juice x Forum Cookies. This strain is PHENOMENAL. Nothing short of exeptional. This is everyhthing a strain of marijuana should be. Immense beauty of the flowers with a light green, orange and slight hints of purple, to the best aroma I&#39;ve ever encountered from the cannabis plant. Pure tangerine cream. To tie it all together, its incredible mind blasting sativa will have you ready to face any challenge life could throw at you - hey you&#39;ll be stoned none the less. :) I wake up every morning to Orange Cookies.

VI am more of an indica smoker but I tried Orange Cookies (a hybrid leaning to the sativa side) because everyone at work said how great it was.  Well, I was not disappointed at all!  The sativa high crept up on me within 15 minutes of smoking and I felt great. High, senses lit up, and brain and body in a good place.  I felt high without any anxiousness, energized without being hyper.  Soon the Orange Cookie took me to its indica side where the energy was replaced by contentment and an easy feeling of relaxation yet still buzzing.  I loved the way the Orange Cookies showed both sides of its hybrid, starting out sativa and evolving into its indica mode.  I highly recommend this bud to all the buds reading this.

VWow... One of the tastiest strains I&#39;ve ever puffed. Nice smooth smoke with a surprisingly less pu grant smell when burning than I expected. Beautiful look that breaks apart easily.

VI picked up 7 grams of this stuff and my friend and I rolled a blunt. We hotboxed the car. Orange cookies was delicious and we were high after just a few hits (unusual). I pulled out a bag of animal crackers and we went to town on them. We also talked about some really amazing conspiracy theories. I really had a great high from smoking orange cookies. My friend J and I had an animal fight night with the animal crackers. We\u2019re really vibing. Definitely recommend. Don\u2019t miss out on this one. \u000a\u000aI second that -J

VMy friend from CA turned me on to this when I was looking for something different from my &#39;usual&#39; Jack Herer. Although I&#39;ve smoked weed for 45  years, I look for strains that help with pain due to an injury as an Ironworker 8 years ago when a 35# slab fell on my head. With 24/7 headaches, neck and back pain, and a banged up shoulder, on top of all the other injuries acquired over 35 years, it&#39;s either Norco&#39;s 3 times a day, or cannabis. When my headaches start to come on, one or two mini one hitters stop it before it gets going. (My friends laugh at my miniscule mini bat, which is a third less capacity than theirs. &quot;I&#39;m a cheap date!&quot; I say. Anyway, I&#39;m glad HN suggested (with a free sample, no less) this strain. I was asking for some Trainwreck because I wanted something that I could still function on all day with no couch lock or mandatory mid day naps, and the Orange Cookies fit the bill. I&#39;m basically a geezer from the 70&#39;s who, until the last year or so, just depended on whatever came down the road to the Ozarks where I live. I can&#39;t keep up with all the new strains, but thankfully my bud growing bud out in SF can. Great stuff for chronic pain and headache, and it tastes good, too! Thanks, Hanh!!

VI&#39;ve had Orange Cookies Nug Run Shatter, Sauce, and Sugar by Paper Planes Extracts. All had fantastic and very full terp profiles. The flavor is similar to biting into a fresh orange. Most of the &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Citrus&quot;\u000a, and &quot;Tangie&quot; stuff on the market tastes like how an Orange peel smells, not the fruit inside. Orange Cookies tastes like the fruit itself, very sweet, not overpungent, and smooth. It is delicious.

VGot an 1/8th from TLC few days ago.  I love TLC flowers because they are cured perfectly and you never get popcorn nugs.  The strain itself smells like orange/tangerine citrus but it wasn&#39;t as pungent as I thought it would be.  As for the high it self it hits pretty good.  A little cerebral but doesn&#39;t give you anxiety for the most part.  Wait about 30 minutes then the indica side kicks in but you don&#39;t get tired.  It&#39;s a strain I can keep smoking during the day and early evening which I like.  All in all it&#39;s a great strain I would recommend you try at least once.

VEasy going buzz that is very light.  It is a little awkward in that there is not a whole lot of medicinal value aside from a slight mood change.  Did not make me sleepy nor give a jolt to my energy level.  There was a nice light numb feeling in the back of my neck and head for a half hour.  So maybe mild short lived pain relief or mood stabilizer, no munchies, functional, short lived.\u000a\u000aThe taste was something to note being of bergamot, but not so strong.  My opinion is that there are way better orange strains out there like Orange Velveteen, Agent Orange, or Jack the Ripper.  All of those strains have distinctly bold orange flavors all with different flavor notes whereas Orange Cookies makes no genuine character. So as with any other strain given a &quot;blah&quot; c- or below rating I will def try Orange Cookies again if we cross paths &amp; meet each others economic level.  It is ok.

VSo sweet &amp; tasty, it&#39;s a perfect strain! Very nice body euphoria is felt, yet with a very clean head. Walking can be a challenge right after you consume, but that quickly fades and you&#39;re left comfortably buzzed for 3-4 hours. Promotes a healthy appetite, and while you&#39;re eating your mind will be in a creative thought process.\u000a\u000aOne of the top strains of 16/17.

V\u000aOrange soda is what my first thoughts when I think of think strain. Let me first say that I&#39;m not the biggest fan of GSC strains, but I actually really enjoyed this strain. The flowers were compact frosty light green, coated with deep orange calyxes. The smell is skunky, a sweet citrus, with a bit of nice floral aroma. The flavor is what really appealed to me with this strain. It tastes very much like skunky orange soda. Tastes really awesome in a joint. The effects were pretty instant and powerful. Extremely relaxing and euphoric. Really spacey and a little foggy if overindulged. Pain relief was nice with this strain.

VAs soon as I took the first hit *BAM* delicious orangey terps, after the initial orangeyness I can still taste an orange cream soda sorta taste- even after about 30 mins after I smoked! This strain definitely has a hybrid-y feel too it, while I felt a lot of relaxation and sedation, my mind was so clear, alert and crisp it kept me awake, focused, but still very relaxed helped my pain a good amount, migraine GONE, no anxiety either. I urge you guys to try this strain! It&#39;s delicious and effective. In my opinion perfectly crafted.

VThis strain is super easy to vape because it&#39;s so light in texture and flavor. It made me feel super happy and relaxed at the same time. I listened to classical music on this strain as well and got some amazing visuals. Definitely gonna make this my go-to strain from now on.

VThis is by far my favorite strain I\u2019ve ever tried. I love waking and baking with Orange Cookies because it gives me a really great energy boost, and I feel very patient, and talkative/social which helps start my day off right and keep up with my kids. I deal with anxiety and depression and this strain seems to mellow both of those extremes and brings me back into the middle.

VI am more of an indica smoker but I tried Orange Cookies (a hybrid leaning to the sativa side) because everyone at work said how great it was.  Well, I was not disappointed at all!  The sativa high crept up on me within 15 minutes of smoking and I felt great. High, senses lit up, and brain and body in a good place.  I felt high without any anxiousness, energized without being hyper.  Soon the Orange Cookie took me to its indica side where the energy was replaced by contentment and an easy feeling of relaxation yet still buzzing.  I loved the way the Orange Cookies showed both sides of its hybrid, starting out sativa and evolving into its indica mode.  I highly recommend this bud to all the buds reading this.

I had a strain cultivated by &quot;Jungle Boys&quot; http://www.thejungleboys.com/\u000a\u000aThe smell is amazing. Sweet and super citrusy. Taste just like it smells. Earthy and slighty diesly on the inhale, and you get all the orange on the exhale. \u000a\u000aThe high is a creative and uplifted. It crafted this review.

VIt&#39;s pretty darn good. Nothing at all compared to &quot;Thin Mint..&quot; But you do get a strong taste of Orange/Tangerine, and you feel the indica high instantly. Perfect for tasty spliffs or just an evening smoke. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f

VDense, orange smelling rock hard buds. The scent of this strain is pretty awesome if you&#39;re into citrusy fruity strains. The taste on this particular cut was slightly lack luster compared to its aroma. The high comes on strong and the dips into a pretty Stoney, sleepy couch lock. \u000a\u000aDef not my fav, but good bud none the less.

VI took a half gram dab of orange cookies after a 4 week tolerance break, and I felt as if I was actually tripping on acid.  There was waves going outwards through my body starting in my heart, my vision was distorted for 45 minutes, I felt like I was going to pass out for the first hour (never actually did).  But definitely 2 star don&#39;t recommend to a beginner, if you are experienced maybe you would enjoy it more but that was tooo much
