VOriginally picked this up to deal with my daily headaches, and while it did not help me in that area, it did take my mind off of it enough to help me sleep. A little of this and I got drowsy and wanted my bed, but a little more and I started thinking deeply about human consciousness. Pretty good bud nonetheless

VDefinitely a new found favorite, don&#39;t actually see &quot;the purple&quot; but dispensaries don&#39;t lie. (Do they?) You&#39;ll know when you&#39;ve smoked this strain the first hit you take,  not saying you&#39;re going to get stoned but definitely changes your head w/1 bong hit, nice body Buzz to go with it and long-lasting.

VGrowed it outdoor, one of the plant&#39;s leaves went all purple but the buds stayed greens. Highly resinous strain, it has a strong pine wood taste. Stoning effect, perfect for bedtime.

VBig fan of this. After the first hit you get a jolt of energy then your body starts to really get relaxed, but your mind stays active.

VFirst of all, it doesn&#39;t turn purple at all with my 6 pots. This is very sad. Growing is very easy, cloning  is easy too. Yield is good enough. Smell and taste is nice deep aroma.Effect is indica one. No head high and heavy body buzz.,which I don&#39;t like so much. It is good for couch locking and sleep.

VIt&#39;s easy to grow. Flowering took 62 days from switching to 12/12. It wasn&#39;t purple, but I had the temperature above 23C\u2070 The smell during flowering wasn&#39;t hard. \u000aDefinitely It needs curing after harvest. The vape smells and tastes very good, but I expected a bit more from the effect.
