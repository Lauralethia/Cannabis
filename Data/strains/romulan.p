VLOVE!!!!!! It&#39;s a great indica. Helps me sleep, relieves my pain and gives me an appetite. I use this along with their Rick Simpson Oil to treat severe muscle spasms and nerve pain from MS, RA and brain disorder, epilepsy. I feel better than ever! I&#39;m able to get out and enjoy life again. :) Oregon Medigreen has me feeling great!

VThis is hands down my favorite indica strain at the moment. I&#39;ve had multiple examples from different growers and they have all been exceptional. Aroma has varied from cherry candy to concord grapes. Definitely some amber notes too. Once smoked, the flavor always leans cherry candy for me. Normally I&#39;m more into hashy, dieselly, cheesey smelling strains, but Romulan pushed me out of my normal pattern. For me, the high reminds me of Jager, another indica with a heavy narcotic-like body high, except while Jager can force sleep on you, Romulan will facilitate sleep IF you want it.  I&#39;ve smoked Romulan mid day and Ben fully capable of detailed work like soldering. Great for pain and stress. I usually lean towards 50/50 and sativa dom hybrids, but I always like to keep Romulan around as my indica option.

VReal Romulan is an incredible strain, if you can find it! Here&#39;s how you can tell- The Taste : very piney/lime(NOT LEMON,) skunky, with a very distinct  GRAPE WINE aftertaste on exhale. If you don&#39;t taste all of these things - it is not real Romulan.  The  high is both cerebral and body at the same time, with a calming effect of no other strain except Columbian Gold. This is in fact due to the actual COLUMBIAN GOLD genitcss  dominating this incredible Indica . The other genetics are Northern California Blue, bred in at much lower level through back crossing. The result is the NEAR PERfECT Columbian Gold having the Indica effects , and light grape taste (lime x  blueberry = grape wine) it  was made for! A perfect strain, but may be to strong for some.  It will make you forget where you are if too much is  taken. Also, the real cut was from Joe ( and his buddies ( at Sacred Seeds- circa 1976)) and has made its way around , but is very, very hard to find. ( I indicated exactly how you will know by taste)  The cut from the Canadian seed banks had been ruined and crossed . Not real Romulan any more - like so many other original strains that have been ruined for mass production. Many people in Ca, Az, and Vancouver Island still have Joe&#39;s cut. Real Romulan is still out there and is a revered strain among true connoseuars and Old Schooler&#39;s who know what the real deal is/WAS. BTW- IT IS IN NO WAY a descendant of White Rino or any other strain-except forementioned here- Guranteed .

VThis is some pretty good weed. It begins by existing in fucking beautiful little frosted nuggets that smell absolutely delightful. They smoke extremely well and taste wonderful. It hits really hard, but it&#39;s not at all of a debilitating high. You&#39;ll feel curious and as if things are breathing at you. Taking a walk is orgasmic. This is also perfect for a pre-sleep toke. If you lay down you&#39;ll slip into comfort heaven. This is a strain you&#39;ll be excited all day to smoke. And it has a badass name. What a trip this shit gives you.

Vromulan is without a doubt my favorite indica I have picked up, if not my favorite strain of any bud ever. this stuff relieves my back and neck pain, relieves my anxiety and stress, and knocks me out into the best sleep I&#39;ve ever gotten. it is definitely a crazy body high - first few times I smoked it I was thinking maybe it wasn&#39;t as strong as these reviews lead on, but a couple bowls in and I tried to move and just went &quot;oh shit&quot;. puts you in a very, very comfortable couch locked state without a cloudy head high, almost feels like you aren&#39;t stoned at all besides sleepiness and your heavy body. I love it. and it tastes like the forest, pine/woodsy with a bit of lemon or something in there. overall an incredible experience and this bud will always stay stocked in my house.

VI simply can&#39;t express how much this strain helped me. While filling my bowl I was suffering from some severe shoulder pain that was stressing me out and in turn creating a fair amount of insomnia but this beauty melted it all away.  The high came on surprisingly quickly and conitued to rise for around half an hour before sedating me and leaving my mind in a blissful, although forgetful, state.  Romulan has become one of my favorite strains and would recommend it highly.

VThis was the most intense high I&#39;ve ever experienced. I smoked two big bowls and I was in another dimension. I was so spaced out I didn&#39;t even know where I was (I was on my couch in my apartment playing Gears of War 3 with a friend). It has a great smell to it, piney, yet sweet. The smoke isn&#39;t pungent, and the smell goes away pretty quickly. As my high progressed, I noticed I was able to focus very intensely for 5-10 seconds at a time in between my insane euphoria. That was something I might not have noticed if I wasn&#39;t playing video games. One of the best highs I&#39;ve ever had, but wouldn&#39;t recommend it unless you don&#39;t have anything to do. It&#39;s not an uplifting high by any means, at least for me. Great smoke with friends, playing video games, or just chillin.

VThe flavor profile for this strain is spot-on! The moment you inhale, a rush of earthy pine pleasantly surprises the taste buds, and the moment you exhale, a woody, almost campfire-smelling, aroma engulfs the senses. As for Romulan&#39;s effect, it&#39;s very mellow, very relaxing, very calming. Great for anxiety, stress, muscle pain, and insomnia. Along with Afgooey, this is one of my all-time favorite strains. Perfect for winding down after a long day. Highly recommend Platinum Romulan if you can find it.

VThis is sure to live up to its name. As described above for Romulan, this turns out to weigh heavier per nug for a given reason. More dense, compacted and sure to attract the naked eye. This strain provides the couch kickoff several hours even if you do decided to move and run errands. This still needs up giving you the true feeling of indica rather than sativa.

VComes on like a sledgehammer to the head. Big, weighty physical feeling around the head. Vision is nicely brightened with good vibrancy and wide focus - almost like looking through a wide-angled lens. Headspace is focused and energized. There\u2019s a clarity, ability to function, and think clearly simultaneous to a somewhat tamped down mental capacity. You feel minorly lobotomized, but the serene, happy mood and pleasurably relaxed body doesn\u2019t make you really mind. It feels a bit like a ride; fun and carefree - but cushioned. Music slips in and resides in you, making you feel so in tune, it\u2019s as though you\u2019re playing the instrument. Experiencing it feels like mom\u2019s cooking - so good you just want to sleep in it. Nice degrees of euphoria keeps everything rosy and feeling good. Watching stuff is just as thrilling. Easy to follow, even fast paced, but a short enough attention span keeps everything enthralling. Reminds me of SFV OG in a similarly cozy, gone way. The peak of the high feels surprisingly short, but that&#39;s likely more to do with how old my herb was.

VI have never had better pain control than this strain, including opioids, in the five years I&#39;ve dealt with endometriosis. It felt like my abdomen finally unclenched and was receiving a massage from the inside. I&#39;ve used it every night for a week and had zero pain all week, and I&#39;ve NEVER gone that long without pain. The pain control extends into the following day which is so hard to find. Left a very clear head with no paranoia, and helped with sleep without being sedative or causing couch-lock. Makes me loosen up, chatty and creative. Might actually be able to wean off the narcotics! Highly recommend.

Vthis is one of the main medical cannabis strains. An easy relaxing smoke thats highly sedating physicaly, and relaxing mentaly. great for muscle aches and pains, end of an overly strenuous physicaly active day to help relax the muscles, mind, and heart. Has effects similar to that of muscle relaxers, pain killers, NSAIDS, anxiolytic and anti-nausea meds, only much safer and can have all these effects with 1 medication

VOne of the best knock-out sleep strains possible. The taste is something of pine and is very pungent,  and even after 2 hits you&#39;ll be wanting to sleep your life away. Absolutely beautiful strain, partial and light sativa effects with an indica punch.

VMy reviews are based on how the strain interact with my PTSD for medical marijuana patients with PTSD all of my reviews are based off my! Experiences with that strain to treat my PTSD episodes. But! What works for me might not work for you then again it might. \u000a* This strain is a heavy hitter. I do not recommend it if your having an intense mental break down due to your PTSD. This will make your extremely over think. Which might throw you into paranoid realm. It will eventually melt away to an extreme body melt only if you can navigate the head high. \u000a\u000a*Please only use this strain if your a seasoned user that can navigate this complex high. \u000a\u000aAs for your PTSD and this strain it&#39;s a handle with care strain. You must be able to navigate an extreme head high. If you PTSD has you stuck mentally then this is a great strain to unstick your mind because you&#39;ll be able to slowly analyze what has you stuck.

VGreat strain for knocking out social anxiety and a good relaxing strain that soothes the mind so much I can\u2019t remember how my body felt. Mind over matter all day. The taste and aroma is bland like faint tobacco and a hint of berries. The effects are valued over aesthetics. Variations I prefer over plain Jane rom is x with the white or purple Kush.\u000a\u000aI may not get again because of better cultivars being more effective and tasty.

VIn honor of Spacex /Elon Musk and their recent groundbreaking success, tonight&#39;s &quot;nightcap&quot; is Romlan.  \u000a\u000aI found this strain to be incompatible with vertically.  Upon laying down, it&#39;s other effects become apparent, with the \u000a\u000a\u2022 1st and most significant being a leaden feeling in my body and concrete in my frontal lobe, between the 3rd eye and the bridge of the nose.  \u000a\u000a\u2022 2nd effect worthy of note was pleasantly tingling upper body.  \u000a\u000a\u2022 3rd, relaxed muscles and an absence of pain throughout the body.  Kinda balances out the concrete frontal lobe. \u000a\u000a\u2022 4th, thinking and typing one&#39;s phone is doable.  LOL, with great power comes great responsibility.  Let&#39;s not use this ability to drunk-text your ex, mkay?  \u000a\u000a\u2022 5th, and maybe last, is that tangential thought was amusing.

VI honestly really enjoyed this, most of the time I prefer strains with high euphoria and I prefer mind highs more than body highs, but this strain surprised me. Although I didn\u2019t get a lot of mind effects (Like I was able to act normal and speak normally), I felt SUPER relaxed and like if my whole body was being massaged constantly, not to mention how it also made me sleep like a baby haha. Would definitely recommend if you have sleep problems or any physical pain (I felt sick and had a headache, but it went away). Another thing is I didn\u2019t feel any paranoia or bad trip at all, would recommend for beginners too. I wouldn\u2019t recommend smoking a lot of this if you plan on doing something important or productive (Like going to school or your job) because when I took a lot I was almost stuck to my chair and just couldn\u2019t move, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have plans that day.

Definitely some Sativa-like head effects with this strain, paired well with a nice relaxing Indica body warming buzz. Feeling euphoric, happy, relaxed and oh so smooth in it&#39;s delivery. A great strain for beginners. Follows the laws of motion, so if you are up and about it wont slow you down but if you wanna chill out on the couch or hit the sack it will compliment nicely.

VI really like Romulan. It&#39;s not too strong THC-wise and seems to have a very nice balance of effects that do not overwhelm. Definitely some Sativa-like head effects with this strain, paired well with a nice relaxing Indica body warming buzz. Feeling euphoric, happy, relaxed and oh so smooth in it&#39;s delivery. A great strain for beginners. Follows the laws of motion, so if you are up and about it wont slow you down but if you wanna chill out on the couch or hit the sack it will compliment nicely.

VI think this strain is what I&#39;ve needed all these years that I&#39;ve  suffered from insomnia. I have never felt more powerless than I did when I smoked Romulan for the 1st time. It put me to sleep immediately at every red light and stop sign. Once i used it before bed time and it was a fight to get a bowl of cereal because u was so dam sleepy from that indica side. It is all that they said it is and more I&#39;d recommend to any patient

Not too surprisingly, it did nothing for my pain since there is virtually no CBD in this strain.  The next time I used this, I mixed it with some Cannatonic.  Got great stress and pain relief from that combo.   Used alone, it hits hard and fast. Super cotton mouth!  Best to start out small if you are a low tolerance user.

VBlessed be the weed, in which goes by the name Romulan. It kisses my forehead,  as I slowly weep beside the bag of glorious green buds. As one last tear trickles down my cheek, I slowly open the bag and my lungs are inihilated by the orgasmic sensation leaving the bag and penetrating my nostrils.  I lay awake, long sleepless nights, thinking about my beautiful Romulan when i am not in its presence. But for now, I am not lonely, as I get to be with my one and only; Romulan Bud.

VI really like Romulan. It&#39;s not too strong THC-wise and seems to have a very nice balance of effects that do not overwhelm. Definitely some Sativa-like head effects with this strain, paired well with a nice relaxing Indica body warming buzz. Feeling euphoric, happy, relaxed and oh so smooth in it&#39;s delivery. A great strain for beginners. Follows the laws of motion, so if you are up and about it wont slow you down but if you wanna chill out on the couch or hit the sack it will compliment nicely.

VBlessed be the weed, in which goes by the name Romulan. It kisses my forehead,  as I slowly weep beside the bag of glorious green buds. As one last tear trickles down my cheek, I slowly open the bag and my lungs are inihilated by the orgasmic sensation leaving the bag and penetrating my nostrils.  I lay awake, long sleepless nights, thinking about my beautiful Romulan when i am not in its presence. But for now, I am not lonely, as I get to be with my one and only; Romulan Bud.

It\u2019s a heavy potent high that would be difficult for newbie\u2019s to hang with. It will make you lazy as hell and a bit sleepy.

VProbably the best strain I&#39;ve had so far for an incredibly pleasurable feeling.  I used it to try to get to sleep and help with chronic shoulder pain but the feeling was so intensely great that I ended up staying awake for over an hour while I just laid there and enjoyed the wonderful feelings.  Not too surprisingly, it did nothing for my pain since there is virtually no CBD in this strain.  The next time I used this, I mixed it with some Cannatonic.  Got great stress and pain relief from that combo.   Used alone, it hits hard and fast. Super cotton mouth!  Best to start out small if you are a low tolerance user.

VRomulan is a great stress reliever.  It also helps with my inflammation and has a woodsy smell and taste to it.  Skunky in the beginning but as the flowers dry the THC content goes through the roof.  Best to use this at night because you won&#39;t be able to move around too much after smoking this.  It works for my nerve issues and my insomnia.

VHave this in an 80% vape. \u000a\u000aThe effects are very smooth and glossy, you\u2019re head will be sent into a gyroscopic utopia of creativity but you\u2019ll be likely doing that from a couch in the first hour. Goodbye headaches and it\u2019ll nicely steady you on for the night from a bad day. \u000a\u000aAwesome for musicians and artists, you\u2019ll wanna jam or paint.\u000a\u000aI tend to combine 1-2 draws of rom, then have a draw or two of granddaddy purple from an 86% vape... That\u2019s an interesting result- try it if you can. \u000a\u000a...also blends nicely with high cbd harlequin and blue dream

VRomulan is a pretty awesome strain from what I can tell. I&#39;m taking some pretty heavy dabs of it at the moment and its leading me into some deep cerebral insight, but i&#39;m not exactly too concerned about remembering all of it. Hahaha. I keep finding myself going on tangents and long stories.. both online, and in person right here in this moment. So many memories to share. We&#39;ve all got so much information we are so enthusiastic to share with each other and synchronize our experience ..data! HUMANS DEMAND COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUS! IT SEEMS WE MAY ALL WANT A DEEP ONENESS. TO STRIVE TO BECOME GODS OF OUR OWN CHOOSING! AND Wow. We nearly had a fire within the last 5 minutes. But we handled it quickly without hesitation. So moving on.. this is a seemingly sleepy, spacey, dreamy kind of stoned where im thinking i&#39;m heading to bed in not much longer. I dont think its a true indica, but maybe some conglomeration of sativas that were bred to act like indicas... hahaha, GIGA IS DROPPIN OUT.

Vsuper dense nugs with tinges of purple. tested at only 12% thc, this is the strongest weed I&#39;ve ever smoked that is this &quot;weak&quot;, and is thus a perfect example of the fact that there is a whole wider range of things that get you high other than the cannabanoid content. got me super stoned and relaxed, definitely a very mellow strain, but with a head high that I can only describe as spacy, you will indeed be in the stars with the Romulan if you decide to smoke this strain.

VRomulan is a really good choice for this looking for pain relief.  It didn&#39;t do much for my mood or it would have been rated a five, but my pain and muscle spasms were gone with this, making it worth buying - if you can ever find it.  It&#39;s extremely hard to get, though there are quite a few Romulan cross strains out there, they aren&#39;t the same.  If you ever come across some, it&#39;s more than worth trying!

VI picked up some Romulan for by birthday. I thought it&#39;d help me get some sleep but it didn&#39;t induce me into slumber right away. It helped me feel relaxed and the sativa effects were noticeable, too. It&#39;s a good herb to wind down on the couch after a long day, treating PTSD symptoms and the pains after having a good work out at the gym.  I&#39;d smoke the heavier indica strains, preferably LA Confidential or OG Kush, to knock myself out quicker.  Romulan is tasty and beautiful.  I&#39;d buy it again.

Vthis stuff is like indica for the mind. a stoney and cerebral high. reminds me of like a stonier chemdawg or gorilla glue or some other heavy hitter with cerebral effects. this is truly one of the most stress relieving strains i&#39;ve ever tried. also great for pain relief. made me very very relaxed but not sleepy. really really good stuff.

VI had not tried this strain before but was intrigued by Pot Cargo having a Gold Collection Romulan with 31.9%THC so I ordered it. I think I should have been more skeptical of the potency advertised ad it does not hit like anything close to that so I was not impressed. Having said that, there is no exotic smell or taste but resther earthy and bland. Was a nice relaxing high that melted the pain away but no buzz intensity at all. For the price it\u2019s not worth it but it is good 4/5 strain of the price was right.

VRomulan is certainly an appropriately named strain, considering that it will send you to outer space just like it\u2019s alien namesake. The nugs I acquired of this potent indica were densely packed with beautiful purple hues flecked throughout. Some of them were thoroughly purple, and all were covered in a thick coating of trichomes. Very aesthetically pleasing. Upon smoking, the couchlock creeps up very quickly. The first few hits will leave you feeling relaxed and hazy but still able to move around, albeit slowly. On continuous smoking, I was put in a near comatose state. I had no desire to do anything remotely close to physical activity, instead being satisfied to relax in my chair and have a marathon Mafia 3 session. A great smoke to unwind at the end of a long day, but for me it\u2019s certainly not daytime medication as I wouldn\u2019t get anything done. Overall, I highly recommend Romulan to indica connoisseurs and folks looking for pain relief or appetite stimulation.

Not only did it really even me out if smoked very lightly, and sporadically over the course of a few hours, it helped greatly with my over all anxiety and at higher doses put me right to sleep. A- Top Grade medicinal marijuana. Must Try.

VRomulan makes me feel Vulcan. Okay bad pun. But this stuff is top shelf. My body feels completed weighted down, and warm all over like being in a bathtub but not water. But my mind is noticeably uplifted. It\u2019s fun to dance around, if I ever get up from time to time. I\u2019m euphoric enough to enjoy auditory and visual escapes. Two flower vape bowls btw. So far this is my choice of being a primary indica. Deep body relaxation, inner peace, and much enjoyment with trippy YouTube videos makes for the right kind of indica for me.

VRomulan is one of what I like to call my &quot;buy before I&#39;ll even try&quot; strains because it&#39;s always a good, strong strain. Romulan has a smooth taste that doesn&#39;t go down as hard as it hits you. The high is very mellow; strong, but not debilitating like some BC indicas, rather it gives you a sense of focus and the mindset that you can actually get things done now that you&#39;ve cleared your mind of any negative or excess thoughts. It doesn&#39;t hold a flame close to my province&#39;s Rockstar and Bubba Rockstar/Rockstar Kush/Whatever people are calling it now craze, but it has a 1-up on Rockstar over one thing where Romulan shines: the shatter. No shatter has gotten me as high as Romulan shatter. I don&#39;t even need much to feel anything, it&#39;s very nice to take a dab of Romulan and let your troubles go away. If you&#39;re in British Columbia and you feel like taking a break from Rockstar, this is a great strain to go for too.

VBuds are a kind of dusty green whose color is affected by an abundance of orange hairs.  A generous layer of white blankets the outside, muting the color and giving it that dusty look.  A fairly attractive nug indeed.\u000a\u000aFairly strong earthy scent even before the grind.  Once that happens you are greeted with a very strong, funky, earthy smell with a sweetness to it.  It&#39;s very interesting I think I could spend a week smelling it at different times to pinpoint the scents.\u000a\u000aNice vapor and the flavour is full bodied and almost musty.\u000a\u000aOnly halfway through my usual .2 Volcano  session and I already  feel the indica strongly.  Nice relaxed feeling with some heaviness.  \u000a\u000aThis worked well as an indica, left me relaxed and sleepy.  My desire to eat was there but didn&#39;t go crazy.\u000a\u000aDefinitely try some in the evening if given the chance!\u000a\u000a

VThis is one of the smoothest flowers I have smoked and vaped both.  Flavorful and complex the flavors linger on your tongue quite nicely.  Romulan sure is a tasty strain for sure. For newbies this will hit very hard and relax you on the couch or put you to sleep.  At least that is what I have witnessed from inexperienced users testing this strain out for the first time.  For the more regular users such as myself, It definitely has a heavy cerebral effect that relaxes you, revs your libido, and kind of makes you disappear from the world for an hour or two. The body high is incredible and can almost feel like total body orgasm.  For some this can feel like anxiety instead so be careful. This is a great way to end a long day of stress, or to help battle chronic pain.  My experience is that it was not very effective at relieving headache and pain, which is my primary need, but was very good at taking away nassau and dizziness. Overall this is a very nice strain and definitely worth trying.

VThis was my first strain I tried when I moved out west and all I have to say is the strain is remarkable. The first thing that peaked my interest was the sweet aroma of the bud. Best I&#39;ve ever got the privilege to sniff. When it came time to smoke, you just feel happy having the taste linger on the taste buds prompting you to take toke after toke. Warning though, this is some powerful shit! You start feeling it shooting throughout the body with a pitstop in the head. When I&#39;m happy I freestyle and this strain had my creative juices reaching heights never explored. 2-3 hours in, you succumb to momma indica and go night night with no worries in the world. Everyday is a good day with to romulan. Buy it! \u000a

Has a pine  smell to it when not smoked, and when it is, it has a  slight pine pine taste to it, but it isn&#39;t bad.

VI had not tried this strain before but was intrigued by Pot Cargo having a Gold Collection Romulan with 31.9%THC so I ordered it. I think I should have been more skeptical of the potency advertised ad it does not hit like anything close to that so I was not impressed. Having said that, there is no exotic smell or taste but resther earthy and bland. Was a nice relaxing high that melted the pain away but no buzz intensity at all. For the price it\u2019s not worth it but it is good 4/5 strain of the price was right.

VRomulan is certainly an appropriately named strain, considering that it will send you to outer space just like it\u2019s alien namesake. The nugs I acquired of this potent indica were densely packed with beautiful purple hues flecked throughout. Some of them were thoroughly purple, and all were covered in a thick coating of trichomes. Very aesthetically pleasing. Upon smoking, the couchlock creeps up very quickly. The first few hits will leave you feeling relaxed and hazy but still able to move around, albeit slowly. On continuous smoking, I was put in a near comatose state. I had no desire to do anything remotely close to physical activity, instead being satisfied to relax in my chair and have a marathon Mafia 3 session. A great smoke to unwind at the end of a long day, but for me it\u2019s certainly not daytime medication as I wouldn\u2019t get anything done. Overall, I highly recommend Romulan to indica connoisseurs and folks looking for pain relief or appetite stimulation.

VOh, Romulan. I thought I&#39;d give it 5 stars as soon as I smelled it. Piney passion fruit! I broke it up to vape and my fingers smelled like passion fruit, too. Vaping tasted like flowers! Pleasant head high, good body high, relaxing. But it didn&#39;t do enough for my RLS, hence the 4 stars. I could still feel the signals going to my legs, even though I was couch locked and not moving them, so it was a little maddening. I&#39;m going to give it another try, use a little more, and see if it does the trick. But I definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to sleep.

VRomulan! Yes! This was my shit back in undergrad in the early aughts but until now I haven&#39;t seen it since, and it is every bit as good as I remember. It&#39;s a very pure indica high, but different than the blueberry derivatives I typically roll with. Pretty hard body high for an indica and more clear-headed than you&#39;d think. This particular batch is super fresh and sticky to the point that I couldn&#39;t grind it sufficiently to vaporize, but based on the history it makes more sense to bong rip it anyway. So I guess I can check off this box, now I just need to track down some G-13 and Kryptonite. What to do with my day? Maybe video games? Who cares!

VRomulan makes me feel Vulcan. Okay bad pun. But this stuff is top shelf. My body feels completed weighted down, and warm all over like being in a bathtub but not water. But my mind is noticeably uplifted. It\u2019s fun to dance around, if I ever get up from time to time. I\u2019m euphoric enough to enjoy auditory and visual escapes. Two flower vape bowls btw. So far this is my choice of being a primary indica. Deep body relaxation, inner peace, and much enjoyment with trippy YouTube videos makes for the right kind of indica for me.

VMy experience this week with Romulan suggests it is a pretty pure Indica or close to it. If you have arthritis pain at night, Romulan will take that pain away so you can sleep at long last, and yes...through the night. I\u2019ll definitely be buying more as it out-did the Kush strains I purchased for the same reasons (pain, sleep). I used Romulan immediately before bed so I didn\u2019t experience much of the head high, just a little bit before I fell asleep. My intented use is to get a good night\u2019s sleep due to the pain-killing effects of Romulan. I\u2019m very pleased to find this exceptional strain.

My routine before hitting the hay typically involves taking a couple hits, soaking up in a jetted bathtub followed by slow flow yoga with sweet gentle tunes in the background. Just the thought of it makes me excited for the evening! Really relaxes your mind and muscles, slows down your breathing, your body feels all tingly like your floating through the world. Highly recommend it for a relaxing solo evening and for meditating, top knotch stuff!!

The body high is pretty much an intense sativa headache sensation across entire body=heavy indica stone.  There is also a strong dizzying/warping effect that gets increasingly more powerful the longer you stay still. Equality potent mental effects.   Lasts solid 4 hours, easy to act normal

VBought it for sleep. Too much sativa influence for me to sleep though, too many ideas and thoughts bouncing around to settle my mind. But once I did fall asleep I slept well despite my migraine and nerve pain. To be clear: it didn&#39;t help my headache but I was able to mostly sleep through it. It also makes me laugh SO HARD - more than any other strain has.\u000a\u000aWait for more than 5 minutes before you decide to have more. It creeps up and if you&#39;re trying to sleep and you have too much, your mind may race like mine did. Not in a bad way, just not in a sleepy way! Psychoactive effects included body awareness and increased creative thoughts, a feeling of sinking into my mattress, slight confusion, cozy weightlessness. I wasn&#39;t paranoid (I&#39;m prone to paranoia so this is important) at all and had no negative thoughts. \u000a\u000aWill now use this for TV or movie watching instead of sleep, because everything becomes hilarious.

VThis strain can really drop a bomb on you, so use with caution (or abandon; who am I to judge?) Nice head high with a lingering body feel as well. Felt as if I could still have cohesive thoughts. Good taste from vaporizing; super sticky buds. Good stuff.

VVery good strain of weed.  I heard from someone it&#39;s northern lights x unknown afghan x Thai sativa.  I smoked maybe a 1/5 of a gram and I have this overwhelming euphoric/stoning dizzying sensation, you can definitely feel the sativa and indica combining. Powerful mental mellowing effect that spaces you out a lot.

VI bought a gram of this at Nectar in SE Portland. The nuggs were green with sugary trichomes all over the place. I loved the mellow high from this. Definitely a night time strain for me as I didn\u2019t make it through the movie I was watching, but if I smoke a little less it\u2019s a great strain to just watch Netflix and zone out. It helped with my muscle and nerve pain and absolutely cured my insomnia. I loved this strain.No paranoia for me, and I am prone to anxiety/paranoia when I get a strain that causes rapid heart rate; this caused none of that for me. &#128077;&#127997;

VThis strain was incredibly strong. I went into it thinking that it would be a milder strain from the looks of the bud, but after smoking a full bowl I immediately regretted it. Looking back on the experience, I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had prepared myself ahead of time and been in a better mindset. The look of the bud was great. I can&#39;t really say how it smelled as it was cured with lemon peels, which throws off the natural scent. Overall this was mind-bending, and I will be trying it again.

VI picked up some Romulan for by birthday. I thought it&#39;d help me get some sleep but it didn&#39;t induce me into slumber right away. It helped me feel relaxed and the sativa effects were noticeable, too. It&#39;s a good herb to wind down on the couch after a long day, treating PTSD symptoms and the pains after having a good work out at the gym.  I&#39;d smoke the heavier indica strains, preferably LA Confidential or OG Kush, to knock myself out quicker.  Romulan is tasty and beautiful.  I&#39;d buy it again.

Vsuper dense nugs with tinges of purple. tested at only 12% thc, this is the strongest weed I&#39;ve ever smoked that is this &quot;weak&quot;, and is thus a perfect example of the fact that there is a whole wider range of things that get you high other than the cannabanoid content. got me super stoned and relaxed, definitely a very mellow strain, but with a head high that I can only describe as spacy, you will indeed be in the stars with the Romulan if you decide to smoke this strain.

Vwow...I can&#39;t even tell you how much this has helped me. My bed turns into the most comfortable spot on the planet, when I fist lay down! I just sink in and am SO relaxed. NOTHING is on my mind, I can watch TV and focus on it ( even game of thrones lol) I fall asleep so well and have the most vivid dreams. They are NEVER bad, just super vivid. I wake up feeling well rested and ready for the day. It takes away all my aches and pains and I don&#39;t know how I lived without it before.

VAs a lover and explorer of cannabis, this was just one of those strains I knew I&#39;d love and wanted to try for a long time. As I&#39;m smoking it right now, it&#39;s rep is well deserved. Smoking it tasted like pine with a hint of sweet tar. At first I notice slight cerebral sensations that increase with time. Then...WHAM!, the intense couchlocking body high hit me like I got shot out of a cannon and into my couch. If you&#39;re looking for a solid indica that will plant your ass on the couch for a few hours, try this!

Vromulan is a powerful indica. though it has some headyness like a sativa. tastes of sweet pine, but it&#39;s very subtle. that could be from extraction though. I&#39;m relaxed, but not &quot;couch locked&quot;. though I can&#39;t exactly feel my feet lol.

Neurological, chronic pain, stiff muscles, inflammation, INSOMNIA,  and a vomiting disorder.\u000aA little goes a long way, so it can seem like you need to use more , but, DONT, because it comes on slowly, which IMHO is the best part.\u000aRelax and enjoy this Bright Green plant friend.

VSeriously great strain. It&#39;s definitely an indica strain, but does have a very mild sativa touch to it. I just smoked a little over a bowl in a small pipe and I feel amazing. Music sounds amazing on this strain to me. Eyes a little heavy.

Not exactly a &quot;knock you on your ass&quot; strain but still decent. Didn&#39;t last too long though. Unfortunately, the mellowness was followed by a wave of paranoia.

VRomulan is in my opinion, is one of the more over hyped buds  I have seen (since Pineapple Express &amp; Purple Haze). The high is okay, but its only feels a little bit better than smoking blunts of big bud (and we all know the quality of big bud). I am not a huge organic fan, but I can typically always find some better, and longer lasting organic for half the price of Romulan.
