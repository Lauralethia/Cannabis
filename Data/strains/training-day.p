VI got a gram of this grown by Jackpot Seaweed. Smells and tastes a lot like a spice cabinet with some muskiness. Very strong! I got very sleepy and a little dizzy after smoking a bowl, so I would definitely NOT recommend if you have stuff to do.

VI picked up an eighth of this strain from my local dispo (WA). It was grown by Liberty Reach and was 23.3%. I took a fat snap of it in the afternoon and was immediately relaxed and mellow! Training day has the ability to confine you to your couch if you&#39;re not careful. The buds were perfectly formed and crystallized and the flavor was nice and ripe! I highly recommend to any stoner looking for a strain to put them to bed or mellow out after a long day! Lightweights, do be cautious.

VVery distinct smell that doesn\u2019t dissipate with time. Great for grinding; one can practically taste the potency (north of 22 here) when freshly ground. Taste is as flavorful as the scent. A must, even for lightweights. How else are you going to build a flavor Profile? Toke away, all!

VI had this strain from a new medical dispensary i think it was az natural remedies 160 for a half once it was recommended to me by the tender. THIS strain is for you if you like the quick sleepy Indica effect combined with that grassy earthy lime scent and flavor. I&#39;ll give this strain another try maybe it was just this batch but it was the buds consistency that made it a 6 /10 smoke for me.

VI got this from the green door of buckley. in buckley, obviously. it was a 1 gram bag from liberty reach farms. liberty reach is a grower I&#39;ve tried one other time. it&#39;s was blue dream, it was alright. but this training day is great. it came in at 21% thc. it&#39;s a indica  dominate hybrid and is a pretty heavy high. it hit first in my head, very light at first,and then ramped up to a very heavy and pleasant body high. it sat me down and kept me there. it melted away all stress, mental fatigue, and any and all aches and pains I had from the day. I enjoyed the high for about a hour or so and then it knocked me out. I don&#39;t even remember falling asleep. all of a sudden it was morning. I woke up feeling awesome. really well rested. this is a strain that new smokers should be careful with. the high really ramped up on me. which I loved but a new smoker might start fell overwhelmed and not in control. all in all, this is a really good strain grown pretty well also by liberty reach. I would highly suggest that everybody try this if they can get there hands on it.\u000a

Vso I have grown Training Day a few times and have found that there are 3 main phenotypes ... 1 is sativa dominant and the other 2 are indica\u000a\u000athe sativa is not very heavy on the couch lock and has quite an uplifting high ... the indica dominate ones are super dank and quite dangerous as you will become a vegetable if you smoke a lot of it

VYes! Like someone mentioned, it&#39;s hard to find a good strain that works and this is one is one of those highs that comes up a bit slow at first and then you realize you have the relaxation and heaviness settling in the head and body. A good one for sure and it doesn&#39;t take much so thanks for the prior reviews that helped me decide on it.
