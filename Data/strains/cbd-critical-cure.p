I may have a slipped disc in my lower back. This strain stops the pain and gave me a calm, chill head mental state and a warm, relaxed body high. Gives me a break from the chronic pain.

VI grew this strain last summer and boy she is a healthy girl. She grew about six to seven feet in diameter and about six foot tall in a 30 gallon cloth pot. Recently diagnosed with pain cond and ptsd and Cannabis just became legal in my state. The lower thc content makes this ideal for me since I hadn\u2019t really smoked since the 80s and this is a perfect reintroduction to pot that isn\u2019t to heavy and also addresses my pain issues. Made into a salve that works excellent with some heat applied after. Also made cookies which I have one before bed. I sleep like a stone and wake up clear headed. Maybe a little unsteady if I wake up in the night. Off r/x opioids thanks to this plant and a Tens unit (thx to the folks at Barney\u2019s Farm too). My head is clear after years in r/x fog and gentler on my body.  A wonderful example of pot as medicine.

VMy new \u201devery day strain\u201d. If you wanna have the benefits of weed without being really stoned, this one\u2019s for you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the high is chilling in the background reminding you just enough that you are a little buzzed. I\u2019ve done most things i do in every day life on this strain. It doesn\u2019t really matter the task in front of you, a few puffs on this and you\u2019ll be ready to go! I don\u2019t suffer from any major mental/physical conditions but still this strain simply improves my life. Good for everyone i believe!

VI was really excited to find an Indica that&#39;s high-CBD, but I was disappointed with the critical cure I picked up. it did offer some pain relief, but it was lacking in flavour and oomph - it was rather flat. I prefer harlequin, even though it&#39;s a sativa.

VThis is exactly what I have been searching for! Perfect for the morning to start your day off right with clarity and a positive perspective. I have trouble with psycho activity from THC inducing paranoia or negative thoughts so finding the right CBD strain that counters this while providing relief is not easy to come by. Critical Cure provides a euphoric body high and uplifting perspective with mental clarity and no negative thoughts. I have noticed it reduces a great deal of anxiety/nerves also. But don&#39;t buy it, I wanna keep the supply up for selfish reasons ;)

VI do not recommend this strain. It came recommended alongside Critical Kush, which has been very helpful, and Critical Cure has been a huge disappointment. It smells good, but it tastes awful when smoked and often times I&#39;m left in a foul mood. Between the poor flavor, and the fact that it doesn&#39;t seem to help my leg pain or nausea or really anything at all about my condition, I get pretty grumpy. \u000a\u000aI regret this strain.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. This is review of my very own first homegrown from a cutting gifted to me by a generous friend. Last fall&#39;s harvest, a backyard grow. I took four good hits from a stubby Mrs. Mule had not finished.  The extra heat did affect the flavor but the kush spice was obvious. I thought a little taste of fuel as well. I felt it in my head first as a gentle cloudiness, very unobtrusive.Twenty minutes in there is a gentle light body buzz and a relaxed mind to match. I don&#39;t feel sleepy but feel like sleeping will come easy once I close my eyes. There is also a mild sense that if Mrs. Mule dropped back by the boudoir that would be just fine. Overall not a bad smoke at all. I&#39;m not dosed up out of my mind, I feel fairly functional. This makes a good utility weed, though I&#39;m still partial to C99 as my go-to happy time smoke, or White Widow.
