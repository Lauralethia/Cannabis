V   Apple Kush- \u000aFirstly, this is a very pretty strain. Secondly, the SMELL! &#128067; &#127822;!!!\u000aIt smells like sweet, green apple with a hint of diesel and earth. I love that the most.\u000aThird, the taste is quite good.&#128077;\u000aI haven&#39;t tried Pure Kush, but I have tried Sour Diesel- so it makes sense that it&#39;s offspring would taste so delicious! \u000aFourth, it feels wonderful. So relaxing, happy, euphoric. Just what I need after a rough, stressful day.\u000aAnd Fifth- sound??? Lol, well, it didn&#39;t speak or anything which I have mixed feelings about. ; )\u000aHowever, I can say that I do especially enjoy the NAME Apple Kush. Just SOUNDS friendly and yummy!&#128523;\u000aSo there we have it: 5 reasons that Apple Kush deserves 5 Stars from the effects on the human&#39;s 5 senses! : )

VFirst of, the smell, it&#39;s unique, the scent of apple is extremely strong and surprisingly tangy. The taste, heavenly, apple pie, sour apple, every thing apple. And then, the high, cerebral at first and creeps and pulsates through your body like rays and shockwaves of relaxation. Very good evening strain.

VClass A strain. We knew it was a kush but they had lost the label. Open the jar and so much fruitiness in my nostrils. I couldn&#39;t place it at first due to the strong twang it possessed, really pungent. I didn&#39;t want to stop inhaling it! Then apples was really coming to me but bitter. A thought of those applesours and that was it! Googled &quot;Apple Kush&quot; to lead me here and story certainly checks out with that lovely Sour D mammy. Ground up a bud and rolled a 1g joint. Buds are lovely, I&#39;ll put up a photo tomorrow, jees that smell! Gets the juices flowing mentally at first. Gentle euphoric tones creep in and get stronger. Not a giant rushy sativa like outburst but a soft creeper...which had crept to a blissful state by half the J. Finish my smoke and I start to get a lovely body buzz as I&#39;m approaching my bed. This combines for a flowy cerebral and mellow state. Body becomes heavier the more you smoke I reckon, but I&#39;ll find that out in the field tomorrow night. I&#39;m currently tucked into my comfortable resting spot for the night and about to sail away to the land of nod. 5*+ strain.

VWow. This is pretty amazing. It smells like straight weed and sweet candy apple with dense buds. temporarily cured my cripping depression, anxiety, and ptsd. I rolled a tight joint (too bad I didn&#39;t have blunts) at first I thought it was weak then about 15 minutes later when I finished the other half, a burst of euphoria and disorientation ( the amazing good kind) happened. my mind froze a minute later, next thing I know I&#39;m laying in my bed watching family guy laughing my ass when I normally I&#39;d keep a straight face. Couldn&#39;t get hungry because of withdrawal from my depression medication, now I ordered a pizza after being nauseas and far from hungry all day and I feel like a ninja turtle. I paused alot while writing this but it makes creative and recognize things I didn&#39;t think I could recognize. I&#39;m also very relaxed at the same time. Please use this strain, I have crippling depression and anxiety, it&#39;s all gone for now.

VWell what can I say about this little beauty?\u000aWhen I received this off my &#128268; I liked the look of the dense buds in this 3.5g deal. Beautiful glowing green buds coated in scrumptious orange hair&#39;s. I \u000aOpened the pot to a slight apple more skunky smell, and could not wait to roll one of these babies up &#128526;&#128077;&#127995;. \u000aJheez the apple taste I received on the 1st pull of this bat was awesome. Just like apple sour sweets I&#39;d have to say. After I had sadly finished my bat I was Left feeling so relaxed,mindful and happy of course. I can also tell you my sciatic pain was reduced considerably. Beautiful strain guys &#128077;&#127995;

VPerfect for anxiety and sore muscles or migraines. Gives me the pain relief I need without uncontrollably thoughts. You feel a headrush but it&#39;s enjoyable unlike strains that make me paranoid.

Vok, it&#39;s just like the strain header says, this yummy Kush provided a great Apple twist to a glorious strain. My overall impression that lingers is the knock out punch that eventually catches up with you. I struggled unsuccessfully to keep my eyes open in the end.\u000agreatest strain ever for my stomach problems.\u000aprovided strong body effects including goose bumps and cerebral waves of ultimate relaxation.\u000aBlessed be the sweet fruit that grows on this tree!

VThis is one of the best strains for bedding down for the night. We vape flower at roughly 350F. Starts in the head after about 10 minutes and turns into &quot;bed lock&quot; about 20 minutes in. Not too bad on the dry mouth for us. To my palette, flavor is mostly pine and citrus--&quot;Pine Sol&quot; if you&#39;re familiar with the cleaner. Sticks around for about 3 hours but plenty of time to knock me out well when I&#39;m trying to sleep.
