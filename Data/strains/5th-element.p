Vwow. very good strong strain. I drank a rum and coke with it and this is one of the better indicas I&#39;ve had in awhile. I&#39;m a fan of death star and Skywalker and black water (might be my favorite) but 5th is a contender for 2nd. Strong for me. ok folks signin off, im hitting the couch hard. see ya later gators

VIt&#39;s an indica that takes a few moments to kick in. It&#39;s a very calming strain. It&#39;s not a sleepy calm, just the body and mood are calmed. It&#39;s just an all-around generic indica strain. It doesn&#39;t have any wowing factors, but it&#39;s a good and affordable daily strain. I would say it does also make it harder for me to focus, but great to relax with music or a movie.

My life is like whipped cream (sublime). And I can make em scream (oh my!) And I put on my wings (fly-by). And I be &quot;bye-bye&quot; when SpongeBob say &quot;Ay!

VVery cerebral, and relaxing great for night time smoke seshes. I felt fairly immediate body relaxation, and euphoria. I have noticed a renewed effect from cannabis with my anxiety, since I switched to night time sessions only. If you smoke for anxiety, and you feel like you aren&#39;t getting what you need, or worse the constant high THC levels increases your anxiety, then I&#39;d say cutting back could be helpful.\u000a

V5th Elements frequency is definitely one that will take you to other planetary dimensions. It subtle flavor is reminiscent of roasted pine nuts. Quickly it detaches your mind from the spinal column and by that point you should be ready for a journey of intergalactic proportions. Bong recommended for deep interstellar journeying.

Vthis is some great stuff! at 33% i took a few hits,  like 3 and i couldn&#39;t move. my eyes are so heavy,  my body s numb and i passed out in the middle of a show on netflix.  luckily i woke up near the end and took another hit since i woke up so abruptly. if you need pain relief or have insomnia,  look no further.  straight to the stars.

VO finally I see it on her. It taste like sweet sage, earthy flowery taste.  It has a lot of blackberry kush pheno on mine. But it had a thicker smoke. I liked  it to smoke but not enough to do it again. It euphoria, makes you lazy, helped pain, and my depression. More Indica traits with blackberry kush flavors.

VI had tried this strain from the Green Haven company it had a 32% THC. I enjoyed this strain very much so a very potent indica and earthy taste to it. The high had a uplifting body high, euphoric, concentration, and creative thoughts.

VCerebral, and relaxing good for evening use. I had two bowls after work, and felt relaxed and euphoric. I was able to talk on the phone with a friend, usually I&#39;m nervous and tripping over my words. I have noticed a renewed effect from cannabis on my anxiety, since I cut back and switched to only evening sessions, this strain is great for that. \u000a
