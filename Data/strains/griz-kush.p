VI had this as a Platinum Vape Oil which is the second tier of highness to me, with flower being first, and jelly, wax shatter the third level.  The Griz Kush gave me strong force field euphoria to start, also made me hungry a bit.  I was scatterbrained but focused on what I was doing, felt very relaxed too.  Excellent chronic pain relief and put me down for the count for a bit at the end.

VExtreme giggles. Zero anxiety. This is some fun weed when you&#39;re doing a mindless outdoor activity- lots of energy, but sloppy, silly high so not for sports. Some of the buds I got are a dark purple that&#39;s almost black. I don&#39;t like how varied the buds are in one batch. It&#39;s almost two strains in one eighth- the greener buds are much better.

V4.5! I struck gold with my strain selections this weekend and Griz Kush is indeed one of them.  How nice! Rare find bc it&#39;s only at NRoots and I was near one so I went ahead to finally try it.  Truly a very nice strain! THC level is mid/upper teens but don&#39;t let that fool you; this is a nic,e relaxing and creative/motivation strain.\u000aHappy, happy, happy!  Is a good description. Not couch lock but not energetic or racy either. Purple hue to the flower and nice hairs and pretty dense look. It smells very unique!.. Maybe like sweet herbs or flowery herb like.

VGood sativa with heavy indica characteristics as well.  Can be too strong for those not used to the strong combo of both Tang Haze and Chrital Pakistani.  Very stoney! So it may not be a functioning smoke for you.  Not the  most euphoric I&#39;ve had, but definitely a pleasantly strong &quot;headband-like&quot; feeling around the head.  My batch I couldn&#39;t taste any Tang I imagine due to the ash being black, because the pot was not dried or cured long enough.  By the strong effects, I expect if I keep it in an airtight container long enough, like 3-4 more weeks,  it could develop that taste.

VMy ABSOLUTE favorite strain. First case I take my patients to every time, and you will never catch me without a lil Griz in my pocket ;)\u000a\u000aMy home is perfumed with the Griz, as the bowl on my coffee table always runneth over. Griz in the morning, Griz in the afternoon, Griz for supper time, Griz for the bedroom. All day, every day.\u000a\u000a-GG aka the Gidget

VIt&#39;s a very active hybrid; I smoked it thinking I would watch TV but instead rearranged my entire closet. You might want to use it on a hike or a beach day, because it&#39;s happy and makes colors look cool, if you know what I mean. Psychedelic in that sense, like many kush strains, right? I&#39;m new to the game. Also got that crazy headband feeling, so that&#39;s fun.
