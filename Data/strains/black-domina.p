VMy caretaker chose this strain for me a few months ago, and I can still remember the look, smell, taste and of course the relief I got after smoking Black Domina.  It wasn&#39;t harsh like other strains I had experienced.  It&#39;s potent and certainly squashes any pain or discomfort.\u000a\u000aI use a 3-chamber grinder for my bud. Using this type of grinder is the best to catch kief. One of the greatest things about Black Domina is the amount/quality of kief.  I&#39;ve never seen a bud dispel so much kief in my grinder. If you&#39;ve never smoked your kief, you&#39;re missing out on the best part.  But that&#39;s a different review, altogether! lol\u000a\u000aBlack Domina will not disappoint, I promise. It&#39;s one of the best Indicas, so far!

Vgood mellow high. good if you want some pain relief or migraine relief. When I get the onset signs of a potential migraine, I smoke a .5g joint and make an espresso. the strain i got wasn&#39;t high in thc% but it had nice cbd%. So I guess it did what I wanted it to do. Wasn&#39;t pumped on the smell, probably an older cure for the cbd%.

VGot an eight for myself but I had to invite some friends over cuz this is definetely a knock-out strain. \u000aHigh lasts 3 hours and no paraneua for my friends and me. Munchies do not hit too hard, hot cheetos should do the trick! Dry/cotton mouth was present but I\u2018d say only 5/10, water will cure it.\u000aFound myself very talkactive and excited although it is an Indica strain. If you have the chance to try this please give it a shot. You won\u2018t be dissapointed! Peace

VNot a big fan of Black Domina though I don&#39;t hate it either. It made me paranoid a little. A positive aspect of it is that after a couples of anxiety incident on this strain I learned how to control such incidents and ride&#39;em through.  It also made me understand what a person with a mental illness feels like 24/7 while at best I felt like for an hour.So I gained more respect for some peoples (liked mentally broken peoples already so I just love them more) and gained a lot more self-control. Very discreet strain as it almost smell nothing. It taste earthy and sweet when vaped but not overwhelming.

VWHOA!!  I love indicas and this is one to definitely put on your list if you&#39;re like me.  I like to literally get SO relaxed at night that I fall blissfully asleep with the bong in my hand.  Black Domina does just that.  If you have pain or sleep issues, this strain is perfect for you.  Coming from a lineage of four other indicas, this one packs a punch with both pain and insomnia, not to mention the fact that it gets you stoned silly.  The moment you take a hit of the deep green, earthy bud you get a feeling of utter serenity come over your entire body.  Extremely nice.  Full head and body buzz, skunky and earthy, and very pretty crystals.

VBlack Domina, She is the Sandwoman. Opposite Sandman. Black Domina will put you in the nice sweet spot euphoric mood for a bit and then slowly slip you into a comfortable relaxed mood. \u000a\u000aEventually leading to a nice restful sleep that once upon you is immediate and you sleep. NOW. SLEEP NOW.\u000a\u000aI have light anxiety and my wife has severe anxiety. This is THE strain for us.  I&#39;ve tried many strains to help her and this one is THE one that she  and I prefer.  \u000a\u000aThere isn&#39;t a single note of anxiety when we relax with Black Domina.    We only smoke a bowl from a nice glass bong or pipe and it is enough for melt the week away and get a good restful sleep.  \u000a\u000aWe strongly recommend for people who need some relief from stress, anxiety and sleep troubles.  Not much of a social plant for parties, a night with a friend or two is good.\u000a\u000aMuch love Ganja

Va nice flora mix  of a smooth spicey musk similar to the hindu with sweet purple undertones that made for yummy...   Very cerebral or psycho active . This would be great for a show or even just a movie as it really gives you that emphatic feeling like everything is alive around you and your body is just buzzing.  Couple that with an almost narcotic warmth going through the body and you have a truly special experience   my wife put it best when she said my elbows are really tingly. The duration is most impressive ... Almost two hours on one session and I actually forgot I hadn&#39;t gone back for seconds which is very unlike me.  The second level is a trip to the moon... No sleepiness through the night

VNorth Coast Growers out of Washington was the cut I tried.   Let me start off by saying wow!  I&#39;m a concentrate guy through and through, however, this delectable strain was calling my name.  Super dense nugs, my 1/8th was 3 medium sized nugs.  Super super dense.  Purple, glistening under my phone light.  Perfect trim job.  Breaking these buds down for bong hits and I smell purple, candy, and a musky pepper.  1 snap out of my bong and I already feel my eyes getting low.  2 snaps and I&#39;m right where I need to be after a long day at work.  Found myself being lazy, no munchies, no dry eyes.  Caught myself dozing off a couple times.  This is one heck of a strain to wind down with, or just get that Stoney high.  This girl has some legs!

VThis is a potent strain.  Vaping herb, it takes a few minutes before you feel it, then it sneaks up on you swiftly with a syrupy head float that lasts for a bit until it mellows and melts through the rest of your body. Goes a long way. Very relaxing in its prime, so don&#39;t have anything to do that night!  As the body feeling diminishes, it rises into a warm, sleepy narcotic full body that is the trick of my chronic insomnia.  Definitely my Go To for the late night relaxation and to ward off that sleeplessness.  The narcotic effects last me almost all night.  A full night&#39;s rest!

VHoly moly! \u000a\u000aThis is an extremely unique strain.  The taste was dark and pungent.  The appearance; medium sized buds truly black in color, with hairs the same shade.  Widely ranging indica parents deliver a relaxation and euphoria that&#39;s hard to match.  What shocked me about this strain though was there was zero sedation involved but I felt like I was floating.  Literally floating. My head was very clear but there was a psychedelic effect I rarely get, pleasant though.  Awesome Indica 10/10!

VStrain: Black Domina (Northern Lights / Ortega / Hash Plant / Afghani cross -- Indica leaning Hybrid)\u000aTHC: 24.77%\u000aCBD: 0.08%\u000aGrower: Kool Kush Farms\u000aLocation found: KaLeafa\u000aDate purchased: 3.31.16  \u000aPrice: $8.00\u000aWeight: 1.1g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: Damp earth musky pepper with a hint of ammonia. The parents of this kid made one unique combination plate. \u000aLook: Super dense light green nug with light orange hairs all over it. Definitely machine trimmed right down. The bud structure reminds me of some Hash Plant I have seen before.\u000aTaste: Mild taste from my youth. The flavor is a peppery damp earth with enough history in one breath that it is near impossible to explain. The combination of Afghani and Thai is amazing. It tastes like licking a dew covered rock untouched by man for eons on the mountain tops in both regions; at the same time!\u000aRecommendation for medicine: This stuff hits hard and fast. Slowed me down to a slight crawl. Need to try for possible nighttime type medication.

I started growing my own soon after I started smoking, but this was the best weed that I ever purchased on the &quot;black market.&quot; Numbs your body and mind. Although it made me want to stay on the couch, I picked myself up and went on a bike ride. For me, the trick with heavy indicas is to already have an activity in place, smoke real fast, then go do it! I love being active on indicas, if just for the challenge it presents.

VOne of the first reviews I read on this site was from someone who described this as the narcotic I was looking for to have a good sleep.  When I saw that Delta 9 was offering it I had to have it, and I have not been in the least disappointed.  I do have problems with sleep due to nausea which tends to wake me from a dead sleep.  With BD this has been improved to the point where I can normally sleep a minimum of 7 hours.  When I vape it before bed, about 30 minutes prior, the vapours are dense and very pleasant, earthy but smooth.  I have seen a small bowl last for 20 or more minutes.  Resiny with plenty of trichomes.  I have ordered more just today

VI got it as a special from a dispensary in BC, it was good but it wasn&#39;t great which was to be expected because it&#39;s price was $120/oz. I only vape and with Black Domina I got a sufficient level of pain relief and duration that was strong enough to be overpowering if I vaped a whole .2g but I would often just pack my vape and hit it about 9 - 11 times at 385&#176; which was enough to last a nightly toke session followed by a wake and bake. It was a great entry level Indica that I would recommend as one of the cheaper options to seek if price is what matters to you.\u000a\u000a I wasn&#39;t able to get a sufficient level Body High, so far Blue Dream and ATF have only delivered in this area.

VIt took a while for the high to get to me, but when it did... it was hella strong. The taste was kind of bitter. I remember getting the munchies so bad that I devoured two cheeseburgers whole while my homie and I were walking down the street lol\u000aI did get some headache-like trips a while later and quite a bit of paranoia... but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because when I smoked some of my friend&#39;s Black Domina I was matching it with my personal stash or maybe the setting just wasn&#39;t right (taking the bus and seeing cop cars drive past you while you&#39;re stoned asf isn&#39;t the best setting lmao). Either way, I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s not bad and it&#39;s a pretty powerful strain so perhaps not the ideal choice for a novice toker. More seasoned tokers should be able to handle it, though.

VI&#39;ve gone through a gram of this stuff and it&#39;s really good! Picked it up from Pharm to Table, I saw it when I was checking out and opened it up to smell and bought it on that alone. For me it provided a heady high at first, giving me the giggles on several occasions and then just a relaxed feeling. I can&#39;t say it makes me sleepy though, if anything maybe the opposite, so I like it for the afternoon. The come down is smooth too which is a plus for me as some indicas will just make me feel groggy.

VIt&#39;s a good strain and actually today was the first day I got it from a local dispensary called The Karmacy in Michigan.  The buds are black, never seen anything like it only blue berry kush once was another strain where the color dominated the green.  It&#39;s a top shelf brand here so expect to pay about $18 gm which is worth it if you vaporize it or use little, got a good couch lock to it.  I felt paranoia initially which faded to more of a sleepy non functioning state for a good 1hr.

I have a Moby Pandora station. I&#39;ve been grooming it so I can groove to it. I feel creative and my mind is making many connections. my back pain is a third less and I&#39;m definitely distracted from a third. makes me feel like I want to dance. my body feels warm and tingly.

VI got it as a special from a dispensary in BC, it was good but it wasn&#39;t great which was to be expected because it&#39;s price was $120/oz. I only vape and with Black Domina I got a sufficient level of pain relief and duration that was strong enough to be overpowering if I vaped a whole .2g but I would often just pack my vape and hit it about 9 - 11 times at 385&#176; which was enough to last a nightly toke session followed by a wake and bake. It was a great entry level Indica that I would recommend as one of the cheaper options to seek if price is what matters to you.\u000a\u000a I wasn&#39;t able to get a sufficient level Body High, so far Blue Dream and ATF have only delivered in this area.

It doesn&#39;t mess you up like some other strains but allows you to sleep by calming your thoughts and body in a happy undergo an.

VThe black domina strain is pretty good weed for your late night activities. it puts you in a sleepy/relax and happy mood. My best advice when taking this weed will be too take only &#224; small quantity if you don&#39;t want to fall asleep.

VHeavy hitter.  Perfect for insomnia.  A bit head-heavy for my taste, but is perfect if you just want to be KTFO&#39;d.  If you hit heavy, you can feel a bit dizzy, but with light use it can be extremely relaxing.

Very strong pepper scent. Definitely couch locked I felt like I couldn&#39;t move. It&#39;s an interesting way to go to bed, locked in and stuck thinking hard about something.

VThe weed smells very good ! It reminded me a bit of blueberry (the other strain) with a touch of citrus towards the end. The taste was a little bit harsh and &quot;good&quot; overall.\u000a\u000aPros: Very creative high, it would get my mind into some body trip. I am currently really high on this strain, and my whole body is kind of &quot;buzzing&quot;, a bit like if my body was having a lot of electricity in it. My head feels really swollen.\u000a\u000aCons: A bit sleepy, but that could be good to use if you want to sleep. \u000a\u000aThe strain reminded me of an indica kush, and had some bright orange pistils ! Very, very nice looking weed !\u000a\u000aWould recomend to sleep, remove pain, or to lay down and have a body trip and just chill :)

VI&#39;ve never found Black Domina to be anything to write home about, and this time is no different. The high is very mild, just giving me slow introspective high, that while relaxing still leaves the mind happy to turn over new ideas. I suspect it would be great for lower tolerance smokers who need anxiety relief while still remaining functional, but for us high tolerance smokes it doesn&#39;t seem to do as much of a the trick.\u000aIt&#39;s a nice strain, roll a joint, smoke a fat bowl, and you will feel relaxed, destressed but not conquered as many indicas might have you feel. Just not very stron.
