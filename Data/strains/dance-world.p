VThis strain is INCREDIBLE. It has a super nice fruity aroma to it and hits very smoothly. A very relaxed non super Stoney high. \u000a\u000aI grew this strain myself for it&#39;s high CBD properties. The plant grew just over 3&#39; tall and 2&#39; wide, vegged for one month, topped once, flowered for 9 weeks total with the last two months in just water (grown hydroponically). Grows very trouble free and was the best out of three strains. \u000a\u000aI would highly recommend this strain to anyone for a good daytime strain with high CBD.

VMedical patients with inflamatory issues and stomach problems this high CBD with low THC is fantastic for first timers.  First strain I purchased and very much a body relaxation effect.  very focused and able to be productive.  as a newbie to the medical experiences I can see the 8th I purchased lasting me a while.

VPicked this up today mostly for my wife. But I was excited to try this strain out. As you see this is very CBD heavy. Ratio is close to even THC. The head high was very mellow. Body very relaxed. Not my personal favorite as far as getting ripped and playing video games. But very chill and mellow overall high. \u000a\u000aSide notes:\u000alower back pain was gone after smoking.\u000aI did end up smoking a different strain to get a stronger head high.

VMy first Sativa was quite a pleasant surprise. As a novice, I have been sticking with CBD strains, and Dance World did not disappoint. \u000a\u000aThe flavor was spicy with a slightly earthy edge with a touch of tartness at the tail end. \u000a\u000aThis strain made me feel uplifted, yet relaxed at the same time which was a unique sensation. I really appreciated feeling calm, but not inebriated. I was relatively clear headed and able to carry on a conversation. \u000a\u000aSo far one of my favorites.

VI wish this strain was more readily available. Helps with inflammation and arthritic issues in my neck so that I have no need for ibuprofen any longer. Subtle high which relaxes stiff muscles.

VW O W !  This strain is an incredible mood booster. Not only do I feel more joy, energy and creativity with this strain but it also helps with my anxiety! Dance World is almost certainly my go to for any occasion.

VThis strain produces a very clean and clear head buzz. It is not very euphoric but it is pleasant. the buds can be quite strong even though it&#39;s a high CBD variety. You are left kinda functional and pretty energetic even when you&#39;re very high on it. It&#39;s a good daytime strain for everyday use because of the healthy CBD content but it&#39;s not really the right one if you want to get stoned and super relaxed. So it doesn&#39;t make you extremely relaxed but it is very good for anxiety. It kills the anxiety while keeping you energized.

VTried this from Origin Cannabis Company purchased from Have a Heart in Fremont. Although pricey, this strain really gets me where I need to. A quick hitting, not overwhelming high, and back to normal in an hour or so.

VFirst thyme trying high CBD. I love it. Everything I&#39;m looking for in pain relief with a really nice THC effect. Great nose..a bit harsh on the intake for me but who&#39;s complaining, not me. Hello Oregon...let&#39;s do this thing.

VGrowing this now as we speak. Definitely sativa type, with loose budspacing (is that a word?). Lot&#39;s of variation in height from plant-to-plant. My skunk no. 1&#39;s are flowering *much* earlier, and my DW&#39;s are all over the map; most are maybe 3 weeks from finishing &amp; one is just now showing frost. New hybrid I guess. Lavender. VERY lavender (which is nice, IMHO). Not getting the citrus &amp;c. at all actually. All seeds sprouted, but 40% of plants died within 1st 2 weeks. Hope it&#39;s worth it.
