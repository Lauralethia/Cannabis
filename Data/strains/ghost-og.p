VHave yet to smoke this stuff, but I&#39;ve been vaping it the past week and all I can say is WOW.  This strain has every good quality I look for in cannabis: It dosen&#39;t put you to sleep, it gives you both a head high and a body high, gives me great creativity, amazingly relaxing, and you can still focus and go about day to day tasks.\u000a\u000aCool name too.

VGhost OG has seen a revival in the medical industry, particularly on the east coast. This strain posses thick fluffy buds that, when cured correctly, posses a combination of milky white trichomes and sunburnt accents all along its&#39; dense body. The plant itself is able to produce some of the largest buds of any strain, buds weighing 8-14g each are fairly common with this robust plant. The high is smooth and uplifting. Within the first few seconds after inhalation the 27% thc content threw me into a gapping oblivion of euphoria. The strong psychoactive effects are felt strongest in along the back of the neck and head. This strain is much stronger after the first 15 minutes, that&#39;s when your body and mind become one and you sink to your coach, while your mind flies away.

VA perfect hybrid. The flavor is straight OG: lemon, pine and earthy sweetness. The head high comes on hard and fast, followed by a strong body high about 10 minutes later. I love this smoke in the evening, because I can enjoy the combination until I&#39;m\u000aready to sleep without being forced to sleep. That said, when I want to conk out for the night, sleep comes easy.

VAcquired from Shore Naturals in Maryland. Tested out at:\u000aTHC 29.49%; CBG 0.06%; a-Pinene 0.10%; b-Pinene 0.09%; b-Myrcene 0.50%; Limonene 0.31%; Linalool 0.07%; b-Caryophyllene 0.27%; Humulene 0.11%; b-Eudesmol 0.05%; Caryophyllene Oxide 0.04%; Trans-Nerolidol 0.04%. \u000a\u000aVery light, frosted and crystallized buds. Creeper of a high. First, very euphoric and cerebral (due to high THC content), which is great for pain. Then an amazing, tingly body high. Great combination. Indica leaning, but not devastatingly so. Highly functional, but would rather work alone on this strain with my ear buds and my huge smile ear to ear. Will buy again.

VThis is a solid strain, had not tried it previously until recently recommended.  It has a reasonable generic citrus smell with some earthiness but take smell aside the trichomes and hairs are amazing.  Comes off like crystals into the land of grinder keif.  \u000a\u000aNow, I prefer to vape this at lower temperatures as it really focuses it on the insomnia relief aspect of it and gives a solid behind the eyes, through the head and eventually a nice tingling in the lips type relaxation high.\u000a\u000aBest out there, nope, but vaping around 355f up to 375f you get solid flavors with nice vape cloud levels but the high is where it is at.  Get into the higher temperatures or smoking and I think you are losing out on some real quality and while I have smoked and enjoyed it, I smoked it only once, not again.  Also think the higher temperature bring out some of the panic/anxious features of a bad Sativa. \u000a\u000aStart slow because it is a creeper and eventually those multiple bags start leaving you obliterated and in total indica land state of...what time is it?

VAcquired this &quot;Exclusive - Aka Connoisseur Grade&quot; Cannabis Flower recently at Circle City Collective in Corona CA :)  Riverside Represent !!! This Lovely Dispensary consistently stocks the Best Strains from some of the Best Growers at arguably the Cheapest Prices in So Cal... at the least the Cheapest Prices which proudly display the test results of their flower.  $10 a gram Top Shelf Tuesdays (Think $280 per oz or 28 grams). Although This Strain came with no deals because of its Exclusive Status, it was still a Great Deal at $100 per quarter :)  I would like to know if this was personally grown by CCC or another Master Grower because they deserve Props ! The Dispensary correctly labels this Strain an INDICA because that is what it is !!!  The Smell .... Sweet Pine with a hint of fresh cut grass and mint in the background.  The Taste on the Inhale ... a sweet pine which expanded in the lungs perfectly, and the exhale was more Richer Pine aftertaste.  Typical of an Indica Strain.  Smoked a small bowl of this out of a small glass pipe.  The High starts by one entering a High Speed Indica Mineshaft Elevator the sends one strain down on about 3000 meters :) A Pure Heavy Headbang Indica Euphoric High Straight to your Chest, Eyes, and Dome :)  Absolutely Nothing Sativa or Hybrid about this flower for the first 45 minutes of the High. The High does get Lighter and Brighter over the course of the next hour where Creative Thinking just seems to happen without effort. I wouldn&#39;t describe the High as anything Psychedelic, just wonderfully creative and mildly pleasantly spacey with the body still feeling heavy and relaxed; but not to the point of Couch-lock. I think that fits the description of Indica Territory.  This is a wonderful 2 1/2 hour Super Stoney yet functional high which lingers to 3 1/2 hours; as you finally ascend back to Ground Level.  This is Certified Legit One Hit Indica Shit !!!  This Ghostly Flower will wonderfully haunt you if you&#39;re fortunate enough to get some.  This is a Solid 4.7 out 5 Indica Stars. Would love to see Leafly put a nice Deep Rich Much Deserved Indica Purple on this Strain Tag :)

Vpeople talk about weed being good, but this stuff is different. the batch I have is only 18% thc and smokes better than strains I&#39;ve seen at 27%. the buds are a super frosty bright green, and the smell is super pungent. the high is unique as far as I know, and starts really heady and tippy and then mellows out to a silly goofy high the more you smoke. I&#39;ve seen many good strains, but this is &quot;the one&quot;.

The buds are large and when squeezed there was a slight stickiness to it, when grinding the flower I smelled Pine, Spice, and a bit of sweetness like candy. The following Terpenes in this flower are Alpha Pinene, Beta Pinene, D- Limonene, Linalool, Beta- Caryophyllene, Alpha Humulene. This flower is amazing for those who suffer with asthma, pain, stress, depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, and sleep. I absolutely Love this Hybrid! (CRESCOLABS product)

All anxiety is removed. You can lie down and just sink into the surface without falling asleep, just enjoying a sense of well-being. It slowly trails off without any crash. You wake up the next day feeling great. One of the few strains I&#39;ve found that will knock out a full-blown migraine with no rebound when it wears off.

VWow, very nice Strain that actually stands out and feels different! I am surprised by how many reviews of Ghost OG here describe what I felt. \u000aUnlike other strains Ghost OG kicks in much quicker for some reason. If with cookies strains I may feel a gradual slow onset of the effects, with Ghost OG it was more pronounced. \u000aOne effect of Ghost OG that I like is it&#39;s stronger effects on the mind and on my ability to smile. I rarely get this from any strain. With Ghost I felt stronger abstract throughts and perception changes. It doesn&#39;t knock me out and doesn&#39;t cause strong sleepiness and laziness that most weed does in general. At the same time I was feeling body relaxation typical of Indicas. The smell was nothing special and the smoke is as gross as other strains. Effects are very fun inducing.

VOne of my favorites for sure! I\u2019ve been smoking for years, but more hardcore over the last year. I started paying super attention to strains, and I think I\u2019d have to say Ghost OG is officially my favorite. I literally cleaned my entire house in like 50 minutes, stayed in good spirits for hours, felt much less stressed and anxious, and I did feel pretty euphoric. I didn\u2019t experience dry mouth or eyes, never got anxious, and it didn\u2019t make me sleepy. Definitely recommend!

VThis OG strain is pretty stoney.  I just got a gram of it and it was one huge rock hard nug.  The nugs where pretty frosted too. The strain was called Al&#39;s Ghost OG grown by Sonic Green and sold by White Rabbit Cannabis.  The THC level was just under 30 percent  too. With a CBD level of 0.26.  This was a good OG but it was missing that intense OG smell

VI realize that different growers can produce different qualities of the same strain. I came across some ghost og from a dispensary in Mi. It was by far the strongest bud I have smoked, and unlike any other buzz! I&#39;ve smoked since the 80&#39;s, I am not a newbie! Its a very heavy buzz, all over your body. The pain relief was amazing, and almost immediate. I for one, would not attempt to use this one during the day if you have any plans. I slept so hard on it, and still felt buzzed when I woke up the next day!

Taste is good, buzz lasts long, and the herb itself looks very nice.  This is a good choice to smoke if you are looking to relax and listen to music or watch a movie, as it will leave you stuck to your bed.

VI received large helping of this wonderful medicine for my birthday last week and I couldn&#39;t have been more please. Through the bag at first whiff I caught a noticeable skunk aroma but upon further inhalation I enjoyed complexities of bouquet reminiscent of something floral and sweet. These odor accents compliment perfectly the taste which also remind me something sweet, floral with a hint of citrus. \u000aOn appearance I immediately notice a low leaf to calyx ratio which pleases me. It&#39;s  not one of those snow white types of frosty but no straining is required to see the even cover of diamond and honey bead like crystals. Very potent yet after smoking I don&#39;t experience any time of mental over stimulation like I can with other very potent strains. I&#39;m calm and relaxed. I feel introspective but my mind also happily drifts in the waves of euphoria this strain brings. I&#39;ll be making a purchase of my own. I will repeat.

I get a solid 7+ hours with no high-over in the morning. I try to avoid chocolate/extra sweet stuff after smoking Ghost OG. as it tends to &quot;reset&quot; the buzz for me and I have to smoke more.\u000aNot for daytime use if operating heavy equipment or power tools.\u000aExcellent for daytime use if you want to sit in a big comfy chair on the porch with that first cup of coffee and watch the birds flying in from the neighboring trees to the feeders and ground to get something to eat.\u000aUntil the dogs jump off my lap and chase them away.\u000aAhhhh, sweet.

Dome feels like it&#39;s gently expanding outward. THC is ~18% and probably for the best that it&#39;s not any higher than that.  I remember this from back in like 06 being very similar to trainwreck, and yeah my recall seems to be basically correct. Nice.

V8/10 I usually lean towards sativa but this Indica blend hits just right. immediate effects from first bong rip. I recommend for all seeking help with pain and insomnia.

V4.5 - the particular batch I got was very diesel. But I love that tang lol. I get more pine than citrus. This is just a good indica leaning hybrid. What you expect from an OG. Good body high that knocks out pain. Few too many hits will send you right to dreamland. But it&#39;s chill. Puts your anxiety at bay. If you pace yourself it&#39;s a real nice evening unwind.

VBeing an OG phenotype, there isn&#39;t really too much to say about this strain beyond explaining the characteristics of OG Kush, except that this variety isn&#39;t quite as much of a knockout and allows you to function more. The flavor also has this definitely unique flavor that other phenotypes of OG Kush do not share and it makes you want to really savor the sweet, piney, flowery taste of this strain.

VAverage Sativa .. Nothing super special but gets me smiling, running around and getting my day done. Like most Sativa&#39;s this gives my PTSD a lil shove so I can get a bit anxious ..

VI took a small dab of wax made with ghost OG, then 10 minutes later took another, slightly larger dab. The first dab immediately helped me relax, the second one had me loosening the tension in my shoulders. I have a clear head. My extremities are slightly tingly, but it&#39;s a pleasant feeling. I am able to concentrate, but am feeling very relaxed and euphoric. A long intellectual discussion would be awesome right now..

I usually use a variety indicas at night and was looking forward to trying this strain \u000a\u000aAroma - initially I picked up a citrus but at times had Suttle tones of a pine. med pungent aroma. \u000a\u000aTaste - first rip and inhale again the citrus I was smelling followed within the taste. some throat hit and didn&#39;t irritate to bad. \u000a\u000aFeeling - very potent for the first 10 min each night created the same effect first heavy head then flowing through the body. No reported negatives from my experiences but each person is different. \u000a\u000a\u000aOverall allowed me to sleep throughout the night and loved the first 10 min and transition through the body very cool stuff. will be buying again.

VProbably my favorite OG. Stumbled upon this out of pure chance and was blessed with this euphoric beast of a strain. Alot more citrus/ ginger aley than other OG Kushes and the taste is instantly recognizable, its also burns smoother than alot of other OG&#39;s. Ghost itself is a clone only but when selfed (s1) it tends to have 2 main phenotypes one more sativa and branchy, the other more higher yielding and indica but you can tell they are cut from the same cloth. Great for daytime in small doses and even better at night for relaxing and taking the edge (or many edges ^_^) off.

VGreat well balanced strain, not alot of couch lock, not as heavy as other Kushs like o.g kush. \u000a The smell is insane it has a inceadible citrus pine aroma. But it tastes more gassy or like diesel with a hint of citrus more  along the lines of sour D or chemdawg, rather then a citrusy piney taste.  The stone is not the strongest but this strain has the longest legs of any strain I have ever smoked, 1 or 2 bong hits Jeep&#39;s me medicated for a solid 4 to 5 hours, I gone that amazing because wax doesn&#39;t keep me  medicated that long.

VNow my favorite sleepy night time strain. \u000a4 to 6 puffs of Ghost OG over an hour or so and I&#39;m ready to sleep deeply in no time. Lower back pain melts away and a comfy calm relaxes my mind. I get a solid 7+ hours with no high-over in the morning. I try to avoid chocolate/extra sweet stuff after smoking Ghost OG. as it tends to &quot;reset&quot; the buzz for me and I have to smoke more.\u000aNot for daytime use if operating heavy equipment or power tools.\u000aExcellent for daytime use if you want to sit in a big comfy chair on the porch with that first cup of coffee and watch the birds flying in from the neighboring trees to the feeders and ground to get something to eat.\u000aUntil the dogs jump off my lap and chase them away.\u000aAhhhh, sweet.

VA legend in the making. This is a lovely strain. The buds are fluffy and not quite as dense as some OG strains may be. Loaded with fiery hairs. Very nice bud structure. Sticky icky breaking up. Smell is citrusy with some slightly sweet aroma. The smoke is smooth with some pine and citrus notes. Good daytime smoke. High was balanced and stimulating.A very nicely grown OG strain in my opinion.

VI asked the dude at the dispensary for some &quot;mind warp shit with minimal anxiety&quot; and he by god nailed it.  Bright, thoughtful high with very little body effect. Dome feels like it&#39;s gently expanding outward. THC is ~18% and probably for the best that it&#39;s not any higher than that.  I remember this from back in like 06 being very similar to trainwreck, and yeah my recall seems to be basically correct. Nice.

VA very cerebral high indeed. Although in the batch I had the buds were rather small, they had a light frost over of trichomes and it&#39;s leaves where a nice earthy dark green. Overall, I&#39;d say a 4.3 on my scale

VWonderful earthy citrus taste, perfect balance on the mental and body high, and worked great for pain. Able to hit a few times and still function throughout the day and relieved A LOT of built up anxiety driven stress. Right up there with God&#39;s Gift and Moby Dick

VLike a ghost, she comes slowly in through the cracks and sinks in without your knowledge.\u000a\u000aPowerful stuff. I use this as an anti-depressant and it works wonders for me. At my local clinic they recommended this strain for my Aural migraines as well. Seemed to take the edge right off the one that was sneaking up on me this morning.\u000a\u000aVery smooth, clean inhale. Warm and fresh. Love you Ghost xoxox

VAhyo... So I get a preroll that&#39;s it. I had it for about a week never smelt it or opens it. I was actually pissed cause there was now way that the pre roll was a gram. I never scaled cause honestly I didn&#39;t want it to show short then have to write here it was. So I don&#39;t know. But sparked it was high as kite. The roll was still soft I could tell that it was ground up trees vs. snow leaf or trimmings. Was not.

VOne of my favourite hybrids, This strain is an indica dominate which has derived from OG Kush, kinda like an adaptation. If you can get your hands on this its great for after work or end of the day. It will leave you in a very good mood and relaxed as nothing else matters. Ghost og will also leave you with a mild body high. I find this strain great for sleeping, because as soon as i hit the pillow i was out. It&#39;s smell is pretty strong and is a little sweet but also earthy. Ghost og smokes really smooth with a nice taste. I would recommend this if you are just chilling at home or with friends. Ghost og is not this best strain to smoke then go out or do things as expected from a potent indica.

VVaped Ghost OG and it really hasn&#39;t done much for me and I&#39;m quite new to the world of cannabis and still have a low tolerance.  It isn&#39;t unpleasant by any means but It is pretty weak.  It may be a good choice if you are going hiking.  Normally when I vape other strains, 2 pulls gets me where I want to be.  My Ghost OG cartridge is basically full so maybe I&#39;ll try 4-5 pulls next time but I have others that are much better so I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll come back to it.

VGot this in shatter from phyto and i was supprised. i went bought myself 2 grams a glass shatter rig with domless nail and torch. id never smoked shatter before and i guess i did alittle to much. I exhalled and instant high like ive never experienced. i got a warm fuzzy feeling in chest then my whole core of my body went into a big charlie horse muscles completlty locked up and it hurt bad. got really scared and had to lay down was high for e hour plus but wen i came down i was like holy shit wat an experience and loaded up another dad not so big. i weighed the leftover shatter and it was 1.2 so i did almost a gram for first time in two dabs wat a wild ride thougjt i was gonna die but loved every minute except the pain from my body going into rigger but was worth it didnt happen second time but be carefull because the ghost is lurking to sweep you away.
