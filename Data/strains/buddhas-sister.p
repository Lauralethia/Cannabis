Vi&#39;m extremely particular about how a strain will affect my mind, I love the cerebral amplifications of sativas but indicas tend to create more clearer paths to mental clarity and positivity and subsequently help my anxiety more. Buddha&#39;s Sister is a cerebrally stimulating indica that also provides that classic indica tranquility I seek. It induced a full body zen while also spurring my friends and on a wild ride of conversation taking us through the deepest cobwebbed corners of our minds. Be prepared to debate the illogical, the fantastical, and the threads that weave the sheer fabric of what we call reality! Excellent cherry taste too

VI tried it, I liked it! I went to my favorite dispensary looking for Shark Shock and my bud tender suggested I try Buddha&#39;s Sister. As soon as I got home I tried it, and it was exactly what I was looking for. High CBD levels and moderate to low THC, making it for me the perfect evening choice. My body relaxed, my stress levels dropped right away. And, I felt happy! Both my anxiety and depression faded away. For a while the THC helped me get some things done, I was functional, a rarity. Finally it was time to rest and eat. I need the motivation to eat, I have chronic nausea. So hungry but not ravenous is exactly what I need. This strain is now on my &quot;Try to always have on hand list.&quot;

VThis is my favorite strain for relaxing without being couch-locked, lifting my mood, and helping with mild anxiety (not panic attacks). This strain is really well-founded. It allows for conversation, creativity, spontaneity, and medium muscle relaxation without feeling sleepy. \u000a\u000aMy partner is just opening up to trying weed again, and she really likes this one for easing her daily worries and not feeling overly drugged. The high lasts about an hour--we thoroughly went through one full bowl of this on a Boundless CF, her going two rounds and me four. I was pleasantly comfortable from 8ish to bedtime at 11.

VI first tried Buddhas Sister in Amsterdam at the Dampkring Coffeeshop. I actually didn&#39;t like it much at first since I was trying to roll while on a canal boat and it was a bitch to shred with my fingers. Then I realized that my fingers were covered in this seriously stinky oil, I smelled like a skunk. I finally got the unit finished, lit it up and enjoyed a nice canal boat tour. The colors seemed a bit more vivid, straight to the head, leveling off after 45 minutes, while the body high kicks into place. Super clear high, tasted like a cross between a cherry sweet tart and a vintage skunk. I did not finish that joint until the next morning at Barneys. I pulled it out of the tube and looked at it in the light, it was serious resin dripping through the paper. I only managed to finish half the night before.

VVery pleasant strain, as mellow as the name implies. Good for both day and night time use. Great for managing pain in the day, has a fulfilling body feel but leaves you with a clear mind and doesn&#39;t weigh you down. If you have enough it&#39;ll definitely get you to sleep. Has nice uplifting qualities, puts you in a good mood. Even at a low THC % (15.67%, would normally avoid something that low but I was out of medicine and the indica varieties were lacking), this was a very enjoyable medicine. Exactly as advertised, everything I expected it to be. I&#39;m looking forward to trying a higher %

Nor did it smell particularly strongly, so I hadn&#39;t hoped for much.

VNice strain for moderate pain and insomnia.  Leaves you feeling calm and relaxed but not overwhelmingly tired.  Rather a clear-headed strain for an indica, actually.  That&#39;s a nice thing, as sativas just don&#39;t seem to work for me, and this gives me something indica that I can use during the day.

VFlower from NETA in MA. Been using this strain for a few evenings to ease into sleep. I\u2019m prone to a bit of anxiety but have experienced none with Buddha\u2019s sis. Vaped on high from my Vaporfi Atom, the taste is phenomenal, very flowery throughout the entire oven\u2019s worth. Effects are initially quite uplifting which soon melts to a state of calm relaxation. I don\u2019t feel as if the Buddha is sitting on my chest but definitely get a nice, heavy feeling throughout my body &amp; can comfortably drift off to sleep.

VThe report from the dispensary says this is 11.5% THC-A.  But something about this strain really chills me out every time I smoke it.  It feels heavier than some of the high 20% THC strains I use.  \u000a\u000aIt is a great weekend or evening strain.

VBuddha\u2019s Sister has been on my Leafly \u201cfavorites\u201d list for some time, based on reviews and effects, but I had yet to try it.  \u000a\u000aMy go-to dispensary (Central Ave. Compassionate Care) had some so I picked up an 8th.  This stuff lives up to my expectations and reviews.  Full body &amp; mind buzz without the \u201cwhere\u2019s my phone? Oh, it\u2019s here in my hand!\u201d stuff.  I was also leery of getting the munchies due to its indica dominances.  No munchies experienced but I wouldn\u2019t call it an appetite suppressant lol.  \u000a\u000aDefinitely a new favorite.   My uses are for:  Arthritis (knee), stress, anxiety and insomnia.  All of which were minimized or eliminated during my time with BH.  To piggy back on some other reviews- my anxiety, which seems omnipresent, took a couple hour hiatus.  That in itself is worth the cost.

VSince my last review of this strain, I&#39;ve picked up a couple batches of Buddha&#39;s Sister testing above 20% THC (as all medical cannabis should *coughNETAcough*) and I have to say, I&#39;m confused. Personally, I need very strong medicine for chronic pain and insomnia. I love and prefer strains topping out at 30% active content (not that this batch was, only 23%), but this strain seems to better fit it&#39;s own name at lower potencies. At the low potency I tried (16%-ish), it is a very calm, uplifting strain. Good for pain during the day, but if you want to sleep you certainly can.\u000a\u000aThe higher potency batches I had are more like Buddha&#39;s angry sister who doesn&#39;t meditate and came to fight. The uplifting qualities transform into a more psychedelic state that comes on very strongly and rapidly, accompanied by the racy-ness of sativas. When the psychedelic state wears off it comes off very quickly, seeming to take away any medical qualities with it. On the 16% THC batch I could smoke a bowl and have a full 4 hours of good medicine. On the higher THC, it seems to wear off after about 2 hours which is weird as hell.\u000a\u000aOverall, I do really like this strain. However, I am going to be weary of the more potent harvests from now on. Too much of a sativa effect to be of any medical benefit. But the lower ones are perfect

VI smoked a large amount of Buddhas Sister and it was really, really intense. If you are not a veteran smoker or a high tolerance smoker you may want to get more experiences before hitting this strain because it will seriously wipe you out.\u000a\u000aWhile my anxiety was definitely dampened I had really serious cotton mouth and I became seriously paranoid. Smoke in a relaxed and comfortable environment, everyone!

VOne of my favorite indicas due to how versatile it is. It works absolutely well for both trouble falling/staying asleep as well as PTSD nightmares, not to mention it makes me more giggly. It even works well in small doses in the morning/afternoon to take stress off (even if it won&#39;t help focus you or energize you). It tastes great and has a nice aftertaste to it too, plus the smell (in my experience) isn&#39;t overwhelming or strong that, with proper precautions, no one else aside from you should be able to smell it that easily. The only downside (which I don&#39;t consider it to be much of one at all) is that the more high off this you get, the harder it is to talk to people or keep up with something someone is saying. Found that out the hard way saying good night to my girlfriend for a couple of nights.
