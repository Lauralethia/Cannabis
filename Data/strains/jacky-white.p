VHonestly I am prone to depression and anxiety and I rarely feel euphoria when high (I used to be addicted to opiate pills and nothing compares to that &quot;happy&quot; fake high). This gives me a happy high which is rare and hard for me to find but I feel actually happy on this strain. Yes.

VReally great strain. I give 5 out of 5. I am a total sucker for Jack Frost and I find similar effects with the more popular and readily available Jacky White. Also found that this is a good strain to smoke any way and really enjoyable as a joint. \u000a\u000aPerfect for mornings/ day time, Stress, depression, and if you want to be smiley. Great for pain when you want to be active.

VReview Jacky White purchased from DO Organics Cortez\u000aSo this is that kind of weed that is so smooth you can suck in big chestfuls without a burn. Mild taste. Burns long, meaty buds. This might be that kind of weed they call &quot;heady&quot; and gives an aesthetic head high annnnnd it&#39;s five minutes later and oh boy.  oh fuck. \u000ai am cleaning the house. Not the &quot;just a quick tidy-up&quot; kind of cleaning. There are buckets and mops and brooms and oh look a screwdriver.\u000aThere is no end in sight. \u000aI know this weed. \u000aIt&#39;s an hour later and the house is fucking spotless as it&#39;s ever been during a messy Colorado spring and I am on Facebook with a broom propped up on my knee, my headlamp shining brightly, cleaning supplies surrounding me. \u000aI&#39;ve been on Facebook for an additional hour. I&#39;ve also cleaned my Osprey laptop bag per manufacturer instructions and it&#39;s hanging in the laundry room drip drying. I may have also washed my Hi-Tecs. \u000aI know this weed.\u000aYou know this weed. \u000aThis is that weed. \u000a\u000aWill try again? Sure. \u000aOther: very little anxiety for a strain that creates intense focus.

VRelaxed-but-aware, fairly creative high. (Great for meditation) The strain is VERY resinous like its parent, White Widow. Used in my Crafty vaporizer, my sessions last twice as long compared to any other strain. Great genetics\u2014highly recommended if you can find some.

VI never get this close to sativa, but man, WHAT THE FUCK?! Kicked me to a pool of euphoria and energy, I&#39;m so happy and uplifted, thinking about plans for today, definitely bringing this strain with me. Literally impossible to stop whistling my favourite melodies, the music is amazing with Jacky White. I go for 5* because this is my intro to sativas and went well. Buds are amazingly resinous, sweet, berry flavour, reminds me so much of my first, Cinderella 99 strain. The day is just about to start!

VThis herb taste awesome! The combination of sweet fruit makes you immediately think about a tropical fruit salad. The buzz starts as a smooth funky mind buzz but strike you about 30 minutes later as a full blast body and mind high. Pain melt away instantly. Very powerful but forgiving. A bit too strong for beginners but a careful intermediate users will probably love this one! Not good if you have a lot of intellectual work to do but awesome strain for hiking since it kills the pain and motivate you by giving you a positive outlook on life.

VThis is a simple sativa with a great initial mental zing followed by a strong crash. I really enjoy the focus I get initially when I smoke. I\u2019m really able to be productive for about an hour, but when the crash comes it hits hard. I typically need to smoke again or take a nap after an hour.

VI have to say vaping this for 2 weeks now this is not one of my favorites, this stuff definitely creeps up on you; at first you might think it&#39;s a calm, serene, euphoric, and spacey high but smoke too much Jacky White and you&#39;ll get thrown into a dizzy mind numbing experience.

VWow! I grabbed this honey on my way home from work, packed a bowl and instantly I was blown away!! The hit was thick and really lung heavy, I&#39;m not a cougher but this got me. The high is just as intense. It shut me down for about 30mins and any motivation went out the window. The high is really short but that&#39;s not a big enough deal breaker, you get stoned as shit. If you want to get super high try and find this gem but if your looking to smoke and be active I&#39;d try something else. Love it!!
