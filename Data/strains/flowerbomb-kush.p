VTried this at the Greenhouse in Amsterdam last year. Fell in love with the smell and appearance of the flower instantly. The smoke was thick, heavy and very flavourful. Potent as all hell and long lasting so it&#39;s definitely more for the seasoned smoker. 10/10 for my all time favourite strain.

VI was grown and smoked the Flowerbomb Kush.\u000aThe cultivation did not really pay off.\u000aThe smoke is good. Strong stoned effect. Almost immediately starts to work. Medical level.\u000aThe taste is clean, white pepper and lightly spicy ginger. The smell slightly citrusy, slightly anise.\u000aMy summary of my assessment: 4/5.

VMy friend kept telling me how this was real fruity tasting and that I&#39;d really enjoy it and he was right! I absolutely love this strain! I found it to have a more earthy/spicy taste but smelt slightly fruity. Currently Watching Getting Doug With High while smoking this! If someone from the show sees this do more shows with an audience! and have them smoke this because oh my fuck that would be rad!!!

VMakes u silly. Nice cause not a lot heart racing. It definitely slow things down. I&#39;ve written like complex feminist disablity theory while on and it came out grammatically terrible but still made  sense. Not a good vinyl buddy though Doesn&#39;t make music crazy or do much for visual effects. Doesn&#39;t get rid pain just sort turns your pain into itchy hot feeling. Couldn&#39;t get much work done but I felt better painwise next day. It super dense and hard to grind but very potent. Doesn&#39;t taste like much either. Smell loud but not sour. I think I would like smoke it regularly and might even buy an 8th which is a lot for me cause I smoke a gram a week. Might mix with edibles to see what it like and will review occurdinyly
