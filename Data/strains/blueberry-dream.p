VI love this sativa hybrid. You can chill and focus or get up and get stuff done. It takes away my anxiety and sciatic pain. Feels slightly similar to strawberry cough.

VI am a Blueberry fan so I am a little biased when it comes to DbD. This is a great energizing med for me. I could smoke this for every meal. I like to be able to get up and do housework so this is a great medicine.

VThis is by far my favorite strain. I don&#39;t know how many of you are on anti depressants but sexually speaking always have boners but not able to finish. There is a mental block that is a wall that this brings down and has made my life so much better. It worked for me hopefully you will have the same effect

VI had Blueberry Dream in concentrate form as the first-ever thing I vaped.\u000a\u000aIt felt gentle but swift, and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. There was also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aBlueberry Dream is a 4 for me. It was a nice entry point, gentle with a beginner and effective, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s in my top 5. Top 10, maybe. I was also hoping for more creativity from it, but that&#39;s not really my experience with it. It&#39;s pleasant enough to get lost in while I&#39;m working on art, it lets me focus and get all wrapped up in painting or the written word, but it doesn&#39;t actively inspire me with a need to create. \u000a\u000aAnd then, about two hours later, it puts me to sleep.
