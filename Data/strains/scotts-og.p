VWow. Wow. Wow. Did I say wow? I think I covered it. Really great hybrid -- one of my favorites. Combines the best from both the indica and sativa worlds to create a very functional, extremely pleasant high...Again, wow. If you can find this strain, buy it.

VAny strain that has Rare Dankness #1 is going to be ultra dank. Not to mention that Triangle Kush on its own is a heavy hitter. The Scott&#39;s reminds me a lot of the Rugburn OG, one of my favorites, for its obvious OG hints and a more lemony flavor. This bad boy hits the body hard in the best way, right behind the eyes Stoney feel with a lovely body buzz that&#39;s sure to work out some kinks. Grows like an OG. I would be curious to see how this beauty does outdoors. If you are a heavy smoker, this is one to keep in the &quot;medicine cabinet.&quot;

VAbsolutely lifts pain and stress away. Great for that and feeling functional, as it also made me very talkative. Definitely brought about appetite as well. However, I didn&#39;t feel happy or euphoric. Instead, just like me but high and in less pain with less worry. The energizing effect is so much that I can&#39;t sleep on this strain, not that it&#39;s bad, as it&#39;s very much what I would call a functioning high. I find myself mixing it with other strains to see if I can get the pain benefits to work with a strain that has greater buzz effects on me. I try every strain with my favorite music. If I don&#39;t get completely into the music because it is enhanced by the strain, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m high enough. Scott&#39;s OG did not enhance my music.

I write these reviews right after puffing and right before looking them up on the site so I am very interested to see how my opinions on this one differ or concur! I only know if they are indica, sativa, or hybrid which are really tough because then I have to decide where their dominance lies, I have a better track record than I expected which is actually a nod to the farmers for growing a clean, strain specific, unadulterated, and organic product! Science and canibus are really getting under one another and lifting each other up-it\u2019s a very productive \u2b55\ufe0f I recommend this strain to anyone that can get their hands on it, for real, spend the &#128181;-this is what bud is all about!

VSmoking this was an incredibly pleasant experience - I felt immediately relaxed. The taste was light, crisp, and lemony. The effects were quite strong, and resulted in quite a night! My label reads 22.41% THC with the terpenes listed as follows:\u000a\u000aLimonene: 16.02 mg/g\u000aCaryophyllene: 10.62 mg/g\u000aLinalool: 9.45 mg/g

VThis earthy heavy hitter is just a few rungs under those hammer buds like Medicine Man/Woman strains and the old school Skunks. Outstanding cannabis with excellent proportional stonalities (my new mix match word: it&#39;s like the four or five C&#39;s of a diamond, you know?) \u000a\u000aTo all the OMMP patients looking for a heavy hitter, this should be right there in your cannaArsenal.

VThe overview of this strain is very accurate. Very potent stuff. 2 or 3 puffs to yourself and you will be content. A good head high but indica like effects make for a true hybrid experience. Although I&#39;m confused why it says it&#39;s not available in Seattle. I procure my product from a grower, and this strain is available every 3 or 4 weeks.

VI&#39;d probably give it 4 1/2 stars, if i could!!  I am a novice smoker, myself. I most definetly got high off this... And it was a nice, peaceful, and calming high. I can also think really clearly when I smoke this,  unless some strong strains that render you useless for the time being. I&#39;m sure happy i just so happened to come across this particular strain earlier.  &#128513;&#128516;&#128517;&#128514;&#128525;&#129303;&#128293;&#128168;&#128154;&#128527;

VAwful to grow, stretch was silly, intermodal distance was a joke.  When you do get.a decent harvest the smoke is average.  I just pulled 2 out of the garden that were puny with about a foot between nodes.  Also a weak stemmed strain.  Would never grow or smoke again.
