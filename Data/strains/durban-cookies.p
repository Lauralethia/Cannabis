VI enjoyed via dab. I think the most balanced high as of late. My head, face, eyelids, and forehead feel amazing. My neck feels great where it\u2019s resting on the couch. I could float there, but there\u2019s something keeping me engaged with what i want to do. Despite contentment, I had the energy to spring up and go pick up a tasty drink and cold water from the 7 Eleven. Some sativas can be equally debilitating as indicas; this hits the sweet spot. I can\u2019t fully zone into a movie with this strain. I think I would want one of those more debilitating strains for that, while this is the better multi tasking strain. I feel great mental energy. I haven\u2019t yet used it while exercising or cleaning, so I can\u2019t go as far as to say it\u2019s a good strain for chores or working out- but it feels like it!

V//From someone with Tourette\u2019s, mood disorders, and EDNOS//\u000aDefinitely now one of my favorite strains to smoke after a bad mental health day. Took my horrible mood and made me significantly happier in the matter of a couple hits. As for my Tourette\u2019s, it also helped a lot but I did tic a couple times; didn\u2019t phase me though. Personally I\u2019d recommend this strain to anyone with an anxiety disorder or mood disorder because it\u2019ll definitely do the trick.

VAwesome variant of the Cookies Strains.  Smoked half a bowl of this out of small glass pipe; Piney Smell, Piney Taste from the first toke and pleasant Piney aftertaste on the Palate :)   This was labeled a Hybrid by Apothekare Dispensary in San Diego.  I think Leafly is right on here.  This Strain is a Sativa !  Head High comes on quick and steady, the High is Uplifting, Crisp and Clear.  Easy to Focus on this strain.  God I wish I had this one in College !  While I walking to the Taco Shop I felt like I had lost 50 Ibs even though I have not lost any weight.  As the High Endures it becomes more spacey, but the Psychedelics are mild on this one.  No Racey Heart at all which is amazing given the energy this Strain was giving me.  Solid 2 hour high probably closer to 3 hours with Pleasant Mind and Body Relaxation as the high fades.  Definitely add this to your Strain Stash :)

VI could hear my thoughts a whole lot more on this. Mainly a mental/cerebral high with a nice body buzz. If you&#39;re looking for something more functioning and focus, then I would give Durban Cookies a try. With that said, and along with the energy boost it gives, you can find yourself being a lot more productive. And any physical activity would mix pretty well on this. Definitely a big mood changer as well. Excellent wake and bake, and day time strain. \u000aMedical use for Durban Cookies I would recommend pain and fatigue. The body buzz and cerebral will do well for high aches and migraines. The energizing side to this will clear brain fog and body fatigue. Will help with depression with the uplifting mood shift this gives. Could help with anxiety, though with the mental high this gives I would be careful.

Vdefinitely advertised more as a sativa than a hybrid but I believe this is a Durban Poison (straight sativa) and GSC(Girl Scout Cookies) cross which means there is some Indica capabilities.. seeing that Cookies is a hybrid and can be pretty heavy. This is what I categorize as a classic high. Definitely psychoactive, a general sense of well being, Visually stimulating but I can feel it in my body and it is doing incredible for pain relief. (20 min in after a gram joint) Also eyelids are heavy which reminds me of an Indica but I could get through a shift at work no problem or attend a social event. \u000a\u000aI typically smoke to alleviate stress \u000aI have a mildly high tolerance \u000aI typically smoke flower(joints) but am slowing down on the ash and looking to vaporize more of my product.
