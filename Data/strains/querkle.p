V7.5/10 &#127803; loved the aroma of grape koolaid and tree pine. Flavor profile was of heavy citrus &#127818; not overly sweet though still had a very woodsy herbal flavor. I experienced slight visual distortions &#127752; which usually happens after a good dose of a strong sativa strain, so that was unexpected but pleasant. &#128367;The body high was probably the best part, ZERO pain. Not even nerve pain which as of late has been bad. Very happy with overall appearance of the flowers too, they are dense &#127795;&#128144; and lime green not too many hairs but still has a great nose &#128067;&#127995; and effect. I smoked this strain continually from my bong and can say it&#39;s very expansive on the inhale especially after 4 or more good bowls. Rich thick smoke &#128168;&#127819;&#127815;of sweet lemons and grapes not too sweet again but overall a very complex fruit salad &#129367; type of flavor. Enjoy this one with a good movie or snack the appetite stimulation alone could have made eat my way through the weeks worth of groceries I just bought. Effects of this sort lasted the longest maybe about 3-5 hours for me. Fun strain &#128378;&#127999;very good for pain and appetite boost, sweet grape-ish flavor, do buy if you see this one locally around your dispensary or delivery. &#127803; *Disclaimer* these experiences/opinions are solely that of the author and in no way are EXACTLY what you might experience yourself upon consumption**.

VThis is hands down the very best for nights! Perfect for insomnia. Definitely stimulating the munchies which I don&#39;t care for but worth that as a side effect because the full body effect is profound for me, so relaxing and gently puts me to sleep. Upon wake up I feel very rested and not drugged! Perfect for stress, anxiety and PTSD. I use this in daytime only if super stressed and I don&#39;t get couch lock at all! Get this when you can!

VLately, Querkle has been my favorite strain for smoking buds. I feel creative and uplifted. Takes the stress away after a long day at work. No side effects and I don&#39;t feel lazy at all. Look for the popcorn buds with Querkle. Easier to identify the quality of it ;)

VI&#39;m a veteran with a very bad back. As my back gets worse, I get bad cases of insomnia and go weeks with little sleep. I have been looking for something to help me sleep. Not just make me tired, but knocks me out. My first try of Querkle 2, I took 3 hits. After the 3rd hit, I was tired and my eyelids were heavy. Laid down to watch TV at 6, and within minutes, my body just felt numb with my fingertips tingling. Fell asleep within 10 minutes. Woke up refreshed, believing I slept through the night. Was only 10. I only bought a gram to try. My next visit to the dispensary, I will be buying 7 grams.

VAbsolutely one of my favorite strains. Strain description cautions somewhat against daytime use - it is a bit of a drowsy/dreamy buzz, but if you have a veteran&#39;s tolerance (or access to a cup of good coffee), I see no problem with using Querkle during the day and still being productive. \u000a\u000aI find everything to be in balance with Querkle. The aesthetic is pleasing to the eye, especially the way the purple from it&#39;s Purple Urkle lineage threads through the buds. Like most purples, the flavors here are rich and floral, but without one terpene overwhelming the others. Very pleasant strain for recreational or medicinal needs.

VAfter having some purple purple urkle, I moved on to try querkle. Wonderful berry scent that in itself, (well at least for me) began the downfall of my days stress!  I did two rounds so far, both I smoked in a water-pipe. I am feeling good,, who the Heck has a Oreo?.... but I regress. In all truth a lot like its purple purple urkle half but yet the notice of the addition of Space queen dose smooth the heavy ness of the high a bit.. Still though not a strain for active tasks, a pm medication. Just what I was looking for in a high tonight so scores well with me and I would recommend this strain to troughs who are ready to melt and take it easy... peace love and .... damn I still got no Oreo! that reminds me!

VThis is honestly the best medical I have ever had. My uncle grows in Colorado, similar to this, but MUCH stronger, to the point it knocks you the fuck out whether you have a high tolerance or not. Querkle, though, it&#39;s the bomb in my own opinion. Able to either make you sleep peacefully or feel relaxed, pain levels go down for sure, my lower back up to my neck, before trying my medication, muscles stiff and sore from working out. After, still sore but not to the point I cannot stand or lie in bed a certain way due to the pain. Also find it slightly a motivation booster, so if you want to stay up and enjoy the euphoria whilst enjoying hobbies, etc, you can, (or at least I can,) orrr I can easily drift in to a great dreamlike state that eventually leads to wonderful sleep.

VBottom Line Up Front: \u000a Generally not an Indica kind of person but......I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good standalone for medicinal purposes.  This is a great late evening / before bed indica hybrid.  Onset is fairly quick, and you will soon find yourself couch locked but the sativa is just enough to keep you going without a zzzzz crash until much later in the high.   would make a great addition to to one\u2019s collection who is looking for a high-quality Indica hybrid.  Great for pain and insomnia.\u000a\u000aEmpirical Data and Value:\u000a	Out of the bag, you know you have some real medicine in your hand. Smell is pungent and uniquely musky. The smoke to follow is full and smooth but not much to taste.  Burned consistently to fine white ash (80/20) indicating proper growing/harvesting technique.  Above average smoothness. Value is there with long-lasting effects and a solid smoke to cash.\u000a

VGreat long lasting indica dominant breed! I used to be totally into sativa buds, but that was cause I was addicted to spice at the time and preferred the &quot;trippy speedy&quot; head high. But then I came across the worst pain I ever felt; irritable bowel syndrome. It&#39;s going to eventually progress to chron&#39;s disease, but even now cramping and muscle spasms and pain are among the symptoms. My dispensary&#39;s owners daughter told me about the beauty of an indica or indica-dominant hybrids and their medicinal qualities. So she gave me a very well priced bag of Querkle. I put a ground nug into my pipe, roasted it 5-6 times, and then... I was amazed. Cramping was completely gone, no pain in anyway was detected. The sativa gave me a fun head buzz with a heavy heavy low body buzz, all tingly and euphoric. I have then bought blue cheese, caterpillar, and some more querkle, its my current favorite and will always be something I will invest it. 8.5/10!

VQuerkle is awesome! Came home from working a 10. hour shift and my husband had this little treasure waiting to ease my back pain. I must say it did the trick and not only does my backfield better my whole body is deeply relaxed. This strain has a nice smooth earthy berry type of taste, it isn&#39;t harsh at all. it continues to give a nice cerebral high feeling through my whole body while I sit here and enjoy the feeling. I literally went from a pain level of around 9 after work and now I can comfortably say I&#39;m sitting at a 3, I would recommend this for pain management and relaxation as well.

That said, paired up with something like Purple Nepal, as a patient I know I will be getting my rest.

VI seem to get more sativa traits than indica with this strain. My heart races a bit which isn&#39;t fun for anxiety. But then there is a relaxing flow that comes over you. I mainly use this in tincture form in my tea, as smoking it jacks up my heart rate.

VI did not like this high.  Was way too heavy,  took one decent but and I was lost &amp; confused and paranoid.   Might be a great strain for a super heavy user but for an evening smoker it was just too much.  Munchie factor was low but so was my energy.  Did not feel relaxed just tired, stuck to the couch and unable to concentrate or focus.   Probably a great strain if you like all of the above.\u000a

VPersonally, I have had a good experience with this strain. It is very effective at nighttime for treating my PTSD symptoms and lulling me into sleep. However, if you are predisposed to becoming paranoid when smoking, this strain may not be the right fit for you. A good friend of mine had a very unenjoyable episode last night after smoking a relatively small amount of the stuff, so just be cautious if you are worried about increasing anxiety or paranoia.

VThis is by far my favourite strain. After recently switching to vaping, Querkle has an amazing flavour profile when you take those first couple of hits (and you really only do need a few hits to feel the impact) and the after-taste is smooth with a hint of lemon. Prepare for an intense, immediate cerebral rush that seems to distort time and then fades into a creeping body high that will leave you sedated. Perfect before bed, Querkle knocked me right out as I started to come down. Awesome. Great for relaxing and amazing for sleep.

VI really, really like Querkle.  So far, it&#39;s my favorite TGA strain, by far.  When vaped, it actually DOES have a grape taste to it!  I really like the taste and smell of this strain, very high-class marijuana.  Even though she is clearly indica-dominant in growth, she is no couch-lock.  Querkle acts much more like a sativa than an indica, but without the speediness of a lot of sativas.  This strain promotes a very creative, positive outlook for me that is perfect for writing or playing music, or enjoying the oputdoors.  It is, however, only moderately strong in effect, but the high really is top quality!

So, wow. \u000a\u000aThe one downside I noticed was that I ended up far more anxious than when I was sober. So, be careful. I noticed the second time around smoking it (I was in a good headspace to start), I felt good and my pain had subsided. Make sure to keep in tune with how you&#39;re feeling before you smoke this for more predictable results.

VI get mixed results with Querkle but I like it either way. First two times I used it I had a relaxed, sleepy, melt into the mattress kind of effect. When I used it last night (same batch) I was relaxed but certainly aroused in a way that wont allow melting into the mattress ;). \u000a\u000aIts a good choice for a beginner prone to anxiety/chest tightness. Even when it didn&#39;t put me to sleep how I wanted I still felt rested and pretty calm. \u000a\u000aNo particular flavor but im not too into that.

VQuerkle is awesome! Came home from working a 10. hour shift and my husband had this little treasure waiting to ease my back pain. I must say it did the trick and not only does my backfield better my whole body is deeply relaxed. This strain has a nice smooth earthy berry type of taste, it isn&#39;t harsh at all. it continues to give a nice cerebral high feeling through my whole body while I sit here and enjoy the feeling. I literally went from a pain level of around 9 after work and now I can comfortably say I&#39;m sitting at a 3, I would recommend this for pain management and relaxation as well.

VSmells great but the I wish it tasted just as good as it smells.  Can&#39;t say I tasted much grape but willing to try some more growers varieties.  The high is bomb.  Calming but clear headed with euphoria.  Smooth well balanced high ends well for next session.

VI got this prescribed to me at GMC, is very dense and little buds. Smoke is not too strong and it made me feel a bit dopey and dizzy. It helped for sleep but it is definitely not a day time weed.
