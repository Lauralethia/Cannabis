VTasty and frost. Look definitely a 5! To quote the canadian lyricist Drake. &quot;0 to 100 real quick&quot; ...defines how high you feel, and just as you peak, you&#39;re so stoned you don&#39; t realize that you&#39;re coming down. I just wished it lasted longer.

VI am prone to anxiety, so I normally stick to Indicas and high CBD strains. I don&#39;t know why I experimented with this stuff, but it&#39;s a bad fit for me personally. Just a few hits made me cranky and paranoid. YMMV

VIt is a good strain for novices or maybe monthly users but lacks a good taste. The batch I got was a little harsh but did present the effects I was looking for. However, I have been smoking for 15 years on and off, so I might have a slightly higher tolerance and I am very particular when it comes to a strain being a smooth and tasty smoke. If you are just starting out, I would recommend this strain and a few others to figure out what you like.
