VWell to be honest, I was drawn to this bud because of the name! Then the look &amp; smell. Lol. But, so glad I did! I always like to try different weed . We got this from the Clean Green Patient Services Dispensary, the test results showed the THC was 21.2% and overall 24.7% total cannabinoids profile. It was a little bit on the pricey side, but hey why not \u221a it out. I guess it is a Michigan hybrid, don&#39;t see that out here. Anyways, this stuff rocks!! This one has it all, the look, smell, structure &amp; medicinal value, oh and the name: FROSTED FREAK.

VA rare Michigan strain that deserves some respect. I have tried many strains promising relief from my PTSD, but none work quite like Frosted Freak does. It never causes anxiety, paranoia or stress. This medicine actually calms me down, making my issues more bearable with a gentle warmth that I can feel through out my body. My mindset changes. I feel comfortable &amp; at peace. I am very appreciative to find this one &amp; want to spread the word for other Veterans that are looking for some help. This one work

This stuff rocked my depression away &amp; put me into a comfortable trance of bliss that lasted for rest of the evening. Glad I found this at the Michigan Medical Cup.

VMy first review! Why? Well, this one caught my attention. I don&#39;t like couch lock, paranoid, laziness or traits in pot that usually keeps me from using it. But many of my peers &amp; veteran users kept telling me, don&#39;t give up, when you find  that one, &quot;the one&quot;  the special one that actually helps you, you will definitely know it. Cannabis has such a versatile existence as to say every strain is different &amp; has their own different qualities, &amp; effects. What is great for a remedy to one  maybe totally opposite of another, the great diversity of marijuana. There are so many, but with research, trial &amp; error sooner or later you will find one that fits like a glove.\u000aWell, I see all the authority&#39;s of friendship has finally rang true! \u000aFrosted Freak is my Atalanta. What is Atalanta? Google it! Ha! Just a remarkable, super female that has finally graced my world &amp; has changed it forever! \u000aSeriously, PTSD disappears when FF is used, scares away stress &amp; depression!!!

VA new favorite! Very relaxing! Pretty &amp; super crystal coated, see why the name Frosted Freak, it is Freaky covered. When smoking it is like smoking hashish. Hash, piney&amp; minty taste!\u000aGreat for stress and anxiety!\u000a&#129303;
