VThis strain has risen into my top  10.  This amazing strain has a piney, sweet taste with an undertone of mint.  it&#39;s delicious.  the smoke is so smooth you can easily take pulls from the spliff... My lungs are trained, but this has never made me cough.  The high is relaxing but not terribly sedating.  The bag I got definitely leaned towards sativa dominant because my mind was alive with great thoughts.  Focus to do paperwork, clean the house, or just spend a few hours in introspective thought.  All aground great bud

VPeppermint Cookies by Gold leaf Gardens Listed as a hybrid and I think that&#39;s accurate. \u000a\u000aIf I remember correctly it is 24% THC with an effect that left me feeling talkative and gave me the munchies. The descriptions of it being sweet minty and honey like are true I also picked up a bit of pepper too.\u000a\u000aThis is a good all around strain that I haven&#39;t heard a complaint about as it seems agreeable to most who partake.

VThis strain is easily the best strain I have ever smoked, the high consists of trips. Good and bad, have greened out twice on them which is a slight negative however once was with homemade brownies. Overall love this weed and requires so little to get one high.

VIf you\u2019ve purchased Peppermint Cookies by Gold Leaf Gardens like I have, you\u2019re also in AWE! This took first place hybrid in 2015 and after consuming you\u2019ll understand why. Looks lovely with sparkly Trichomes all over and is very sticky and extremely euphoric. The most enjoyable flavor I\u2019ve tasted in ages, never ashy, a 5/5 experience. FIRE!!

VPeppermint cookies by X-tracted in a sugar wax it has a listed THC of 69.31% and is a hybrid\u000a\u000aThe effect was a nice active mellow that had me relaxing after my day of work and was happy to chat it up with co workers after our sesh.\u000a\u000aFlavor was Pepper and mint in a nicely separated way that had pepper in front with mint at the back end. Very enjoyable.

VWOW! We went looking for something festive for the holidays and we found it! A little on the dry side so it crumbled very easily.  However, the taste is great, the smell before burning was a little earthy and flowery.  During burning it was a hypnotic scent...not over powering...but just right.  Effects...uplifting, comfortable, holly-jolly, relaxed, in-tune to everything and dry mouth.  Bottle of water needed!  Highly recommend and hope to keep this in my favorites.

VThe smell and taste of peppermint cookies is that of original GSC mixed with a sweet and skunky smell and flavor.  Any product that Gold leaf produces is top notch quality and even better they are clean green certified (pesticide and herbicide free). So you can have peace of mind when smoking or dabbing their products. The peppermint cookies strain has a very heavy effect on the body but provides enough cerebral to not knock you out right away. Peppermint cookies is by far is the best tasting strain I have come across!

VExcellent looks and taste 4 out of 5 stars!  Gold leaf grows some amazing flower!! I&#39;m curious though is this somehow different than the thin mint cookies?  I get mostly an original cookies smell and taste to it..  Not a bad thing but I&#39;m interested to know the story behind the genetics of this strain.  Also the smell is not &quot;loud&quot; more of a mellow sweetness.. Overall though I would recommend it especially because gold leaf puts a lot of love into growing it. &#128077;&#127996;
