VAloha! \u000a\u000aWhat an honor to be the 420th person to review this legendary strain, a personal favorite of Bob Marley&#39;s verified by his &#39;Ohana (family) who still cultivate the strain to this day sown Nine Mile in Jamaica.\u000a\u000aLambsbread is named after the Rastafarian spiritual belief that the holy herb is in fact the &quot;bread of the lamb&quot; or the bread of life from Jah that feeds us spiritually.\u000a\u000aWhile some people have taken to taken to calling it &quot;lamb&#39;s breath&quot; this name is incorrect according to those cultivating the strain in Jamaica for the last 50 plus years.\u000a\u000aLambsbread is still cultivated by Bob Marley&#39;s &#39;Ohana in Jamaica and can be seen grown in her homeland by his cousin Sledger in the documentary &quot;Sledger&quot; recently released on Youtube by Pua Mana &#39;Ohana.\u000a\u000aHere is a link to the film you can watch free of charge out of Jah Love:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpdJuiE6iU\u000a\u000aAs for cultivation of the strain Lambsbread is a looong flowering Jamaican sativa but worth every second of patience cultivated.\u000a\u000aThose who can make the 16 plus week trip to harvest are assured to be treated to one of the finest delicacies in all of the cannabis kingdom.\u000a\u000aJah guide and provide &#39;Ohana!\u000a\u000aAloha a hui hou,\u000aPua Mana &#39;Ohana

VThis is one of the nicest strain&#39;s i&#39;ve picked up since getting my card. The buds are bright green, fluffy, with a fair bit of crystals and some nice brown hairs. For lack of a better term, it smells like some dank. The buzz is a pure Sativa head high, incredibly mellow and a little spacey. I laid back on my bed, with my eyes closed feeling like I was floating before I realized how much time had passed. I took another toke, and within maybe 25 minutes I was asleep all day and woke up the next day feeling lovely. Recommended for anyone who&#39;s stressed out, anxious or needs to unwind in general.

VThis heavenly strain is the reason I decided to start an account here! Normally, I am an indica user, since I&#39;ve had bad experiences with anxieties related to sativas. After hearing so much about Lamb&#39;s Bread and the fact the it&#39;s Bob Marley&#39;s fave... I pulled the trigger and bough a g from CPA in the OC...\u000aMedicated really well on this one. None of those jitters and anxieties commonly associated with sativas. Really felt happy and general sense of well-being. I found myself at peace with the world as I sank into my bed, floating away...

VNothing on the planet relieves my stress faster or better than this shit. I drove miles yesterday to a dispensary that had some Lb testing at almost 30% THC, which I had never seen before. (Usually it&#39;s in the low to mid 20s, and I&#39;ve had some in that range that was fire.) Took half the day to get it, but it was well worth the time. I fired up a bowl as soon as I got home, and no shit, every bit of tension in my mind, body, and soul melted away with one hit. It was a weird, difficult week, and the Lb just totally turned the page for me. For the first time all week, I was able to just chill...and I smoke every day, but NOTHING eases the mind like this stuff. Probably my favorite strain for that reason. And it&#39;s a mellow cerebral-energy kind of stone that allows me to be as functional as I want to be; hours later, I&#39; so relaxed I could go to sleep. But honestly, I never want to sleep through this high! Btw, I looked at the menu again today for the dispensary where I got this 30% shit, and they sold out already. It&#39;s that kind of weed.

So I tryed making some live Rosin (after a few failed attempts) but in the end I successfully did it.! ( dont give up )  I extracted some live Rosin, with out using any BHO&#39;S (butane) or Chemicals. The 3 things I used to extract the live rosin a.k.a THC from my cannabis is.. 1) Cannabis itself.lol duhhh. 2) Heat (hair straightener) 3) Parchment paper that&#39;s it.!  The entire process takes 3-5 minutes.  It&#39;s definitely worth it. \u000a\u2661 &amp; Peace....

VThis was delicious (at least my cut was).  The aroma was dried pineapple with notes of mango, a spicy, hashy exhale and sweet aftertaste. The high was extremely creative, made me happy and euphoric as well. Colors seemed more vibrant, food tasted better, my sense of smell was heightened, and music just sounded better. Tapered off into a more meditative buzz, great for a mid-day smoke.

VOne of my go to stains for a mood lifter. This strain won&#39;t get you super stoned but it will wipe away and bad mood almost immediately.  Just a couple doses and any bad day will quickly turn around. Great day time Sativa to get things done and to energize you to be social.  Great for PTSD and anxiety issues.  Effects last one or two hours for the seasoned user with no &quot;crash&quot;. It gently brings you down the same way it brings you up.  Not a crazy high but just like any Sativa, a super high dose might bring on slight paranoia so take it easy. The flavor is mild with maybe a slight puppy breath smell that lingers in the air.

VAfter years of smoking bud, this was my first pure sativa.  I didn&#39;t truly appreciate what people meant by &quot;soaring high&quot; until I smoked some of this herb.  I took one very modest hit, and I  didn&#39;t taste much; it was very smooth.  After  2 minutes I could feel my mind start to kick in.  It was straight to the head, and  I wasn&#39;t sure If I was gonna sit back down or go for a walk at first.  But I resisted the urge to be parnoid and sort of sat back and just went with the cerebral flow which felt like I was taking off, but it wasn&#39;t scary just never experienced such a high that was so purely mental.  It&#39;s like a plane taking off, at first you feel the rush of the acceleration but once at altitude, you feel a certain calm about it.  I see great potential in this type of high, but I need to adjust to it a bit.  Normally you feel a sort of body high with a bit of mental mixed into it....Lambs Bread goes straight to the dome in a hurry which makes it feel very powerful.  This aint no sitting weed.

VIf you happen to come across the actual genetic lambs bread, you will be met with a distinct scent, highly reminiscent of the Chemo strain. This scent is recognized for it&#39;s analogous effects. The first symptoms are intense euphoria, akin to the feeling of joy &amp; gratitude. The unexpected rush of the feeling of happiness overwhelms every other emotion and grounds you into a state that one could only reach through deep meditation/sleep. Tremendous psychological healing potential as well as physical. To summarize this strain&#39;s effects: nostalgia, euphoria, joy, harmony, groundedness, and all those sum up to the emotion of faith.

VWhat a great strain Lavender Lambs Bread from The Green Solution is.  While THC is scored at 16% the effect was like 24%.  Crystallization was very heavy. Very kick-back kind of high due to the Lavender.  Flavor is excellent with an almost hoppy smell.  With a Jamaican heritage, you&#39;ll see why Jamaican has always been so highly favored.  Lb is one of the best and Cinderella 99 can&#39;t be missed.  ns

I&#39;ve been a heavy smoker with a high tolerance when it comes to getting ceilinged and this did the job amazingly. This bud got me higher than I had been in a long long time. It was a very powerful clear headed, uplifting high that lasted me a good 5-6 hours. Simply amazing strain. Definitely in my top 10 all time.

VLime Green with pale hairs, frosted with a thick layer of trichomes, nice dense buds with minimal stem.  \u000aSmell could be described as &#39;fresh&#39; or &#39;spicy&#39;, the taste was very clean, albeit faint and left me unsatisfied.  \u000a\u000aSativa high elevated my mood and made me want to do something... anything really! Better to have a gameplan before smoking or you&#39;ll find yourself daydreaming. High gives off many inspiring thoughts; Buzz is of medium length and shortly after an hour the comedown begins.\u000a\u000aThis is a great sativa to keep the positive energy flowing, a great initial pick-me-up with a shorter than average duration. The energy and focus from this bud makes your medicated state easy to keep on the DL, to anyone else it just seems like youre in a very good mood.\u000aEarthsource; Fresno, CA

VTotally incredible.  Different than anything else under the Sativa style family.  Magical and sacred.  Joyous and harmonious.  Earthy, spicy coffee flavour with fruity overtones.  Hits fast and consistently, no creeping.  Can work well in small doses or really launch the user when used in quantity.  Incredible positive mood booster.  Doesn&#39;t affect sleep - sheer perfection.\u000a\u000aJamaican Royalty, don&#39;t miss it.  I&#39;ve been waiting almost 30 years to get my hands back on this strain, and I am very very pleased I did.

VLamb&#39;s Bread is moderately energetic, very uplifting, and cerebral. Effects were similar to Harlequin, but significantly more psychoactive. I find this to be a great medicine for taking care of jobs around the house. Pain relief was minimal and there was a little anxiety, but I find this to be one of few pure Sativas I enjoy.

VThis review is for the cannabis strain, \u201cLambsbread x Sour Diesel\u201d grown by Organic Cannabis Growers Society in Eugene, Oregon. \u000aFunny that Leafly doesn\u2019t have this strain listed. All that shows is Lambsbread.\u000a\u000aI picked this as one of my 10 samples of entries at Eugene\u2019s first Ganjacon event.\u000a\u000aCannabis is not a social thing for us. After 45+ years of involvement with this healing plant and 5 years of guerrilla growing at the turn of the century in the Midwest, we limit ourselves to Sunday afternoons as the only day we indulge. As a result, our tolerance level is always fresh and our lungs aren\u2019t worn out. We use it as a tool for deepening our spiritual quest with unique healing music from India that takes us very, very high.\u000a\u000aTwo hours at GanjaCon was plenty. I had 9 samples, and was uninterested in the smoking tent (was there one?) \u000aOrganic Cannabis Growers Society booth was the last one I was lucky enough to happen upon tucked back in a corner.\u000aI had one tab left on my wristband and saw the varieties they had. \u201cLambsbread x Sour Diesel\u201d jumped into my awareness and I grabbed it. (I was saddened that I only had one tab seeing their strains)\u000aLike a kid with his bag of candy, I headed homewards to investigate the heritage of each strain I picked. \u000aExcept for maybe two, all were Sativa or Sativa dominant hybrids. Not much for the couch-lock of Indicas.\u000aThe next decision was what strain were we going to taste on our Sunday. \u201cLambsbread x Sour Diesel\u201d continued to show up on the mind\u2019s screen, so that was what we burned. Unlike our earlier days, we have become light users comparatively, usually starting with two puff\u2019s only. They are small, maybe 1/32 tsp one hitters. After my second hit, I considered a third but thought to see how the two puffs stacked up. I am really happy I didn\u2019t take that third. This \u201cLambsbread x Sour Diesel\u201d is powerful and not for the faint of heart. The effects started within a few minutes but after maybe 10-15 minutes really kicked in. Very cerebral, not just physically but mentally clear and strong. One needs an anchor to keep from getting swept up in the mental whirlwind. That is our music.\u000aThis\u201cLambsbread x Sour Diesel\u201d reminded me of a trip to Jamaica in 1999 when we got some Lambsbreath weed there. It was so powerful to the extent of paranoia possibly becoming an issue.\u000aAs the day progressed we felt very clear headed, energetic and productive. It did not produce the stupidness that getting stoned can easily do. We liked Organic Cannabis Growers Society\u2019s \u201cLambsbread x Sour Diesel\u201d so very, very much. To the extent of thinking that next week we have to try something else? \u000aThe THC analysis showed 17%. Do not be fooled by what seems like a lower THC. \u000aThe terpenes that these two strains together have created will throw you into a soaring high.\u000aSince living in Eugene, I was always looking for a strain that would surpass the AK-47 I grew.\u000aThis does it\u2026far and away the most powerful, fun strain I\u2019ve had.\u000aWe voted it our favorite in GanjaCon.

VI have heard many lovely things about this strain and when I finally got ahold of some in concentrate form of all kinds It definitely did not let down. This is an amazing Sativa, makes you feel good and happy while still being totally blowed in the back ground. Very creative strain, easily best for Depression, Anxiety, Spasms etc. This has climbed to my top 3 favorite Sativa overnight, if you find it in flower or concentrate definitely give it a puff you will not be let down! Marley was right on this one my friends!

VThis strain is mahvelous.  I am a micro doser as this is the method that best serves my medical needs.  I&#39;m a firm believer in moderation and using the smallest  dose possible that gets the job done.  Want to avoid tolerance issues as well. Not interested in trippy highs and dumbass conversations at my age (54).  This beautiful medicine will get you high for sure, but you won&#39;t act - or feel - stupid.  For those prone to depression and most especially for those with ever-present anxiety  (like me), this is wonderful. No paranoia. I still feel like I&#39;m in control with this one. Definitely could go out and about and function without  crippling self-consciousness. This makes my social anxiety GO AWAY.   My preferred delivery method is vaping (occasionally smoking) herb.   So happy to have found a med that makes me feel ONLY PLEASANTLY high, happy as hell, clear-headed and able to focus. Would be perfect for those with a creative bent as well.  Great for aches and pains. I have severe joint pain from cancer maintenance drug, and while pain is still present, I don&#39;t process it as much mentally with this stuff which provides tremendous relief.

Vyeah i believe the lambs bread is a mix of O Haze x skunk it makes sense if you ever had this strain completely organic you can taste both strains prominently also it makes sense because this strain came out of Jamaica late 70&#39;s early 80&#39;s when skunk was the main hybridized strain before kush became popular and haze was the pride of Jamaica during that time too so it makes sense in both time and flavor. if you really want to get in depth  it retains the potency of the skunk but the dominate flavor and bud structure of haze this means most likely that haze received the pollen from skunk taking away the couch-lock of skunk but not the predominate head high that people grow it solely for replacing it with the typical haze energy/ euphoria greatness not found in early skunk phenotypes it also shows it early on being fussy to grow a sign of haze dominate genetics skunk being easier to grow though has lightens the load of this strains know how and has made and excellent hybrid making lambsbread

VI&#39;ve been using marijuana medicinally for about five months to treat my depression and anxiety. This is following 20 years of unsuccessful treatment with at least 60 different psychotropic drugs. Lamb&#39;s Bread is my first foray into the Sativa strain. I&#39;ve been sticking to Indicas due to fear of making my anxiety worse. Lamb&#39;s Bread is a game changer. Effects were immediate after taking about 2 hits from a bong. I felt &quot;normal&quot; almost immediately. I felt clear headed and more emotionally stable than I have felt in ages. I had a period of intense introspection (I was able to think about some topics that generally I can&#39;t even think about because they makes me crazy anxious or feel suicidal) and then was able to redirect my energy to my work. I felt calm and level headed during work meetings that often send me into despair. I accomplished more desk work in a one hour period than I had previously been able to do in a week. I conversed with coworkers and laughed out loud at funny things that I would normally have just smiled at. It was really, really nice. Probably the best I have felt in 25 years. Residual effects lasted through my six hour work day. Still feel good 9 hours after smoking. Did cause a crazy dry mouth.

VTried many different strains and am keeping a log of all my Indica/Sativa/Hybrid experiences. This is by far the best mind/body experience I&#39;ve been looking for. Everyone kept saying you&#39;re an Indica personality but that could be wrong. Effervescent, spiritual mind high with a little body mixed in for good measure and total relaxation. In some reviews some have had anxiety and headaches and I can report headaches can come the day after but not while enjoying. A very pleasant smoke with nice earthy tones, esp. pine so sit in the woods and enjoy this is one fine smoke and may be my &quot;go to&quot; for ever more. Cheers!

VI acquired this strain from the helpful folks at Nature&#39;s Leaf Collective, and I was super impressed by it.  It definitely has a piney smell with fruit undertones, with a taste to match.  After smoking a bowl, I was left feeling completely euphoric, calm, and blissful, and while I could feel energy buzzing in my body, I decided to chill on our futon, giggling at my friends playing video games.  The only real downside was that it was a bit hard to wake up the next morning.  Aside from that, all I could feel was happiness, creativity, and euphoria.  It makes for a nice nighttime smoke, but I&#39;d also recommend it for a daytime blaze.  This is definitely my new favorite, soaring past Holy Grail and Green Crack.

VIt&#39;s been about 20 minutes since I smoked a small nug of Lamb&#39;s Bread aka Lamb&#39;s Breath. And, I must say I&#39;m feeling pretty darned comfortable sitting here. I&#39;m relaxed and my pain has dropped to a dull throb. Not getting any kind of energy boost but I&#39;m able to think clearly and am feeling happy. Which may not sound like much, but when you&#39;re in the midst of an extreme fibro flare like I am right now, comfy&#39;s like a dream come true. Can&#39;t wait to try some when I&#39;m feeling better. Lb makes my current top 5 Sativa list. Enjoyed the flavour and lightness of the smoke.

VThe herb I&#39;m reviewing isn&#39;t the medicinal mix up you get from the (medicinal) coffeeshop, authentic Lamb&#39;s Bread comes from Jamaica and is hard to come by elsewhere. Fortunately I know a place where they have it and when you smoke you get instant rasta vibes mon. You feel good, relaxed but not a heavy stoned or sky high. Just good weed, I&#39;d advise it for creative efforts and moments of introspection. Peace&amp;love.

VMy Lamb&#39;s Breath is 6 weeks into the flowering stage. She looks and smells divine. This is by far 1 of the top 5 best cannabis strains I&#39;ve ever smoked. It&#39;s THC levels are known to reach up to 25%THC,  which is what I&#39;m looking for when smoking cannabis. Thank you Lamb&#39;s Breath!  \u2661\u2661\u2661&amp;Peace...

VI love this strain! It is easy on the lungs and super potent. I feel it in my head first and then it creeps down into a nice body high. I feel relaxed when I smoke this. Not couch-lock relaxed, but just mellow and smiley. My daily stress vanishes when I smoke this. It&#39;s not racey and it doesn&#39;t give me headaches. A nice balanced strain. I can smoke this before bed to fall asleep and I&#39;ll sleep through the night. It&#39;s all around a smooth and pleasant experience. Kinda reminds me of the stone I get from smoking Liberty Haze(another awesome strain). I don&#39;t get wicked munchies either with this, which is cool. Definitely a new favorite for sure.

V I can&#39;t really put me finger on the smell and taste , almost a bit lemony but very strong smelling of this rich chronic sent, it&#39;s very tasty . The high you get from a couple of nice hauls of this stuff is super pleasant, keep smoking and you get nice and effin ripped with pretty well no tiredness. Has kind of an upbeat tingly heady kinda buzz, but super relaxing the shit out of your mind. The high is pretty long lasting too. love this strain.

VI have enjoyed a few pulls of the vape with this Sativa, at 17 percent THC the buzz is nice, however this Weed lifts you and gives you a lil pep, yet while easing anxiety. This is a nice sticky strain that feels great.

Vat first its really heady. you&#39;ll be lost in your thoughts . the high felt like waves coming and going. each time the waves getting stronger and stronger. then your body starts to relax until you feel like its time to take a nap. then just smoke again and get even higher

VVery subtle taste. The effects make this a good daytime, get-things-done type of strain. My local dispensary sold it under the name &quot;Lamb&#39;s Breath&quot;. This strain is immortalized in reggae culture, and is known for being Bob Marley&#39;s favorite. A type of strain that will keep you focused and competent. I didn&#39;t think people would be able to tell I am medicated, like I sometimes do. Felt like doing some chores or errands.

VSets in very quickly.  Almost exclusively a cerebral high; very little body side-effects.  Thoughts are not organized; would not be a good strain to use before needing to accomplish tasks.  Uplifting high, not necessarily giddy, but uplifted.

VInspired by RX420&#39;s review from 10 days ago... I must confirm all that was written about this strain review from Fall 2017. My experiences with this strain were just as intense and again shows the importance of terrior in evaluating / reviewing a landrace strain. There is NO DOUBT in my mind that he had the genuine article in the beautiful town of Montego Bay, Jamaica. \u000aMy experience with this strain was also in Montego Bay, Jamaica but in the year of 1984. I was vacationing in Montego Bay , Jamaica with my native born Jamaican girlfriend. She was a Christian woman - not a Rastafarian - No offense intended. Her close friend obtained Top Shelf Lambs Bread . I  obtained a full OZ of Lamb&#39;s Bread from the mountain town of Anchovy, Jamaica; paying about $50.00 per OZ in 1984. The large chocolate buds ( 2-3 grams per bud!!) had a few seeds but were covered in trichomes and were well cured. The smoke was  pungent, earthy, herbal and slightly harsh. We had two 1.5 gram joints which we shared together. The intense sativa high for both of us lasted 6-8 hours  and was very speedy, trippy, aphrodisiac, and spiritual The effects were profound - music sounded wonderful, verbal communication was also improved to the point of telepathy. Not appetite inducing at all  and very speedy so that sleep was impossible for 1.5 days. Felt an intense , consuming love for others on both a spiritual and natural plane. Not mellow - Way too intense for the novice user, The 2 joints produced an intense, trippy sativa high that did not wear off until late in the afternoon the next day. What was unusual was that the high was impossibly strong but not out of control or anxious. Unfamiliar and ugly people could and would  produce paranoia / anxiety. The only negative effects were red eyes and dry mouth. This is a wonderful landrace variety - consistently producing the same effects. Had a similar experience with imported,  genuine lambs bread in 2009... In this case, believe the hype, get a passport, and journey to Jamaica. You will not be disappointed.  One of my top 3 favorite strains -  have not seen recently.

VLamb&#39;s Breath is really decent overall strain and great for just about any kind of smoker. It is a sativa but rather than a huge head high I got a nice mix of a mind and body stone; it also makes you feel happy and good, prime stress relief. Taste was very interesting, it really does have a weird, slight buttery/creamy type taste but it isn&#39;t bad either though. Nugs were nice looking and not loose, busted well too. Would recommend to anyone!

VGrabbed a quarter of this when I had the chance, and I&#39;m very glad I made the effort.  The buds were some of the biggest, most beautiful I&#39;ve ever seen.  The high is instant euphoria and a mental trip, followed by a perfectly relaxed and mellow body high as it settles in.  Some of the most &quot;feel good&quot; pot I&#39;ve ever had, had me feeling like a lamb frolicking and grazing in a field of clover.  Being a sativa this stuff could get a bit intense and anxiety inducing depending on the consumer, but overall this is magical stuff, don&#39;t pass it up!

V2nd time trying this strain, and only one place in town had it Arizona Selections. So went home  opened the bag, threw these light neon greenish looking medium nugs with orangish brown hair on a tray..boom. Started breaking them down ohhh so easy and  somewhat of a soft cushion like texture. First draw, tolerable woody taste it might come off harsh to some but by the time you hit it 4-5 times mate it won&#39;t even matteri it just start tasting fruity. Wrapped with a Dutch Master it burns none stop all the way till the roach. Ha, now the feeling of softness just covers whatever muscalar(torn muscle) =chronic pain your body is feeling, relaxes your mind like a headband is wrapped around my head, so if you have plans it partially leaves you confused like Shakespeare, whom also might have been puffing on this strain when he asked the question to be or not to be.... no more babbling...drove 40 miles to get it.....#Coming your way Scottsdale Saturday

VVery subtle taste. The effects make this a good daytime, get-things-done type of strain. My local dispensary sold it under the name &quot;Lamb&#39;s Breath&quot;. This strain is immortalized in reggae culture, and is known for being Bob Marley&#39;s favorite. A type of strain that will keep you focused and competent. I didn&#39;t think people would be able to tell I am medicated, like I sometimes do. Felt like doing some chores or errands.

V2nd time trying this strain, and only one place in town had it Arizona Selections. So went home  opened the bag, threw these light neon greenish looking medium nugs with orangish brown hair on a tray..boom. Started breaking them down ohhh so easy and  somewhat of a soft cushion like texture. First draw, tolerable woody taste it might come off harsh to some but by the time you hit it 4-5 times mate it won&#39;t even matteri it just start tasting fruity. Wrapped with a Dutch Master it burns none stop all the way till the roach. Ha, now the feeling of softness just covers whatever muscalar(torn muscle) =chronic pain your body is feeling, relaxes your mind like a headband is wrapped around my head, so if you have plans it partially leaves you confused like Shakespeare, whom also might have been puffing on this strain when he asked the question to be or not to be.... no more babbling...drove 40 miles to get it.....#Coming your way Scottsdale Saturday

VJah bless! This strain is the real deal. Said to have been a favorite of Bob Marley. I can believe it. A very quick onrush of what can best be described as a universal, &quot;one love&quot; connectedness and euphoria. You feel intertwined with all the love in the universe, all at once. Your mental state will be happy, calm, relaxed, at ease, creative, and sociable. You will not get completely fucked up and act like a complete imbecile, which can happen with some of the more modern sativas and sativa hybrids. Forget that noise. Smoke this to find a wonderful bliss and inner peace. \u000a\u000aFantastic medication for depression and anxiety. That you can still function while baked on this strain is a major bonus.

VI really like this sativa. I can *actually* do math on this strain! I can also smoke a decent amount during the day and it doesn&#39;t put me on my ass. I&#39;m very anxiety prone and this strain does not induce anxiety for me--huge plus. Enables me to keep thinking and be very functional.. go to the store, children&#39;s museum, anything. At night, I can smoke a ton of this without getting too sleepy to where it knocks me out, and when I&#39;m ready for bed, I&#39;m asleep right away. However, the dry mouth is unreal with this strain! Don&#39;t be caught dead without a drink! Enjoy!

VOne of the best Sativa&#39;s i have ever had. At 95% Sativa it had my mind racing with thoughts while leaving my body alone. My buds were beautiful. While not dense the buds were full and not as pop corn like buds of most Sativa&#39;s. The trichomes were many and some so big they looked like mini diamonds among the bud. Smelled and taste of pine and skunk to me. Nice change of pace for an Indica lover as myself :)\u000a\u000aPEACE

VFound this sativa to have a lot in common with Alaska Thunder Fuck as far as its effects, very energetic head buzz that fades fairly quick but can creep up again if you change your setting. Good clear headed sativa for when you need to get things done but a little too mild for me 3.5/5.

VI was having a high anxiety, borderline panic attack  kind of day.  This stuff did he trick.  I don&#39;t feel nervous or out of breath any more.  Just chilling watching a movie now and feeling the urge to write, so here I am!  I have trouble sleeping when my partner is out of town on a photography trip like he is now.  Anxiety is a bitch.  This strain really helped me today.  That, and my cats.  :-)  It&#39;s also the peak of my PMS time, and that&#39;s not helping the emotional stress.  Moodiness feels even now.

Maybe it&#39;s good for the people that function all day with a buzz, but, it isn&#39;t great for chilling out and wanting to have a good time.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m annoyed I have so much of this stuff.

VI finally got the pleasure of trying lamb&#39;s bread for the first time, now It didn&#39;t help my pain. But that&#39;s OK i loved the fast head high you got but so focused on everything.

VI haven&#39;t had this strain in years but when I saw some at a local rec shop that was so pretty I couldn&#39;t pass it up, and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t it&#39;s pretty dank stuff. I really don&#39;t care if this was Bob Marley&#39;s favorite strain or not it&#39;s a really nice strain that&#39;s been around a long time and it&#39;s still great. The buds are very dense and bright green it&#39;s quite frosty but maybe not quite as much as some strains the smell is very earthy, with some spicey pine flavor mixed in it smells to me very cheesy I love the taste and smell of this stuff. The high is very cerebral, with very little body at all, seems to be a spike in mental activity coinciding with a burst of energy. Really like this strain at work!

I finally got a medical card, something I thought I\u2019d never do.\u000a\u000aBut enough about me. The Lambs Bread was recommended to me based on my symptoms on my very first visit to the store. Since YOUR pot isn\u2019t the same as MY pot all those years ago, I was very careful with that first pop of the cherry. The teeniest of nuggets hit me right away and the pain in my knee subsided immediately and I was able to walk around, write, function. And for that I am grateful. Subsequent uses yielded the same and I think I needed to retire to the couch once. \u000a\u000aRight now I\u2019m very mellow but talkative and alert. I can get up and move around, because I\u2019m not too high in the head and I\u2019m not in pain. Some face/forehead pressure and I\u2019m a little overwarm but I want weight on me, like a blanket. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m a novice at this so I\u2019m going to try others but I really love this little lamb.

VThis is a very clear-headed and relaxing strain. I have multiple TBIs (traumatic brain injuries), which cause me constant migraines (I used to use Blue Dream, Blue &quot;Nightmare&quot; because I heard that the trim job sucks! ROFLMFAO!), but when we came to Ashland from Grants Pass, I decided to do something a little different. I went to Puff&#39;s and used my OMMP card (got a fat ass discount too!), told them I was having a bad day, so these awesome young gentlemen hooked me up with this strain, and I am going to keep on this one until my &quot;Budtender&quot; (lol my love!) can find me a new one!\u000a

VA true gem. This strain will bring you peace, and a clearheaded high. The flavor is rich and sophisticated, yet humble and down to earth. It is a great pairing with playing music, for all my fellow musicians out there. I&#39;ve never been to Jamaica, and I&#39;m not Rastafarian or anything, but I can attest to the fact that this strain is sacred.

VA really solid sativa! I&#39;ve grabbed this strain several times from one of my favorite dispensaries, Magic Castle in SW PDX and I have always enjoyed it! It has a nice musky herbal smell to it. My bud is sticky to the touch. It gives you a very positive cerebral high. I really enjoy it when I&#39;m out in nature. I also think the Jamaican background is cool! I&#39;d definitely recommend it to any sativa fan!

It dissolves depression and minor body aches, giving a euphoric, energetic, happy high. It&#39;s perfect for reading, studying, and exercising. I&#39;ve read that this one was Bob Marley&#39;s favorite and I also believe it is medicine for the creative soul. It has a lovely, soft taste and aromatic, incense like scent.

I love the very earthy, woody taste to it and with my bong that has two defusers it&#39;s like butter on your throat( horrible analogy ).so with my rambling I would say this is by far my favorite strain :D

VAs someone who suffers from allergies a combination of mental illnesses, I can say that this is by far the only strain that doesn&#39;t make me anxious, or worse, paranoid. The energy I get from it is a healthy one; one that allows me to experiment and get into my creative zone for extended periods of time. As an artist, it allows me to hyper-focus and have the confidence to try new things I&#39;ve never thought of before. There is no headache, sinus congestion, phlegm, or drowsiness. I really hope that Lamb&#39;s Bread doesn&#39;t become tainted over time, like nearly every strain does. This is a god-send for me and I truly hope it will be around forever.

While not dense the buds were full and not as pop corn like buds of most Sativa&#39;s. The trichomes were many and some so big they looked like mini diamonds among the bud. Smelled and taste of pine and skunk to me. Nice change of pace for an Indica lover as myself :)\u000a\u000aPEACE

I found this to also very relaxing for every anxiety patient I have given it to. They said this is their new go-to for Tremors and general stress! I got a chance to look but not smoke the material used in this, and the plants produced wondrous, full bodied buds with a bit of give and a cinnamon-sugar coating of tan, thick kief.

VI normally prefer hard-hitting indicas that smell like breakfast cereal leave me a bonelessly insensate, drooling zombie. However, whenever Lamb&#39;s Bread is in stock, I buy as much as I can. \u000a\u000aThe smell is somewhere between moss and oolong tea, and as soon as I open my jar, I can feel the tension in my neck cascade from my muscles as if it knows it is no match for this aggressively sedate strain. \u000a\u000aThe high comes slowly, almost creepingly slow, and I feel my anxiety fade to the background. I think that my back pain is affected too, but I&#39;m too content with the peculiarities of life and the texture of greek yogurt to notice it. \u000a\u000aI haven&#39;t had a chance to smoke this strain in years, and I missed it dearly, so thank God for Electric Lettuce, because they had a jar of it, and when I saw the look in their eyes when I mentioned the name of the strain, I bought as much as the law of the land would allow. \u000a\u000aIf smoking my normal faire would be similar to a rocket ship, Lamb&#39;s Bread is like taking an air balloon. And you brought sandwiches. \u000a\u000a15/10, would absolutely buy again. Actually. I think I&#39;m going to head over today and do just that.

Now for me this strain was ultra racy very cerebral which I do not enjoy for my PTSD its a no go. The come on was quick which I do like it&#39;s not a creeper but way too much for me.

VA really solid sativa! I&#39;ve grabbed this strain several times from one of my favorite dispensaries, Magic Castle in SW PDX and I have always enjoyed it! It has a nice musky herbal smell to it. My bud is sticky to the touch. It gives you a very positive cerebral high. I really enjoy it when I&#39;m out in nature. I also think the Jamaican background is cool! I&#39;d definitely recommend it to any sativa fan!

VI am not a pot head. I don\u2019t like to be high and have felt this way since the kids came. I am, however, in chronic pain (broken back, tweaked knee) and putting off surgeries I fear I\u2019ll need. I finally got a medical card, something I thought I\u2019d never do.\u000a\u000aBut enough about me. The Lambs Bread was recommended to me based on my symptoms on my very first visit to the store. Since YOUR pot isn\u2019t the same as MY pot all those years ago, I was very careful with that first pop of the cherry. The teeniest of nuggets hit me right away and the pain in my knee subsided immediately and I was able to walk around, write, function. And for that I am grateful. Subsequent uses yielded the same and I think I needed to retire to the couch once. \u000a\u000aRight now I\u2019m very mellow but talkative and alert. I can get up and move around, because I\u2019m not too high in the head and I\u2019m not in pain. Some face/forehead pressure and I\u2019m a little overwarm but I want weight on me, like a blanket. \u000a\u000aI\u2019m a novice at this so I\u2019m going to try others but I really love this little lamb.

VI gotta give this old school strain it&#39;s props! Some of the greatest times I&#39;ve had in my life all began with a Bit of This beauty. First time I had the great Opportunity to try this was in Jamaica. More specifically Montego Bay. Flew in that morning and by the afternoon everybody was feeling great! Invites to a local (evening) beach party ended up back at hotel room with just an incredible amount of LambsB. Swapped for a pair of kicks! Fila sneakers, yes, I said Fila&#39;s! So way back in the 90&#39;s!!! Off the beat and path, sorry. Lets just say we had enough to supply A party of 8 all day long and on the last night we all steamed out the left overs in hot water ... The hotels work force was only too happy to oblidge in solutions on how to consume what was left. What a great trip! And lambsB had us up and gng the whole vacation!!Killah Sativa!!! A pain free, energy stimulating, powerful mind bending strain that you soon won&#39;t forget! I&#39;ve also had the oil and it was so tasty like the flower. Excellent and really potent! Love both! I&#39;ll never pass up this strain... A little goes a long way.

A very quick onrush of what can best be described as a universal, &quot;one love&quot; connectedness and euphoria. You feel intertwined with all the love in the universe, all at once. Your mental state will be happy, calm, relaxed, at ease, creative, and sociable. You will not get completely fucked up and act like a complete imbecile, which can happen with some of the more modern sativas and sativa hybrids. Forget that noise. Smoke this to find a wonderful bliss and inner peace. \u000a\u000aFantastic medication for depression and anxiety. That you can still function while baked on this strain is a major bonus.

VI was sold this strain under the name of Lamb&#39;s Breath. The buds are very nice, although they were not sticky as said in the leafly description. The high is one of a kind, perhaps even my favorite. Depression and anxiety melt away, and euphoric peace replaces them. Medicinally, an excellent strain for anxiety and depression. The taste of the medicine is similar to that of cheese, though vastly less sweet. The aroma is sweet and tangy, and not very weedy.

VI haven&#39;t had this strain in years but when I saw some at a local rec shop that was so pretty I couldn&#39;t pass it up, and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t it&#39;s pretty dank stuff. I really don&#39;t care if this was Bob Marley&#39;s favorite strain or not it&#39;s a really nice strain that&#39;s been around a long time and it&#39;s still great. The buds are very dense and bright green it&#39;s quite frosty but maybe not quite as much as some strains the smell is very earthy, with some spicey pine flavor mixed in it smells to me very cheesy I love the taste and smell of this stuff. The high is very cerebral, with very little body at all, seems to be a spike in mental activity coinciding with a burst of energy. Really like this strain at work!

VI really like this sativa. I can *actually* do math on this strain! I can also smoke a decent amount during the day and it doesn&#39;t put me on my ass. I&#39;m very anxiety prone and this strain does not induce anxiety for me--huge plus. Enables me to keep thinking and be very functional.. go to the store, children&#39;s museum, anything. At night, I can smoke a ton of this without getting too sleepy to where it knocks me out, and when I&#39;m ready for bed, I&#39;m asleep right away. However, the dry mouth is unreal with this strain! Don&#39;t be caught dead without a drink! Enjoy!

VAmazing, clean, sweet in a dreamy way, clarity of  thought, control of thought processes to a higher degree. Feel much freer in all aspects of being. Creatively insightful might be a good way to put it. I&#39;ll revisit Lamb&#39;s bread. I generally have a short fuse, but this allows me to calm my response to more appropriate stance for issues of conflicting nature. Lamb&#39;s bread, which ever the real name is. I suppose since Bob Marley purportedly claimed this was his favorite strain, and he was a Rastafarian, I&#39;d tend towards Lamb&#39;s breath if I had to guess.\u000aNote: I eat the bud instead of smoking it. Can&#39;t comment in the arena of smoking, the battle between lung and smoke. :)

VFor me this is a unique variety of cannabis for reasons that others have sometimes described. It does indeed feel like a Sativa would. It worked on my brain mostly. Definitely relaxing. But relaxing is something every strain does. What is unique about Lamb&#39;s Bread is it does feel like a very mellow as opposed to heady effect that feels like it is not as confusing or disorienting as other Sativas can be. I did not feel any additional energy, but I felt like it was a clear high that didn&#39;t cause sleepiness. \u000aThe smoke is very smooth and has very little irritation qualities like maybe AK or GDP may have. \u000aFresh flowers do not have any unique or unusual smell. In fact it smells very ordinary before you smoke it. I highly recommend it.

VIt is the only strain I will smoke these days. Because the high is very mild and it makes me feel light but not too loose, very relaxing but still energetic. It makes it easier for me to go into deep thought without feeling lost and it help me to get creative. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it is what the Rastafarians smoke because it definitely is conducive to spiritual activities such as contemplating and meditating.

VLamb&#39;s Bread is one of my favorite strains of cannibus. Great head high, face and body numbing with a mild euphoric feeling after the effects settle in. Good for around the house, low impact tasks with clarity staying sharp with this strain. Vaporized smoothly. The only downside for me was greatly increased appetite. LB was a pleasurable high over-all.

It is a Jamaican &quot;Land-race&quot; plant, and has great Pine aromas, coupled with strong citrus overtones. Best Sativa I have ever had. The Sativa effects are unparallelled.

ROFLMFAO!), but when we came to Ashland from Grants Pass, I decided to do something a little different. I went to Puff&#39;s and used my OMMP card (got a fat ass discount too!), told them I was having a bad day, so these awesome young gentlemen hooked me up with this strain, and I am going to keep on this one until my &quot;Budtender&quot; (lol my love!) can find me a new one!\u000a

VThis is my &quot;go-to&quot; strain for day and night relief from stress and anxiety.  High in THC, Lamb&#39;s Bread provides a wonderfully cerebral high with a relaxing body buzz and a fair amount of pressure in the eyes.

VI sure love my sativas and this is a new favorite! I&#39;m a snob when it comes to any strain, and growers. This lamb&#39;s bread I got from  Arizona Natural Selections (of Peoria) is SO good. I have panic disorder and agoraphobia. One bong hit of this I was FINE. I WAS ABLE TO GO OUT! Without feeling as anxious or scared. I can only compare it to Green Crack and Jack Herer, but only killer grows. I absolutely love this strain. I&#39;m so glad I tried it. Makes you feel irie and happy! Tastes yummy.  Highly recommend for ppl with anxiety.

Good for getting things done.

VI don&#39;t tend to like Sativas.  They tend to be too high in THC for me and I&#39;m more of a CDB snob.  I love the thrill of feeling easy and yet energized, to take a hike, get some work done and enjoy the process, in other words, I like control.  But Lamb&#39;s bread.  Whoa, I become open, willing and joyful.  I feel more creative and expansive. I have this need to speak.  Not babble but really speak thoughtfully.  Well, I could wax poetic, but this try, 1 to 2 drags, otherwise you waste the experience.  By the way it&#39;s way better in a vape, my preference; Wulf.

The Rasta association gets white-kids-with-dreads and Marley fan&#39;s excited, but the high keeps people coming.  This is my #1 favorite strain. I&#39;ve cooked, cleaned, written stories, done philosophy reading, prepped economic reports, written parts of my dissertation, listened to music, watched movies, taken drives or walks, spoken to loved ones about fun or serious issues - all with this strain and it accentuates activities in a beautiful way.  5/5 every day.

VExtremely savory smell, not as fruity an aroma as the indica varieties I&#39;ve tried but pungent with nutty, spicy and flowery notes. Very light and fluffy to the touch (the name Lamb&#39;s Bread is fairly apropo). Med-light green hue edging towards yellow with heavy trichroming like wool over the surface. Med-large orange-red hairs cover the surface sparsely.\u000a\u000aAroma opens up greatly after grinding. Flowery and &quot;farty&quot; (in a good way) with some sour, skittle-esque notes. Aroma dissipates surprisingly quickly. Very fluffy in texture with great internal trichroming. Shaping up to be one of the best visual and tactile strains I&#39;ve come across.\u000a\u000aConsumed from a glass pipe Lamb&#39;s Bread burns evenly and has some nice spicey/wheaty flavor with subtle skittle and citrus undertones. A not unpleasant band-aid and clove finish is nice to ruminate on as the body begins tingling. Very nice &quot;get out and do something&quot; strain which makes me want to do just that. Particularly strong body high makes for a nice introduction to sativa strains. Major red-eye though. MAJOR red-eye.

VGot this at Marijuana Mart in Rochester, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings --Brand: Doc Croc\u000aStrain: Lamb&#39;s Bread\u000aSativa-dominant Hybrid -- Potency Analysis: TTL 20% THC 0.77% CBD 0.08% THCa 18.9%\u000a--\u000aPackaging: 4.75&quot;x3&quot; printed plastic bag\u000aCost: $12.25/gram\u000a--Another very beautiful sativa from Doc Croc.  It&#39;s very densely coated in crystals and the hairs are just as densely present.  The buds are fluffy like a great sativa is expected to be.  They&#39;re very light and not at all springy..\u000a--\u000aThe smell is flat.  It&#39;s slightly dusty and herbal like old, dried, cut grass.  It has no real presence or spread.  The lightness of the buds definitely made me think this would smoke light, so I rolled up a decent 0.6g joint. --\u000aThe smoke is just as light and airy as I expected it to be, and much like the smell, there&#39;s only a flat grassy sort of dusty flavor.  It&#39;s not bad, but it sure isn&#39;t the pungent, fragrant, smelly, delicious high-end trees I like to smoke.  I can&#39;t tell how much of that is from the strain and how much is from the age (4 months) and dryness (considerable) of the pot itself.  \u000a--\u000aThe high was nice and relaxed, very mellow.  It was kind, I felt touched in the head for quite a while, just barely aware of the goings-on around me as I kicked it in my backyard and enjoyed the evening sun while watching my daughters and the dog run around.\u000a--\u000aI got sincerely deep munchies after this, and ate so much dinner - and the chocolate chip cookies my wife made for dessert - that I now, some time later, still feel disgusting.  It was great.\u000a--\u000aOverall, a good mental, sativa high. While it has some fair body relaxation and restfulness - the head is really where this high is at.  Once more, based on the really soft nature of the smoke, and the lack of complex flavors, the mellow but real high, I have to call this strain Old Lady Weed.  And once more, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.

Vit looked and smelled beautiful. wanted so badly to like this strain. however, it made me real jittery, and very anxious. I don&#39;t like feeling that way after taking medication. I think I do better with indicas and hybrids. 3 stars for color, smell, and price.

VMy specific strain-  lambs dream- isn&#39;t on leafly yet but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s lambs breath/bread crossed with blue dream (or a similar haze). \u000a\u000aOrange hairs, medium green. Dry mouth &amp; eyes for sure, calmness and anxiety to get up and be active (walking, hiking would be great). Can stay seated with leg shaking, normal for me maybe not so for others). Helped alleviate neck pain &amp; at times makes me more aware of it which indicates I should stretch. Able to carry conversations and think. Will update how time is perceived differently.\u000a\u000aPositive introspection. Helped feelings of anger to die down. Urge to be productive.

VI didn&#39;t like this so much.  To me I either got a bad batch or the wrong stuff, not sure but it felt just like an indica that had been harvested when the trichomes were clear.  Went straight to my head and felt very numbing, but just in my head.  Meh.
