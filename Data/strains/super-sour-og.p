VIt&#39;s safe to say that this strain knocked me on my a**. I was so blazed that I was in couch-lock mode luckily I prepared for it ahead of time by grabbing some munchies and drinks. I highly recommend this strain it went way above my expectations I will definitely try it again.

VI suffer from Chronic back pain due to scoliosis and a messed up back surgery. I was able to get this strain in a BHO crumble form. It is very pungent and it tastes amazing. I decarb my concentrate and then infuse it with coconut oil and out into an eyedropper or capsule. I am finding the best relief from the sublingual dosing. It takes effect quickly and relaxes my muscle spasms. Too much and I will be sleeping like a baby. Great medication.

VHighly recommended!! This one gets on top and takes you on a ride!! Very OG and VERY pungent and lemony, with a pleasant aftertaste. The sample I received was very high testing on the THC, but even still I was impressed with the effect and speed of onset. Made me very relaxed and reduced my anxiety almost immediately.  It put me in a completely different head space. I now have a new holy grail strain to find clones of......

VVery nice strain. Definitely felt euphoria and settled me out in the evening. Surprisingly though, I only took it at night. I felt the high and was a tad bit giggly then I decided to go to sleep so I can get up early the next morning. Slept very well and my appetite came back for sure. Lol

VFantastic all-day smoke. The only downside is how good it tastes\u2014which will have you using more than you really need, gluing you to your seat for a good couple of hours, talking about all the things you need to do (instead of just doing them) lol.
