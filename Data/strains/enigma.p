VGot this at 420 Holiday in Longview, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings -- Brand: Urban Farms\u000aStrain: Enigma\u000aHigh-CBD Sativa-dominant Hybrid -- Potency Analysis: TTL 16.8% THC 5.7% CBD 0.1% CBDA 11% -- Cost: $15/gram -- Scruffy kind of earthy smell.  Like thin dirt from the alley, not rich soil from the garden.  There is definitely a citrus-diesel tang running through the smell. -- \u000aFirst touch of flame, this stuff lit right up. -- The smoke felt tight, compressed.  For some folks who need this strain&#39;s pain relief, this is probably going to be harsh. --  What head there is feels slightly dreamy but overall pretty clear.  There&#39;s no pain after smoking this, essentially immediately.  The worst of my considerable knee pains were reduced significantly, and my back felt great.  The head was ok while the high lasted, but I was slightly edgy.  -- there are higher CBD count with better smoke and head high but this is just ok.

VThis stuff was ridiculous... only had it once and almost forgot until i saw the old medicine bottle. Super earthy and almost kush like this was a definite stand out, but i haven&#39;t seen it since. Strong, tastey and relaxing meds though!

VSmooth.  Best way to describe it, smooth transition into relaxation with a feeling or happieness followed by epic munchies.  it was a super fun night time watch a movie or video game sesh kind of strain.

VIt was great for my sciatica pain but left me feeling an over awareness of my body which I didn&#39;t enjoy.  However ingesting it made me sleep like a baby and lessened greatly the body awareness.  It smelled great ... Like the old days &#128521;

VI love, love, love this strain! My favorite thus far for sleep, muscle and joint pain, and anxiety. I prefer indicas in general, and this is amazing medication for me.

VActive high - confused about the species on here, because what I smoked was a 70-30 sativa dominant. Never the less was a good high, talkative and relaxed. Not sleepy until the very end when I CRASHED.

VThis is the closed to LSD you&#39;ll ever get legally. However still wouldn&#39;t go back to this strain for the feeling going into it but the experience. Don&#39;t go to bed right away and end up on a magic carpet ride. Portland OR, because that was really weird.
