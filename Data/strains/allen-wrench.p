VHoly shit. \u000aOk, now that we have that out of the way, let me start by saying that I am currently on Allenwrench. I love this shit. This is my go to, every day strain. Allenwrench is about as much sativa I can handle and I do have to be sitting for the first few minutes because it really gets my mind going. But after my mind catches up and realizes we are alright, its great. love love LOVE this strain

VGot this stuff from Nectar in Portland at a budget price. Not the greatest looking buds, but a really nice strain. I tend to go as sativa as possible, digging Durban, hazes, like that to replace my Rx ADD medication. These strains work well both to help with concentration and sleep, for me. For reference, Ghost Train Haze is my gold standard strain, when I can get it. The Allen Wrench is very well balanced; not super racy, but definitely won&#39;t knock you out either. This is a strain you could truly smoke all day long.

VMy absolute favorite strain!!!! Very solid high. I mean imagine your favorite high, but at the same you\u2019re just pre-occupied by so many things but this time you actually finish everything. Gives you purpose. Good for sativa lovers, probably only good for them (my friend didnt like this as much as I did, he has constant anxiety attacks and paranoia). Long lasting high tho. I\u2019d smoke this everyday if I\u2019m even allowed to, I wanna breed it, I wanna touch it, I love it that much.

VPut me on the moon. Just picked some up from my local. I was looking for a head-banger for my migraine and this is a good one.  Very heady intense high not probably suited for daytime activities if they involve communicating with other coherently. I&#39;d take it down a notch or two and save this for when you need good, fast pain relief but don&#39;t have any other responsibilities. Pretty dark green dank, smell great and hits nice and smooth with a fruity aftertaste. Love it effective as all get out.

VI was sitting in the car at like 3:00am, probably, I packed myself a nice bowl, and had some jams. This strain hit pretty swell, I lost myself and forgot what I was doing. I saw a man walking down the street coming out the darkness and into the light, and I flipped shit, I started getting paranoid, nothing happened. Just thought I was gonna die. I feel like being active. As far as my mood, I am very chill and happy. I&#39;m a huge fan when it comes to Sativa, it&#39;s my favorite.

VDelightful to vape, and it does what was promised. I asked the bud tender for something motivating, and this is it. I love the way it makes me feel like digging into projects I have procrastinated about for months. It&#39;s a pleasant, happy but slightly self-concious high, not good for evening unless you want to be bubbly for a party. No couch-lock, body high or libido enhancement. Perfect to start the day. Munchies and cotton-mouth.

I really appreciate the gentle happiness that sweeps over me as I smoke this. For me a burst of desire to want to play an instrument was overwhelming. Such a creative push. The smell is amazing. I mean it&#39;s like sweet. Anyways so far it has definitely helped my depression. As for social anxiety I haven&#39;t been able to determine if it helps or not yet.

VFirst impressions of this strain are that it is aromatic and quite tasty. Strong citrus and floral flavors come through right away; delightful to smoke. Beyond that, the effects of the strain came in waves for me. First, it made me feel creative, energetic, and intently focused on whatever activity I was taking part in. After about an hour or two of continually smoking, the energizing effects gave way to overpowering fatigue. Within fifteen minutes of noticing my extreme tiredness, I was fast asleep. After smoking this strain exclusively for two weeks, I can assuredly say this happened every night. The only omnipresent effect throughout the different stages of the high was hunger. This strain makes you EAT. And eat. And then, just when you think your stomach will rupture from how much food you&#39;ve crammed in there, you can&#39;t help but eat again.\u000a\u000aTasty and energetic sativa effects to start, but this strain might not be best for those who want hours upon hours of creative, uplifting, focused capacity. If you&#39;re looking for a relaxing night at home full of veg and limited couch lock, this may be the strain for you.

VLately all the bud I&#39;ve been getting has been the best Bud I&#39;ve ever smoked. Here&#39;s another one that looks amazing bright green super dense with dark orange hairs and covered in a white frost. It smells very strongly of citrus, it smells very bright, and fresh. The smoke is dense, very smooth, with a very strong flavor of oranges I think. The high is all head but very strong I feel it alot in my temples and behind the eyes of course. It&#39;s a very creative, focused high, but also funny almost silly? I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d like to smoke this at work it&#39;s alittle too stoney but it&#39;d be great all weekend long! I really like it I will be getting it again.

VFirst impressions of this strain are that it is aromatic and quite tasty. Strong citrus and floral flavors come through right away; delightful to smoke. Beyond that, the effects of the strain came in waves for me. First, it made me feel creative, energetic, and intently focused on whatever activity I was taking part in. After about an hour or two of continually smoking, the energizing effects gave way to overpowering fatigue. Within fifteen minutes of noticing my extreme tiredness, I was fast asleep. After smoking this strain exclusively for two weeks, I can assuredly say this happened every night. The only omnipresent effect throughout the different stages of the high was hunger. This strain makes you EAT. And eat. And then, just when you think your stomach will rupture from how much food you&#39;ve crammed in there, you can&#39;t help but eat again.\u000a\u000aTasty and energetic sativa effects to start, but this strain might not be best for those who want hours upon hours of creative, uplifting, focused capacity. If you&#39;re looking for a relaxing night at home full of veg and limited couch lock, this may be the strain for you.

On another note this strain is an awesome pungent sour smoke with earthy hints, active engaged high.  If cultivating I suggest watching your nutrients as it burns very easily, it also stretches alot so be ready to top, train, and or scrog.

VI have a passion for indica strains that cause couch lock and put me to sleep.  Lately, I&#39;ve been trying to branch out and explore sativas with a more energizing buzz.  So I was a little surprised to find myself so very relaxed, and nodding off, after two bowls of Allen Wrench!  A good high overall, but I had been expecting to leap off the couch in a flurry of activity.  I thought it was just me, but my sativa-loving partner agreed: this is a great relaxing strain. ETA: upon further reflection, I wonder if I got a bud that was overripe.\u000a\u000aA bit of a creeper for a strong strain; let the first bowl/puff sink in before having another.  Very giggly too.\u000a\u000aWould recommend, but based on my experience, its more of a night time smoke.

The smell is earthy and pungent, but the taste is all chemical and tar - definitely not my favorite tasting strain, thus the 4 stars.\u000a\u000aThe high comes on slowly, with some light body relaxation, but creeps up on you and hits hard with a blast of euphoria and a slight dizziness.

VVery up high on this one. I should be far more hungover this Saturday morning, but the ol&#39; Wrench is apparently getting to work. Nice pep-up with this business; excellent to listen to music with, and just, in the words of Althea and Donna, Uptown Top Ranking. Got a lot of cleaning/dancing done, an activity it not only enables, but encourages. This one is a recommend if you can find it. Very strong, so be warned. You don&#39;t wanna be Gravity Bongin&#39; this. Take your time with the Wrench... it&#39;ll fix you right up.

VIt&#39;s a good sativa but I&#39;m not buying anymore. it hit like a hybrid or something, strait to the dome yo then couchlock. smells good,looks nice. this strain is like a hot chick you sleep with, but she sucks in bed. looks great but don&#39;t deliver. it&#39;s a bit racey an blasts you out there, don&#39;t last long. alot of other hybrids can do the same thing.

VGets you up and doing! It also helps you muse on philosophical topics and the meaning of life, the universe and everything.... I like active creative and euphoric highs for doing craft work and this was very helpful. I find it was less creative in the visual/design realm and more creative in the introspective/inductive reasoning realm.
