VBlackberry is a strain that can be enjoyed anytime of day.  The taste is smooth and sweet, it&#39;s fairly unique.  As for effects I&#39;ve seen this strain range around the mid 20 percentile mark and it hits like it.  At smaller doses you&#39;ll be bubbly, on the go, and able to function.  While at larger doses you may be comfortably couched locked trying to remember what you had for lunch.  Either way Blackberry is a very enjoyable strain.  9/10

VWonderful strain.  Works very well for relaxation, muscle fatigue, and spasms.  The only down side is the &#39;one toke over the line&#39; issue.  Two or three hits is enough to stop a rhino.  Anything beyond that will just put you in a staring coma.  Don&#39;t even think about reaching for the remote.  It&#39;s just too far away...\u000a\u000aThe plant grows big and bushy with a pungent fruity odor.  However, the smell isn&#39;t immediately recognized as marijuana like many other indica dominants.  Returns of two to four ounces per plant are not abnormal.  Plants will get big and bushy, usually taking up the space of two normal plants.  Does very well with average nutrients.  If you can expose it to colder air during it&#39;s late stage flowering, it will turn nice shades of purple for you.  I&#39;ve had plants range from medium green to dark purple depending on the time of year.

VIt must really depend on how it was grown. I got this strain in small bud form at Alternatives in Santa Rosa and I have not found any herb that I like better. It is smooth and has a definite blackberry after-taste. I am on dialysis and it really helped my nausea. I felt young again. Thank you Alternatives you guys are amazing.

VI bought two grams of some Blackberry - the last bit they had at The Humboldt County Collective, actually - and loved it to bits and pieces. The buds were incredibly frosted and gleaning with beautiful purple leaves. Really beautiful buds; I wish I could provide pictures. The strength of the Blackberry was pretty nice and potent, very indica-based and good for nighttime medication.

Very uplifting cerebral high, but also makes you very relaxed, in a nutshell; she is a true hybrid.

V4.5 stars. I started with half my usual first dose, and my pain went from 8 down to 2! (out of 10). It took a few minutes to come on. Very euphoric yet clear headed, and I did get a bit yawn-y after about 20 minutes. My second dose eliminated pain but motivate me to the mattress.  Smell and taste are just as described.

VIf you&#39;re looking for a strain that will help muscle spasms and allow you to get to sleep more quirky, and stay asleep longer, look no further than Blackberry.  Can&#39;t stress it enough, it&#39;s a great strain for nighttime use for those of with muscle spasms.  Presumably, it should be a great strain for anybody else to help all kinds of sleep disorders. :)\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s too bad, though, as my local dispensary got it as an extremely limited supply :(\u000a\u000aTo those of you who have access to this strain and have difficulties sleeping, you should pick up this strain immediately and enjoy sweet dreams once again!  :D

VThis herb had my ass in a coma, i literally rolled a full spliff on Raw brown paper.  My friend and I smoked it.  I was on my ass on the couch barely functioning an hour and half later.  We watched the superbowl, then i ate brownies (regular good chocolate) and ate more brownies and by 1130 i was dozing by 1am i thought it was 3am and i was sleep...i slept till 1130 am couldn&#39;t move my body still feeling sluggish.  Indica&#39;s i will leave be.  Even trainwreck didn&#39;t have me like this. great for those with pain and insomnia...

VKiller strain all together. I must say that the grower of this cannabis plant put lots of love and care to make sure that they produced the best flower possible. Dockside Co-op in Seattle is where I got this batch of cannabis and I must say that when I noticed that the trichomes were actually purple I was impressed with the over all look of the flower. Once I rolled one up and medicated with the flower I noticed that it tastes like blackberries I was really just blown away. Killer strain and the grower just pulled the true potential out of it.

VGrabbed and gram and damn. I felt really good. This strain can lean either way and I believe I tried the Indica-dom pheno-type, because the cerebral high was short lived, but my body felt wonderful. I&#39;m not prone to soreness or injuries, but who gets mad at a prolonged and warm body high. Nice sweet smoke produced and the cerebral portion is nearly instantaneous. Great strain for work or pleasure.

VSmells both earthy &amp; sweet, tastes kind of fruity when smoked... with blackberry after tones. Relatively fluffy buds, but with lots of crystal and orange hairs. The high is definitely an indica, leaving me feel quite relaxed 10 mins after consumption. The buzz is not overpowering enough to leave you couchlocked, however, although it could be used to treat insomnia, as it does sedate you quite nicely. I give Blackberry marijuana three stars out of five, because it provides a solid indica high &amp; has a unique blackberry taste (kinda), but provides no exceptional effects or medicinal qualities for me as a user.

VGreat body high/buzz along with the cerebral effects. The effects of the body high will also have a numb feeling to it, and Blackberry can be couch locky. The cerebral effects will kick out your stresses and anxiety, and leave you in a uplifting happy euphoria! This is a good day time strain if you are not doing anything and at home. I wouldn&#39;t do difficult task on this, just sit down, watch some tv, listen to music, or play a video game. \u000aMedical users can turn to Blackberry  for pain with the body numbing like effects. Anxiety suffers will benefit from this a lot, and will kick you out of a bad mood. The cerebral effects will help out with migraines. If you are feeling nauseous I can definitely recommend this. \u000aOverall great! Would smoke again.

VI recently had an appendectomy and gall bladder removal. I am not a fan of opioids. This strain has been the best pain killer ever. I go from being bed ridden to walking around as if I never had surgery. My fianc&#233; has to remind me that I am not suppose to be moving around that much. Wonderful strain. Will continue to use :)

VI grew a batch of this a while back. Great indica strain that has a nice berry scent and flavor. The feeling produced is great for insomnia and makes you feel sleepy and relaxed. Smoking this for the flavor alone is worth it ,but the nice body stone is great for patients in need of pain relieving forces. Similiar strains to this I would say are blueberry and northern lights and the like.

VIt&#39;s a neutral green color with a tinge of yellow with lots of red hairs inter spaced equally throughout the nug ( small red hairs - laying down flat all all surfaces of the bud) with a medium number of crystal trichomes in view that sparkle , but I am sure if I had a jewelers loupes I would be able to see much more. ( also if you are looking @ the potency information the CBD&#39;s is 0.00% ) - and all tests are done - or rather said they are done (but I believe them) by SC labs , I got this medical cannabis delivered to me be by I believe her name was Tami , But I am horrible with names ,  by IE Greenmeds Delivery service in Upland .

Last Saturday I smoked a fat bowl of this and don&#39;t remember much of what I did, besides chasing my friend around my house while he was eating an entire gallon of ice cream. After I was mellowing out I smoked  a joint of it and my body felt like a swirling bucket of great. The sun felt amazing on my body and I had a nice body high for about 3 hours after that. Overall good strain. Oh, and it tastes and smells great, just like blackberry!!!!!!!!!!!

Definetly helps slow my thoughts down so I highly recommend for mood disorders/PTSD/Opiate disorder to help calm your mind. Does very well for pain I regards to a hybrid. Overall I was very happy I tried it. The buds were big, dense, with a neon green hue while bright orange hairs burst through and to &quot;ice&quot; it all off, a nice dusting of trichromes covers the kolas.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Clears and calms mind. Relaxes body and provides pain relief. Lasts a decent amount of time. Smooth draw/exhale. Berry taste.\u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth and  minor dry/red eyes. \u000a\u000aOverall: Definitely a hybrid that has both the mind effects of sativas &amp; body relaxation of an indica. I found my mind at almost too much at ease as I was more talkative but spacy in my thoughts. While relaxing, didn&#39;t feel tired or sleepy, but could with added consumption. Didn&#39;t cause the munchies but was helpful in getting/stimulating an appetite.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this for unwinding from stress or needing some pain relief, even pre/post meal for digestive issues or as an appetite enabler.

VBlackberry very nice pungent flavor. You can really taste the BlackBerry. It has a good combination of a euphoric relaxation but no couch lock effects. I would say it&#39;s a really good strain for work environments.

Very good for pain,insomnia,sleepy and happy but is best used at night for sleeping for me. I also made brownies with some blackberry and they were awesome and I smoked or vaporized after eating the brownies and found my self SUPER SLEEPY and I didn&#39;t eat more than 2-3 pieces but there was lot of flower in it with a small brownie...all personal LOL

VIm actually rolling the blackberry cheese or bbc lol. How the fuck.do.you add a strain on here? Anyways this dirty whore of a plant can suck it. Super deep purple leaves and calyxes, nearly black.  Really poppin calyxes really does look like a blackberry. Takes like 9 weeks and has basically crap yields. It also likes pmd more than some. The stalks are thick as the dickens but not the hollow kind. The resin is so viscous and sticky. Its has sweet and bitter tones kinda like a semi sweet black forest cake. Great to smoke and concentrate. Unruly growth like if you took the bubba and stretched it out.

VMy mouth waters just thinking of the flavor and smell inherent in this gorgeous strain&#39;s almost black nugs. Unfortunately, and I&#39;d try it out for yourself to be sure, I didn&#39;t get much of a body or head high. I suppose this is to be expected with CBD weed but I&#39;ve tried other strains with similar CBD:THC and just wasn&#39;t impressed. The funny thing is, the flavor was so out of this world that I&#39;m tempted to try another gram again just to taste it again. Smell before using is of tar / diesel and then during it turns into blackberry. Color is the darkest I&#39;ve ever seen.

Just enough THC to get the buzz going and know you&#39;re getting baked, and a huge punch of CBD that helps with my arthritis as well as cramps and other issues, and the plus side it&#39;s a CBD strain that actually tastes good, but it does have a pretty pungent berry smell which isn&#39;t a downside to me. I reccomend this to everyone I know that has chronic pain. 10/10 Dope.

VI biked to a dispensary today and picked up a lot of weed. I randomly chose one strain to smoke, and I ended up with Blackberry. I smoked one bowl at 1:30 pm, and I got so high. That after getting off of the ferry, I had to bike 14 miles to get home. And I was stoned all the way throughout it. In fact, I&#39;m still a little high writing this review now at 6:29 pm. This strain is absolutely amazing I highly recommend getting it. I felt energized, and focused to go home and study for my upcoming math 120 test. I got 94% on the practice test. UPDATE After Math Test: This is an amazing strain to smoke after doing something stressful, incredible, or such as me taking my first ever college math test. It was my math 120 class test 1, and I got a score of 85.59%. This strain just totally relaxes you. It&#39;s perfect to smoke if your plans are to just sit back and relax. It&#39;s also good for doing a few productive things after smoking, for example, I did laundry, and didn&#39;t act high on phone with one of my employers.

After I was mellowing out I smoked  a joint of it and my body felt like a swirling bucket of great. The sun felt amazing on my body and I had a nice body high for about 3 hours after that.

VI bought it because it was good price, but also because of the crazy color of the flower! I&#39;ve never seen a bud so purple in person before. The orange hairs against the purple with a sprinkle of forest green here and there, it was striking looking. It crumbled very nicely.\u000a\u000aThe flavor was ok. If you like earthy bud, you&#39;ll probably like this. There was something unique in there too. I don&#39;t know what it was. Maybe that&#39;s just the way purple bud tastes. I give it a 3.5 / 5 on flavor.\u000a\u000aThe high was a relaxed body high. Gave me a slightly cloudy head, but that may be a good trait if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for.

VThis is my best all around strain, not much more to add for now. It has all the goodies, THC/THCV/CBD and long lasting meds.\u000aI&#39;ve grown this a few times now, but had to make an entry here on this grow because the plant has gone and turned blue 2 weeks into flowering. It was always going purplish/blackish when it was younger. But now, it has gone full on almost an iridescent blue.\u000aThe thing is, it is the hairs on the top of the leaves, because when you mist it with water, presto it turns a perfect deep dark green.\u000aThis plant is a clone. The original plant showed no signs of purpling or turning blue. I am guessing that we may have some input on the plants expression by the conditions we provide it with.\u000aMore to come.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Clears and calms mind. Relaxes body and provides pain relief. Lasts a decent amount of time. Smooth draw/exhale. Berry taste.\u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth and  minor dry/red eyes. \u000a\u000aOverall: Definitely a hybrid that has both the mind effects of sativas &amp; body relaxation of an indica. I found my mind at almost too much at ease as I was more talkative but spacy in my thoughts. While relaxing, didn&#39;t feel tired or sleepy, but could with added consumption. Didn&#39;t cause the munchies but was helpful in getting/stimulating an appetite.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this for unwinding from stress or needing some pain relief, even pre/post meal for digestive issues or as an appetite enabler.

( also if you are looking @ the potency information the CBD&#39;s is 0.00% ) - and all tests are done - or rather said they are done (but I believe them) by SC labs , I got this medical cannabis delivered to me be by I believe her name was Tami , But I am horrible with names ,  by IE Greenmeds Delivery service in Upland .

VA solid smoke. It&#39;s got a great flavour, and a totally cool scent. More like berries than weed sometimes. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;ll put you to sleep if you smoke more than a small-moderate amount, or so I find. Even then, it&#39;ll make you sleepy. \u000a\u000aBut, the euphoria of the high is pretty excellent. You get absolutely enthralled in music, tv, and games. So its a good high if you&#39;ve got free time. Not a productive high. Also I found it  hard to be creative, or draw, and never had too many great thoughts or &quot;highdeas&quot;. Also don&#39;t feel too sociable, would rather nap or get enthralled by some experience. So take that into consideration when you&#39;re using it, but your mileage may very. \u000a\u000aThe only downside is that I get very paranoid after smoking this. Which usually doesn&#39;t happen to me, considering I&#39;m in a medical state. Once again, your mileage may very. I&#39;d be interested to see if anyone else had the same paranoia. Only really sets in if you&#39;ve smoked about 3 bowls in the vape, and lasts until you inevitably fall asleep from that much. \u000a\u000aOverall a great euphoric feeling. But a strain that should be partaken in moderation.

VFlowery scent, almost perfume like, there&#39;s certainly some citrus notes in there also. Tighter buds with light green leaf and bright orange hairs. Doesn&#39;t have a sweet or flowery taste when exhaling, more like the smell/taste of an old dusty attic. I know that sounds weird but it&#39;s actually not as unpleasant as it sounds, just the memory that it invokes. This strain isn&#39;t as hard on my eyes as most. It doesn&#39;t make them feel heavy or make me look stoned.  There&#39;s more of a euphoric head high and less of a sleepy feeling which is nice.  In my opinion this would be a good strain to take on the go, or to an outdoor activity.

VEven buzz of body and head to me. The smell is so strong that I can&#39;t even open the small jar in the house without my wife smelling it downstairs. Really!!\u000aIt&#39;s the strongest odor ever...skunks for sure. I can&#39;t detect any blackberry in the strain we had. \u000aI get a bit introspective on this, but feels nice. Balanced between up buzz and relaxed. \u000aHeavy resin coated on buds and leaves...giving way to big thick hits.

VPicked up this strain crossed with cherry pie for Blackcherry Pie, an indica dominant hybrid that has a sweet berry taste with an earthy kush tasting exhale. Delayed effects kick in about 5-10 minutes after initial smoke but the effects are well balanced between head and body euphoria, and lasted a couple hours. Great strain!

VThis bud is fruity with a musky undertone. The smoke is slightly harsh but the taste contributes to its name &quot;blackberry,&quot; making it a splendid choice. The feeling of floating over my couch overtook my body. Couch lock is a under statement. Definitely a top 5.

VI&#39;ve never had anything Blackberry before. And when I heard it was mixed with Diesel I had to give it a try. It smelled a little fuely and the buds were really compact and popcorny. It was a little harsh of a smoke, but the high gave off a more sativa kick at first with a Indica finish as you sit and bake in the goodness. It was a good smoke, but really nothing memorable about the buds themselves. My final rating is 7/10
