V4.5  Niiiiiiiiiiice.  Two great strains come together in this one.   I did like it, but probably not quite as much as sour diesel or Jack Here by themselves.  Made my smile. This was a very effective strain mid afternoon, when I needed a boost of energy (and wanted to be high, of course.).

VI really liked this strain simply because it was the first strain I that I experienced a Volcano vaporizer. The flavour that the vapor holds is amazing. I&#39;ve been torching the flavor from my weed this whole time using my bong. So happy to have a Volcano now. &lt;3\u000a\u000aThe flavour I noticed was sweet and tropical while the high I experienced was light and airy; great for just lounging about. I used it primarily for appetite stimulation, anxiety and pain relief.

VThis is an intoxicating flower with a wonderful citrus aroma. The smoke wasn&#39;t harsh and it tasted better than other sour strains. The high was very relaxing compared to most sativas. Almost all sativas give me at least some paranoia but this one is has very little in the way of side effects.  Overall, this strain exceeded my expectations in every single way and left me with a smooth, comfortable, high.

VSour Jack comes around herr once a year for a few weeks,and i grab every bit i can. One of those strains you wanna keep all for yourself. The flowers are bright green with fire red hairs.White crystals dust every nug,but in certain spots they cluster so much you cant even see the green. They are long and somewhat airy but not in a bad way. The smell has something distinct about it, along with the piney/diesel and citrus flavor/smell, it also has a unique freshness to it,almost like a minty smell/flav, the smoke is verrry light and clean,but extremly potent at the same time. 1 or 2 hits will have you flying high with amazing sativa effects,instantly makes your eyes widen and gives you a slight energy boost,but not over the top. No anxiety worries here. It really is the best of both worlds with sour jack.

VDensely pack dark green nuggets with red hair and a diesel aroma. Heavy diesel flavor but smooth.\u000aMedically; Giggly high with pain, depression and anxiety gone completely. \u000aI love the way it smooths out the rough edges of the day while allowing you to focus on the tasks at hand. You can either stay active to complete tasks, hang out watching a movie or decide to take a nap.\u000aSide Effects; Dry mouth. Zero munchies!!!\u000a

VI love Sour Jack.  This is probably my favorite strain of all time. After one bowl, I definitely feel the uplifted, happiness that this strain gives.  The high ( for me ) last for hours.  Have food ready.  It smells like diesel/citrus, and for some reason stung my nose after i hit it.  Wouldn\u2019t recommend this to a new smoker as it is very potent, but at one point YOU MUST TRY SOUR JACK\u000a

VAbout half way through a gram of this Sour Jack sugar wax and it&#39;s definitely a heavy sativa strain. Though I haven&#39;t found this sample to be particularly strong (but the citrusy-diesel smell on this!! Phew!), I have enjoyed this for that creative pep in my step and some stronger-dosed sessions of self-reflection. It&#39;s not quite a creeper, nor does it hit full on within the first few seconds, but when it starts it climbs steadily for a quite a while. As with many sativas, the high can have a number of peaks and troughs, so ride with caution and give it some time before re-dosing.\u000a\u000aNot recommended if you suffer from anxiety or are prone to paranoid stoner moments...wait...did you here sirens?

VI&#39;m new at describing strains.  I wanted to try sativa over indica for my personal needs.  I wanted something  upbeat, creative, energetic yet calming.   Sour Jack is all that.  And for me at least it, it let down after a bit and settled into a comfortable state with no couch lock.

VThis strain is all about exactly what was said about it by Leafly and the couple of people who reviewed. It&#39;s a super &quot;up&quot; high that has pretty much kicked my depression out the window. Feeling really good right about now. This strain&#39;s aroma is really, really nice too. Kind of a pine-citrus-sweet smell. I give it the 4.3 that Leafly did.

VThis  bud is really nice! This is a really nice flowery sativa. It soothes PTSD and Depression. This Bud is one that motivates you and you can function on. At best I give this a 4.8!

VAfter smoking quite a bit of this, I&#39;m honestly not a huge fan. Taste is pretty bad, especially after smoking a good amount and the effects can be paranoia inducing if you&#39;re not ready for it.
