VThis was recommended to me at a dispensary outside Denver (The Highway in Downieville, CO) when I told the bud tender I wanted something Indica dominant that would relax me at night, make me happy, make me feel like my body&#39;s getting buzzed for once. I have quite a tolerance and it&#39;s been a while since I actually felt high. She suggested this hybrid instead of pure indica.  She was right. I&#39;m high again with a good body buzz. It&#39;s one of the most relaxing strains I&#39;ve used in a while. Nice tingly feeling mostly in my lower body without being too euphoric.  This is definitely what I need after smoking sativa strains to keep me focused and thinking all day - this counteracts that, helps me relax my brain. I will make hash with my remaining supply. Can&#39;t wait to see how that works.

Hard Pain Killing Indica  that Creeps up my painful back what with All This Traveled, but to discover a new vital Pain Medical Cannabis Strain that I would love to have in my Legal Garden.

VCataract Kush is one of the most iconic strong earthy strains that is a favorite amongst the rest of my other patients here.\u000aThe Smell: Popping open the funky swirly label in purple I am hit in the face with a pungent odors of funky then fresh cut grass and earthy fresh mud as if it has just rained, very loud.\u000aBud Freshness: I can always tell how well a bud has been treated when it comes to not only how it smells but how it feels when grinding this up. After a few turns of my grinder I notice the bud is very moist and super fresh smelling releasing a lot of the cbg the earthy fragrance is just so nice. \u000aThe Look: Enormous nugs as big as a jalepe&#241;o, very dank heavy darkened moss color like spinach, with a foxtail at the top. Small patches of blistering orange around the middle and bottom part of this nugget weighing 2.5 grams.\u000aThe Taste:Woody, that earth taste followed by a lot of dryness afterward vape ligers around for a bit like the old cartoons that resemble smoke, the vape in this mag is super milky can&#39;t even see through it like a ghost in a bag :D\u000aThe Effect/Condition: I use Cataract Kush for a number of my conditions not to mention it&#39;s a great pain reliever if I have been having a hard time getting up or lifting larger items I notice my aching back. This old strain is great for the way it acts on my mind making me relax and kick back to watch one of my favorite shows on youtube.I also use this specific strain if I am having a hard time focusing, I have ADHD and this just relaxes me to where I can concentrate on one subject and get it done within one sitting. Cataract Kush is great for glaucoma and scotopia, It makes light have more of a brighter trail beam lingering over each light and sort like a rainbow halo over each bulb. I highly suggest this strain if you&#39;re looking for a nice relaxing buzz, it helps with fine tuning while cooking. I recommend this to those who have Pain and as well as concentraiting issues makes light bearable when most of the time I have to wear shades even in doors. Helps with depression and motivation to get back on track. Happy and euphoric feeling especially with music. You&#39;ll get a big appetite with this strain too if you also don&#39;t get the signals to eat :D

VThis is one hell of a strain! Its high THC and high CBD levels make it pack a real, long lasting punch. Though it says hybrid, this is a heavy indica leaning strain. This strain has given me the most intense euphoria I&#39;ve ever felt from weed, and I&#39;m no novice smoker.\u000aBeing that its an indica, it knocks away all my pain. It also has a habit of initiating couch locks. Its a wonderful bed time strain, in my opinion.

VIf you&#39;re sore have heavy pain and cramps then I suggest cataract Kush. Cataract Kush is great if you have a hard time just moving throughout the day but say you go on a walk and you want to go further  before your joints are hurting cataract Kush is able to take away the pain and leave you manageable. It&#39;s a very dark earthy strain and it&#39;s very dank if grown correctly. Hey causes a lot of dry eyes and dry mouth but if you&#39;re able to take the taste this relaxing calming affect is perfection.

VThis is a heavy stone that creeps up about ten minutes after smoking and keeps building in intensity long after the smoking has ended. Combine that with the creeper effect, and it can cause serious couchlock for uninitiated. Lightweight smokers may have an unpleasant experience if unprepared, but those who are after the big stone indica will be pleased with the hashy, spicy-sweet flavor that brings the rich pungency of Eastern spices. Medical users will enjoy this strain\u2019s usefulness for pain relief, encouragement of appetite, and assistance with sleep.

VDNA Cataract Kush is a great medical strain, with a very strong and pleasent body buzz. Wonderful creeper high, as people already mentioned here. Great for pain relief and sleeping disorders. Aroma is kind of minty fresh during exhale, with typically pretty intense kush smell. No matter if you enjoy this hybrid (OG Kush x LA Confidential) in the evening hours or after sunrise, she will set you in stress-off-mode within minutes. Another enjoyable thing i&#39;d like to mention, is that the Cataract Kush does not make you feel paranoid or &quot;brainy&quot; uncomfy in any way. It keeps your thoughts untouched and relaxes your mind as well as your body.

VCataract Kush was recommended to me by a bud tender and I have to say he did me a favor. Dark green buds covered in crystals, it does indeed creep. However, it seems to creep for longer than just 10 minutes--I finally leveled off around 30. I wouldn&#39;t say this is the best indica-dom hybrid I&#39;ve ever had but it&#39;s damn close. The only thing is I&#39;m not so sure this would be the best choice for your novice or occasional smoker because of the creeper aspect and the possibility of a novice pulling a Maureen Dowd. Nevertheless, this is a damn fine strain that I wish I could still find because I&#39;d definitely buy it again.

VThis is the combination of two known winners, LA Confidential and OG Kush.\u000aShe finishes in 8-9 weeks and has blankets of crystals! The Cataract Kush looks almost grey-black when cured. The flavour is LA dominant with the OG Kush coming through in the exhale. The nugs look OG with LA density. This is the perfect combination of these two strains and the high is VERY strong!\u000a\u000aThe effect is good for pain, eating and sleep disorders. Most describe Cataract as a &quot;creeper&quot; high that keeps on building long after you stop smoking!\u000aThis strain has been years in the making and is NOT recommended for the light weight smoker!\u000aAbove average yields and dense frosty nugs are easily achieved by the novice as well as seasoned growers. After you experience the Cataract Kush you&#39;ll think you have cataracts!\u000a\u000aFlowering period - 8 - 9 weeks\u000aHeight - Medium\u000aTHC - High\u000a\u000aDNA Genetics \u000a\u000a

It made me feel as if I was drifting in space and doing the Alien dance (whatever that is). It may be a little strong for a new medical patient.

This strain allows me to briefly leave the world, but am still conscience at the same time. Very unique.

VOne of my favorites without question! It combines two of my all time fav strains, to create a whole new beast. Effects start slow and creep into ur mental/ physical space and them BAM, eyes low and sticky... Smell is similar to the taste, really gassy and earthy, with that familiar kush/ citrus afghan taste. This is very close to their Holy Grail Kush, with more indica from the LA. Classic!

VLike some of the others have said, this strain is not for lightweights. A little goes a long way, but if you can handle the stronger THC content, this is a nice strain. For me, the high peaks about 45 minutes after two or three decent rips from my bong, and I feel relaxed and quite happy. Kind of a harsh inhale, but it has a nice pine exhale. It&#39;s versatile enough where I can either sleep or go about my day doing school work. I have a whole ounce of this and I&#39;m thrilled, because I have nothing but good things to say about it.

VThis is a very high 5 stars in my opinion.  This is straight up FIRE!!!  At least the batch I got was nothing but fire.  Very LOUD!  The smell is insane, especially when you blunt it up.  All forms of smoking are awesome with this strain.\u000a\u000aDefinitely buy this if it&#39;s on the shelf.  I would recommend this for smoking, vaporizing, and medicine making (i.e. tinctured, in a salve, infused in oil, edibles, etc...).  Seriously super strong medicine, that will alleviate pain, and help you sleep.  I would only smoke this in the evening when I was done for the day.  You don&#39;t want to be running errands when this medicine is working on you.  This is what you go for when you&#39;re trying to go to bed or are in need of serious pain relief. \u000a\u000aAnother thing to take into consideration is that this strain is most definitely a creeper.  It will intensify as time goes on.  I personally love that, especially when I&#39;m in a lot of pain.  It&#39;s great for insomnia.  I know it&#39;s categorized as a Hybrid, but what I was smoking seemed way more like a pure Indica.

The buzz lasts for several hours. \u000a\u000aThe Cataract buds I have now seem stickier than I remember. Ill scissor this instead of grinding. The smell os powerful but not as stinky as Skunk or some of the OG Ive had recently. \u000a\u000aOverall, its really good. Try it!

It made me feel as if I was drifting in space and doing the Alien dance (whatever that is). It may be a little strong for a new medical patient. However, In my opinion , this is a perfect evening strain. You get the energy, pure happiness and a gradual come down into a perfect blissful sleep. (5 stars)  Cheers

VIts nicely dark green and purple edges give me a sense of heavy hitter. This will make your limbs very heavy as the relaxing effect soothes your limbs before arriving at your head numbing the pain of my lower back. I love how the colours around my house lamps anything bright have streams of the light much sharper. It also enhances the night time to be more like day time I can see so much clearer on this than normally. I really recommend those who have glaucoma. It&#39;s a heavy hitter too so it will cause dry mouth. It&#39;s better than dealing with pain all day long. On the downside it will make you very sleepy; great right before bed.\u000aIf you suffer from mania this helps as well!

VDefinitely a hard hitter. Potent chill with heavy head high.  I was left satisfied, happy and relaxed. it felt indica dominant. Being new to the canna-world I would say stressed and wanna lay on the couch listening to music, this is a good companion.

VNot for the faint of heart.  Superb for migraines, insomnia, and nausea.  Just be prepared for a very dry mouth as well as eyes.  Smell is slightly sweet, and the nugs are on the sativa side in terms of texture.  And yes...  It most certainly creeps up on ya like a puma!

VI&#39;d give Cataracts 10, but 5 was highest. Very smooth and fast acting smoke, that lasts way longer than most. I suffer with PTSD and insomnia, and after smoking this it was lights out. I also mixed this with a pinch oh Herojuana\u000a, and it was bananas good Son.

VA really nice strain. I do know it was grown all organic as well which always helps, but it looks, smells, and tastes great! It&#39;s got a nice sweet taste with an earthy undertone. Really diggin it, and would highly recommend for a chill night smoke. Got me baked like a cake haha\u000aP&amp;L
