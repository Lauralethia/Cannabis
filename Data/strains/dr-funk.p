VLove it! Super tasty &amp;super heady. Gorgeous sherbet orange hairs with frosty white trichomes covering the grass green buds. Perfect day time bud as not a heavy indica &amp;won&#39;t give you couch lock. I picked up an eighth of this Grateful Meds Talent for a reasonable price! Very pleased! \u000a

VI was having quite a bit of a problem looking for a strain that didn&#39;t induce paranoia. I have high anxiety, so I knew I had to find the perfect indica strain.\u000a\u000aAnd let me tell you, I found the right damn strain.\u000a\u000aThere isn&#39;t that much of a head high. However, the effect on your body is amazing. You feel a bit numb, as if you&#39;re floating on a cloud. I have the time of my life cooking and playing video games with this strain. This feeling lasts me about 3 hours. At the end of the night? It&#39;ll be the best sleep you&#39;ll ever have.

VThis Strain should be called Dr Viagra or Dr. F*ck.  About half way through a bowl I got a euphoric come up that gave me goose pumps, I&#39;m sure there is a terpene or cannabinoid in this strain that dilates blood vessels as I soon became aroused.  Music was enhanced, I quickly changed the song lineup to slow jamz and proceeded to engage in a mating ritual not unlike those male birds you see trying to entrance their woman, i didn&#39;t care how foolish i was, i lost inhibition and it payed off well...three times

VI tried some Dr. Funk BHO by Bhombkellys. The flavor was very mediocre, and I have trouble identifying any flavors other than earthy. The high had a punch to it, no lie. Very front loaded high that will leave you wondering why the sky is blue and why you aren&#39;t eating. Overall a unique high.
