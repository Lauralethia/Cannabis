VI just bought a 7g. It&#39;s a good strain. It litteraly smell like some oranges. Give you a nice smooth high. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a kind of weed for someone who doesn&#39;t smoke a lot.

VThis strain indeed lives up to its name, you can feel something cold on the back of your head, then it takes a very firm grasp and makes u sleepy, its a little bit panicky, its a firm knockout in big doses. \u000aThe name is quite fitting because it induces a sort of stillness thats like very consistent, to me if felt like being over dry and stone cold place. If it hadnt made me anxious it would have been better.

VI&#39;m an experienced smoker and I love this stuff. The woody and pine taste is what really did it for me. brings me back to when I used to climb trees, now I&#39;m smoking them. The high isn&#39;t super strong, so it&#39;s good if you don&#39;t want to get fucked up. Just very nice and relaxing.

VGet you really high. Ripped, vaped and smoked this nice mellow strain. After lots of use, you start to feel the body high, couch magnet. If you lots of energies, you&#39;re still awake and so relaxed.

Il faudrais qu&#39;un bon pousseux s&#39;en occupe et le fasse pousser a la perfection .Juste pour le gout il en vaut la peine , gommant au boute . Svp rehausser la r&#233;putation du friesland svp.

VI got 4g for 20 so not too bad.I did not know what to expect. I took at least 20 bong hits it got me high but not very.\u000a\u000aI rolled me and my gf a joint each to go to the movies. We did not get high at all.\u000aI would not recommend this strain to anyone.

VFreezeland is known for being a sativa dominant &quot;biker weed&quot; from Quebec, allegedly getting its name from the strains ability to withstand the autumn frost.\u000aIt has a very distinctive, minty pine smell that would probably work well as a men&#39;s fragrance. The taste would be lauded by menthol smokers. Freeze is also characterized by small, green, feather light buds.\u000a\u000aAs a discount weed, it packs a powerful cerebral punch. It&#39;s not an energy drain, making it good for a daytime smoke. That being said, as a discount weed it can also give the user brain freeze. Personally, I find after I smoke an eighth of this weed I stop getting high from it. \u000a\u000aIt won&#39;t impress your friends, but it won&#39;t waste your time or money.

Vtakes quite a bit to get you high but that&#39;s what i like about it. can smoke a bunch without becoming a potato, and is the most active strain i have tried (though i haven&#39;t tried many). usually i smoke a very small amount and i have a great time; i laugh, dance, and am able to complete tasks. pretty good for pain although i do not experience clinical pain, and i can see why some may get panicky on this. for me it&#39;s just a very active weed that&#39;s good to smoke with a bunch of friends.

VIt&#39;s strong. Cheap and strong.\u000aDon&#39;t go all out if not used to weed. Been smoking for couple weeks and love it. Makes you very social but lean back at the same time. \u000aYou should know the high is pretty hard to dissimulate.

VAbsolutely great for casual highs and for beginners. Really pleasant effects, and really hard to green out on.\u000a\u000aThe downsides are : this isin&#39;t a great strain to get really high on.\u000aAlso, to get a decent high, if you are a little overweight or you are used to the effects of cannabis, you need to smoke a lot of this.\u000a\u000aI really recommend it if you can have a good price for it
