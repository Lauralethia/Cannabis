VLucky enough to get some of this from Reliable Medical Services #2.\u000a\u000aJust 2 hits on the mini-bubbler and I was able to sit at my system for 2 hours straight getting work done. Usually I can do 30 minutes at a time, I blew out both knee&#39;s and my back.\u000a\u000aI hope the keep this in stock

VShared a bowl with one of my friends on my Sherlock pipe and felt it almost immediately. It has an amazing smell and a great high, relaxes your whole body but doesn\u2019t make you tired, really euphoric. I have major depressive disorder and after smoking this I was really talkative and couldn\u2019t stop laughing at first. All in all it\u2019s a great strain and I definitely recommend it.

VThis is fast becoming one of my favorite strains for enjoyment.  The pain relief and general sense of well being are even, long lasting, and consistent with every use.   While Sweet Kush would be an excellent choice for mild to moderate pain/nausea, my #1 recommendation would be for stress.  Sweet Kush truly just relaxes the mind and melts away tension.

VVery uplifted. One of the best strains I&#39;ve ever had. I really like this strain because it makes me have an apatite. Very fruity taste.

VI just tried this strain and have been very pleased with the results.\u000aThis is a really good strain for those that are stressed for the day. \u000aI&#39;ll be smoking and vaporizing this on a regular basis.
