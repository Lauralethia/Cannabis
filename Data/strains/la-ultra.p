VThe very high CDB level in this strain makes any pain or headache go away and you feel like you&#39;re floating. It&#39;s got some serious anxiety killing power, too. Not as euphoric as I thought it would be but it still makes me feel very happy and at peace. Great for insomnia, anxiety, pain, and mental well-being.

VBites the nose, and then, a chemical taste comes during exhale. Some Indicas can hit heavy. However, this is a mild evening high. You stay up for a while, do a few things, and then slip into relaxation&#127771;.

VAs I&#39;m typing this, I have the jar to my nose, I can&#39;t stop sniffing this! It has a deep piney scent with beautiful citrus/lemon accents. It tastes delicious, especially on a vaporizer, and will leave a lemony basil taste in your mouth. This strain is very relaxing and introspective. Perfect for watching something like the Godfather and noticing all the subtle commentary. Smoked hundreds of strains, and this is one of my all time faves. If you see some, grab it! You won&#39;t regret it!
