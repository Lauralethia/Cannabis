VThis shit is incredible. It&#39;s not your average strain but rather a combination of buds dipped in hash (oil?) and then dipped thoroughly in keef. What you get is a heavy hitting, out of this world high  -that is guaranteed to stone you no \u000amatter what your tolerance level may be. That said get ready to shell out 2x,3x or 5x

VI usually read other people&#39;s reviews of strains when I am considering buying. I bought some of this strain yesterday, and I find it to be quite potent, as others said! First I took one bong hit and waited a few minutes to see what effects emerged after one hit. I may not have waited long enough before walking out of the house with my dog, to take her for her walk. By the time we had walked 1/4 mile to the park, I was beginning to see what others had been describing! It does have a nice heavy body hit and I was so glad I had not smoked any more than I did before leaving the house. So, I would say that this is not the ideal strain, for me, if I need to actually do anything remotely active - which includes walking the dog!\u000a\u000aHowever, later on, when I was sure I was in for the evening and would not be required to go out again, I smoked another couple of hits. It&#39;s really strong, for me. I then saw what other reviewers were saying about this being the perfect strain for chilling and watching tv, which is exactly what I did. I did find that it allows my mind to wander nicely without falling asleep or losing the thread of even a simple soap! I enjoy the giggles - I am always on the lookout for strains that make me giggle, to fall about laughing, but I have great difficulty finding strains that work in that way, for me. This one is, so far, so I&#39;m going to enjoy this strain while I can.

VSince I am unable to locate the original BLUE MOON I am putting the review of the BLUE MOON I recently purchased at BREEZE BOTANICAL:\u000a\u000a2015 09.14  - 10:38pm:\u000a\u000aBLUE MOON - THC 18.14% CBD: 06%\u000aIndica Hybrid (not sure if it is sun grown)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFinally BLUE MOON showed up again \u2026 and it\u2019s almost a FULL MOON two more nights! It couldn\u2019t be more perfect timing. Was a bit stressed and just took a puff. It\u2019s 10:38pm at night. It seems it is a social high and am finding that instead of doing a NATIVE BEATS writing I am checking out chat rooms. It is coming on slow but strong and I didn\u2019t take a big hit. Nice.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.thinkwilder.com/blog/this-week-in-psychedelics-9916\u000a\u000aSometimes I just want to talk. It\u2019s a strange thing and it doesn\u2019t come up often and I don\u2019t mean with vocal chords. But I do miss the chitchat sometimes. Just babbling. Not really but kind of.\u000a\u000aThey are planning on making KRATOM illegal. Figures. Fuckers. Geez you find something that makes life a bit more enjoyable and they fucking slap a label on it that can send you to fucking prison! Really? Yes Really. We live in a complete insane asylum. Heh! I am probably not going to buy it illegally. I like that I could just go to the store and get something that helps but I doubt I will go out of my way to find this stuff. I have appreciated it for the time it has been here. Sing it for me Nelly:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.vevo.com/watch/nelly-furtado/All-Good-Things-(Come-To-An-End)-(US-Version)/USUV70702625\u000a\u000aI just Danced to about 5 Nelly Furtado songs as they kept playing one after the other and this bud is not bad for making the body move. \u000a\u000aNelly\u2019s a neat character \u2026 great voice \u2026 completely unique sound and she has such gorgeous eyes. I really don\u2019t notice eyes all that often \u2026 just a handful in this life have stood out as Amazing \u2026 the kind of eyes you just can\u2019t not notice and hers are one of them.\u000a\u000aI rate this bud pretty high still (heh \u2026 pretty high still) I am searching for \u201cThe Love Bud\u201d but I don\u2019t think you can buy it in a store. I haven\u2019t had any for a long time but it was/is a bud that is well loved on. When you buy it from a store \u2026 it\u2019s not \u2026 it lacks the Love \u2026 it\u2019s just not Love Bud if you know what I mean. There\u2019s some Weed that\u2019s like smoking a hit of ecstasy. That\u2019s what I mean. It is bud that some one tenderly cared for \u2026 they Loved The Bud and so their Love is in the Bud. It\u2019s not the same as store bought, but you get the idea. Maybe it was a once in a lifetime thing. Who knows I haven\u2019t come across any like it before or since so wah! However Blue Moon is a decent bud to sort of put the mind at ease, the body relaxed from it and the fear and tension that had been going on seemed to dissipate quite a bit.

VReally enjoyable, and it has really helped with my depression! The package I got says it&#39;s only 14% THC, but I&#39;m not so sure that is correct. I smoked a small bowl (one bud) and I was flat on my back for hours! \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a very relaxing and mentally uplifting strain. It has a nice steady buzz throughout. I highly recommend picking some up if you can find it!

VI could not say enough good things about this strain. The smell is great, taste is great and high is even better. As a student who is constantly stressed with all sorts of workloads, this is the perfect strain to dial-in on your work or get fired up for a wild night out. It helps a lot with stress and anxiety by providing such a great euphoric feeling. This is by far the best dope I have ever smoked, every time it is available it is a treat and a must-buy.

VExceptional Service... I came in for the first time... they gave me some different strands &amp; I also enjoyed their company as well. I&#39;m definitely going to come back and try more strands... it&#39;s a type of experience that anyone adult would enjoy

VThis review is for the strain Blue Moon Rocks not the product with the same. All I really have to say about this strain is it&#39;s pretty nice but it didn&#39;t really stand out to me in anyway and while I&#39;d definitely smoke it again I won&#39;t be going out of my way to find it.
