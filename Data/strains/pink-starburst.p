VOne of the best strains I ever had. Somehow smells and tastes just like pink starburst, and even for veteran users, this stuff works effectively and efficiently.

V8.5/10\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000aFlavor-\u000aInhale: 5- Tricks your senses at first with a flavorful, sweet &amp; savory taste, then sucker-punches you with a hot &amp; hardy finish. Could be overwhelming &amp; is very reminiscent of \u201cstrawberry cough.\u201d\u000a\u2014\u000aExhale: 9- Strong, flowery &amp; a subtle smoky flavor with a lingering sugary, tropical aftertaste.\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000aHigh: 8- Very nerve tranquilizing effect with a tingly head &amp; shoulder sensation. Great for day &amp; night use. (Haha I\u2019m slumped out on the couch rn)

VThis strain smells very floral and earthy and it does have a pink starburst undertone to it. Upon visuals it looks like dj shorts blueberry kush. It has red-ish color hairs, a mint green look to it, and it&#39;s caked with trichomes. My first dose I felt a strong cerebral feeling in the center of my head. I sort of felt stuck. I started to feel a lil relaxed and ended up watching some netflix. I&#39;m usually the connoisseur of sativa but this hybrid it like a perfect 50/50 buzz.

VLooks nice, smells odd. \u000a\u000aTastes like pure poison and chemicals. \u000a\u000aThe flavor is as if I am heating compounds from under the kitchen sink. I can&#39;t even describe how gross the first draw is. Reminds me of formaldehyde. Upon inhale the body wants to reject this smoke. Gag, a sickening, vometous flavor. \u000a\u000aOn the other hand, whatever it&#39;s laced with begins to work quickly. I&#39;m concerned it may be sprayed with synthetics. \u000a\u000aI&#39;d love to get this batch down to the university for testing to see exactly what the heck happened here. This batch was purchased in Tucson, Az, from a mmj dispensary.

Vthis is a very mellow and delicious strain I&#39;ve had so far. I can taste the hint of Starburst even a couple hours after I&#39;ve smoked. definitely a clean, perfect hybrid.
