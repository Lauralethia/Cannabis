VThe Herijuana side of Mad S put me in a really mellow mood, and made watching Game of Thrones really intense.  Finally lulled me into a a nice sleep.  My mind wandered a bit as  I tried to sleep as it does with anything that has even a trace of Sativa in it, and It did give me a slight headache, but overall very good night time strain.

VIt&#39;s real Mad Scientist ... It&#39;s cool sonofabitch!\u000a\u000aFor real though if you want to really de-stress at the end of the day, this is a winner. Be warned -- it&#39;s damn strong. This indica don&#39;t play! If you smoke this make no immediate plans. \u000a

VThis one is a first rate bomb. Very uncomfortable pressure headache similar to headband which I also detest. Zero pain relief. Made me drowsy enough to eventually pass out. But by then what difference does it make? Still in severe body pain and now my head feels like shit thanks to this studebaker of strains. I sincerely mean no offense to its advocates. I just don&#39;t know how else to say it. Fuck this one. Never again.

VI didn&#39;t know anything about TJ&#39;s Mad Scientist; but sure glad I did try something new.  This strain was good and effective.  I personally got a energy rush similar to a sativa, which got me busy with projects. Got busy doing things.  Eventually, the sensations mellowed and a sweet mellow mood followed.  I will try this again. \u000aTJ&#39;s Organic Gardens pre-rolled are top shelf quality.

VGrown by Burning Bush Seeds, sample i had was extremely potent, fast hitting indica followed by slow motion build up.  hit fast plus crept.  layed me out.  great for sore muscles and deep tissue pain.  excellant taste which surprised me as herijuana tends to be earthy bland.
