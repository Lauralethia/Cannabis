VAnother fantastic strain from heavy weight seeds. big yeilder, easy to grow, big fat buds, not to mention the fruity tast is very present.  the thc levels are high and it definitely hits you hard and fast, you will be giggling in minutes. would recommend to anyone, heavy weight  strains are top shelf smoke in my opinion.

VFruit Punch (Skunk X Haze X Northern Lights ==Heavyweight Seeds)\u000a\u000aTHC 15.00%  CBD  1%\u000a\u000aEmerald City Medicinal\u000a\u000aTruly is all that was said in reviews before mine.  But to reiterate this strain packs a very upbeat &amp; fruity punch to the head. More  a super tasty fruit punch from a wedding with oranges &amp; pineapple pieces floating at top that is dipped out with a ladle into cup rather than a kool aid version.  Sweetness that lingers on the back sides of the tongue for a few minutes. The effect is fairly short lived being about an hour or two.  Smoked a little over a half of a full gram preroll &amp; had a nice jolt coupled with my energy drink.  Would stay away from this combination for it left me with a constant longing for more of something that was probably nothing attainable.  Much better feeling with no anxiety when enjoying the hour half of preroll minus caffeine the next day. As a bonus there was a touch of 1% cbd. Excellent daytime strain with a novelty taste everyone should try at least once for that alone.

VSuper potent! I definitely underestimated the effects of this strain, got me very giggly, talkative, overall hyper. Though, i felt a little anxious and maybe a bit paranoid but that could also be due to smoking a bit too much. Perfect to use if you need energy or just during day time.

VIt&#39;s interesting that this is considered an energetic sativa. \u000a\u000aI had assumed it was an indica before looking it up. It made my boyfriend and I both VERY lethargic.\u000a\u000aSex was really good on it initially, but then following that, we&#39;ve been too lethargic to even approach each other for sex, lol. \u000a\u000aThe comedown just left us very depressed and angry.\u000a\u000aOverall, I don&#39;t know that I would suggest it (but this was just my personal experience). It simply didn&#39;t work for my boyfriend and I.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m pretty confident that this is definitely what I received. It definitely smelled fruity (very similar to the fruity pebbles strain), and the high definitely hits you like a punch in the face.

VFruit Punch is no joke when it comes to flavor. The first thing that will hit when you lay eyes on this bud is it&#39;s powerful fruity scent of various sweet aromas that, surprisingly enough, give off a scent similar to a fruit salad. The flavor carries on through every toke with potent flavors adding to a very smooth hit. What makes this strain so special is it&#39;s added Haze lineage. Like most Hazes, the high is a smooth cerebral rush that provides comfort with every bowl. This is great for all levels of smoking although new comers should be weary of smoking a high dosage of this strain. Unfortunately the mix of Northern Lights in this strain will be enough to put you into a lazy or slumped high stage with enough hits. Fruit Punch&#39;s fruity traits and comfortable Haze high makes this strain a delight for any Sativa lover. Its medicinal effects will help patients deal with depression as well as anxiety making this strain a great Sativa Hybrid for any social event.

The highest levels I\u2019ve read about with this strain have been under 24%. The high is so very cerebral and yet not racey at all. Very visual effects without a trace of anxiety!\u000aSo tasty with a \u201creal\u201d fruit punch exhale. \u000aThis was so good I put it away for very special occasions. Definitely try this!
