VLoud exudes a strangely unique aroma, and produces an energetic, thoughtful high. My mind felt refreshed as it was flooded with positive ideas and emotions. It is not a strain that would completely knock someone off their feet -- mild, &#39;barely-there&#39; body high.

VGreat strain, makes you feel relaxed but focused gives you a good boost throughout the day really controllable, the only thing that I didn&#39;t like about it was the fact that it took me more hits then usual to get lifted.

VFun, up beat high. Very social buzz that kicks in pretty quick and lasts for a few hrs as it mellows out into the munchies and a good movie to fall asleep to. Just woke up and there is food everywhere and I really dont remember passing out. Strong B+, not enough indica feeling for my pain relief needs, but great bud for a little kick back or hiking, versatile medicine for me

VI think this strain is awesome. what an awesome bud this is for creativity, relaxation, playing music and a very good head high. when listening to music with this strain, you feel like the individual notes are mini roller coaster rides LOL to me it intensifies everything from what you hear to even something simple as the rain droplets during a rainstorm. after about a half hour to an hour, those Munchies will kick in and then you&#39;ll have an awesome peaceful deep sleep

VWith Hairs like Mufassa, the Dream is a plush and full nugget. The crystals aren&#39;t as abundant as some prefer, but the immediate taste and aroma compensates by far. A great relaxer that helped wit my back pain as well as my anxiety.  Look forward to a thoughtful Euphoric high that compliments the unique looking furry bud

VThis is my desperate last resort weed because i wouldnt be able to get anything else reason why is friend of mine has QPs of the stuff on hand, his favorite strain. It def gets the job done. A more clear headed high yet very introverted, just very mild effects, overall no pain real pain relief but does give energy and and stimulated appetite.
