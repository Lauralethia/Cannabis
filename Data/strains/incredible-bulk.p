VIt has a nice dance fate to it not too heavy for the body but also this head high that comes along with it is not as bad as well it&#39;s very motivating uplifting energetic a little bit but not so much a couch lock it&#39;s a little bit different from all the other types of Indica&#39;s that portray some of the same symptoms. Like a light spacing is a very creative thoughts and I would have to say the taste for this is very musky but very tea and herbal like it&#39;s very different from a lot of the other cannabises you will ever try.

VBest strain I&#39;ve tried. Easy grow, large yield with huge buds that are very dense, relaxes and relieves pain when smoked. I have severe PTSD and neck and back pain with constant back spasms and sciatica. Within 15 minutes after smoke and vape session I realized my back had relaxed and I felt at peace, as my pain and anxiety were gone. SUPER effects that resulted in my best night of sleep in a long time.

VEarly Saturday morning bowls &amp; cartoons is the perfect combination for this strain. This stain will give you the perfect chill buzz, but won&#39;t leave you stoned and sunk into the couch, I like that. No paranoia, or headache. It&#39;s almost perfect for me. The reason it gets a 3/5 is because it was a bit difficult for me to grow, which may partially be my fault. It was out of control! lol. I simply could not contain it it and had to harvest a little early, I recommend growing outside if possible.

VNugs are  big, dense and compact.\u000a\u000aA not so cured bud will smell sour and pungent but a well cured bud almost smells sweet and minty. \u000a\u000aThe taste, ot fllavor profile is\u000atropical, woody, w/ slight pungent and citrus.\u000a\u000aIts a solid strain. True to profile it was mostly sedative but not overly. the sativa edge keeps you in the stratosphere without flying off into space.

VFor $9/gram, an incredible deal and a decent strain. The bud is visually appealing in terms of color and consistency, and the smoke is not too harsh. I certainly felt &quot;downing&quot; effects ranging from relaxation, body euphoria, and perhaps a tad sleepy (but far from overpowering)... But these effects did not last that long. I think this would be a great end-of-the-day strain and a fair price would be $10/gram or less.

Smelled nice but not strong, looks nice and has a decent bottom end buzz to a good high.  Definitely a joint or blunt weed from what i&#39;m encountering, you&#39;ll just want a bit more than average bowl full to get where you want to go.

VOriginally, I overlooked this strain for more interestingly named plants.  I decided to give it a try since I was told that the people who have tried it would recommend it. \u000a\u000aLook:  It has the standard light green with orange hairs that most standard strains have.  Nothing out of the ordinary here\u000a\u000aSmell:  Honestly, it reminds me of citrus and skunk.  It definitely smells wonderful!\u000a\u000aTaste:  Incredible Bulk tastes part earthy and part herbal.  More of a robust flavor, but definitely tasty in it&#39;s proportions\u000a\u000aFeel:  It took me a moment to realize it had kicked it.  I was sore from the gym yesterday, but now I feel the pain affecting me much less.  I also don&#39;t feel much of a head fog, but my thoughts feel a bit disorganized.  Not in a frustrating way, just definitely something I&#39;d recommend for relaxing\u000a\u000aConclusion:  Definitely worth checking out.  Once again, I recommend it for someone looking to relax (even though I don&#39;t feel tired directly, I feel relaxed enough that I could fall asleep) or sleep.  I use it as part of a blend to help me get to sleep.

VThis a very beginner grower friendly plant. The plant can recover from mistakes you might make. I almost killed them several times with stupid beginner goofs. They always came back  It is easy to grow and has great buds with big harvests. \u000aThe weed itself is a bit harsh but not too bad. Gives you a nice mellow high.

VI&#39;ve seen outstanding reviews on this strain and its effects and of its yield so I decided to grow it myself. And oh boy she didn&#39;t disappoint. Great yields and tastes amazing when vaping - I consumed 1.2g within 5 minutes, shortly thereafter I was unable to move my limbs and was confined to the floor for a few hours in heavenly bliss!!!
