Vi had an amazing super diesel that knocked out practically every sour ive tried. from what i was told the real super sour is a sour diesel IBL crossed with mass super skunk. heavy skunk and diesel notes that fill up a whole house once that jars open..

VSuper Sour Diesel is and will always be my favorite strain. After two hits, strong cerebral effects start to set in.  The feeling is very creative, euphoric, and mildly psychedelic. The strong head high is followed by a mild, relaxing body stone. All pain is melted away.\u000a\u000aIf you love a really potent sativa, I strongly recommend this strain.

VA true sativa. After many trials with heavy indicas, I decided on a sativa that also offers pain relief and cerebral high. A great strain for outdoor activity, lots of energy to go on day hikes and feel energized. Also, enough cerebral high to spend a lot of time laughing at nothing in particular and forgetting what you were just doing. Stoney powerful stuff.

Vsmoked a dub joint by myself. the first rip hit me near instantly, and halfway through i was in my own little world. i became focused on this streetlight that was flickering and couldnt tear my eyes from it for about 10 minutes. then i finished the rest of the joint and started playing battlefield 3. it made me extremely focused like i was actually in the game. after an intense 2 hours of feeling like one of the expendables or something, i started coming down. the whole experience reminded me of sour deisel except instead of being completely unaware of my surroundings, i became more focused. no notable negative effects except for the usual dry mouth

VThis strain absolutely amazed me. I should have expected the extreme potency by the smell. It&#39;s very much like sour diesel but stronger. It didn&#39;t have the most pungent odor, but it spread everywhere in very little time. The buds are very well frosted and my particular batch was very well cured.\u000a\u000aNothing will prepare you for the effects the follow smoking these buds. One medium sized bowl will have anyone soaring through the sky. The rush is immediate and energetic. Waves of energy rush through out the body and a seemingly permanent smile will plaster your face. The most surprising aspect of this strain is how long the effects last. One bowl had me under it&#39;s effects for an astonishing 4 hours and I continued to be hazy headed for another 3 hours.\u000a\u000aSuper Sour Diesel is not for new tokers. The rush is at times overpowering and can scare some people. However, it&#39;s a great way to rediscover one&#39;s feelings for the more common Sour Diesel.

VThis is the best sour diesel i&#39;ve smoked to date. A friend of mine who i work with this purchased it in new york city. she brought the bud into work to give me and i could smell it on her from a distance, even though the 8th was triple bagged. It litterally smelt so strongly i could not keep it on me, and had to stash it in my car. this is the strongest smelling marijuana i&#39;ve ever come across, which is not really a good thing. when i got back to the car after work it completely reeked, and is still airing out. i only smoked one hit because it was so powerful and i didnt really wanna get that high. unfortunatly it got me way higher than i intended, and i had to make a trip to get visine before my grandma got home over three hours later. the high was like a sativa on steriods. if you&#39;ve smoked durban poison before you know what i mean with the rushes of energy. I  felt happy and excited after i smoked it which was nice. this is a very good quality high. i look foward to smoking a blunt in a couple hours when my grandma goes to bed. This is in probabaly in the top 3 best strains i&#39;ve smoked. i still feel a little high and it has been five and a half hours and i only took one hit. idn maybe i am just tired. there is no burnout at all. the high hits you right away, then really hits you hard after 10-15 miniutes after you smoke (or take your first hit, im not sure since i only took one hit). This is some very high quality marijuana. If it wasn\u2019t for the overwhelming smell I would say this bud is perfect in every regard.

VStrain: Super Sour Diesel (Super Silver Haze / Sour Diesel cross -- Sativa)\u000aTHC: 23.26%\u000aCBD: 0.10%\u000aLocation found: Sweet Leaf \u000aDate purchased: 4.8.16\u000aPrice: $8.00/g\u000aWeight: 1.05g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: This mix is beautiful. I have had it several times before and I remember quickly why I keep returning to this strain I discovered back around when Rec went legal in Oregon. It is another earthy diesel smell that packed a fairly good punch.\u000aLook: Tight machine trimmed nug. A little dry from this location but still crystal coated, light green and orange hair covering the entire dense nug.\u000aTaste: Worth it for this alone. If you can find a 20% THC version that is pretty by you, give it a taste. It is almost better, but not quite, tasting than some of the Sour Diesels I have enjoyed before. It is the best of the diesel strains mixed within the earthy wonderfulness of the Super Silver Haze.\u000aRecommendation for medicine: To me, it is an uplifting strain. Helps with creativity.  It has stress, pain and PTSD relieving qualities too.

VI love SSD, no not the type harddrive. It makes me feel energetic but yet calm as hell. Although that seems impossible, it makes you have a really nice body high as a sativa should and yet you are at peace with yourself. I also noticed it&#39;s a lot easier to socialize on it and even pay attention! I wish I could reup on it, but my local dispensary is out right now :(

VSo it has become apparent to me that this strain is part of the saiyan heritage. I&#39;ve had diesel, I&#39;ve even had sour diesel. Then Randy Orton outta nowhere with the RKO this strain goes super saiyan on me turning into super sour diesel. And let me say, it did not disappoint. I am more focused and relaxed while still feeling immense amounts of euphoria. Definitely gonna be added to my top 5.

VI was strain hunting and saw this at a local club, so I decided to pick up an 8th.  Tight dense nuggets covered in a myriad of hazy white crystals.  Beautiful orange hairs sprout from everywhere.  The aroma initially hits you with a gentle sweetness and then your nose is flooded with an electrifying sour lemony overtone, sending a wave of chills up and down your spine.  The smell alone acs as an aphrodisiac.  Upon vaping, more of the sweet flavor is revealed making the taste like a sour lemon drop candy.  Effects weren&#39;t felt right away, but seemed to slowly come on.  At the 01:00hr mark this single bowl has become psychedelic.  My thought process is completely altered.  My mind is making bizarre and creative associations, manifesting  highly unusual thoughts which is a state often experienced on traditional psychedelic plants.  Senses are amplified, the world around me feels like I&#39;m in a dream.  Music is godly at high volumes.  Food tastes like it was sent from the heavens.  A wonderful sativa cerebral high that verges on being psychedelic.  This strain has the potential to give you a new perspective on life. It&#39;s that powerful.  I don&#39;t suffer from any prescribed pain, so my experience with this strain&#39;s pain management is unknown.  I do, however, face frequent depression and I found this strain to be very effective.  HIGHLY recommended for creativity, stress, and depression.  This strain is now in regular circulation.  Good vibes!

VI felt the need to write a review, because of all the mixed reviews on this strain, and how it relates to migraine headaches... Because of all the mixed reviews I read, I was worried about trying it - SO GLAD I DID TRY IT!\u000a\u000aI suffer from horrible, migraines, as well as severe neck &amp; back pain, and this really helped. I just felt relaxed and mellow. Most people say it gives them energy, but I tried it at night so I just hung out and watched movies. Felt a little anxious, but only because I wanted to do something and at 10pm there isn&#39;t anything to do, lol.\u000a\u000aDepression is such a major issue for me, as it relates to pain, and this is the first time in years where I felt happy, relaxed, giggly, and sexual.\u000a\u000aI did get a mini head rush - nothing I would describe as a headache - but it subsided after a few minutes. And rather than taking a long inhale, I did short mini ones - a few minutes apart. I think this helped keep the head pain, (that others had described), at bay. \u000a\u000aFor me, nothing negative to report. I love it!

VOne of my top three strains.  Great for chilling with a good movie.In the evening but just dandy for daytime use as well.  Relaxing, yet energizing.  Potent, but a clear head.  Not sure how others react, but I find this strain amazing for male libido!  Follow this up with some Blueberry Tahoe when you&#39;re ready to sleep.  Perfect, peaceful, pain free night...

Vsmells light. woody and sweet.\u000aNatural Solutions is Scientific with their cultivation practices and have the Hottest budtenders\u000acalyx to leaf ratio: 7\u000aone rip= soft smoke, green flavor. sad. I would&#39;nt call this diesel.\u000atwo= nice lung exspansion\u000athree= bad flvor, but comes through on the THC content. Definately does the job.

VTried SSD for the first time today. I&#39;m not usually a Sativa fan, but WOW, what a wonderful vape in my Pax 2!  Smells exactly like diesel fuel.  Beautiful large buds.  Its a great &quot;I&#39;m not going to sleep soon&quot; strain.  A clear head high that provided relaxation, focused thought and relief from my chronic pain.  Can&#39;t wait to pick up a larger quantity at my next dispensary visit!!!

VI took 1 puff 2day and was buzzed 4 about 15 minutes then I finished the rest later and was high for almost the whole day  won&#39;t recommended this 4 be smokers. The first thing I felt was a tingly feeling in my left hand then I felt a huge body of energy and started 2 laugh at my own thoughts. Overall I think it is some of the best out there\u000a

VHoly hell does this stuff hit you hard. Not for novices that&#39;s for sure. A very intense high that almost doesn&#39;t have a ceiling, almost unsettling at first if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming. Very pungent and extremely in your face like any good Sour or Sour hybrid, earthy and herbal, it&#39;s a strain that takes you on a journey. I highly recommend it as a weekend strain as it&#39;s energy level is tremendous, perfect to start or end a fantastic night with friends

VHalf Baked: Jon Stewart: &quot;Ever had Toast?&quot; Dave: &quot;Yeah sure&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;Ever had Toast, ON WEED?&quot; Lightly Toasted thank you is how I think of SSD. Too much (I mean a LOT) of SSD and we approach crispy critter burnt toast syndrome. Smooth, takes the edge off but yet there is a clarity edge, strange combo. Everything the day after has a warm yellowish glow or &quot;haze&quot; to it. Bit of munchies the day after but not during the high. There is a &quot;skunky&quot; Bliss that is always present. Chill yet alert at the same time. Not fuzzy at all, more like rounded corners like everything is sanded smooth. In bed, definitely love the warm blankly sensation. My Body thermo-regulation (hot/cold) was a little bit weird but no big deal. That mistress bitch who I adore, Super Silver haze, is always in the background providing clarity but also an little bit of an edgy paranoia, not a lot, but just enough to tap you on the shoulder and say &quot;I&#39;m here&quot; but easy to brush off because the Chemdawg/Skunk in the Diesel helps keep everything low chill. The Super Silver Haze half of the hybrid does provide that excellent &quot;soaring&quot; &quot;lifting&quot; quality that she is so good at but it&#39;s tempered. Definitely has a creative side, excellent for painters, artwork, etc. Inspires new perception/outlook on art. This strain is like the complete picture, it has a bit of everything good but is definitely Sativa leaning. No Couch lock here unless you smoke 5 bowls of chipped off heads and then it&#39;s time to say goodnight. Talkative. The Introspection is the hallmark, you *will* think deeply about you life, your dreams, desires, accomplishments and lack thereof, etc. I also call it &quot;technical&quot; weed because I&#39;m always thinking how to do everything in an exact nature but not really worried about it that much. I&#39;ve smoked this over the years and it&#39;s always very similar, dependable and I always enjoy it. One of my top 10, maybe even top 5.

VIt\u2019s great for depression and fatigue, not to mention boredom. Makes you giggle at little things, makes you want to talk, makes everything easier and almost fun. I cleaned three litter boxes this morning before realizing I was doing work.\u000a\u000aThere is the \u201ccoming down sleepy\u201d effect but in a vape (or not, if it\u2019s a recreational state) this is a great all-day type strain for productivity and good moods.

I loaded up my chillin with a dense nug and as soon as I took a hit I felt and tasted the sheer potency of this 28% flower. Yum. I&#39;m usually a 2-3 hit every hour or 2 type of smoker, but I must say I was completely satisfied off of one hit.

VThis has been one of the best non-haze sativas I&#39;ve ever tried. I love the delicious sour, citrusy petrol scent. It transfers to flavor perfectly in a vape, one of the best tasting strains I&#39;ve tried in a long time. I&#39;m a bass player, and this is one of the best creativity-stimulators I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure in partaking. It made me make some happy non-blues music for a change. I also love the happy, euphoric feeling I get from this, perfect for helping me get outta bed. I feel quite energetic under it&#39;s effects, perfect for a concert or party situation.

VI am a VERY light smoker in general, not in the past but currently.  I got some SSD from a grower friend, outdoor.  So dank, that distinct sour diesel scent.  Went straight to my dome, not my mind too much but my literal head.  Eyes are heavy but not tired or laid out.  Feels good, happy and chilled out but not too anxious, very thoughtful and vibin out on some deep ideas.  Strong stuff if you don\u2019t smoke often.  I took one tiny hit and I\u2019m lit.  If i smoked more I would probably be glued to the couch with anxiety flying through a vortex though, so be warned.  I wonder how many of the reviews left on leafly are done totally baked like a French fry....

VLocation: Unknown \u000aTHC: Unknown \u000a\u000aAdditional Notes: None\u000a\u000aAppearance Rating: 5.00\u000aAppearance Description: The buds are relatively compact, but are not actually dense. They&#39;re a vibrant lime green with a sparse amount of orange, red hairs. They are well manicured and very frosty. \u000a\u000aTaste Rating: 5.00\u000aTaste Description: This is a tough one to describe. I get some of the skunk, fuel funk from the Sour Diesel.  However, I also get an earthy and sweet, fruity flavor that almost reminds me slightly of peaches on the exhale. \u000a\u000aEffects Rating: 5.00\u000aEffects Description: This is a great Sativa. It not only gives a nice burst of energy, but also brings on a lot of Euphoria. There was no anxiety for me on this one. It does a great job as daytime medicine as it allows you to remain functional. \u000a \u000aOverall Rating: 5.00 \u000aOverall Summary: I&#39;ve always been a fan of Super Silver Haze and Sour Diesel. If you also are, I think you will enjoy this strain. With a great high and phenomenal flavor, what more could one want? \u000a\u000aI&#39;m Keith Von Fraichen ... You Keep On Fraiching

V[Super Silver Haze X Sour Diesel] \u2022 Process\u2014Enjoyable onset, and lasts a solid time. Flower was very sticky and dense. // \u2022 Stoniness\u2014Strong, but not functionally overwhelming. Like a stoney haze over everything visually and somatically. Time moved at an easy (slow) pace. // \u2022 Somatic\u2014Very relaxing, to the point of laziness and not wanting to move. I smoked this all day of 420 outside at Dolores Park, and had an amazingly chill time. I snacked a lot, not sure if just for something to do or if I had hunger urges (probably a bit of both). My movements might have been a bit slower and deliberate. My eyes were not overly droopy, but got pretty red (that might have also been a result of smoking all day). // \u2022 Mood\u2014Very relaxed and happy. I people watched for hours. This strain was helpful with relieving anxiety and paranoia. // \u2022 Fx\u2014I could easily attend to tasks without much delay or distraction. Socializing was very easy and entertaining, even though I wasn&#39;t exactly talkative I could start up and maintain conversations. I could focus on future reminders and planning action steps.

VI&#39;m on the hunt for the TimeLess cartridge again. I&#39;ve only had maybe 7 strains so far (been learning VERY quickly the last month) in the search for a replacement for 14 years of opiates (and I started searching for a way to get through DTs). So far, this is hands-down the solution for me. The only taste/smell it has is very subtle and citrus-like, but really a treat. I normally don&#39;t &quot;like&quot; vaping in terms of flavor/smell, but with this one that was a non-issue on top of the amazing benefits of this strain. I work constantly (software development and IT) under its benefits and as long as I don&#39;t overdo it, my productivity is way up between the pain relief and focus.\u000a\u000aToo much, DOES get interesting though. I lose my ability to focus and follow along which KILLS my productivity (and makes me want to lie down).

VThis has been one of the best non-haze sativas I&#39;ve ever tried. I love the delicious sour, citrusy petrol scent. It transfers to flavor perfectly in a vape, one of the best tasting strains I&#39;ve tried in a long time. I&#39;m a bass player, and this is one of the best creativity-stimulators I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure in partaking. It made me make some happy non-blues music for a change. I also love the happy, euphoric feeling I get from this, perfect for helping me get outta bed. I feel quite energetic under it&#39;s effects, perfect for a concert or party situation.

VAfter a couple different batches of this, I&#39;ve found it to be a bit too speedy and narcotic for my tastes - almost like a more potent, slightly longer lasting Green Crack type high, with the raciness of Sour Diesel added to that.  I had a little month-or-so honeymoon with this strain then eventually stopped smoking it, it was just too much for me, and I generally like extremely stimulating weed, so that is saying something.

VWell I bought this at The Bloom Room in San Francisco, CA. It was on the Sativa menu, I pulled it up on Leafly just to double check. Sure enough, it says Sativa.\u000a\u000aNow normally I\u2019m an Indica person, but once in a Blue Moon I\u2019ll grab a good Sativa to have on hand for more social situations and for my relatives and friends who don\u2019t dig Indicas. \u000a\u000aBut I was buying this strain specifically to share with my dad (who only really likes Sativas) and a close female friend (Sativas rev her up, ya know..?) so I spent a pretty penny on a 1/4 of this Top Shelf stuff. \u000a\u000aLooked amazing, smelled absolutely incredible, covered in sugary trichomes....\u000aSmoke up and.... WAY more Indica than I could have ever possibly imagined!!! Hahaha! This knocked everyone\u2019s ass out! I thought it was just me but, nope. Everyone who tried got heavy, couch-lock style Indica effects. What a trip!\u000a\u000aJust goes to show how much of an effect your grow environment, medium, nutrients, lights, harvest time, cure, etc, etc, can really change the outcome of your bud\u2019s phenotype! It was definitely an excellent Indica thou! Lmao.

Vopen the bag and I see 3 giant doo-doo log turds, each one 7 grams or more. Fat, rotund, covered in red hairs and frosted the fuck up with trichomes, these giant weed-dongs looked like a green and glazed baby&#39;s arm that was throbbing, so ripe and firm. It waited, rigid from the cure, waiting for the chance to fist fuck my mind and cornhole my sense of reality. so damn intense and cerebral was the high, it sort of felt like I was mellowly tripping balls as I lay in the pitch black of my room, tool&#39;s &quot;10,000 days&quot; album provided the perfect soundtrack to my funhouse/ horror-core head trip throughout space and time.

I have to recommend for people looking either for the happy-giggly high we all love, or for ones trying to overcome social anxiety. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of chem-smelling strains, although with this one, I just can&#39;t seem to get myself to care. This is truly one of the most outstandingly pleasant highs I&#39;ve come across.

VThis is a very potent strain.  However, I have found that the harshness of this strain (using oil and vape) negates the many positive effects.  For me, and other users of MMJ, the breath is literally knocked out of the patient.  Recommend VERY slight inhalation if using vape, so as to avoid bronchiospasm.  VERY minimal, or be ready for the side effects.  I DO recommend this strain, using due caution on inhalation depth and length.  1 second is enough of an intake, and wait for your next inhale, if applicable.

This would land towards the bottom of my Top 10 Udder Favorite Strains.  Most any regular smoker, should have had some good Regular Sours at some point.  Imagine the harshness of the diesel softened with some sweet notes.  The initial high can hit after a few pulls and can be intense, but quickly softens into a full body euphoric udder hardening high that lasts for hours.  Not good for doing difficult tasks. Did not find helpful for pain or nausea.  Good for hanging around the barn with friends.

VI am a VERY light smoker in general, not in the past but currently.  I got some SSD from a grower friend, outdoor.  So dank, that distinct sour diesel scent.  Went straight to my dome, not my mind too much but my literal head.  Eyes are heavy but not tired or laid out.  Feels good, happy and chilled out but not too anxious, very thoughtful and vibin out on some deep ideas.  Strong stuff if you don\u2019t smoke often.  I took one tiny hit and I\u2019m lit.  If i smoked more I would probably be glued to the couch with anxiety flying through a vortex though, so be warned.  I wonder how many of the reviews left on leafly are done totally baked like a French fry....

VI&#39;m on the hunt for the TimeLess cartridge again. I&#39;ve only had maybe 7 strains so far (been learning VERY quickly the last month) in the search for a replacement for 14 years of opiates (and I started searching for a way to get through DTs). So far, this is hands-down the solution for me. The only taste/smell it has is very subtle and citrus-like, but really a treat. I normally don&#39;t &quot;like&quot; vaping in terms of flavor/smell, but with this one that was a non-issue on top of the amazing benefits of this strain. I work constantly (software development and IT) under its benefits and as long as I don&#39;t overdo it, my productivity is way up between the pain relief and focus.\u000a\u000aToo much, DOES get interesting though. I lose my ability to focus and follow along which KILLS my productivity (and makes me want to lie down).

VIt\u2019s great for depression and fatigue, not to mention boredom. Makes you giggle at little things, makes you want to talk, makes everything easier and almost fun. I cleaned three litter boxes this morning before realizing I was doing work.\u000a\u000aThere is the \u201ccoming down sleepy\u201d effect but in a vape (or not, if it\u2019s a recreational state) this is a great all-day type strain for productivity and good moods.

VHalf Baked: Jon Stewart: &quot;Ever had Toast?&quot; Dave: &quot;Yeah sure&quot; Jon Stewart: &quot;Ever had Toast, ON WEED?&quot; Lightly Toasted thank you is how I think of SSD. Too much (I mean a LOT) of SSD and we approach crispy critter burnt toast syndrome. Smooth, takes the edge off but yet there is a clarity edge, strange combo. Everything the day after has a warm yellowish glow or &quot;haze&quot; to it. Bit of munchies the day after but not during the high. There is a &quot;skunky&quot; Bliss that is always present. Chill yet alert at the same time. Not fuzzy at all, more like rounded corners like everything is sanded smooth. In bed, definitely love the warm blankly sensation. My Body thermo-regulation (hot/cold) was a little bit weird but no big deal. That mistress bitch who I adore, Super Silver haze, is always in the background providing clarity but also an little bit of an edgy paranoia, not a lot, but just enough to tap you on the shoulder and say &quot;I&#39;m here&quot; but easy to brush off because the Chemdawg/Skunk in the Diesel helps keep everything low chill. The Super Silver Haze half of the hybrid does provide that excellent &quot;soaring&quot; &quot;lifting&quot; quality that she is so good at but it&#39;s tempered. Definitely has a creative side, excellent for painters, artwork, etc. Inspires new perception/outlook on art. This strain is like the complete picture, it has a bit of everything good but is definitely Sativa leaning. No Couch lock here unless you smoke 5 bowls of chipped off heads and then it&#39;s time to say goodnight. Talkative. The Introspection is the hallmark, you *will* think deeply about you life, your dreams, desires, accomplishments and lack thereof, etc. I also call it &quot;technical&quot; weed because I&#39;m always thinking how to do everything in an exact nature but not really worried about it that much. I&#39;ve smoked this over the years and it&#39;s always very similar, dependable and I always enjoy it. One of my top 10, maybe even top 5.

VJust when you thought Sour diesel couldn&#39;t get any better! Well think again! With everything you love about the strain and more. Parenting Sour Diesel and Super Silver Haze brings this best of both under one Sativa Hybrid strain: Super Sour Diesel! And the Haze grandparent makes it a great pain reliever along with fatigue relief! I highly recommend this strain for anyone who loves their bud high in THC! This is the strain for you! Sold at Brothers cannabis dispensary on Division! The THC content for that batch comes up too 34%!&#128513;

Vopen the bag and I see 3 giant doo-doo log turds, each one 7 grams or more. Fat, rotund, covered in red hairs and frosted the fuck up with trichomes, these giant weed-dongs looked like a green and glazed baby&#39;s arm that was throbbing, so ripe and firm. It waited, rigid from the cure, waiting for the chance to fist fuck my mind and cornhole my sense of reality. so damn intense and cerebral was the high, it sort of felt like I was mellowly tripping balls as I lay in the pitch black of my room, tool&#39;s &quot;10,000 days&quot; album provided the perfect soundtrack to my funhouse/ horror-core head trip throughout space and time.

VAfter a couple different batches of this, I&#39;ve found it to be a bit too speedy and narcotic for my tastes - almost like a more potent, slightly longer lasting Green Crack type high, with the raciness of Sour Diesel added to that.  I had a little month-or-so honeymoon with this strain then eventually stopped smoking it, it was just too much for me, and I generally like extremely stimulating weed, so that is saying something.

VThis has been one of the best non-haze sativas I&#39;ve ever tried. I love the delicious sour, citrusy petrol scent. It transfers to flavor perfectly in a vape, one of the best tasting strains I&#39;ve tried in a long time. I&#39;m a bass player, and this is one of the best creativity-stimulators I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure in partaking. It made me make some happy non-blues music for a change. I also love the happy, euphoric feeling I get from this, perfect for helping me get outta bed. I feel quite energetic under it&#39;s effects, perfect for a concert or party situation.

VClocking in at 22.1% THC 0.06% CBD the flower was thick but fluffy, brown hues and dark pine. The taste was woody and earthy, but admittedly, not very tasty. \u000a\u000aThe onset is quick, very tingly. I do notice it makes my tinnitus a thousand times louder, overall it&#39;s a pure sativa without a doubt, and produces a very racy high.

VI&#39;m going to start by noting how beautiful these flowers are. Light and dark green infused with lots of hairs. Very fluffy and light yet sticky. The taste and smell are classic for a diesel which I love. This stuff is going to last awhile because it doesn&#39;t take much. very euphoric high. A bit of an energy boost before a drop off of relaxation.

VClassic Diesel scent with a hint of extra sweetness. Carries over into the taste. Tends to have more bag appeal but for me, seems slightly milder than Sour Diesel in almost every way, which there certainly is a time and place for, but I think the original still wins just slightly. Seems better suited for being social and/or focused because it&#39;s slightly less intense but still a very potent sativa. 4.5/5.

VI love this strain when I wake up in the morning! The high is so clear and uplifting and my anxiety and depression fade away completely for the whole day. The comedown isn&#39;t heavy or make you fall asleep which makes it ideal for daytime use. Highly recommend!!!\u000a

VSuper Sour is definitely a strain you should try. When compared to the original Sour D, you can smell the similarities of the scents but you can also notice the sweeter smell of Super Sour. This strain induces a strong cerebral high and will wake you right up. To me it had that classic Sour D taste when smoked along with a little extra. One of my favorite strains out there.

VI smoke on a daily basis but had never had the pleasure of smoking this strain until a couple days ago. This is a POWERFUL strain. I rolled a fat joint and it knocked me on my ass. I need to figure out the way dosage level for me but I was surprised at the potency of the strain and the strength of the cerebral effects. No paranoia or anything like that- it just hits you hard and then I knocked out. I would take it easy the first time smoking this strain  - even for experienced smokers, figure out what your ideal dosage is and ramp up. I haven\u2019t had a chance to experience the energizing sativa effects yet because I over indulged :)

VWhen grown (and fully died cured trimmed, whether self-grow or grown by a person who actually knows what they are doing) and you have a large wicker basket lined with a mile of wax paper FULL and OVERLY topping the overflow boundaries of the FRESHEST OF THE FRESH Super Sour Diesel there is nothing like it.  To me its my favorite (even tho there are many &quot;favorites&quot; this is the favorite of the favorites) - you can use it in moderation during the day and I am a graphic artist so it is like a hand-in-glove situation...come back from &#39;lunch&#39; and i&#39;m fully renewed with the creative juices and am very attentive to what I am doing. There are so many strains that are, to be honest and generally speaking, are all different BUT are ALL 10&#39;s out of 10 - whether it be a Kush. a Haze, a Crush, or any of these new rapidly emerging powerful and wonderfully perfected strains that are always emerging on the market, this is still one of the best of the best. I have a buncha things to smoke outta, but 1 hit outta my 3 and a half footer Illadelph Bong, I&#39;m stoned for 6 hours. Like HIGH and wanna get things done and be productive and creative and all the while I am rip-roarin&#39; feelin just perfect in my own self....mind, body, soul... And eyes so red they get purple if you don&#39;t watch it; this shit hits you fast, BUT ITS ALSO A CREEPER at the same time. So you just keep getting higher and well, your eyes keep getting redder... LOL It&#39;s my #1 if I had a gun to my head and had to choose an absolute #1, it&#39;d be Super Sour Diesel.

VSuper Sour Silver Diesel Haze by AuricAG\u000a\u000aI love this strain. It provides an upbeat and functional high, while being a little more spacey/heady than just Diesel alone. This is one of my favorite wake &amp; bake strains. It&#39;s pairs well with a sunny weekend morning, in your jammies while sipping coffee. It&#39;s excellent at addressing stress, depression, and pain issues. If you like Diesel, but want something a bit more heady/stoney, you&#39;ll definitely dig this one. Happy Smorkin! \u270c&#127995;

Vfirst off I want to mention i have a different strain, but its the same cross, its called the shire. so same strain, different name. now the review: im not usually a sativa guy, i have anxiety and prefer indica dominant hybrids. this strain is all head high, virtually no body high. its very uplifting, heady, creative, but also too hazy/foggy for this to be a good wake and bake strain or get stuff done type of sativa. its good for a mood boost, and its somewhat chill but still energizing. its not racy at all, just refreshing. more like a good nights sleep than a cup of coffee. otherwise it just doesnt really play a role in my life. its not great for socializing, or watching movies or going out into nature or getting stuff done. its just a decent mood pick me up and some creative thinking.

VThis is a new absolute favorite. It was a gray winter day, the kind where you know you&#39;ll be stuck inside all day long. Well, I smoked this incredible strain and decided that I needed to walk in the woods, despite the crappy weather. So I bundled up and half way through my walk the temperature went up by 30 degrees and the melting snow was producing a fog that was hovering gently in the wind...in short..beautiful. And to think that had it not been for SSD, I probably would have missed it all. Let this one take you for a ride.

VThis is a very potent Sativa that immediately hits you in the head. I picked it up from the Green Door in San Francisco because it was during the day and all I had on me was Indica. I&#39;ve had Sour D before, and the effects are similar (this one is more intense!) \u000aI did two bong rips and smoked half a joint before I was stoned to my tolerance level (daily smoker for almost a year - so that&#39;s impressive.) \u000aThe cerebral effects for me are in the eyes and forehead that slowly radiate towards the center of your head. 30 minutes into the high for me, the pressure goes away and then boom - it hits you. You&#39;re creative, introspective, and energetic! I&#39;m prone to anxiety when smoking, so I&#39;m always careful. This strain did make me a little anxious, but it was easy for me to ground myself unlike other Sativa&#39;s that make me anxious. So use with caution if you&#39;re like that, as this is potent.\u000aI&#39;m about one hour into the high now and it&#39;s still great, good for concentration. It&#39;s letting me work on one thing at a time without getting too overwhelmed.

VThe Super Sour Diesel strain I possessed had a fresher smell and taste to it rather than just Sour Diesel which contains more of an earthy odor and taste. The thin orange hairs accentuate the bright green color of the bud by giving it a color to contrast against; therefor making the bud seem even more bright than it already is. The Super Sour Diesel strain that i received carries an extreme cerebral uplift which would be good for the morning or throughout the day. I would not recommend smoking this strain at night because of the strong sativa qualities the strain has that would not allow you to get settled for bed. I mostly recommend this strain to chronic smokers only because it has such a high thc content that a newbie wouldn&#39;t be able to handle it without throwing up. If you are new to smoking and you want to try this bud go right ahead but i warn you, don&#39;t smoke too much before you even feel it hit you because you&#39;ll just get nauseous and sick.

VI BROWK WITH IT THE MEDS AMAZING SUPER SOUR D. I LOVE this strain Before I smoked this strain today. I was thrown in a beautiful sweet and subtle body high that hits you hard and my mind was super hungry and the high is great. I felt like it was a couch lock which made me so high. There was a little bit of a body buzz and then it felt like I was happier than I want to try this strain and I had a little bit of energy than other people&#39;s better, so if you know what they should open your eyes and they smoke a bit of this. I have to say it is strong and a good sativa lover.\u000aI really enjoyed this strain. It smells like cheese but the buds are dense and feeling potent and feel to do and smoke a little bit of the leaves that have been on the beach and work it hits you hard.

No paranoia or anything like that- it just hits you hard and then I knocked out.

VAdd this to the fuel, diesel lovers arsenal. Extremely dank jet fuel/diesel smell and taste. Harsh smoke that will definetly make you cough. Purchased &quot;middle shelf&quot; potency which seems to be a sweet spot of price with quality. I&#39;m prone to natural anxiety spikes so sativa is typically not my choice. This is a potent sativa with too much can trigger a little of the paranoid feeling. Simply know your limits. This is a slight affect most straight sativa give me so still 5 stars. Definetly makes you focused, creative, uplifted and euphoric. I&#39;d smoke this before meeting some friends or a fun activity it won&#39;t drag you down. Recommended for active day usage. If you smoke this later you definetly won&#39;t be sleeping for 2+ hours. This strain grave me more boost than green crack. It was a bad batch but just as comparison. Toke responsibly!

VA very potent in your face sativa.  Great for that first vape bowl just after coffee to get the day started.  It almost instantly starts creativity and ideas while relaxing the body and moderating pain.  Productivity and focus result while experiencing a nice head.  Not as mind numbing/pain numbing as Girl Scout Cookie, Gorilla Glue #4 oy Key Lime Pie but those also are not recommended in large dosages for the average stoner.  Pros only.  However this strain always pleases and is consistently good.

VI picked up a gram of Soulshines Ssd from the joint, September 2017. Expecting to smell Diesel or Skunk when I opened the bag, I was put off by the heavy sativa smell. Even though it visually looked like Chemdog, it&#39;s smell was Durban Poison. Which makes sense, one of the possible phenotypes from that cross would be straight sativa (sativa the strain not the sativa genus) since Sour D is a Mexican sativa cross. So if you are looking for Durban Poison I highly recommend Soulshine&#39;s Ssd. Otherwise stick with their Gorilla Glue #4.

VThis is the first Sativa I have ever liked. I&#39;m new to this. Having some trouble breathing when using it. My sober girlfriend noticed it as I was noticing it happening to me in the high. I&#39;m still alive obviously, but have smoked it three times, with less flower, with the same result. Has anyone had that happen with it? Did I mention I like the strain?\u000a\u000aWonderful for anxiety and stress that last long after you are high. Biggest pet peeve is that I have to get high in order to receive the benefits. It seems to have nothing to do with super silver haze according to the DNA online universe and instead seems to be a cross between a bunch of diesel strains and something called Venice OG. Sad when naming doesn&#39;t really work out the way you would hope it would.\u000a\u000aMakes everything really loud.

VNice buds! I picked up a couple grams of this strain and right away I knew it was gonna be good! The buds I got were very dense. Not too sticky. Packed pretty easily. The smell of this strain was really pungent and sour. It had a strong aroma too it but smelt very nice! The taste of this strain was really good. Tasted exactly like cheese! It was amazing! XD Now, the high is very strong. Very heady. Definitely felt the sativa effects with this one. The high is very present and very in your face. Pretty euphoric and uplifting. I must say this is one good sativa. Newbie smokers might find this one a little bit too strong so take it easy on this one if you have a low tolerance because this one&#39;s a smacker for sure!! Definitely recommend you try this strain! It&#39;s great! :) 5/5

VI got this strain and while it smelt great in the tub, I didn&#39;t realise it was mixed with Super Silver Haze. It didn&#39;t give me the euphoric feel or happiness I was told it would (asked for something like Quantum Kush) but instead made me hungry and tired. Not as good as I was told.

VSuper Sour is definitely a strain you should try. When compared to the original Sour D, you can smell the similarities of the scents but you can also notice the sweeter smell of Super Sour. This strain induces a strong cerebral high and will wake you right up. To me it had that classic Sour D taste when smoked along with a little extra. One of my favorite strains out there.

VI love diesel plants.  Period.\u000a\u000aI know what this is supposed to taste like because I&#39;ve been smoking weed since 1982.\u000a\u000aThis particular flower was PULLED a little TOO EARLY.  It wasn&#39;t sticky to the touch but had the basic taste and feel of sour diesel.  It wasn&#39;t keefed so that was good - added to the punch of the THC.\u000a\u000aThe strain I tried was grown outdoors - I can tell from the heavy stem and rough cut finish.\u000a\u000aThe buds are loose but tasty.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s hard to say I didn&#39;t like it because I like practically any diesel weed.\u000a\u000aWith any luck, I&#39;ll be growing some Blueberry Sour Diesel for this summers grow.  Last year I got lucky and found a White Widow seed that I grew into a beautiful female.  This year it looks like I&#39;ve got a Sour Diesel Seed.  Let&#39;s see how it does with me.\u000a\u000aLike Craft Beer Brewers, I believe craft weed growers will be the future of the industry.  I am one of those growers.  If you met me in public you wouldn&#39;t have a clue that I smoke.   Better yet, I believe its all about the flavor palette.  Look its not all about THC.  Shit man - just smoke some more if your not high enough.\u000a\u000aJust saying....  Its more about flavor than THC.  If its good flavor I can smoke all day and night.  If its heady and dense...  I&#39;ll probably just party for a bit and then crash.\u000a\u000aMore on this strain later this Fall.  hehe\u000a\u000aI should be the poster boy for weed.

VThis was really good stuff.  I experienced a intense increase in energy.  But when I was a young lad I had an accidental grand mal seizure. There was no come up to the said seizure bit if I try to imagine one, the effects produced by this strain would be spot on. That caused panic attacks and distress and fear. Regardless of how I felt I kept smoking, I soon felt so in the realm of death and out of my mind I was able to get over my fear of seizures from smoking marijuana. Take in mind this was the first medical marijuana I had ever smoked. I was used to street weed which I could smoke all day and not produce the effectss produced from a single bowl of the super sour d. At first I thought the cashier put pcp on my weed, and it made me angry because she&#39;s supposed to treat it like medicine. I soon drug tested myself and only had marijuana in my system! I could not believe how fucking strong kids made this shot now days. I feel bad for people that  have to smoke weed this strong to get high. You need to take a step back and realize this weed produced just as strong a psychoactive feeling in my brain as lsd, mushrooms, and percoden (but safer and healthier). If you read this and you get weed off the street and you think I&#39;m a pussy well I&#39;ll tell you something, medical marijuana is not even fun. The stronger strains like this one are serious medicine for people that need it. I went in thinking I could smoke any of the strongest strain they could make. I was wrong. This is like crack but I&#39;ve never smoked crack. Again this weed is strong and the head buzz is so insane you could compare it easily to crack or a seizure in my self proclaimed opinion. Thank you everybody and remember this shit should only be used as medicine, not weed. Thank you.
