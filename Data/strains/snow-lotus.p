VProbably top 5 strains of mine. Potency is high but the effect of this strain is unique and distinguishable. Smells potent as it is. The Herbal connect always has fire on this level

VThis stuff hits like a train for me, if getting  hit by a train was a good thing! I\u2019ve been out of it for awhile and just got more tonight I forgot how quick it hit.  Granted I\u2019m a evening/night smoker I don\u2019t get the energy from it, I find it super relaxing.  I have anxiety issues and a couple times it\u2019s made me a little anxious, but not paranoid.  Has a district flavor almost like a bit of seaweed, not a bad thing I love it.

VUsing a moderately small dab for me which is much larger for others but I was able to get a very very nice rush of good feelings happy feelings, my body feels more energetic I feel happier thinking a little bit more silly and it\u2019s definitely relaxing this is a great overall strain

V1 of the dopest dopes I&#39;ve ever smoked. Great long lasting euphoric effects with a light tingly body high. Nice for any day or night, one of my favorites.

VSeems like this one grew out really nice, chunky dense broccoli style bud but lacks the kick I was looking for. Has very little flavor profile and had no scent notes when it was ground up.\u000a\u000aAs for the head it&#39;s not soo bad, kinda hit me in the front but lacks the euphoric rush I look for in sativa based strains  I would pass on this, further evidence we&#39;re climbing higher in the THC content of strains. Hang on kids...
