VSweet earthy vanilla vapor that lingers around awhile and keeps your taste buds just begging for more! Pain melts away and stress levels taper off as it takes hold slowly. Indica? Sativa? Imagine a Root Beer Dream...yeah, its that good! Great flower for both novice and veterans if you can find it!

VPretty amazing that theres a plant with root beer charactaristics. I dont understand how. Anyways this smells and tastes of rootbeer. Its unmistakable. Like a dessert bud. Id keep this around as a treat. Its good. Nothin magical. But better than average. I feel energetic mentally but nothin overwhelming.

VVery nice! Good bud for zoning out to video games or creative activities like music/drawing. Tastes wonderful. Rootbeerish for sure. As for the reviewer saying the bud is sprayed? Lol maybe YOUR supplier does that. Has nothing to do with the strain.

VVery good Indica body high (pain relief) followed by appetite stimulation and a couple of hours of &quot;couch lock&quot; relaxation. It was very good at reducing anxiety and stress. I consumed this strain in BHO form.

Vincredible, the smell and taste isby far one of the most potent ive come across. but it doesnt seem 100% natural. maybe its a technique used in the final flushing stages. its got a strong vanilla and spearamint aroma to it. i pray its not a chemical thing. but it is very smooth velvetty enjoyable smoke. the root beer after taste lasts forever. its a lighter indica not the heaviest hitter but its does pack a punch fo sho! a good one to have around to impress the homies or if u gotta sweet tooth.

VThe Strain Has A Very Strong Scent Of Vanilla / Cola Cola. The Root Beer After Taste Shows Up After The First Couple Hits. The High On This Strain Is A Very Strong Body High. I Smoked 3 Bowls Before I Left To Go Home &amp; I Could Really Feel The High More When I Got Up And Walked Around, I Recommend This As A Daytime Strain, I Smoked This Last Night &amp; I KO&#39;d Fast When I Got Home, Also Gives You A Good Sleep! Would Recommend To Anybody Who Needs A Good Night&#39;s Sleep Or Anybody Who Wants To Feel Extra Energized!
