VPurple Tangie gives me a quick head high that starts out as a buzz and melts into a warm hugging feeling across my forehead. Too much gives me a headache, though. Otherwise, I feel happy and relaxed.

Vbest sativa I&#39;ve had in over a month. the smell was super passionfruity and the buds were purple inside and out. very functional strain when smoking smaller amount, but over a gram at once and this strain leaves me feeling bent.

VThis strain knocked me om my butt! I was expecting an uplifting and racy Sativa high, but for me it was more like a heavy hitting Indica....It looks so pretty with the purple colors and sparkly buds and a pleasant earthy orange citrus spice kinda flavor...I experienced an intense high and blurred vision, euphoria was soon given way to sleepiness. I took a nap and woke up with a neck headache. Not sure if this will be a strain I&#39;m able to tolerate. Will smoke again and write another review if I have a different experience.

VI don&#39;t have anything negative to say about this strain. The taste and smell are a combo of sweet citrus and funky skunk (which happens to be my ideal terp profile) and the cerebral buzz keeps me going for hours! \u000aThe buds are a beautiful green with purple tips and orange hairs! Looking good enough to eat, but I think I&#39;ll just smoke it all instead &#128525;

VThe buds are nice and chunky. I noticed a lot orange hairs. When you smell the bud it almost smells like a orchid. When you break the bud down, it has a great pine scent which gives the user a preview of what is to come. Very deceiving. I took 3 tokes and began to feel the effects.  Relieved a headache I had, increased my appetite and gave me the motivation to write this review.

VOne of the most flavorful strains I&#39;ve come across. I picked up some Orange Tangie from Purple Star MD in San Francisco at the management&#39;s insistence, and I can&#39;t stop raving about it.\u000a\u000aThe buds smell have an overpowering tangerine aroma with subtle hints of grape. The smoke is sweet and citrusy, with plenty of tangerine flavor that gives way to red fruit on the exhale. This strain gave a balanced high reflective of its hybrid genetics. \u000a\u000aPurple Tangie is a must-have for any consumer interested in flavorful cannabis or unusual cannabis terpenes, as the tangerine aroma is quite unusual and very pleasing. \u000a\u000aPair Purple Tangie with a Chardonnay and smoked salmon croquettes.

VI absolutely hate this strain, I&#39;ve given it multiple chance&#39;s to change my opinion on it because  it has great reviews, but I&#39;ve found I have to smoke so much to feel anything and the high doesn&#39;t last long.
