VReally enjoyed this strain but I&#39;m more of a fan of hard hitting, potent strains. This is not that. Regardless, it is a great relaxer and stress reliever. Not sure about pain. It provides a euphoric head high, that after some time turns to a slight body buzz before tapering off. Definitely one of the most unique looking and smelling strains I&#39;ve ever had. I think this particular batch had been sitting around, possibly not stored that well. I recommend this for stress, anxiety relief, and relaxation coupled with a slight sativa like head high.

VDutch Treat is not a heavy hitter for a veteran smoker IMO, however, that does not knock it down a peg in terms of rating. The high always starts off with a sativa like head rush in and behind the eyes, and transfers (you can literally feel it)  to the body with a slight buzz in the head as well. It is mildly strong the two times I&#39;ve used it despite looking gourgeous and trichomey. Would love to try a high THC batch of this. \u000a\u000aLots of medicinal benefits. Increases my appetite (have nausea), relieves stress and is good for relaxing. There is a creative and energetic element to it too. For lower tolerance users, this is a treat. For vets, you might struggle to get the high you want to reach.

VWow! This strain blew me away!! A very strong high that hits the brain initially with an abrupt psychedelic metal shift, very euphoric. Also possesses a comfortably numb body buzz. Strong smelling flowers, with what others have described as a unique eucalyptus scent that also called to mind sandalwood and menthol, all of which come through in the delicious flavor against a sweet, earthy, piney backdrop. \u000aVery attractive vibrant green nugs, glistening in tiny trichomes that make the flower appear almost crystalline and wet. Extremely sticky on the break up. \u000aThis is a late afternoon - evening smoke due to the strong indica finish, and not a strain I&#39;d recommend for beginners because of the suddenness and strength of the high, but for connoisseurs this is top shelf stuff.   \u000aI should mention that this was the first outdoor flower I&#39;m aware of smoking. I&#39;ve avoided sun grown in the past believing that it was an inferior product, but at least this grower (Liontree, out of southern Oregon) has got it down right (their Sour D is equally outstanding, and I&#39;ve got my sights set on their Dutch Herer next)! I would purchase any of their flowers in the future, again and again - simply outstanding product, meeting or surpassing in quality  any top shelf indoor I&#39;ve tried. \u000aAcquired from Oregon&#39;s Finest HQ @ a whopping 28.8% THC. \u000aHighly, highly recommended.

VDefinitely one of the most flavorful strains I&#39;ve come across, with earthy plant taste from the inhale lingering after the exhale. The nugs are smallish, covered in reddish hairs, and a dark green underneath; Definitely Indica-heavy. Great for relieving stress, and just mellowing out watching TV or doing some light-intensity activity. Might be too lazy for super active stuff. The buzz is short-lived, and I couldn&#39;t imagine it ever really overwhelming you with intensity, which could leave some heavy smokers looking for more. Overall, an awesome strain most notable for the awesome flavor and smooth smoke.

VI got this as part of a promo event that my shop was doing with Raven Grass. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m an big Indica guy, and usually late night to get to sleep. With that said - this strain was awesome for day time hanging out. This is the most uplifting, happy and clean high I&#39;ve had. I was chatty but not over the top Chatty Cathy. No munchies at all. No anti-social or lazy/procrastination tendencies.\u000a\u000aI consumed this by both combustion and vaporizer. My preference was the vape. Which is typically the case. However, the nice clean non-Stoney high really complimented the uplifting effects of this strain/grow.

VThis heavy cerebral high is perfect for a night time adventure or a long hibernation in a comfortable bed. With earthy, piney, and lemony tones, the exhales comes off very sweet, not a bit of smokeyness, and left my mouth watering and wanting more. Paired with LA Confidential, I was out like a light in under an hour and the body and mind high, though quite strong, made my body feel pleasantly lazy and put me in the perfect mood for a session of music and headphones. This is the best tasting strain I&#39;ve ever had, it did quite literally make my mouth water. Highly recommend this to new and old stoners alike.

VMy third time trying Dutch Treat, and, nope, do not like it. It is relaxing, but let&#39;s be real here, it&#39;s marijuana, of course it&#39;s relaxing. It&#39;s a very unusual high... I&#39;ve noticed it every time I buy this stuff, it doesn&#39;t smoke like other strains. I don&#39;t personally feel much of a body effect. I do get fatigued, but it doesn&#39;t do much for pain. The headspace could be great for some people, but it doesn&#39;t sit well with me. It tends to give me heart palpitations and a knotty stomach. For someone without anxiety, that&#39;s probably nothing more than annoying, and maybe even invigorating. For people who struggle with anxiety on a daily basis, those physical effects mimic anxiety and will actually make you feel anxious/sad/paranoid etc. So yeah. It&#39;s not particularly racy or dizzying, but the heart thumps it gives me just... puts me in a bad headspace. \u000a\u000aMy partner, who has less anxiety than me, also doesn&#39;t like this strain because it makes her talk and talk and talk and drives her crazy. \u000a\u000aSo, I dunno. If you&#39;re looking for a relaxing, couch lock strain, there are much better options than Dutch Treat. You know what I absolutely love? Granddaddy Dutch. The GDP really mellows out the Dutch Treat, making it a really nice indica leaning hybrid.

I found my strain match made in heaven at Moss Crossing dispensary in Eugene Oregon.

VI have had Dutch Treat many times.  I do have a higher tolerance, so if you are looking for that &#39;buzz&#39; from DT, I didn&#39;t see it.  DT is great for anxiety.  Large crowds no longer became a problem with DT.  I was able to mingle comfortably as needed with large groups as well as stay focused on my task at hand.  The taste is some earth and some sweet, however the sweet is hit and miss.  It will allow you to relax and or handle multi-tasking, however, I was struggling when I did not have more than one task at hand while high on DT.  It&#39;s great for work, exercise even.  I found myself doing yoga a lot on DT.  If you are wanting to just &#39;chill&#39; on the couch and watch TV, it may work for a short while, but you may get the need to get up and do something.  No creativity involved in DT, but again, it will let you get a lot done.\u000a\u000aI did have quite a bit of dry mouth with this strain.  I rarely get dry mouth on a normal basis, so to go from literally none to the Sahara Desert was a bit much for me.  As long as I had something to drink at hand, it was perfectly fine.\u000a\u000aMy eyes were much drier on DT than other strains before.  Nothing good old Visine can&#39;t fix.

VThere are two types of dutch treat running around the indica and the sativa dominant. You must find the sativa dominant dutch treat #5 it will blow your world apart. Was the most uplifting, Pain re-leaving, wonderful experience ever and I have been at it for a good while folks. If all the rating on here were from the #5 there is no doubt it would be all 10&#39;s. Nothing can compare except this one strain called The Hog can&#39;t find it around much but its the only thing of the same caliber.

VI&#39;ve bought this strain twice from separate people almost a year apart, and I have to say it&#39;s amazing stuff, has an easygoing vibe in general with a slight energy kick from the Sativa dominance in the strain.\u000aWhile it is a Sativa, it almost sort of feels like an Indica with its strange ability to wake you up and make you able to do things, while depriving you of any motivation to do them almost completely. Fantastic for games or TV at the end of a long day.\u000aOnly drawback is the relatively short length of high for the amount you smoke, and that it doesn&#39;t burn as well as most of the other bud i&#39;ve smoked. I really want to give it an 8.5, but to be honest I&#39;d probably round down rather than up on this one just because of those two things, but still gets a very solid 8/10 from yours truly.

VThis strain is pretty popular. It&#39;s sold in almost every shop. This strain can go both ways. Some growers have indica leaning and some have sativa leaning Dutch Treat. And sometimes even so something will say indica leaning, your body might be more susceptible to the sativa side of the strain. So this strain is a confusing one. It&#39;s typically not labelled as a 50/50 hybrid but that seems to be the experience I usually have with it. Overall, I&#39;ve always enjoyed this strain no matter who or where it was produced from. :-)

VThe two stars are all about appearances and smell. These flowers are extremely dense and covered in kief. Very fruity and almost eucalyptus-like smell. Crystals are glistening and perfectly cured. The smoke is smooth and tasty, but delivers a somewhat disappointing high. Its a probably a good smoke for beginners or those that want to get their feet wet, but for experiences smokers, the effects are dull. Not happy, not sad, not couch-locked or energetic...just blah.

The smell is pretty strong with the aroma of pine with a small hint of berries and it taste exactly how it smells. When inhaled the smoke expands pretty well and will have even the most experienced smokers coughing, I felt a pretty quick and intense head high, definitely feel the effects of the sativa but not to the point where my mind was racing but kept me engaged with long lasting effects. overall this was a very good top shelf satica strain that I definitely will try again and again.

VIf you are an insomnia sufferer, SSS&#39;s Lavender is the strain you are looking for. The nugs are well-cured, on the dense side, with a light purple hue all over. It has a nice citrus scent with flowery overtones, lending it a sweet lavender scent. \u000a\u000aBut you aren&#39;t reading this for what the cannabis looked like, are you?\u000a\u000aThe heads over at SSS should rename this strain &quot;Lavender Lullaby&quot;. I&#39;d been unable to sleep for days when I came into the Shop and picked it up. After a few tokes from Batman, my trusty bong, I felt the silvery arms of Lavender float me away on a fresh breeze. The aches in my skull faded, and the tension in my shoulders ceased. I wasn&#39;t sleepy, but extremely relaxed, like my soul had just had a bubble bath. When it was time for bed, I closed my eyes as I hit the pillow and floated off to dreamland, where I swear to god, I dreamt I was flying on a dragon.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m not promising you that if you smoke Sunset Super Shop&#39;s Lavender you&#39;ll be able to dream about flying dragons through clouds made of indigo diamonds, glittering in the cosmic rays, plunging through waterfalls in a far-off-landscape...but I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t happen, either.

VVery interesting strain that I really liked. It was my first time doing Dutch Treat but it seemed to adapt to the mood/situation that you were in.  I could imagine if you happen to be in a depressed or anxious mood it might bring that out, but that is just a guess.  I went with a friend to see X-men and we were being silly on the way to the theater, but when when the movie started we were able to relax and enjoy the movie w/o feeling super stoned.  Did a little more before we had dinner after and I was cracking up so hard I had to stand up from my chair so that I did not fall out of it.  If you want to go on a little adventure through the city/town I would recommend it.

The smell is pretty strong with the aroma of pine with a small hint of berries and it taste exactly how it smells. When inhaled the smoke expands pretty well and will have even the most experienced smokers coughing, I felt a pretty quick and intense head high, definitely feel the effects of the sativa but not to the point where my mind was racing but kept me engaged with long lasting effects. overall this was a very good top shelf satica strain that I definitely will try again and again.

VI had the Treat of vaping this strain out of a cartridge. The terpene profile was pretty spot-on with the fruity/pine notes (and glycol-free, so no chemical tastes or residue on the roof of my mouth). Smoke was phenomenal with nice large plooms and I definitely felt medicated. \u000aDutch Treat feels like a nice versatile strain. It is certainly uplifting; for example, common house-sounds like the refrigerator and dishwasher running almost sound a half-step higher in pitch as it\u2019s kicking in. I feel relaxed and there\u2019s no anxiety/paranoia as far as negative side effects (which is not totally uncommon unless I\u2019m smoking indica-dominant). It could totally be used as a social strain, such as in the aforementioned Amsterdam coffee shops. Would certainly smoke again and I\u2019m curious to see what the buds smell like!

VOne of my absolute favorite strains. The biggest benefit I get from it is the uplift in mood. There&#39;s a nice balance between that and the relaxing effects, so it doesn&#39;t stop me from wanting to get out and do things and have fun. Could be great for those prone to depressive bouts.

VI had the Treat of vaping this strain out of a cartridge. The terpene profile was pretty spot-on with the fruity/pine notes (and glycol-free, so no chemical tastes or residue on the roof of my mouth). Smoke was phenomenal with nice large plooms and I definitely felt medicated. \u000aDutch Treat feels like a nice versatile strain. It is certainly uplifting; for example, common house-sounds like the refrigerator and dishwasher running almost sound a half-step higher in pitch as it\u2019s kicking in. I feel relaxed and there\u2019s no anxiety/paranoia as far as negative side effects (which is not totally uncommon unless I\u2019m smoking indica-dominant). It could totally be used as a social strain, such as in the aforementioned Amsterdam coffee shops. Would certainly smoke again and I\u2019m curious to see what the buds smell like!

VDense dark green buds with a small amount of orange  hairs and trichomes, smells and smokes better than it looks. The smell is pretty strong with the aroma of pine with a small hint of berries and it taste exactly how it smells. When inhaled the smoke expands pretty well and will have even the most experienced smokers coughing, I felt a pretty quick and intense head high, definitely feel the effects of the sativa but not to the point where my mind was racing but kept me engaged with long lasting effects. overall this was a very good top shelf satica strain that I definitely will try again and again.

VIf you are an insomnia sufferer, SSS&#39;s Lavender is the strain you are looking for. The nugs are well-cured, on the dense side, with a light purple hue all over. It has a nice citrus scent with flowery overtones, lending it a sweet lavender scent. \u000a\u000aBut you aren&#39;t reading this for what the cannabis looked like, are you?\u000a\u000aThe heads over at SSS should rename this strain &quot;Lavender Lullaby&quot;. I&#39;d been unable to sleep for days when I came into the Shop and picked it up. After a few tokes from Batman, my trusty bong, I felt the silvery arms of Lavender float me away on a fresh breeze. The aches in my skull faded, and the tension in my shoulders ceased. I wasn&#39;t sleepy, but extremely relaxed, like my soul had just had a bubble bath. When it was time for bed, I closed my eyes as I hit the pillow and floated off to dreamland, where I swear to god, I dreamt I was flying on a dragon.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m not promising you that if you smoke Sunset Super Shop&#39;s Lavender you&#39;ll be able to dream about flying dragons through clouds made of indigo diamonds, glittering in the cosmic rays, plunging through waterfalls in a far-off-landscape...but I&#39;m not saying it won&#39;t happen, either.

I could imagine if you happen to be in a depressed or anxious mood it might bring that out, but that is just a guess.  I went with a friend to see X-men and we were being silly on the way to the theater, but when when the movie started we were able to relax and enjoy the movie w/o feeling super stoned.  Did a little more before we had dinner after and I was cracking up so hard I had to stand up from my chair so that I did not fall out of it.  If you want to go on a little adventure through the city/town I would recommend it.

VI have seen this strain around but hadn&#39;t tried it until a few minutes ago. This is going into heavy rotation. It&#39;s very euphoric and uplifting and feels pretty potent. I don&#39;t know the ratio of indica to sativa but it feels PERFECT.

VI recently gave a review on Dutch Treat based on Vaping it &amp; I did enjoy every bit of it, However I also tried smoking it &amp; found that 3 tokes REALLY did me in good.\u000aI had to shut everything down &amp; go str8 to bed &amp; live it out &amp; when I woke up the next day I was in a cloud that was a bit too heavy for me personally. I didn&#39;t expect a slow start then suddenly I started getting VERY High almost to a point of being stoned.\u000aI am a light weight user for health issues &amp; although as it taper off to a warm heavy sedative like feel i wasn&#39;t happy over all due to how heavy it was for me. I know there are folks out there that like these effects &amp; I Encourage those folks who haven&#39;t tried it yet to do so. \u000aI would purchase this one again but staying clear of smoking it what a difference between vaping &amp; smoking. LOL If I had trouble before I started, I sure wont have them when done LOL

Likewise it&#39;s chill without being sedating. \u000a\u000aOnly reason I don&#39;t smoke this all the time is I&#39;m afraid of running out!

VDutch Treat, great highly euphoric strain.\u000a\u000aI got this flower from Sky High Organics in Oregon, testing at %25.4. The nugs are light green and very dense, with a thick coat of trichomes.\u000a\u000aSmells like sweet pine, not very sharp at all.\u000a\u000aAbout the most euphoric high I could imagine. It starts with a rush of happiness and creative energy and then slowly floats you down into a relaxing sedation. Though I wouldn&#39;t say its going to totally put you out, its more likely to just leave you happily relaxed.

VDutch Treat is one of my favorites. just feels right to me. You can taste and feel some kind of similar Jack Herer  genetics in it, taste is  kinda  mild menthol minty eucalyptus . Hybrid effects offer relaxation but not couch locky., for afternoon (or evening.)  Feels to me a bit similar to Blue Dream but more relaxing.Nice mental balance with body relax. Come down feels mild.\u000a DT is now hard to find in California .I wish it was more readily available. If you like Jack Herer, try Dutch Treat for the evening.

VWovenWeb says &quot;You can literally feel it&quot; referring to the transfer of high from head to body, and i couldnt agree more. Euphoric throughout. Such a wonderful experience. its exactly what i look for in my cannabis when im seeking something for all-around benefits that i can use pretty much any time of day. And like HerbalMagician here, I aquired my exquisite cut grown by Liontree out of southern oregon. I too had avoided outdoor (also believing it to be inferior), and truth be told? I wasnt aware it was an outdoor batch until after i had already tried it and fell in love. well, i went back for more! and recently tried a couple others from liontree. Their Chemdawg&#215;Wedding Cake strain is a beauty as well. Anyways, Dutch Treat is a strain id recommend to just about anyone. If you get the chance- take it! =)

VOne of my all time favourites. Anytime in Amsterdam I always go for the Dutch treat, and when I can find it on the east coast I grab all I can. The taste is amazing...notes of citrus and in a vape you&#39;ll cough immediately and feel the onset fairly quickly. Puts you in a good mood too!  Usually high thc content, and a winner for stress and anxiety. If the buds are dense and covered in trichromes, you&#39;ve got the real deal.

VNew found favorite. The initial draw (water perc) is so smooth, do not, I repeat do not let it fool you. The exhale starts off normal then an intense black peppery burn sets in, have a beverage handy, bubbly is preferred in my case. Once you can breathe normal again rinse and repeat to your preference. I feel this strain is a bit lighter than others and step up the intake by 30-50% of my normal quantity in an effort to reach the desired high. If you happen to be in a not yet legalized locale consider this a warning, this strain has as serious aroma that lingers and hangs on everything. We&#39;re talking you can smell it in a windstorm. \u000a\u000aIn my case, about 10-15 minutes passed before I really noticed much. While cleared headed and happy, thoughts seem to come and go. If you are in the company of others you may find this strain a little chatty but not bad. As the high proceeds relaxation sets in and stress is just gone, you&#39;re not tired but you could certainly go to sleep readily if wanted.\u000a\u000aIf using flower, a grinder should be on hand. The buds are so sticky you&#39;ll lose the best part to your fingers pulling it apart, the buds are to dense to burn well otherwise.\u000a\u000aAs a side note, a 50/50 mixed bowl with Dutch Treat and Gorilla Glue #5 is in my opinion one of the most fantastic head and body highs around. Grab snacks and put them in arms reach, you&#39;ll be hungry but you will not want to move.

This is a strain that started out in Amsterdam coffee shops, and it&#39;s still one of the most widely grown strains that I know of among amateur and enthusiast growers.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aThis Dutch Treat came to me as a processor&#39;s sample, and so it doesn&#39;t have quite the information that a retail-sales batch would have.  I was able to see lab testing reports however - which are immensely more complete and complex than you would think - and the numbers add up.  This is legitimately some 29% TTL THC content pot.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aFrankly, I did not treat this delicious flower with the respect it really deserved.  I smoked this as some &#39;go to bed&#39; medicine at the end of a long day on my feet, doing sales consultancy for the first time in 6 years.  Because I was working with weed (as a budtender), I was getting stoned all day.  I vaped hash, I smoked joints, I smoked bowls, I hit an MFLB a few times for flavor tasting, and along with it all I drank about a gallon of coffee. \u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000a\u000aThe herb had a slightly bitter, slightly chemical/diesel smell - the inside of the bag has the faintest trace of it under a fresh herb smell.  The taste was very earthy, slightly herby but not particularly strong.  The smoke itself was much more mellow than I expected based on appearance, smell, texture, strain and the density of smoke.  \u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aAs for effect, I was asleep in moments I woke up feeling incredibly rested.

VLately the quality of Dutch Treat flower (Seattle) has been the best I&#39;ve ever seen. It isn&#39;t just one place or anything it involves several different growers and shops but lately the Dutch Treat consistently looks absolutely amazing, just complete fire &#128293;. I picked up an eighth from Skyhigh Gardens and while it test at only about 19% THC it looked absolutely beautiful it was a nice dense emerald green perfectly manicured and cured with fire orange hairs and that very pineapple, sweet, citrus thing going on that makes Dutch Treat such an original. The high starts out upbeat with a head rush that hits as soon as you exhale, from there it gets quite euphoric with a heavy Indica body high that is nice and relaxing but shouldn&#39;t leave you stuck on the couch . If you&#39;re looking for a strain get you up and going, kinda kickstart your day this probably ain&#39;t it but, if you&#39;re looking for really flavorful, perfectly cured, with a pretty heavy Indica high that has just enough Sativa genetics to make things fun. With this strain being so popular in Seattle I&#39;ve run into some pretty boring, tasteless versions of this strain but lately Dutch Treat season is open!

VDutch Treat by AuricAG!\u000a\u000aFantastic! Farms matter! AuricAG knocks it out of the park again with this strain. I&#39;ve had this strain by a few other farms in the past, but the experience was not the same. They didn&#39;t live up to AuricAG&#39;s Dutch Treat.\u000a\u000aDT is a classic &amp; popular strain. I face-palm at the fact that I didn&#39;t try this when I was in Holland years ago. There&#39;s much to be said about strains that have some extra cannabinoids in them. But this one! CBD, CBG, CBN, &amp; CBC! A very well balanced high/stone. You&#39;ll get super baked, and curtail pain issues thanks to those extra cannabinoids, but still be functional. If you see this strain by one of your favorite farms, just\u000agrab it, \u000asmoke it, \u000adab it, \u000atoke it. \u000a\u000aHappy smorkin&#39;!\u270c&#127995;

VI have to agree with a lot of reviewers of this strain.  The effects match the profile pretty much spot on.  Give it a few minutes, but 2-3 good pulls and you should be set.  Super heady high, followed by super chill thoughts.  Great body hum.  Super uplifting and overall sense of well-being.  SUPER dense buds. \u000aSUPER creamy smoke and SUPER smooth.  Typically not high in THC, mine is 18.5%.  And I&#39;m a Sativa guy...Always.  This hybrid is Indica dominant with around 20% Sativa.  Do NOT let that fool you.  This is a superb flower when obtained from the right grower.

VThere&#39;s nothing special I can say about Dutch Treat. It got me high, but it made me extremely anxious. The high isn&#39;t anything special, it didn&#39;t make me euphoric or happy. This isn&#39;t a bad weed, it just didn&#39;t work with my already high stress and anxious personality. So if you&#39;re like me I would suggest avoiding this strain.

VI&#39;m an old duffer with a ton of anxiety and DT is extraordinary at alleviating those lurking panic attacks and depression.  I&#39;ve tried so many strains that always had a side kick of anxiety, sometimes ever so slightly.  DT has been an answered prayer for me.

VFweedom Collective has this one down pat! Accept no imitations! Dank, sticky buds with incredible trichomes. This is the most potent strain I have ever smoked. It&#39;s the most-expensive strain at Fweedom Collective, but worth every cent because of the superior way it&#39;s been grown and cured! It borders on psychedelic! Wow!

VAn Excellent Choice for Quality and specifially for Pain relief. I have Patellal Femural syndrome. The Knee Pain was so bad when I first got it I lost 2 different jobs 2 different times due to knee pain from this medical problem. I have been a Drummer for 25 years and Joint problems are common. Its like putting tiny hot gravel inside my kneecap. The L.a. woman relieved my pain for almost 90 minutes a setting. Also It is energetic without feeling paranoid. It CAN be overpowering to a novice though so newbs beware. L.A. Woman....MR MOJO RISING Oh yeah, its Dense and burns forver. Makes Godzilla movies the best!

VJust tried for the first time. Really heavy face and head high, not much body at all. Didn&#39;t like the taste during vaporizing but the smell of the bud is great, a lot of purple and smells sweet, but doesn&#39;t taste as good as it smells. No feeling of paranoia or anxiety. Sat down at my MAC and was able to write and post some blog articles without any issues, able to focus. Listened to music while blogging and was really feeling the music, uplifted my mood immediately. Overall, not a bad Indica hybrid, just not a super fan. With so many options I won&#39;t get this one again.

VLet me pre-face by saying I&#39;ve only had my card for 1.5 months. Still a newbie. Not a smoker prior to. Have tried a few high THC (16-18%) strains, but this one at 10% THC hit harder than any I&#39;ve tried yet. 2 puffs is my max and I&#39;m out. Everyday is different with it though. Some days it&#39;s mellow with a good body high and pain relief. The next day it&#39;s more cerebral with little to no pain relief. Last night I got a very woozy head and waves of anxiety and nausea that lasted about an hour. No fun. That experience and the fact that it smells like a pasture and tastes like hay keeps me from giving it 5 stars. But overall, it&#39;s definitely in my top 5.

VI love indicas, but this is a little underwhelming in the head-high department, even for me. However, I included the ratios of THC-D9 to THCa and CBD. This is clearly a strain meant for more medicinal uses, and I can totally see that. It&#39;s relaxing, after a shift on the job it eases muh tired muscles like a charm. It also improves my mood in a pretty subtle way, but hey, it&#39;s still makes shit awesome!\u000aSo if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for with almost no head high to speak up, this is right up your alley. If you&#39;re new to smoking and want something comparable to a couple good beers after work, check this strain out.

VI tried this strain several weeks ago and would rate it .. &quot;OK&quot;. Last week I qualified for a free gift at my dispensary and I chose a Dutch Treat pre-roll. (What the hell .. it was free).\u000a\u000aI had just finished installing a washer, gas dryer, and gas range. The next morning my back was killing me (I&#39;m 60). I sparked the  DT pre-roll and within 30 min. I was cleaning up the mess I left, and back to my sarcastic self. I would rate the pre-roll .. &quot;EXCELLENT&quot;!\u000a\u000aDifferent suppliers? Different clones? Different grows? As an &quot;old guy&quot; hobby grower, I would say if all DT was like that pre-roll, it&#39;s a keeper!

VI have to agree with a lot of reviewers of this strain.  The effects match the profile pretty much spot on.  Give it a few minutes, but 2-3 good pulls and you should be set.  Super heady high, followed by super chill thoughts.  Great body hum.  Super uplifting and overall sense of well-being.  SUPER dense buds. \u000aSUPER creamy smoke and SUPER smooth.  Typically not high in THC, mine is 18.5%.  And I&#39;m a Sativa guy...Always.  This hybrid is Indica dominant with around 20% Sativa.  Do NOT let that fool you.  This is a superb flower when obtained from the right grower.

VDutch Treat is one of my favorites. just feels right to me. You can taste and feel some kind of similar Jack Herer  genetics in it, taste is  kinda  mild menthol minty eucalyptus . Hybrid effects offer relaxation but not couch locky., for afternoon (or evening.)  Feels to me a bit similar to Blue Dream but more relaxing.Nice mental balance with body relax. Come down feels mild.\u000a DT is now hard to find in California .I wish it was more readily available. If you like Jack Herer, try Dutch Treat for the evening.

Vfirst toke packs a surprising punch. it comes on pretty strong and quick. it seems to speed up your mind while giving you some decent levels of relaxation as well as maybe some pain relief. (cured a headache I had for over 8hrs in about 10 minutes) it&#39;s nice and flavorful, a little piney but not harsh at all when smoked out a home made water pipe. couldn&#39;t pass up the deal i got on it at Have a Heart in Seattle&#39;s Belltown either. for primarily after work smokers, this is a great choice when you have stuff to do after work. the relaxed feeling doesnt glue you to the sofa, I still had plenty of energy to split some wood and tinker on a few things. I didn&#39;t give it a 5 star because it made me slightly anxious. I would purchase it again.

VDutch Treat is a very popular strain in the Pacific NW. It is esp. hard to find in a dab concentrate of the strain but ever once you get lucky.  The high is a perfect, the Savia dominate feel dominates w/o any anxiety. You will awake/focused, \u201ccoach locked\u201d and definitely stoned from this powerhouse. Dab r commended or cartridge (although I have never found one).

VDutch Treat by AuricAG!\u000a\u000aFantastic! Farms matter! AuricAG knocks it out of the park again with this strain. I&#39;ve had this strain by a few other farms in the past, but the experience was not the same. They didn&#39;t live up to AuricAG&#39;s Dutch Treat.\u000a\u000aDT is a classic &amp; popular strain. I face-palm at the fact that I didn&#39;t try this when I was in Holland years ago. There&#39;s much to be said about strains that have some extra cannabinoids in them. But this one! CBD, CBG, CBN, &amp; CBC! A very well balanced high/stone. You&#39;ll get super baked, and curtail pain issues thanks to those extra cannabinoids, but still be functional. If you see this strain by one of your favorite farms, just\u000agrab it, \u000asmoke it, \u000adab it, \u000atoke it. \u000a\u000aHappy smorkin&#39;!\u270c&#127995;

VDutch Treat, great highly euphoric strain.\u000a\u000aI got this flower from Sky High Organics in Oregon, testing at %25.4. The nugs are light green and very dense, with a thick coat of trichomes.\u000a\u000aSmells like sweet pine, not very sharp at all.\u000a\u000aAbout the most euphoric high I could imagine. It starts with a rush of happiness and creative energy and then slowly floats you down into a relaxing sedation. Though I wouldn&#39;t say its going to totally put you out, its more likely to just leave you happily relaxed.

VI recently gave a review on Dutch Treat based on Vaping it &amp; I did enjoy every bit of it, However I also tried smoking it &amp; found that 3 tokes REALLY did me in good.\u000aI had to shut everything down &amp; go str8 to bed &amp; live it out &amp; when I woke up the next day I was in a cloud that was a bit too heavy for me personally. I didn&#39;t expect a slow start then suddenly I started getting VERY High almost to a point of being stoned.\u000aI am a light weight user for health issues &amp; although as it taper off to a warm heavy sedative like feel i wasn&#39;t happy over all due to how heavy it was for me. I know there are folks out there that like these effects &amp; I Encourage those folks who haven&#39;t tried it yet to do so. \u000aI would purchase this one again but staying clear of smoking it what a difference between vaping &amp; smoking. LOL If I had trouble before I started, I sure wont have them when done LOL

VLately the quality of Dutch Treat flower (Seattle) has been the best I&#39;ve ever seen. It isn&#39;t just one place or anything it involves several different growers and shops but lately the Dutch Treat consistently looks absolutely amazing, just complete fire &#128293;. I picked up an eighth from Skyhigh Gardens and while it test at only about 19% THC it looked absolutely beautiful it was a nice dense emerald green perfectly manicured and cured with fire orange hairs and that very pineapple, sweet, citrus thing going on that makes Dutch Treat such an original. The high starts out upbeat with a head rush that hits as soon as you exhale, from there it gets quite euphoric with a heavy Indica body high that is nice and relaxing but shouldn&#39;t leave you stuck on the couch . If you&#39;re looking for a strain get you up and going, kinda kickstart your day this probably ain&#39;t it but, if you&#39;re looking for really flavorful, perfectly cured, with a pretty heavy Indica high that has just enough Sativa genetics to make things fun. With this strain being so popular in Seattle I&#39;ve run into some pretty boring, tasteless versions of this strain but lately Dutch Treat season is open!

VOne of my all time favourites. Anytime in Amsterdam I always go for the Dutch treat, and when I can find it on the east coast I grab all I can. The taste is amazing...notes of citrus and in a vape you&#39;ll cough immediately and feel the onset fairly quickly. Puts you in a good mood too!  Usually high thc content, and a winner for stress and anxiety. If the buds are dense and covered in trichromes, you&#39;ve got the real deal.

VWovenWeb says &quot;You can literally feel it&quot; referring to the transfer of high from head to body, and i couldnt agree more. Euphoric throughout. Such a wonderful experience. its exactly what i look for in my cannabis when im seeking something for all-around benefits that i can use pretty much any time of day. And like HerbalMagician here, I aquired my exquisite cut grown by Liontree out of southern oregon. I too had avoided outdoor (also believing it to be inferior), and truth be told? I wasnt aware it was an outdoor batch until after i had already tried it and fell in love. well, i went back for more! and recently tried a couple others from liontree. Their Chemdawg&#215;Wedding Cake strain is a beauty as well. Anyways, Dutch Treat is a strain id recommend to just about anyone. If you get the chance- take it! =)

VHefty \u201cchristmas tree material\u201d nugs rearing gorgeous  trichomes with thick amber and tangerine hairs.  Earthy, piney lemon hints in smell that give off only a piece of its sweetness and brightness. Calm and collecting, it is not \u201cstraight to the dome\u201d, but it is \u201cmelts into you before you melt\u201d kind of strain. The melting is a euphoric head high, that can make any mundane task or thing you are doing or want to do, feel exciting, focusable, while not making you want to be hyper or needing to be  far from the couch. One hit or two and your senses are permeated with heightened sight, hearing and touch. Also cerebral in nature, Dutch Treat... you may have a deep conversation on this one or a simple  giggling one depending on who is in your company. This strain is a strain I smoked before I sat down and did some writing  when writing a paper for class. \u000aDefinitely would recommend this for stress relief, pain relief, relaxing, people who need help being social,talkative, and creative, and people who need help not being impulsive.

VI have to laugh at previous reviews that complain of Dutch Treat lacking in potency, for it was the extremely strong potency that led me to purchase this strain a second time. At 31.46% THC, this is the strongest strain i have tried thus far. I began seeking out stronger strains after switching from smoke to a Pax 2 vaper, which I find can require hitting 4-6 times to reach the desired effects with typical potency strains of 20-25% THC. This Dutch Treat gets you where you are trying to go in two tokes from a vaporizer, truly qualifying it as a &quot;one hit wonder&quot; strain. The flavor is lemony/pinesol-esque, which is not my favorite but at least is less chemically tasting than some of the diesels I&#39;ve tried. The effect is body and head high but with surprising clarity, allowing one to engage in constructive dialogue with others not under the influence as well as accomplishing tasks such as reading and term paper writing to house cleaning. Head high subsides after about 30 minutes to leave me with a more subtle buzz and body high that lingers for about 2 hours. My takeaway: Don&#39;t discredit Dutch Treat (or any strain, for that matter), for low potency. Because once in a while, a grower will manage to hit the strain out of the park. This is good for daytime/evening alert high. I would not consume later in the evening because it does keep the mind active which can interfere with sleep.

VI would say this has to be the most common weed / cannabis (whatever) sold on the black market. It took a while for my high to kick in. I would use this as my last resort.The taste is earthy, and harsh. Smoking it is a big dense cloud. It is sticky to the touch too.

VNew found favorite. The initial draw (water perc) is so smooth, do not, I repeat do not let it fool you. The exhale starts off normal then an intense black peppery burn sets in, have a beverage handy, bubbly is preferred in my case. Once you can breathe normal again rinse and repeat to your preference. I feel this strain is a bit lighter than others and step up the intake by 30-50% of my normal quantity in an effort to reach the desired high. If you happen to be in a not yet legalized locale consider this a warning, this strain has as serious aroma that lingers and hangs on everything. We&#39;re talking you can smell it in a windstorm. \u000a\u000aIn my case, about 10-15 minutes passed before I really noticed much. While cleared headed and happy, thoughts seem to come and go. If you are in the company of others you may find this strain a little chatty but not bad. As the high proceeds relaxation sets in and stress is just gone, you&#39;re not tired but you could certainly go to sleep readily if wanted.\u000a\u000aIf using flower, a grinder should be on hand. The buds are so sticky you&#39;ll lose the best part to your fingers pulling it apart, the buds are to dense to burn well otherwise.\u000a\u000aAs a side note, a 50/50 mixed bowl with Dutch Treat and Gorilla Glue #5 is in my opinion one of the most fantastic head and body highs around. Grab snacks and put them in arms reach, you&#39;ll be hungry but you will not want to move.

This is a strain that started out in Amsterdam coffee shops, and it&#39;s still one of the most widely grown strains that I know of among amateur and enthusiast growers.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aThis Dutch Treat came to me as a processor&#39;s sample, and so it doesn&#39;t have quite the information that a retail-sales batch would have.  I was able to see lab testing reports however - which are immensely more complete and complex than you would think - and the numbers add up.  This is legitimately some 29% TTL THC content pot.\u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aFrankly, I did not treat this delicious flower with the respect it really deserved.  I smoked this as some &#39;go to bed&#39; medicine at the end of a long day on my feet, doing sales consultancy for the first time in 6 years.  Because I was working with weed (as a budtender), I was getting stoned all day.  I vaped hash, I smoked joints, I smoked bowls, I hit an MFLB a few times for flavor tasting, and along with it all I drank about a gallon of coffee. \u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000a\u000aThe herb had a slightly bitter, slightly chemical/diesel smell - the inside of the bag has the faintest trace of it under a fresh herb smell.  The taste was very earthy, slightly herby but not particularly strong.  The smoke itself was much more mellow than I expected based on appearance, smell, texture, strain and the density of smoke.  \u000a\u000a--\u000a\u000aAs for effect, I was asleep in moments I woke up feeling incredibly rested. I call that some potent medicine.\u000a\u000aRead more reviews and see pictures at my blog AgingEnt.com

VI really like this strain. It&#39;s excellent for my brain pain (daily, all the time, 24/7/365 headaches). It doesn&#39;t get me super duper high unless I really hit it, but it can sneak up on you if you&#39;re not careful. I can still function and enjoy my afternoon and evening and get quite a bit done, which is excellent. Gives me a nice body high while helping me to forget my head, which is exactly what I want. Helps me to feel relaxed and mellow, but not so mellow I just want to sit on the couch and watch re-runs of Happy Days all night. I can also write and not look at it the next day and say &quot;What was I smoking...oh yeah!&quot;\u000a\u000aIt also does NOT give me the munchies, which is a super duper bonus for me as a personal trainer. Totally NOT cool when your trainer shows up to Bootcamp with an extra ten pounds around her belly and Cheeto crumbs under her nails.

VA true classic! Dutch treat offers my favorite flavor and aroma profiles in one package. She&#39;s almost always very heavy on the pinesol/lemon pledge aromas but the shining glory is a delicious amount of spicy sour herbal funk like the supplement isle of an old school health food store. The high of Dutch treat usually stays fairly brief for me, starting with a fast acting spike in giggles and fun hazy euphoria that will boil down to a calming and sedating stone. I almost always end up taking a nap after a bowl or two making this a weekend relaxation variety for me, but still very enjoyable in the right circumstances.

VI have tried many strain varieties and I&#39;m a regular partaker so my tolerance is a bit higher than a newbie. I feel the Dutch Treat after the first hit and two hits will be enough to be in that fuzzy happy state. Also tried it for an all day increasing headache relief and voila it worked!! The other day I had about 5-6 &quot;go-to&quot; strains sharing my love equally. After inhaling the amazingly strong and refreshing piny flavor of Dutch and feeling its effects, this is now my primary go to strain. Would love to try it in a vapor form! Oh and best of all is it doesn&#39;t make me want to eat my entire fridge of food and not fit into my clothes the next day.

VDutch Treat is to Amsterdam what Exodus Cheese is to London or at least was when I was there a few years back (both places) so things might have changed but in Amsterdam it was what everyone was smoking and it was every where. It&#39;s supposed to be a 80/20 indica/sativa but it seems to lean heavily  on that 20%  it starts you out with an uplifting energetic feeling with a pleasant head high that slowly transitions into a more relaxed body high that is nice and mellow without any problems getting off the couch. I recently picked up some Omega Consentrates nug run crumble that was so sparkly it looked like a butter colored disco ball. The flavor was awesome not alot of earthiness like usual but you could really taste the citrus come through and the high you get from Dutch Treat make it perfect for dabs. Try it you&#39;ll like it nice upbeat then relaxing strain!

Relaxation, pain relief, and all around happiness with the moment you are in. Very smooth smoke and exhale... A little dry but the density of the nugs hold a little moisture  in the center that makes for a nice even burn. Try it you&#39;ll like it!

VI bought this a few weeks ago in Seattle on a recommendation.  I remember it being really good, but I didn&#39;t really have time to relax and enjoy it.  Fast forward to this weekend...my Dutch Treat &quot;somehow&quot; made it&#39;s way with me to Palm Springs for Memorial Day weekend.   I smoked my first bowl at about 9 am (the closest thing I&#39;ve had to a wake and bake in 30 years), and went out to the cabana by the pool.  Th e sativa kept me interested in all the girls walking by in their bikinis, while the indica parts kept me happily in my seat.  Yeah, this is the shit for camping by the pool.  About every three hours, I went off  to smoke another bowl, and renew that terrific buzz.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m so happy this made the trip with me, because it really made the trip a magic one

But I found Dutch Treat to be a much heavier high; very grounding and emotionally and physically stabilizing, but not the energetic kick I was looking for. \u000a\u000aOn the flip side, this didn&#39;t induce any paranoia and left me feeling a little euphoric and creative. My hike was made more enjoyable in that regard. I think this strain would be a good pain reliever and can help with sleep.

The smell is incredible, especially when breaking it up, and it&#39;s sure to be a recognizable one in the future. My guess is that it&#39;s an indica dominant, made me real sleepy and just complacent. Excellent weed.

VA really good head high that hits you quick. It&#39;s a nice strain to smoke after a late shift at work. Last time I smoked it I was tense and stressed and it got rid of it almost instantly. Did have a little depression toward the end and I was restless while trying to sleep. I fo have insomnia and most of the strains I&#39;ve smoked help with that but this one not so much. It wasn&#39;t that it kept me up, just simply didn&#39;t put me out. Awesome strain, would recommend. Li

VFinally getting around to this long time staple strain. I prefer an indica-dom hybrid (and indicas in general over sativas) but thought I&#39;d try a sativa-dominant strain like Dutch Treat. It has a very clean inhale / taste. Very nice fruity smell out of the container. At just 15.x% THC I was surprised to experience a very pleasant combination mind/body coolness with only one small pipe bowl. I will definitely add this strain to my favorites.

VGSC was an extremely dense type of bud. Rock hard and the smell was pine like with hints of mint and menthol. It was extremely harsh as well but the stone was powerful. Got me eating everything in sight, not to mention drinking tons of fluids due to coughing alot. At one point I found myself very happy and content with the buzz as I enjoyed a bike ride on a sunny sunday afternoon. To make sure I wasnt just having a good time in the sun I decided to smoke during the night and once again I was having an uplifting surge of energy to eat then relax and sleep. Great strain for depression and insomnia. Will give you the weed hang overs due to high thc content.

Think I read somewhere that this strain is 80/20 indica dominant...so it would make sense that it would make me tired. I seem to be particularly sensitive to indicas in terms of feeling tired. Puts me right to sleep, and I sleep like a f***ing rock. Which I hate.\u000aBut other than that, I LOVED the way it smoked and tasted. And the flowers smell amazing. The high was really good, very relaxed and happy. But it didn&#39;t last very long because I would fall asleep no matter what.\u000aThat&#39;s just me.

Do not spend your money on this strain if you ARE looking for a good buzz. Dutch Treat will not provide what you&#39;re looking for. I would recommend this stain to somebody with a very light tolerance level or someone who is just beginning to smoke. This strain is definitely not built for your daily smoker.

VPretty strong.  This strain smells similar to chocolope, and has an uknown llineage.\u000a\u000aSmells and tastes like chocolope- pretty tasty.\u000a\u000aThe high is moderate, and probably not the best for morning use, but better for afternoon-night use.  Just my .02

VPicked this up from a local connect that works and grows for a dispensary and this is definitely some intense stuff. Started out with a big bong bowl in a dark setting which allowed the feeling of a higher body high and then moved to a pipe bowl which still intensified the already amazing high. \u000a\u000aThere is a definite euphoric feeling with this and a sense of D&#233;j&#224; vu. When sitting you will feel tingly and as if some parts of your body are numb. When standing you could feel dizziness and could loose balance. Sitting in a chill setting would be perfect just being able to kick back and relax. I prefer to have a dimly lit room (preferably colored lights) with good music playing in the background. \u000a\u000aThis strain is good for both night time and day time smoking. This particular smoke was after a very long day at work and wanted to just come home smoke, had a bowl of stew and then slept like a king.\u000a\u000aHope you enjoy this as much as I did. :D\u000a\u000a
