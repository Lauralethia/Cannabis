Vi&#39;ve seen a few different seed companies that offer panama red strain and wanted to grow it this summer... one of the reputable local dispensaries got a batch in and i bought an 1/8 oz last week..... the kind they had was very well grown and fresh (always a plus because a lot of dispensaries have dry buds that been sittin around for 8 months not sayin thats bad i just prefer fresh buds) anyways... very unique smell, hard to explain but very sweet and fresh.... woke me up just takin a wiff off the bag... only other unique smell flowers i seen are Jack Herer and all the other buds basically smell the same to me...breakin it up you can tell its potent because it&#39;s pretty sticky, rolled up a small joint... smoke is really tasty kind of has a harsh tinge to it at times but has a strong dense smoke to it... almost magical... great sativa and gets me baked... goin back to by as much as i can this weekend...

VAn absolute legend, and as nostalgic as strains come. I&#39;d heard numerous stories throughout the years from the old school heads about the legendary Panama Red. They reminisce about how buds don&#39;t come as smooth and groovy as The Red. I&#39;ve tried an unfathomable number of strains and had never come across this elusive lady. Until one day... I was helping a grower buddy of mine do some trim sessions. So one night he and I were there pretty late finally finishing up a batch, when he decided to show me something a little &quot;different&quot; he had going outside in the greenhouse. And to no avail there she was 10 gigantic Panama Red plants. I was couldn&#39;t stop staring at them.He gave me a bit to take home as a thank you for helping him out and to get my take on the flower.\u000a     The buds are definitely 100% Sativa, long and fluffy with delicate stems. They are a nice emerald green with dark red orange calyxes and nicely sugared. She smelled of Earl Grey Tea, a bit of pine, and some obvious citrus. The taste was smooth as fuck. It was mildly astringent and sweet. The effects are immediate. Very uplifting and energetic. Provided a nice clear headed groovy high. Great strain for socializing and getting shit done.

VIt&#39;s not often that I go out of my way to pursue a Sativa, but when I heard this was in town, it was impossible to resist. Having only heard stories and seen a few pictures of this legendary strain, I of course had my expectations set quite high, if you&#39;ll pardon the pun. I must say, I was not disappointed. Sweet, sugarcane inhale, with a rich earthy exhale, the euphoria bit my head and heart in a way I don&#39;t really think I was expecting, as it wasn&#39;t the almost jittery energy burst one expects from Haze or Durban. Onset was immediate, and lasted for a solid 2hrs, leaving me waxing philosophical in conversion with friends. Anxiety became an afterthought, in fact I found myself smiling, thinking about what this must have looked and smoked like before all these fancy cultivation and manicuring techniques got involved. Either way, I&#39;m glad to see these genetics haven&#39;t been lost to time, because this is definitely worth sharing with the best folks you know. Truly a legend.

VPanama Red- now thats a blast from the past: circa 1972 imagine a group of high school kids, one of them gets his hands on some Panama Red and shares. Extremely stimulating, like being strapped to a saturn V rocket. extreme continued  acceleration, almost unbearable then it smooths out, reaches a peak then a smooth parachute aided slash down, nice, very nice just like I remember it being. For the uninitiated the extreme stimulation might be scary. The kids in the above mentioned tale all ran home, got in bed at 7pm to avoid having to talk to parents--lol-So when I saw this strain offered I jumped at the opportunity--and man I&#39;m glad I did---By the way it&#39;s not from Panama. it is from the coastal plains of Columbia.

VI lived in the Canal Zone &#39;71 to &#39;73. Red was a very sticky rust colored strain that would give you trouble staying awake beyond 10 minutes if you smoked too much. It was generally harvested towards the end of the dry season around march, lots of amber. And no it is not from Colombia, it was grown mostly in the Perlas Islands off the coast of Panama. Dove for STRI (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) in that area many times. I also doubt that the Red available today is the same curtesy of the toxic eradication programs of the time.\u000a\u000aHappy Trails

VThe mellowness efffect of smoking this strain is taken to a whole new level.  I smoked some 27%THC Panama Red and the high was a super intense melowness that really helped my anxiety.  The Sativa would not let me sit still.  I would like to have some Panama Red that has been harvested with clear trich.s and some with amber trich.s.  Clear for am, amber for pm and more CBD&#39;s in amber trichomes.

VThis is my go to &quot;get up and go&quot; strain. \u000aI&#39;m more of an indica kind of gal due to fibromyalgia and PTSD. The sativas I&#39;ve had prior to this one always caused me to become anxious and on edge. I still try them when given the chance though, because you never know. \u000a\u000aThis was one of those I never knew ones. It&#39;s amazing. It didn&#39;t cause me to become anxious in any way. I swear I talked for like 3 hours straight. I have no clue about what, but I know I was talking. I also became super social. Which is a huge feat in itself since I also have social anxiety. It works wonders for pain. I didn&#39;t even notice until halfway through cleaning my house that I wasn&#39;t hurting anywhere. It did keep me up till around 2am, but I smoked it around 8pm AND I have insomnia. Obviously a dumb move on my part. I mean if I have coffee past noon I&#39;m screwed. So not sure what I was thinking there.\u000aOverall I like this one for daytime use and will definitely keep this in my books.\u000aThe flower I received was really pretty with streaks of orange-y red flowing through it. The flower was a bit dry. The nugget I ground came out really fine and burnt up fast. I re-hydrated the rest a bit and it came out beautifully sticky and burned nice and slow.\u000a\u000aPros:\u000aElevates mood\u000aEnergizes\u000aImproves social ability\u000aGood for day time use\u000aStill able to function normally\u000aDecreases, if not eliminates pain\u000aHelps with organizational and cleaning skills\u000a\u000aCons:\u000aMakes you a chatterbox\u000aNot so great for nighttime or people with insomnia\u000aDoesn&#39;t cause the stereotypical &#39;High&#39; (if that&#39;s you thang)\u000aProbably not good for people with Obsessive disorders.

VPanama Red is some nice daytime weed. I&#39;ve bought this strain a few times from Belltown PDA. I feel really creative and goofy when I smoke it. I talk a lot and get really inspired to do things, but I get kinda lazy too. The high lasts usually a couple of hours for me but it&#39;s mellow. At no point have I ever been smoking Pam and been like &quot;oh my god, I&#39;m so fucking high&quot;, but I definitely like this strain. The only thing I really can&#39;t stand is the smell after you&#39;ve smoked it.

VAnother review of a very famous landrace variety. This strain was imported from the Panama Canal region. I enjoyed this strain several times from 1975 - 1979. It was imported , hard to obtain, and pricey - about $ 100 / oz. The buds were medium in size, red /brown in color, and had a few seeds. The imported strain had a unique taste and an unforgettable CREEPER high. Have not seen strain since 1980 , probably due to the Noriega regime. Potency was outstanding ~ 20% . One bowl of buds produced a 5-6  hour intense sativa high. Two bowls were hallucinogenic!!  What I remember most about this strain was the very unique high- way better than Colombian Gold or high end Mexican sativas.  The high had a quick onset but kept building and intensifying for over 2 hours until you were impossibly stoned. No other strain has had a creeper type high as intense!! Not a social strain - very introspective and intense. This strain produced intense thirst and very , very bloodshot eyes that got redder as the high intensified to an alarming extent - you were very obviously high..Thoughts were difficult to form / racy, euphoria was intense, and mundane tasks could not be performed. Everything took on a cartoon appearance - people and objects appeared flat, every gesture appeared hilarious, Not spiritual or soaring like Maui Wowie. A different but wonderful psychedelic high - in my personal hall of fame.

I have been going through an incredible amount of stress lately, but a few hits straight from Panama left me happy living in the moment that is now. not by  forgetting my problems, but by simply helping me realize that everything will work out, and helping me brainstorm about what I&#39;m going to do to fix them.\u000a\u000aquality: 8.5/10\u000aintensity: 7/10\u000acreativity+6\u000afog -2\u000astress -5\u000amunchies: moderately low\u000aparanoia: extremely low\u000a\u000aoverall experience: 10/10 would reccomend

This and Thai sticks are what he would tell me he would burn back then. When I first Smelled it I was greeted with a delightful citrus sent with a piney undertone to it. With bright green buds and a tricome  coating that can be described as majestic. Took the flower home and loaded me a biggin. 3 pulls later and I was greated with a euphoric yet energetic high, with that outstanding citrus flavor and a piney taste. Almost like a XJ-13. This flower is amazing from the amouth of keif on return to the smell and flavor profile, truly one for the favorites book. I could see this flower being outstanding for a hike or concert.

VVaped finely-ground in my MFLB. Very odd flavor, bitter and funky like old linseed oil.  As others have mentioned, it has a very 80s feel to it.  My unfounded theory is this has a lot to do with the ratio of THC to CBD and other volatile compounds.  Pronounced time dilation, which combined with the brightness probably accounts for this strains reputation as a &quot;get shit done&quot; variety.  Good for deep cleaning the kitchen or watching MST3K.  You have to consume more of it to achieve the desired effect than you would of a modern strain, but it&#39;s worth it.

VI smoked Panama Red yesterday. I think I was high for at least 2 hours straight. This strain is without a doubt a must try for every stoner. It has such a strong sweet smell, that every time I open the jar where I Store it my entire room smells like soap for a Long time.\u000a

VVaped finely-ground in my MFLB. Very odd flavor, bitter and funky like old linseed oil.  As others have mentioned, it has a very 80s feel to it.  My unfounded theory is this has a lot to do with the ratio of THC to CBD and other volatile compounds.  Pronounced time dilation, which combined with the brightness probably accounts for this strains reputation as a &quot;get shit done&quot; variety.  Good for deep cleaning the kitchen or watching MST3K.  You have to consume more of it to achieve the desired effect than you would of a modern strain, but it&#39;s worth it.

VI bought some Panama Red, 1-2 toke weed for a minor buzz. More is fun, but not necessary all of the time: you might need to accomplish something that might require functioning! The buds of Panama Red are coated with &quot;flavor crystals&quot; encrusted w/ orange hairs, leaves are bright lime green. All products here ( I examined several kinds) are fresh and aromatic. Very pretty head: rushing at 4-5 hits. You know, the RUSH, the wave that breaks over your head and when you come up for air and shake it off, you feel like you just got off a giant roller-coaster. Note: No DUI&#39;s folks! Bad news! BE RESPONSIBLE! But Enjoy!

VPanama Red is a euphoric experience which will leave you anywhere between laughing hysterically at your film of choice and contemplating life from the most metaphysical plane you&#39;ve ever been on. Having been a smoker for some years, this is hands down one of my favourite sativas so far. Whereas some can (often pleasingly) come on with a full-hitting head-dizzying high, Panama Red leaves plenty of space for your own personal thought and leaves a deep-seated feeling of happiness and incredibly enhanced perceptive ability. A rare sunny day here in the UK morphed into an endless parade of sunshine and beautiful landscapes. I would definitely, without a doubt, recommend this strain. The only negative is that for those used to super intense highs which prevent you from functioning, this might a little outside the norm. You can 100% get to work/get out and about/focus through this weed, ften feeling fantastic about doing so!

A good sativa strain, no hybrid shit. About an hour later, he shows up in his all black trashy and smelly car. He hands me the bag without the rotted salemanship talk. I looked at him, he nodds his head a few time and said &quot;It&#39;s good kho, trust me we brothers&quot;. I roll it up quick in the toilet and light it up behind the library. First puff, first smile I was elevated, I go to the local hipster coffee shop and get myself a cup of tea. It reminded me of my first join inhaled although I had smoked Moroccan hash with mint tea.

VI tried this strain while on a quest to try &quot;legendary strains&quot; from the Vietnam Era and beyond. What I got was a very neutral tasting, highly head-trippy strain. \u000a\u000aBe prepared for a trip! But if you&#39;re in a cozy place, you&#39;ll be okay. It started making me chatty, and then I was happy and gone. This strain made me feel very critical of my own life. My mind was scattered, but not in a scary way. I thought back to a radio special I listened to once about William Burroughs, and the voice wouldn&#39;t get out of my head. It was a very deep time. But it was also great.

VFlowery, nutty, pungent vaped at 185 Celsius. Describe this very cerebral very drastic change is that it makes things brighter shinier and it will make you happy euphoric and ecstatic. I have a very high tolerance user and I would say Panama lasts for about three hours. I can see why they call it panama red it smells of Cherry and tea leaves and the hairs around it form and small clumps around the greeny leafy product. I would say that the smell and taste are very different the buds smell of cherries and Tea along with super lemon lime citrus tones.  It&#39;s pungent and T like taste and give it in the classic cannabis skunk in diesel feel. I would say the dry eyes come on first because you start to notice that the lights linger in your vision for a little bit and the smoke is so thick that it still sticks around after 10-15 seconds. Happy euphoric and the energetics signed it comes from Panama the red side would have to be a very different phenotype is introduced to the strain. After all I wonder if Panama red is actually just Panama crossed with red. Are are famous trains like the red diesel is supposed to be an Indica I&#39;ve had vintage diesel and I would say the panama red is of the same heritage if not the parents of red diesel and vintage diesel. Overall great smoke if you have a high tolerance and are looking for something energetic and cheerful I highly recommend the strain get as much as you can often because it doesn&#39;t come around like ever! Panama Red is one of the very old very famous classics if you tend to see it in your dispensary try some and reserve a lot later you&#39;re going to need a bigger space ship. Btw have a great day!

VI asked to give me a different strain, since I was getting used to the Purple, and boy did they ever.  Thanks Swell for giving me RedX. It gave me a sense of being aware.  I also felt like my muscles were relaxing and I could actually get things done for a couple of hours.\u000aI smoke out of a bong and the flavor of the weed lasts throughout the bowl.  Awesome taste too.  Almost a Tangerine flavor.

VI was looking forward to trying this strain. I gave it a four stars because I don&#39;t like the pressure in the head side-effect. Also, I was hoping it would have creative effects. I feel too heavy to create, but my focus is alright.

Vi bought an 1/8th of this and took it home and rolled a fatty.the 1/8th was one big Christmas tree bud,green w/ lots of red in it.kinda earthy,spicy taste to it and was fairly potent but not what i was expecting the problem was it was a really crispy,dry,hot burning bud,couple of twists int the grinder and it was gone so i know that was the main problem in the potency.i`m 65 yrs. old and have been smoking f/ 50 years and i have had genuine Panama Red in the very early 70`s.small red buds,hashy and spicy tasting.the bud of today is nothing like the original,to say the least i was very disappointed.bought it from Green Star Cannabis grown by Green Bluff Greenhouse.

VI purchased this sativa strain due to my hx with it, it was the  first I&#39;d ever had. I was thrown back Los Angeles 1970. The head was lofty, at times sluggish,happy and hungry, before I realized my pain was gone and Tom Waite &amp; I were cruising PCH heading for Huntington Beach Resort for a swim and camp fire. ..thank you for saving this strain,it won&#39;t let you down.
