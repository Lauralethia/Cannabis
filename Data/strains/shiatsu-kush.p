VOh Shiatsu Kush...I smoked this before taking a nice hot shower. It crept up on me, and bam! It was a complete heady effect for a while. Then I watched TV for a while; the couch lock struggle was real. \u000aI did feel pretty jittery for awhile, and my heart was pounding like crazy, but once I laid down to sleep it started to calm down. \u000a\u000aDefinitely an extremely potent strain.

VAmazing strain for depression and anxiety. Also helps with pain and muscle cramps. Very uplifting and euphoric, but also relaxing. Not really a couch-lock effect on me, I was still very functional. Excellent strain.

VYour ills will commit seppuku because of shiatsu kush. Green haven&#39;s smells like pine, skunk, citrus, hops, and fennel. Looks very frosty in yellow trich with a few spots of wet trich. Mostly beige and a little bit of verities of green nugs and leaves. Sparse  sprawling long dark orange hairs. The taste is very complex, reminiscent of ewok. 3 parts spicy and 2 parts sweet. Not to heavy. Effects are happy, relaxed body, and thoughtful. Negative side, a little dizzy, red eyes, and dry mouth. \u000aI like the effects a lot. I get jittery naturally and this gets me like chilling lotus style. I like the aroma, look, and effects. The taste, I don&#39;t like. 33.4% thc is very strong. I got super stoned with severe munchies. very sleepy...\u000a\u000aShiatsu kush is good for meditating. I recommend it  for treating muscle spasms and depression.

VI love this strain, it has a true Indica high with very little to no paranoia depending on the person and the amount smoked. I\u2019m really sensitive\u000ato paranoia and anxiety and this doesn\u2019t give me either of those side effects. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a mellow,relaxing high and also needs relief from muscle and nerve pain as well as migraines. I\u2019m a fan of Kush strains, what I love about this one is that it doesn\u2019t make me overly tired, I can sketch or paint or just watch Netflix. I could just as easily smoke this and fall  asleep, especially when I mix this with Pennywise (Indica CBD 1:1). Good strain for novices, experienced and casual smokers alike. One of my personal favorites.

VThis is definite heavy hitter. The high hit after about 15 minutes, and it came on all at once. I felt like I got rammed by a train (but in a good way!) Couch lock quickly came after. I had mild hallucinations and was so relaxed. It felt like I was melting into my couch. The peak literally lasted about 2 hours and when I came down it was very noticeable how relaxed I was. Great nighttime strain, but don&#39;t be smoking this when you&#39;ve got stuff to do!

VThis strain kicked my ass. It was too much sedative for me. I actually just went to sleep because the effects were not ideal/pleasant. If you like/need a real heavy/sedative smoke, this might be your strain though....On the bright side, I loved the unique aroma and taste vanilla, pine &amp; cedar.

VSmoked about half of a preroll and was feeling great. Took the physical pain down several notches and gave me a nice cerebral high that allowed me to relax and watch the news, yeah - the news, with a feeling of perspective and appreciation for the intricacies of our world. Not at all unpleasant, although next time I am going to take in something a bit more creative or uplifting.

VIt is a very clear headed and relaxing strain.  It is a strain that is very functional for up tempo people, but also perfect for relaxing at the end of the day for others.  It is capable of being your daytime or nighttime choice. It has a terpene profile that is clean and refreshing.  There is very little negative side effects from consuming it.  Perfect for casual smokers.

VThe aroma of this strain is absolutely superb: sweet and tropical with hints of mango, and the herb itself is beautiful with dark leaves scattered throughout and a thick layer of orange pistils and trichomes. Uplifting and euphoric, sativa-like cerebral buzz. Makes you feel physically heavy like an indica, but feels mentally more like a sativa. Good strain for productivity, although it can make you tired. Overall, this is an amazing strain I&#39;d recommend to anyone.

VAbsolute garbage. So much hype in the Leafly listing and a handful of reviews. I grew 6 clones of this strain and its worthless. It stretches way more than most quality Kush hybrids. it grows into a lanky, sparse, and totally underwhelming hemp plant. A complete waste of time and resources. I can&#39;t possibly list a single strain that has disappointed me more than this strain has in the 20+ years I&#39;ve been growing herb...so my advice is to grow literally ANY strain except this crap. I could barely yield 5% on a nug run BHO experiment with this crap since the nugs were unsalable...and the oil was pretty, but totally mediocre in potency.\u000a
