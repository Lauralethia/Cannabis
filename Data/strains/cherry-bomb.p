VCherry Phoneme of AK-47. \u000a\u000aNot super potent, but GOOD LORD: that smell and taste are MIGHTY fine. Think Cherry Limeade marijuana. \u000a\u000aYeah...\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s some of the tastiest herb and makes food taste all the more tastier. This is both a good and bad thing for me, b/c I love the AK strain, but I also have to tack on an extra $20 in groceries that I spend while she&#39;s in the house.

VOne of my Favorite strains, Awesome taste very sweet flavor and aroma, full body high accompanied with a great head high. Not sedating but very relaxing.

VIt&#39;s sweet even if lacking in flavor and it packs a punch for sure. I wouldn&#39;t say this is a good strain for anyone looking to get creative and high at the same time as all I wanted to do when I smoked it was take it easy. It will get you high if that&#39;s your main goal but I&#39;d look elsewhere if you need something more complex.

VVery very good strain, have been needing to calm down and exercise my demons and this has been great for just that. RELAXING. My batch that I bought was called &quot;cherry cobbler&quot; but I was told this was the mother plant of that particular cross. And since leafly doesn&#39;t have a strain page for it. Taste is like a cherry pie with lemonade and orange garnishes &#127818;&#127819;&#127865; fanstastic for daytime use not too heavy of a sativa side but just enough to make me like this hybrid. 5 stars for the smell alone it&#39;s like freshly cut cherry&#39;s in summer a beautiful cut of cannabis. \u000a

My buddy ripped me off, for this strain!!! No kidding LOL.\u000a\u000aThe buds were red and solid and sativa all the way.\u000aThe taste was explosive, with berry overtones.\u000a\u000aAmazing strain, simply amazing.

VThis is the perfect strain to smoke midday. I smoked one big bowl of this cherry bomb and got so high. I felt energized, focused and creative. That I wrote more for my sociology intro paper. I answered the question how can sociology be used to deal with issues like ethnocentrism and cultural relativity? And I wrote a huge paragraph and I thought I did an excellent job. I also enjoyed a great meal that I prepared for myself beforehand, angel hair pasta with baby clams and clam juice. And I had the desire to clean up the kitchen real good afterward. And then I watched a hilarious episode of workaholics. That show is funny when you&#39;re high. This strain doesn&#39;t make you tired which is why it&#39;s perfect for a midday smoke sesh. This strain is amazing for watching tv, eating, getting stuff done, or doing homework.

VCherry Bomb is the perfect strain of you want to kick back and relax at the end of a long day, but want to stay awake and enjoy your high! Full body relaxation and euphoria, combined with a solid, happy head high. Quite a tasty strain too!

VThis was disappointing. Almost no flavor. The thc level is ok, the bag says 17%. but there is not much of a high, probably no terpenes in this strain. Lots of leaf and stem attached to the buds. Maybe its the grower, Hi Guys. Not impressed.

VI&#39;m going to give this a full 5. I just got mine in the mail today, along with a few other strains, but decided to start my night off with a bowl of this. \u000aThe site I ordered it from had it on extremely cheap, and marked as a &#39;AA&#39; order. I call bullsh*t, because I&#39;m in another dimension as I write this review.\u000aDefinitely on the sative side of the hybrid, as I can definitely feel the heady high. Though, not like a strong sativa that You can&#39;t function on. It kicked in fast and hard, but doesn&#39;t seem to have any couch lock type effects, and I would have no problem heading out and carrying on woth the day.\u000aMy back pain is gone, and music sounds amazing. Feels like it&#39;s going in one ear and out the other. \u000aI will be ordering this as often as I see it, and would recommend to anyone looking for a perfect hybrid strain.

VWhen I first started smoking I didn&#39;t care what I smoked as long as I got high. Now I&#39;m always asking my guy if he&#39;s got this strain. Love it. Hits me hard with the indica within the first hit (preferably joints) and then after awhile I felt the sativa which made me want to smoke more. Which was crazy for me because usually it&#39;s the other way around. Currently trying to grow 3 of these beauties. Can&#39;t have enough.

VThis is the perfect strain to smoke midday. I smoked one big bowl of this cherry bomb and got so high. I felt energized, focused and creative. That I wrote more for my sociology intro paper. I answered the question how can sociology be used to deal with issues like ethnocentrism and cultural relativity? And I wrote a huge paragraph and I thought I did an excellent job. I also enjoyed a great meal that I prepared for myself beforehand, angel hair pasta with baby clams and clam juice. And I had the desire to clean up the kitchen real good afterward. And then I watched a hilarious episode of workaholics. That show is funny when you&#39;re high. This strain doesn&#39;t make you tired which is why it&#39;s perfect for a midday smoke sesh. This strain is amazing for watching tv, eating, getting stuff done, or doing homework.
