VI do like the Dream strains.  Green Dream during the day, and Blue Dream in the evening...  A bong rip of Green Dream will give gives me a good mix of occasional mental fireworks combined with a nice, lite body buzz to relieve pain.  Nice focus and alertness.. ;)

VI love blue dram and green crack so when they had a baby I was like I\u2019ll give it a try and glad I did it\u2019s one of the most well rounded strain just enough sativa and indica. Great for any time of day morning or evening best for feeling happy doing work.

VI&#39;d put Green Dream between an 8 and a 9. Honestly the best bud I&#39;ve gotten on my campus. Copped a dub and cyphed two joints in my bathroom between 5 people. As soon as everyone had at least one hit, we all looked at each other at the same time and started cracking up because we were already high from ONE HIT. It was pretty crazy. Green Dream is a gem if you want to get insta-high and if you want to save money on bud. Less is more. (But more is better!)

VAmazing stuff.  Purchased from the Bay Area Healing Cooperative.  Perfect blend of Blue Dream and Green Crack with the best qualities of both.

VI got a hold of some of the Cannabeast Green Dream, the smell was heavenly very aromatic strain. The Taste on the vaporizer is WONDERFUL, you taste berry and melon type flavors with a slight piney aroma also. BEST TASTING cannabis I&#39;ve had. This particular strain produces a thick calming vapor. The high is wonderful very uplifted creative and great for hardcore gaming sessions or watching a movie or listening to music. It really is a sensory strain.\u000aYou can vape the nuggs wet right off the branch!! The high is more potent and longer lasting though once it has been dried and cured.

VA slow rolling high that&#39;s power is only matched by its ability to subdue any person within a 10ft radius; Green Dream lives up to its name and origins.  This strain takes its time before exploding with energy and euphoria.  An enduring head high, Green Dream levels off with an excellent body high that seems to disconnect your mind and body.  Would recommend to anyone who uses cannabis for pain.  This is a strain you&#39;ll want to keep in your rotation.

VFinally got around to smoking some of the Green Dream I got from Desert Rose here in AZ, and I have to say, it&#39;s quite impressive. I rolled up a nice 1.5g blunt of it and smoked it to myself while cloud watching in my backyard. \u000a\u000aThe flower smelled of nice citrus with a hint of earthiness. The initial effects were positive, uplifted euphoria. After about 20 minutes, it transitioned into a cerebral, creative high. I feel very uplifted and focused. Definitely 5 star strain. Highly recommend!

VGreen Dream is a pretty good day high. I&#39;m very alert and focused, but sometimes a little too focused on one thing to pay attention to other things, if that makes sense. I guess it can be a little &quot;speedy&quot; but it is a really nice high. It smelled very earthy with slight citrus tones, and the taste was similar. this is a true sativa high, but you do feel some relaxation in your extremities. you could definitely go to sleep on this strain if you had to, it relaxes your brain and body enough to mute your thoughts and lull you to sleep. Overall very nice strain.

VGreen Dream is the child of two of my favorite strains: Blue Dream and Green Crack. So I was totally excited to try it, one night when I stumbled across it at my local pot store.\u000a\u000aAnd it is pretty good.  Like I said, I smoke its parent strains regularly.  Green Dream is definitely a mix of its parents. The part that I found slightly disappointing, and the reason for the 4 stars, is that it leans much more towards Green Crack in its effects, and just a little bit of Blue Dream.  So, it is a fab strain for getting things done, which just a little of the euphoria from the Blue Dream.  But I wish it was a little more &quot;dreamy&quot; and less &quot;green&quot;. \u000a\u000aIn any case, I would definitely buy it again for times when I have a lot to get done!

VMy experience with Green Dream was an energetic, active feeling.  I am using Rockband as an objective and subjective test between strains.  Green Dream was very fun and easy to drop into a song with.  I experience this as relaxed muscles, mentally focused and fun.  From the objective point of view the focus helped improve my accuracy.  This is hard to separate from natural skill progression.. but it&#39;s worth it to note strains that leave me feeling &quot;fuzzy&quot; tend to hurt my timing and accuracy.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve recently had too much work on my lower back (massage, acupuncture, etc..) to comment on how this helped my back pain.. but I&#39;m not feeling it right now.

VVery visually appealing flowers. Bright light green with visible, individual trichomes.\u000a\u000aSmell: you immediately get the spiceiness of the Green Crack with the smooth, tropical aroma of Blue Dream. This settles into the floralness mixture of both of these component strains.\u000a\u000aThe taste: pure Green Crack with a Blue Dream background. Definitely notable Sativa component in the flavor (most pronounced flavor: nuttiness).\u000a\u000aEffect: arousing, cloudy at first but proceeds to clear up. Mild Indica body relaxation. May not be the longest duration and may be avoided by Connoisseurs and Sommeliers secondary to lack of general, &#39;appeal&#39; but is an extremely attractive candidate for the first-timer, inexperienced consumer or someone looking for &#39;milder&#39; Cannabis focused more on alertness, awakeness and activity requiring active effort (Blue Dream AND Green Crack).\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t think to buy this again unless for a specific purpose.
