VI love a good sativa, and even better when I find a great one that has a punch from the THC potency. I do feel as if the high didn&#39;t deliver as much as I would have expected for the 26% batch I bought from. Very uplifted and creative, this strain definitely will help you stay focused, intrigued, and relaxed all at the same time.

VBought some bottom of the bag for cheap over 6 months ago and forgot about it. Just had 3 and a bit tokes from a 300mg bowl. Even this was shake, I was soon pain free with a busy mind. Later, these combined into strong euphoria. After an intimate encounter later on, &quot;that feeling&quot; lasted long after the release. Not bad at all for 6 month old B.O.B.!

VWow! The taste! It leaves me feeling like Pineberry was crossed with Purple Skunk. \u000a\u000aReally strong Sativa that is probably best left alone if you are not an experienced smoker.  It&#39;s powerful uplifting effects are quite intoxicating and euphoric.  It left me feeling quite happy. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s as if this Love Potion is like a burst of energy though, as Ive noticed not that I usually feel great for about 30 minutes and then it either burns off completely or starts making me feel a bit sluggish for a while, even though it usually wears off in an hour or so.  \u000a\u000aOther than that, I&#39;m still giving it 5 stars as its genetics are worthy of its rating.

VLove potion is a fairly strong Sativa dominant hybrid, however, the Sativa dominance does little to augment the full force body buzz. I could see this strain as a competitor for treatment in a number of significant symptoms. I would say that those looking for relief from the symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy, radiation, intense drug treatments, epilepsy, Parkinson&#39;s, MS should give Love Potion a shot for day time, or functional night time relief. On the surface, this seems like a lot to promise from a Sativa flower, and I wouldn&#39;t suggest it as a primary medicine for those suffering from the mentioned conditions, however, because of its mood elevating properties and Indica body buzz, Love Potion is a good choice for managing physical and psychological ailments.\u000a\u000aOn the recreational side, Love-Potion is a great all-purpose plant, however I would send those looking for a strictly Sativa-oriented experience to Super Lemon Haze, Super Silver Haze, Green Crack etc.

VI found my auditory senses perk up on this. I also got to drawing. It&#39;s a very mind blowing strain, thoughts are too distracting. My mind is blank on this. My other senses are ablaze. Sometimes a bad trip on an empty stomach, but always mind-wiping and head-pulsing. \u000a\u000aI would smoke this to chill or trip out  with buddies, but I would not attempt to do anything productive that&#39;s related to thought process. Your mind just doesn&#39;t work on this, which can be a blessing at times. \u000a

VI will sell my medical licence for this strain - that\u2019s how good it is! \u000a\u000aLovely pine, sweet lemon and hint of bitter grapefruit in the bag. Turns into a creamy lemon and lime sorbet on inhale in the vape (at around 180C). Such a tasty strain :D \u000a\u000aThe high for me is classic Sativa; uplifting and creative, but no couch-lock. Makes you think you are not stoned, but only for a second. The high creeps in and flash fry\u2019s you in no time! \u000a\u000aIf you have the opportunity to try it, then go for it. You will notice the real deal if it\u2019s super piney and almost lemon balm, plus the intense creative high lasts ages. Some reviews here say that it\u2019s an aphrodisiac - to me cannabis in general is an aphrodisiac! Stand out attributes are definitely the flavour, taste and Santa Marta genetics ;) \u000a\u000a

Uplifting and energizing, this sativa will make your cloudy days sunny, as treat your pain, without making you too sleepy.  I was lucky to get an absolutely beautiful cut of this flower grown by Temple of Calyx. I&#39;m convinced I need to go sign up at their shop (Temple Medicinal) on College St. now that I know they do not mess around.  Sorry that I can&#39;t say where I got these flowers from though, friends.  Why, you may ask?\u000a\u000aBecause Claudia.

VThis is a nice looking, dark green bud with orange hairs hidden under a blanket of white.  It smells strongly of earthy funkiness reminiscent of cheese which is only amplified on grind.\u000a\u000aShe busts out quite nice and produces thick, smooth, full bodied vapor that tastes pleasantly of the earth.\u000a\u000aThe effects are quite strong with a slight heavy baked feeling.  Definitely suitable to daytime chilling.  Not sure I feel like tackling any major tasks at the moment either.\u000a\u000aLater...\u000a\u000aNo major munchies or fatigue when the effects wear off however having a snooze would be no problem at all.\u000a\u000aOverall it&#39;s a yummy strain that I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to try during fun daytime activities or anytime after supper.  Don&#39;t expect bursts of creativity or energy.

VGreat Sativa. Fast euphoric high that leaves you feeling great and help melt the hard day way. Forget about problems and relax. But in the daytime if your up; I find it not too heavy. Nice and clear headed. So depends whats going on...A. 70% Sativa...so creative thinking going on also.
