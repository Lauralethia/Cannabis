VThis is a good strain for pain relief and to bring on a mellow, relaxed feeling &#128526;&#128526; without  a heavy head stone. I would not recommend this for daytime use as it does cause some foginess so it&#39;s better to use in the evening. The high CBD is wonderful to treat inflammation and pain caused by arthritis. Not an easy strain to find but if you get a chance, I would recommend to give it a try.

Vthis strain is wasted by smoking it. it makes a killer concentrate and even better canna-oil. its great for topical application as well making edibles.\u000athis is my top recommendation for use in making rsho. if grown properly is will proved a very resinous, above average yield. its a very hardy plant to grow, pretty low maintenance and seems to be a little pest resistant.\u000a

VI got this strain from Tweed with 7% THC and 9% CBD. I found it to be an excellent option for a mild daytime high that smoothed out my anxiety. No Rapid heartbeat no matter how much I smoked. I&#39;m adding this strain to my favorites list for sure!

VThis is indeed a strain that helps immensely with feeling calm, cool and collected.  No mental fogginess at all, no munchies either.  My biggest complaint:  it tastes like ASS!  If you can get past it&#39;s nasty taste, and sticker shock ($75/gm!) as well as major cotton mouth, you&#39;ll love it for an evening of relaxing, &amp; binge watching iyour latest fav Netflix show.

VThe strain I&#39;m reviewing is called OG Kush CBD from Healthy Pharms in Massachusetts, and this is the closest I could find... \u000a9.9%thc / 13% cbd.\u000aIt smells a little skunky, earthy and church-incensey. There&#39;s some of that pungent kushy taste.\u000aFor me, this stuff is perfect medicine for the daytime. It knocks out my nausea and pain without being overly psychedelic or sedating. I&#39;m not sure on the genetics (OG Kush, presumably) but mentally it feels like a sativa. My mood improves, I&#39;m more talkative and productive, but after a few too many hits I&#39;m pleasantly sleepy. If you&#39;re down with the 1:1 thc:cbd, you&#39;ll get down with this. An immediate favorite.

VI had this strain in a 1:1 ratio (6% THC &amp; CBD) and it just put me right to sleep which was exactly what I was looking for. A really weak hitter (obviously due to the 6%), but good to use for anxiety or sleep issues, especially cause it provides little &quot;high&quot; feeling.

VWhen we picked up the seeds for this strain from close friends, who were also growing this, we were all super excited. My mom and I were especially hyped, since both of us suffer from lifelong anxiety and depression. \u000aOur harvest that year was very successful, so despite it being our smallest plant, we still got a ton out of it. Having such a large supply, all of us got to try this strain many times, in flower and concentrate form, with friends and by ourselves. We&#39;ve smoked it, vaped it, and eaten/drank it too.\u000aIt was the fifth time I tried the strain that I realized how much of a shitty time I was having on this weed. Not only was it making me super anxious and paranoid, but, and this hasn&#39;t happened with ANY other strain to this day, it was making me feel legitimately depressed. Not just sad, but that unique, unforgiving feeling of depression. I was just so excited that I deluded myself into thinking I was having a good time.\u000aSeeing how so many others do good on this strain, I was very hesitant on making a review. I thought I was just that one odd case. However when I was talking with my mom about how the strain felt, I was surprised to hear that she was having the same shitty experience I was, minus the depression. \u000aAfter hearing this, I figured there must be more people like us out there who also aren&#39;t having a good time with this strain, and so I feel that there should be at least one very negative review on Leafly. It&#39;s a total shame too, because I honestly thought I&#39;d be giving this one 5 stars. RIP.
