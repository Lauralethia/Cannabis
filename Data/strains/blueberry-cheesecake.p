Vthis one is an indica mindfuck. theres only a few strains that give me hallucinatory experiences but this is one.  the lights in a room got shut off during the night and my first thought was that the power went out. gave me a bit if disoriented confusion and everything became trippy feeling, but in a good way. its a creeper for sure. tastes like blueberry cheesy creamy goodness

VI had this recommended to me by a superior budtender who, it seems, knows exactly what I need for any of my major medical issues. After explaining my most recent symptoms, she recommend the BEAUTIFUL, Blueberry Cheesecake it\u2019s magnificent. The smell is to die for and, the buds are so dense and sugary. The taste is smooth and mellow. It\u2019s aroma of the smoke just makes you warm and happy. I noticed a sweet and tangy flavor and an immediate effect. Nice tingle down my neck and, basically numbed me from the hair, down! Lol. I was pain free, relaxed and calm but, still able to focus on the hockey game I was watching and track stats, etc... When I was ready to shut my brain off, it was a quick transition to sleep as I was already feeling so relaxed. Definitely a new fave of mine!!

VPicked this up as an alternative, because the dispensary was out of what i wanted. I was VERY impressed by this, right after my first dab my arthritis pain seemed to calm down, i felt a wave of relaxation and felt very happy throughout the entire high. My high lasted about 1.5 hours and dropped my stress levels immensely! Awesome strain to smoke during the day as you are still function able, just very chilled out and still energetic enough to get shit done. Awesome strain.

VThis strain was truly an experience to be cherished, her cheese &#129472; sharp pungency is smoothed over by the undertone of blueberries that end any inhale of her fragrance or taste.  She is loud af &amp; is truly recognizable.  The batch I had was really fresh, and when I first rolled up the high immediately went to my face and was both a bit of a body &amp; a cerebral. I wasn&#39;t tired after smoking this strain but I wanted to close my eyes if that makes any sense. After closing my eyes, pleasant visuals set the ambiance.  I&#39;m giving this strain five stars because it does make a profound impression by truly resembling its name. I would recommend this strain for relaxation from anxiety and perhaps pain. The trichomes on my batch were mostly milky with very little clear. The breeder of this strain is a company called female seeds.

VBlueberry cheesecake. What can I say about this strain that hasn\u2019t been said yet. \u000a\u000aThis was by far and away my finest grow yet!! Seedsman seeds produced a premium strain that not only produced a lot of very potent buds,but also the most fragrant,beautiful smelling and just out right wonderful whole flower smokeable cannabis that money can buy. Although short and skinny,she ran all the way up from the base of the stalk all the way to the top!! Watching her grow was an amazing experience for me. Big, BIG shoutout to seedsman genetics for releasing this strain for ALL to enjoy. I have chopped,and am drying now,once I get to smoke a little I will update this post. Amazing. Just out right amazing!!

V1st choice. As a heavy user I only use concentrates as my method of delivery, I have tried many strains, and Blueberry Cheesecake is a well thought out personal number one. Following the blueberry strain for its notably smooth feel, this version stands above in that quality. Blueberry cheesecake is the best strain for feel, from small samples to some of the largest doses.

VSolstice Grown&#39;s Blueberry Cheesecake is ubiquitous in the Seattle area. I am happy I finally tried it. The smell and flavor are appetizing. The effects are indica leaning relaxing but not overwhelmingly heavy. This is an early stress buster with ample pain relief, followed by good sleep support. I consume(d) lightly and can&#39;t speak to how it will treat one at heavier doses.

VThis stuff absolutely reeks of sweet blueberry and pungent cheese. The high totally messed me right up. Hard to speak properly, dizzying full body high with some cerebral stimulation.

VI recently picked up .5 gram of wax by Dogstar actually the material was from Dogstar and it was produced by X-tracted. If I had known that I would have bought more. I feel that X-tracted produces some truly killer tasting concentrates the look is a kinda juicy goldenrod truly earwax the flavor was sweet, cheesy, berries sounds terrible tastes amazing I was using a Quartz Castle low temp with carb cap and the flavor was quite intense. The high is really upbeat but euphoric I like it when I gotta get some work done that I don&#39;t gotta put too much thought into. It might mess with people sensitive to paranoia, it&#39;s got the really upbeat euphoria thing going on.

Vpicked up an 8th a few weeks back to try out &amp; was def impressed. I will say it was a bit harsh on the throat, but as soon as I opened it up and took a whiff, Wow undeniably pungent yet sweet aroma. after just a few pulls I could feel the warm wave of relaxation slowly working its way from the top of my head to my feet. High lasted about 1.5-2hrs.As someone with Insomnia this would relax me for a few hrs of tv but def isn&#39;t strong enough to send me to sleep.

VSolstice Grown&#39;s Blueberry Cheesecake is ubiquitous in the Seattle area. I am happy I finally tried it. The smell and flavor are appetizing. The effects are indica leaning relaxing but not overwhelmingly heavy. This is an early stress buster with ample pain relief, followed by good sleep support. I consume(d) lightly and can&#39;t speak to how it will treat one at heavier doses.

VI&#39;ts been a few months since I&#39;ve had this strain. But not in concentrate (sugar wax) form. The smell is that of a sharp white cheese with a hint of sugary sweetness like fresh baked pastries. The effect on the mind and the body is immediate. First you feel like you have a halo of bliss tingling your brain and your hair wants to stand on end. Then you feel it in the eyes, more tingling. All senses are enhanced. Sound especially. As time passes on your body feels weightless and buzzed. Perfect to just lay down on the couch, bed or recliner. This was from two rice grain sized dabs on high heat (600*F). The flavor of cheese and nutty vanilla lingers in the mouth even after several minutes. I really love this strain for the evening. This is a couch lock strain. Don&#39;t make any plans is you use this strain as medicine or for fun. Cheers!

VGreat for day time if you watch your intake. Definitely gets me up and going, however I find that in larger amounts it can cause me some dizziness- not particularly uncomfortable, just might make you want to lay down and hang out. Take this one easy and see how it affects you if you have a low tolerance.  Otherwise the info described above is pretty spot on (effects, medical, negative) and overall if you spot it pick some up. It does have a fruity sweet fragrance, and might stimulate your appetite.

VI\u2019m very pleased with this hybrid we picked up from the good people at Bellwoods Dispensary. The smell alone is exciting, taking on aromas true to its name. A powerhouse creeper sativa, Blueberry Cheesecake tastes like dessert and is an anxiety free day-tripper. It\u2019s true to its heritage; the Cheese puts a smile on your face and the Blueberry holds a long lasting euphoria. Perfect for the project oriented.

VBlueberry Cheesecake is a Indica dominate hybrid of as its name would suggest cheese and blueberry. The buds were nice and all but nothing to write home about, although it was good. Upon grind a treasure trove of tricombs emerged to show they&#39;re pretty little faces and the smell was well blueberry at first followed by cheese right away. The first hit was what you would expect out of a blueberry hybrid, sweet with a blueberry taste and a pungent Exhale from the cheese side of this strain. The effects where everything that you expect out of an Indica full body relaxation and reduction of pain also calming affects and putting the mind at ease for those who suffer from anxiety. This is a top shelf Indica worth seeking out 8/10

VI see that some reviewers refer to this strain as a sativa but this batch that I got from Solstice farms was definitely  ALL Indica. It had the sweet berry like smell and somehow reminds you of cheesecake on the exhale. Effects came on quickly and included munchies. The body high was deep but not overpowering.I vape most of the time and that really lets you enjoy the taste. Plus this batch had a 38% THC count :)\u000aThink I just found a new favorite strain.

Vso here is a rare treat for everyone what do you do whenever you take a strain like blueberry cheesecake and mix it with someone who has been diagnosed with autism or Asperger&#39;s? anybody wondering my first experience when taking blueberry cheesecake my hi lasted at least 8 to 10 hours long and it was the most euphoric uplifting happy stress-free environment that I have ever been put in it was like being relaxed and comfortable at the exact same time while also being honest truthful with your words actions and feelings and everything would flow together in place like you&#39;re messing up along the way at all and oh oh oh it smells like blueberries and tastes like cheesecake I give the strain at least and 9.3

VGreat for day time if you watch your intake. Definitely gets me up and going, however I find that in larger amounts it can cause me some dizziness- not particularly uncomfortable, just might make you want to lay down and hang out. Take this one easy and see how it affects you if you have a low tolerance.  Otherwise the info described above is pretty spot on (effects, medical, negative) and overall if you spot it pick some up. It does have a fruity sweet fragrance, and might stimulate your appetite.

VReally liked this strain... beautiful, super crystally buds that are light green and dark purple. When you crack open the jar, you&#39;re greeted by a pungent sour berry smell with cheese and skunk undertones... In a joint it smokes really clean and has a very complex, sweet, dessert like flavour. Would recommend this to a heavier user, as it&#39;s extremely strong and the feeling can boarder on &#39;narcotic&#39; like when over indulging.

VThis is the yummiest smelling, tastiest bud that I\u2019ve ever lit up.  It hits like a freight train after about ten minutes.  \u000a\u000aI had used mine during an episode of stress and was immediately relaxed... immediately comfortable.  It was a beautiful cerebral high that seemed to normalize me completely.  I did notice myself almost stumbling a little bit when I walked however... it was strong enough to cause some dizziness.\u000a\u000aOn another day, when I was already relaxed on my own... this same strain caused me to fall into an immediate, restful sleep.  \u000a\u000aThat tells me that this strain gets a gold star and an A1 strain for panic, depression and anxiety.

VI&#39;ts been a few months since I&#39;ve had this strain. But not in concentrate (sugar wax) form. The smell is that of a sharp white cheese with a hint of sugary sweetness like fresh baked pastries. The effect on the mind and the body is immediate. First you feel like you have a halo of bliss tingling your brain and your hair wants to stand on end. Then you feel it in the eyes, more tingling. All senses are enhanced. Sound especially. As time passes on your body feels weightless and buzzed. Perfect to just lay down on the couch, bed or recliner. This was from two rice grain sized dabs on high heat (600*F). The flavor of cheese and nutty vanilla lingers in the mouth even after several minutes. I really love this strain for the evening. This is a couch lock strain. Don&#39;t make any plans is you use this strain as medicine or for fun. Cheers!

VInitially, the taste and smoke of this strain were incredible.  Then the onsetting high began and I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the results.  Overall, if done in lighter dosages, it was a pleasant stress relieving strain, with some mild to strong psychedelic effect.  However, if over done, I found it to produce anxiety based effects, including panic attacks.\u000a\u000aOverall, was a great stress reliever, but the negatives I received would cause me to pass on the strain in the future.

VThis strain is a pretty good strain. It has great taste, great smell, and good vibes. I would say to those who smoke weed for anxiety; this strain made my anxiety go up a little more than normal, but only if I was triggered by something. Other than that, I love it :)
