VI have a very select process of grading different strains of M.J. based on myrcene,terpines etc. and found myself having a very hard time deciding 4 or 5 stars.What an amazing indica strain that is very euphoric and cerebral taking all body aches and pains away.Plus a truly old school &quot;stoned&quot; head high that pairs really nicely together.I passed this strain up many,many times because i traditionally like hybrids and tend to get the heavy indica strains for when i cant sleep,but this bud did not get me stuck to the couch and left me very uplifted,stress and anxiety free.Beginners beware its a heavy one fore sure.

V3.5 Star. It tastes like most others when you volcano it.  Relaxing night time buzz.  Great for overthinkers.  This was grown by Desert Grown Farms.

VI am a recreational user. I chose this strain because I heard it was good for insomnia.\u000a\u000aThe gram I picked up had 23% thc.\u000a\u000aI vaped this at 365 degrees. The effects are a heavily sedated body high. At first, my mind is mush and I feel kind of disoriented.  There is a mild euphoria. My second go around with this strain gave me slight paranoia until the high peaked. I felt like this is a pretty social strain if you are staying in. A good strain to watch a movie or listen to music. This is not a good strain for productivity.\u000a\u000aI slept like a baby after having this.

VTwo favourite strains in the making of this formidable strain of Black Afghan.   She is made from OG Kush, Black Domina and Afghani both long time favourite Cannabis strains. This heavy pain killing and sedative Cannabis is truly one strain that we will try to find clones of to grow out in one of my Medical Gardens.   \u000a\u000aThis strain arrived by cannabis delivery service of which the Island of Montreal has quite a few of these home deliveries. While they might not carry multiple strains available in any size packages other than 0,7 , 1/8, and 1/4 quantiles and I prefer multiple ounces to make salad of to put into my Stotz undt Bikel Vapourizers  These are without a doubt absolute favourite vapes of which are now made of 100% Medical Grade materials and parts.   The Classic Volcano with the largest and deepest bowls of the desktop models of Vapourizers   I currently use The Plenty the newest designed desktop model the most when I am either in the hospital or at home.   I also use the Mighty hand held portable vapourizers which is my most recently acquired vape.  \u000a\u000aThe Black Afghani strain is Indica dominate 80/20 strain produces very dense and heavy buds that are such a dark green and almost black in appearance wit dark amber coloured hairs while having many different forms of triclombes once she is magnified to the proper level of 80 x t 1025 x magnified    The label of the bag of buds states that this type of Cannabis has close to 6% CBD. and 23,5% THC. Making it a very popular medical strain for chronically ill patients and or those of us that require pain killing and, sedative amongst the desired effects of such a strain.\u000a\u000aI have both the Cannabis buds and it\u2019s hashish and also some bud trim that I send to an Albertan friend how transforms i he bud trim into top quality shatter too.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this strain to any and all persons who favour hard hitting Indicas  that are both cerebral and sedative in nature,

VBeautiful plant with big dense colas. Fantastic smell too. Reminds me of taking a hike in the woods during the fall. Sweet earthy tones with a hint of black pepper and lemon.. The high is unreal. You melt into your bed and become one with the Duvet. This is perfect for curling up on the couch with your loved one and zoning out to stupid movies. Make sure you have all your provisions in arms reach. Once you settle down. You don&#39;t move for a few hours.

VI have been looking for the perfect strain because many of them cause anxiety for me. This strain helped my anxiety, any stressors, pain, and my mood. I have been happier, aurosed, and motivated even though it can be a couch locker. It does give you the munchies but coffee has been helping with that. It makes everything taste good, everything feels good, and everything is just right with life. &#128522; Beautiful!

VVery good indica. Had a nice vape sesh of this and it has a nice afghani smoothness with a dark dirty aftetone (smooth taste/dirt after taste meh). However this is a solid hitting indica, when I think of black afghani I think about falling asleep. This is definitely a later evening strain or a deep relaxer if that\u2019s what you are looking for. I would really recommend this as a solid indica with true indica effects that are hard hitting and long lasting. \u000aHowever the flavor was meh, don\u2019t care for the dirtiness, but if you can get over that you will Love this one. \u000a\u000aMy True Rating 4.45 \u000a-BPop6
