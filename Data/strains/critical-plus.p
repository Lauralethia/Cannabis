VI LOVE Critical +!  As somewhat of a recovering hypochondriac and someone who suffers from anxiety, I do have to be careful about which strains I smoke otherwise my paranoia will take over and I&#39;m suddenly having a bad high.  A friend recommended this to me and ooh my God it&#39;s great!  I have a smoothe, relaxing high, it leaves me super giggly which not many strains do, it gives me the perfect amount of energy but if I need to sleep, smoke a bit more and you&#39;ve got a sleep aid!  I can stay continuously high if I want to with no fear of anxiety or paranoia flare ups!  I smoke some of this and go for a jog or swim and I&#39;m totally Zen.  After trying countless amounts of different strains, this is easily my 2nd favorite out there!  Definitely recommend this for a good, enjoyable high!

VRecently discovered this strain (Critical Plus) which is a balanced hybrid-- perfect for relaxing without too much head high, yet still mentally uplifting. Best of all there are NO negatives that I&#39;ve felt, and a cannabis bud tender confirmed this.  I was told it&#39;s bred for PTSD and other stress related conditions with a goal of no negative effects.  Fab! \u000a\u000aBottom line: If you&#39;re looking for a big boost or head high, you might pass.  If you are wound up or up tight, Critical Plus is probably just right!

VMORTAL, ha dado la casualidad que una hora despu&#233;s de fumarla he tenido que ayudar a mi padre a arreglarle el pelo, y no le dije nada de que hab&#237;a fumado, suelo hacer ese tipo de cosas bien, pero la que le he liado ha sido importante hahaha\u000a\u000aLa &#250;nica pega que le pongo es que es un tipo de planta que, tras un largo periodo de secado, he plantado otras cepas de la misma manera y esta en concreto no tiene mucha resina a simple vista.\u000aSensaci&#243;n de la hostia, pero no os pong&#225;is a cortarle el pelo a vuestro padre porque la cag&#225;is basto.\u000aRecomendable para tratar ansiedad y que te deje una fumada leve durante un tiempo m&#225;s prolongado.

VThanks again to Laura for recommending this amazing strain! I have tried the sweet relief oil and compared to that this trumps by far! I have the Cresco brand and I heat it up with my blow-dryer dryer to make the oil come out of the syringe easier and dissolves better In My Mouth. Can&#39;t stand the taste, butt absolutely love the amazing medical effects! Usually my morning cocktail would be meds and coffee BUT, I found that I&#39;m able to use a little bit of oil under my tongue in the morning and it keeps me off any pain meds or muscle relaxers until around 3 in the afternoon! To me that is so amazing! TOTALLY worth the money! couldn&#39;t be more grateful to Laura for helping me continue to find what is best for me! But I recommend this product to anyone suffering from fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, muscle spasms, chronic fatigue syndrome, thyroid disorders, anxiety and depression!  Matter of fact going back again today for more!

Vthis train is definitely a favorite. While it doesn&#39;t appear impressive, and the flavor matches the appearance of the buds to that effect, it is still an extremely happy uplifting euphoric high. Just enough of a nice fuzzy body high and a cerebral euphoria that honestly makes it one that everyone needs to try; any time I see it in the store I&#39;m getting some because it&#39;s just perfect for everything and for just being happy and high in general it&#39;s the perfect bliss.

VI taught this was a horrible plant to grow. Full of soft all leaf foxtailsbelow the top canopy and then the Colins are very small. Compared to Critical mass. It\u2019s a no grower for me. Did 3 Seasons and not a good yield at all. And strength wise it\u2019s 7%-10% max. Pressed 1 oz and got 3 gram of concentrate using a 12ton press.

The pain I felt in my pelvic region was instantly relieved and my migraine was gone. This had a mild body high but not a deep one.

VFor me, this was a good find. I picked up a 4 gram bag of this at Clear Choice Cannabis in Tacoma WA, it was just $25 so I wasn&#39;t expecting anything special. Really, much better than I had anticipated, feels like a really balanced hybrid, just a really pleasant high. I&#39;m a runner, I had a long run on the first hot day this year, I was feeling pretty beat an hour ago, but feel great now.What more do you want?

Vthis train is definitely a favorite. While it doesn&#39;t appear impressive, and the flavor matches the appearance of the buds to that effect, it is still an extremely happy uplifting euphoric high. Just enough of a nice fuzzy body high and a cerebral euphoria that honestly makes it one that everyone needs to try; any time I see it in the store I&#39;m getting some because it&#39;s just perfect for everything and for just being happy and high in general it&#39;s the perfect bliss.

VThanks again to Laura for recommending this amazing strain! I have tried the sweet relief oil and compared to that this trumps by far! I have the Cresco brand and I heat it up with my blow-dryer dryer to make the oil come out of the syringe easier and dissolves better In My Mouth. Can&#39;t stand the taste, butt absolutely love the amazing medical effects! Usually my morning cocktail would be meds and coffee BUT, I found that I&#39;m able to use a little bit of oil under my tongue in the morning and it keeps me off any pain meds or muscle relaxers until around 3 in the afternoon! To me that is so amazing! TOTALLY worth the money! couldn&#39;t be more grateful to Laura for helping me continue to find what is best for me! But I recommend this product to anyone suffering from fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, muscle spasms, chronic fatigue syndrome, thyroid disorders, anxiety and depression!  Matter of fact going back again today for more!

VThis strain is the definition of sticky icky. It&#39;s so resinous with frosty red hairs and the loveliest color of green with some darker green hues. Definitely a creative head high with body calming effects in decent dosages. But it doesn&#39;t take much with Critical Plus. It&#39;s an all around great strain for many symptoms. But the smell is so strong I could smell it from my buddies house on the road haha some skunk with an underlying citrus aroma to it. Recommend this to anyone.

The buds were gorgeous, this guy really looked after this plant. I could feel this working on me as soon as I took the first few pulls of the joint in my body and head. After about 20 minutes I got a little paranoid and anxious but I went with the flow and it passed. Had a great time after that and I didn&#39;t have bad feelings again. Would recommend this strain for sure.

VGrowing this plant was an amazing experience from start to finish, such vigorous growth throughout its whole lifecycle and produced immensely dense, hairy and resinous nuggets. The high is sedating and cerebral with sativa-like effects that ease into the body. I recommend this strain to anybody that hasn&#39;t tried it!

VThis strain is what you&#39;re looking for if you&#39;ve got a Thanksgiving dinner in a few hours and you wanna really feel the blood spilt by the white demons who invaded Native American land all in your mashed potatoes and your turkey stuffing.

VSecond time: Smoked at Gabaldon bench, casually left when cops rolled up nearby. Only smoked one bowl between Natasha, Drew, Steven and myself, but we once again had a great time. Walked to The Suites hammocks and were in our own worlds giggling. Went back home and ate a sandwich made by Natasha, was wonderful.

VI wanted to try this because it smelled AMAZING and I loved the high from the beginning to when I passed out (lol). Way citrus-y.

VStay away from this strain. It tastes like dirt and the instant you smoke it you receive a headache. Much rather have someone kick me in the face. Closest thing I&#39;ve smoked to Mexican dirt weed in a long time. Feel like my dispensary tricked me and I&#39;ll try to convince them to pull it. Trying to take symptoms away not add them.
