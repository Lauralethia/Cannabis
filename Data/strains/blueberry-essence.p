VSmooth taste. Brightens you up. Mellows you out. Great for focusing and gaming. Very nice relaxed body without having no feeling in limbs. May make you not hungry.

VI great look and smell. I mixed this into a joint of super sour og. between the two of them I felt a real body high as well as a cerebral high. I went out to a show it maintained a good high for about two hours before hitting the joint again. I will for sure be smoking more of this in the future.

VI have to agree with other reviewers, this is a great strain for those who have weed anxiety or just anxiety period. Slight uplifting, but not nervous with a body buzz and tingle throughout. This is one of my favorite strains for sure. We need more equal CBD/THC strains like this.
