Vill start off by saying every strain affects people differently, but for me this was a bad decision. all it does is make me extremely tired. extremely potent, and all i smoke is concentrate. I have ADD/ADHD and PTSD, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what made the difference but if you struggle with any of those things this strain may not be for you

V4.5 stars - I cannot begin to explain how much I love this strain. This is exactly what I needed to kick my anxiety to the curb and get shit done. It can make you a little dizzy if you go overboard but it&#39;s not a unpleasant dizziness, if that makes any sense. I&#39;ll definitely be purchasing more of this strain in the future!~

VA friend of mine grew this and I happened upon two seeds (out of two ounces) and there&#39;s no question, I&#39;m growing it. I can smoke this sativa all day. It&#39;s a total mood booster. Might actually give you energy. Immediately reduces stress.  The crystals on these buds.. Oh my word. I wish I had taken a picture.    Definitely A+ herb.

VI have been a Blue Dream fan for quite some time now, I want to pick up some sativa last night and the budtender at LivWell (Brandon with a southern accent &#128521;) was beyond stoked about this strain. He suggested I give up the blue dream for now and give the BAY Dream a try. So I did. We did. My husband and I... we had a solid puff 2hr before bedtime. It was one of the cleanest, happiest most euphoric highis! Truly enhancing everything you&#39;re feeling in a moment. Fanataric munchies that kicked in almost immediately. No headaches, no dizziness. I highly recommend it in the morning with your coffee/tea (no alcohol). Everyone is different. This strain lays out its own path and can be a magical journey if you choose to walk the Bay Dream&#39;s path &#128513;&#128588;&#127996; happy puffin&#39;

VI did this when i did purple dream. This is really tasty candy like. Didn&#39;t help my pain to much, but it did help my depression and mood. I went from sad angry to happy, It also can get taller then I thought it would. Smoke report taste-berry ,fruity,almost taste like sugar. Effects of this, actually made me energetic which doesn&#39;t happen much because I don&#39;t like that feeling but some might. Sativa heads need try it. If your looking for indica pain or anything probably not going to do it.

VI am a huge fan of Blue Dream, and so I was very excited to try this hybrid.  Bay Dream did not disappoint. It is an awesome sativa that is great for getting work done, exercising, cooking, etc. It made me feel just slightly foggy-headed, but also very, very focused. Like most sativas and sativa-dominant hybrids, it was uplifting and gave me that really good, happy feeling that allows me to concentrate on what I&#39;m doing and not sit around feeling anxious about life.\u000a\u000aI am a lifelong severe anxiety-sufferer, and I did not feel anxious at all with Bay Dream. It was long-lasting as well, which is a huge plus in my book when I am working on a long project and don&#39;t want to have to keep smoking as I work.    \u000a\u000aJust be aware, it is very strong, and slow-acting.  If you don&#39;t feel it right away after a few puffs, wait about 10 minutes before smoking more so that you don&#39;t overdo it. If you are a sativa fan and happen to see Bay Dream in your dispensary, by all means give it a try!

VBay dream forever will hold a special place in my heart as some of the best smelling bud I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure to inhale upon. Tastes so sweet and personally I find it to be really refreshing.

VDamn.  Some of the most stable, clear, and amber colored wax like you wouldn&#39;t believe.  Excellent flavor of herbal exuberance with a faint tootsy roll after taste.  Very heavy, couchlock-y sativa (personally seems more indica to me).  Enjoy now at Delta Health Association in San Jose.

VBay Dream was very pleasant and potent! Normally I smoke an entire .5 g joint in a sitting, but with Bay Dream I only need to smoke about half of that because it&#39;s effects are very strong. It puts me in a good mood, gives me a HUGE appetite, and to me is good for both daytime and nighttime smoking. One day I took a couple hits before work and was able to get through the day without being tired or foggy. I&#39;ve also smoked this before bed and found that the comedown is relaxed enough to where drifting off to sleep is easy. I&#39;ve also smoked this strain right before a hike and found that it enhanced the experience, making colors seem more vivid and the heat more bearable.

VI can only describe it as being a huge mood elevator. I didn&#39;t find it particularly special or anything. NOTE:I am a daily smoker so maybe it just isn&#39;t potent enough for me. If you find it for 8 a gram or less, it&#39;s worth it.

VVery uplifting. Clear headed sativa that is great for chores and getting things done or outdoor adventures.  The flavor is fairly subdued. The high has more of a spin to it than straight Blue Dream.

VI was told that since I like Blue Dream, I would enjoy Baydream.  Time to find out!\u000a\u000a-Smell:  Its full of bright, citrus notes with just enough sweetness to keep it from coming across as astringent\u000a\u000a-Look:  This has your normal green bud throughout, but instead of just having orange hairs, it also has a selection of vibrantly red hairs as well.  Mine did have some seeds (not many, but Lake Effect told me ahead of time.)\u000a\u000a-Taste: I definitely noticed the citrus notes as I exhaled.  This strain also leaves an earthy aftertaste on our mouth\u000a\u000a-Feeling:  It&#39;s kind of surreal.  Immediately you are able to focus on mundane things such as a movement in the background, but it is harder to focus on things you really need to accomplish (but I found if need be, I can push myself to get things done.)\u000a\u000aConclusion:  I really enjoy this strain.  Its one of the more tasty smokes I&#39;ve had and honestly, the feeling is different than what I&#39;m used to so its a nice change of pace.  Give it a try!

VBay Dream has a problem: It&#39;s name. It undersells its effects almost completely.  A better name for this strain would be &#39;Platform Perfection&#39;... Okay, I know -- that&#39;s not going to win any marketing prizes either.  But it&#39;s totally accurate. \u000a\u000aI like to platform my intake over the course of the day (while I&#39;m working), layering either one strain on top of itself or on top of another.  In a lot of cases -- Blue Dream layered atop GG4 especially -- the layering effect is consistent and repeatable: A feeling of well-being leads to focus leads to clarity leads to some of the best work of my life (and why we&#39;re not shouting this from the rooftops, oh, fellow Brothers &amp; Sisters In Cannabis, I do not know -- especially if we mean to change all perception of this remarkable product -- but I digress).  \u000a\u000aBay Dream layers brilliantly upon itself -- as described here at Leafly -- with an effect that&#39;s definitely &#39;intoxicating&#39; -- except rather than feel drunk, the intoxicating makes one &#39;drunk&#39; with focus.  It&#39;s a heady feeling (with terrific nuances when you layer Bay Dream atop, say, Dutch Treat or Blue Dream or -- now we&#39;re talking creme de la creme -- White Widow.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a pleasant enough smoke.  Sweetness and spice on the nose.  Unremarkable flavor but then I&#39;m more about what takes place inside the head than anywhere else.  \u000a\u000aSo -- great strain -- anemic name.  Nothing a high priced PR firm can&#39;t handle.
