VOne of the best of the old-school, foundational strains, GSC in all its many forms is a &#39;go-to&#39; bud. Meaning that it is always an intense head, with many delightful sensory and physical effects that vary (tingling is a favorite), a strong positive impact on my mood, and a nice, characteristic flavor in the bowl, like pastry or like GSC, you decide.\u000a\u000aPearl Scout Cookies (there should be such a badge!) is very cookie-ish (IOW: doughey, before baking).BTW no headaches may gain admission, if you have the same problem as I have. Wacky wacky, time-screwed, happy, stinky-cookie playtime. IOW: fun shit, and then it wears off. Next time I&#39;ll use a bong for even greater effect!\u000a\u000aRecently (summer 2016) I have come across a series of very kind GSC and hybrids, each stronger and more interesting than the last. Peppermint Cookies, Coogies, Mint Cookies, Pink Cookies, Pearl Scout Cookies, and others have all a taste of just-baked, slightly dough-ey sweetness to them, and a punch of macho-THC stoniness, with an almost immediate buoyant cheerful optimism alongside. Strong. Tingly. Welcome. Noobies take care, but this is what cannabis is all about. Fun, fun, fun. \u000a\u000aAll GSC from basic &#39;forum cut&#39; and up the delicacy list give me that basic pumped-up, laugh-prone, industrious relaxation, and a tingly thing up my spine, toes, ears, that never fails to please. I recommend it. Smoking it. Vaping it. Growing it, especially. Yes, please sir, can you grow some more? \u000a\u000aA really fun, happy, beautiful strain--and that&#39;s before you smoke, then it&#39;s bliss...

VPSC full banger anthem for cookie fans. Fireline sets the bar high and gets me super high. I tasted the zesty citrus but also the undeniable cookie taste. High lasted for a couple hours or so and was heavy-ish on the come down. Love this crossed with some of their other in house creations. And the BHO is phenomenal

VThis is a review of the Pearl Scout cookies I 502 washington state recreational version from the producer Fireline.  I give it 3.5 stars out of 5.\u000aFirst off the smell was very subtle to none the sample was super dry. After breaking up in the grinder it had a light fruity sweet smell.  Smell 3/10.  Taste Sweet, creamy, minty, taste 5/10.  High 8/10 good powerful high more uplifting and clear headed.  Looks 8/10 Extremely frosty white green nugs very nice bag appeal.  I would have given this strain higher marks if the flavor was more powerful it was nice but it could have been stronger. And i feel like it might have been dried too quickly there was no smell and the sample was super dry.

VI think in small doses this could be a really nice functional high.I  could see this defiantly being a social thing. I was motivated to do things but unable to actually concentrate. I  smoked wayyy too much and actually got really bad anxiety. Hits super smooth though, none of that sore throat ish that comes with harsher strains. My BF was on a creative rampage and was being optimistic until I started having anxiety lol We both agreed its not very anxiety friendly. Bummer!

VAmazing 3/5pm strain, after work, great for immediate relief as well, relaxing but wanting to be a little productive. Life becomes better  and the shit you thought about or were worried about during the day. Just makes you laugh , you pretty much laugh it off.  It&#39;s a good hitting hybrid. Comes on slowly then lingers...vapes on an Arizer. It&#39;s not to overpowering in the beginning but can get heavy. I am getting a little hungry. So hungers sits in but your truly just content. I&#39;m just really happy, I&#39;m ok with the way today ended and how I took on the day. I feel like I won today. That&#39;s pretty much what I feel like on this strain. Strain from Fireline good batch.

VPearl Scout Cookies by Fireline in Washington State. Tested at 27.3% THC.\u000aThis is a beautiful strain. Large chunky buds with gorgeous hues of purplish-blue throughout, absolutely littered with trichomes. \u000aThe aroma is strong, lending both pungent earthy notes as well as a light citrus. Notes of pine seem to also be present. Once broken down, these buds smell much more skunky and herbal.\u000aThe flavor is smooth on the inhale, providing a smooth, zesty and sweet taste. Good, sweet after taste. \u000aA very clear headed, energetic cerebral high paired with a light body high makes this strain very enjoyable. A slight bit of lethargy on the comedown might make this best suited for afternoons/evenings use.
