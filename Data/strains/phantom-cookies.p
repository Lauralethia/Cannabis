VPurchased a great batch from Emerald Palace in Gilbert Az, excellent smoke. Very potent. Leaves me relaxed with a buzz of creative energy. Definitely helped my back pains and GI issues. After the initial peak at about 10 minutes in, it maintains a powerful buzz for an hour, and the physical effects hang around for another hour after that. Will buy again if the batch is good.

VThis strain is simply amazing. It had a rich earthy taste which I always find relaxing. \u000a\u000aIt worked great with my anxiety and depression, it was nice to have quick instant relief. It also handles pain well, especially for head aches and migraines but any general pain. This stuff will have you feeling good.\u000a\u000aThe high extremely satisfying. Its a strong head high that will have you in pure bliss. It also has a warm fuzzy body high to keep you relaxed.\u000a\u000aIts good for either day or night use. During the day I smoke it to keep me focused and collected. It keeps me motivated and keeps me moving forward. At night its nice to unwind on the couch, it gives you a rich relaxing feeling. Puts me right to sleep when I decide to go to bed, but does not make me overly tired in general.\u000a\u000aOnly downside is that I got extremely dry eyes so make sure you got the Visene. I highly recommend trying it if its around

VSomething about Cali Cookies strains; the highs are insane and enduring. I smoked Phantom Cookies with some friends who enjoy a nice cerebral high. I smoked about 20 mins before they arrived, so I was in full swing by the time they puffed. But, I enjoyed watching them as the effects set. Each enjoyed the creeping cerebral activity and as the festivities continued, each of us noticed that the effects endured for over an hour. For people with serious MMJ induced anxiety, I&#39;d start slow to test your tolerance. Also, the following morning I toked some before my early morning workout and had a productive session. Phantom Cookies really makes me want to be active and productive. No abrupt come-down, but as the cerebral effects wane, a subtle body high ensues. The flower was sticky as shit, with maad tricome coverage. The nugs were fluffy, but compact and darker green in color. The aroma is intoxicating, and its tart like citrus, but more like unripened cherries or cranberries. Some say they can&#39;t taste the cookie dough, but there are hints there; especially when the smoke is thick and free of external influences like butane or sulfur. Phantom Cookies is exactly the right blend for those looking to be physically active and intellectually functional simultaneously. ~Thanks for reading and if you like this review please like and follow.

VBeautiful, dense structure. Dark greens and some bluishness. Frosted from here to the next place. Earthy aroma with more than a hint off diesel but barely a whisper of cherries and grape. Almost no flavor at all when smoked or vaped - kind of disappointing for such a beautiful flower. The effect also seems pretty mild on my endocannabinoid system. Not my favorite.

VI&#39;ve been cultivating cookies for 1 1/2 years, some phenoms can be harvested just after six weeks with powerful frontal and creative effects, as she ages all the way to 12 weeks if you have the patience you can literally design your medication to your specific needs. Extract from phantom cookies in my opinion should only be recommended for those with an extremely high tolerance for cannabis.

VThis strain is not for the first timer. I recently tried it and was Blown away by the affects. very nice sedating with a little bit of jitters. Thoroughly enjoyed The Strain but should only be used in the p.m., I recommend this strain for people who are looking to alleviate insomnia. Two thumbs up but not for first timers.

VExcellent day time strain. Maybe 75% Sativa and 25% indica effects.  As an anxious dude I avoid Sativas, and this hybrid has been the best day time strain for me. No anxiety or shakes, just a bright, relaxing high with a gentle body buzz. Potent stuff, got a good high from less than a bowl with medium tolerance. Has a great, strong fresh lemony flavor. Vapes super smooth, no coughing. All in all highly recommended.

VAbsolutely the best strain I&#39;ve ever had. Just one hit and you&#39;ll be soaring. It&#39;s a very Earthy, nature-like aroma and flavor, but its an absolute treat to smoke. Very pleasant high, but it tends to give you energy rather than relaxation, which can be great if you want that.

VPhantom Cookies from Garden of Eden in Hayward, CA. 23% THC. \u000a\u000aTaste: Fruity and floral first hits the pallette followed by strong peppery after taste that is a bit harsh on my throat.\u000a\u000aEffect: I vaped about .25 gram in a PAX 3. With this dose I noticed that dry mouth and dry eyes set in pretty quickly. I felt a pain numbing set in at about ten minutes and then the full head high at about 20 minutes after vaping. The head high was pretty intense for me as I&#39;m a lightweight. I vape .17 to .30 gram every morning 6 days a week. I could feel my equilibrium becoming disoriented at times and I became a little spaced out or unfocused. But i usually pause take deep breathes and concentrate through these episodes and they dissipate quickly. I felt a little anxious and paranoid during the first 30 minutes but that dissipated as well. Relaxation set in after 30 to 40 minutes and I found my rhythm. I noticed sounds scents and colours become more intense or vibrant. My mood shifted into happiness and calmness and I could focus and power through tasks more efficiently. Interactions with people were calm and easy going as I became intent on listening before responding. The come down was slight easy and gradual and I smoothly sailed on into my day. Very nice.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed this high after getting through the dizzy paranoid anxiety spell. \u000a

V12.27% CBD 10.02% THC\u000a\u000aI use this for my panic attacks and back pain. The first puff results in whole body relaxation. For my pain I need at least a half gram smoked or vaporized. The smell and taste is piney citrus and the flowers are completely covered in sugar. I keep it on hand at all times now for instant stress relief. Getting close to refill time again. I notice it also makes me VERY hungry. This would be amazing tasting BHO too.

VTL;DR Lower Dosages create a euphoric and happy feeling (Thanks to its parent Cherry Pie). Come down is sleepy (Thanks to GDP). If you&#39;ve tried both GDP and Cherry Pie, this is THE example child-hybrid. Taste is okay vaped, but it&#39;s nothing special. This strain is a creeper. Getting really high creates a surreal effect that only seasoned marijuana users will be able to handle. 5/5 Love this strain and would recommend vaping/smoking it.\u000a\u000a== Long Review Warning ==\u000a\u000a(Smoking this strain currently while writing this)\u000a(Smoking aprox. .3-.4 g)(I have major anxiety and depression)\u000a(Been smoking/vaping for 3 months as of about now)\u000a\u000aI got mine from Amsterdam&#39;s Garden (So this review is of medical-grade cannabis) and it&#39;s been a really good high. Dense nugs and very sticky. It tastes great on a vaporizer (using the crafty for reference). Tastes mostly nutty a bit earthy. With it being so dense, it gets hard to hold in the vapor sometimes. For those who dont mind a little coughing after their hit, this strain can get you to a very strong high very quickly.\u000a\u000aThe actual high is very relaxing. I notice a definite high in the body as well as the mind  A sorta distracted high. However, you&#39;re still able to get things done, At higher dosages however, be warned that this strain will get you &quot;fucked up&quot; where the only way I can describe it is as &quot;the typical stoner high&quot;. There&#39;s definitely a euphoria in this high, and you can feel your problems melt away on each exhale. There&#39;s also a happiness to it. A little bit of a smile, sometimes for no reason other than the realization that you&#39;re so high. At higher dosages (about 10-12 hits for me of pretty big hits) you start to get a hungry feeling also known as &quot;the munchies.&quot; It&#39;s also at this point that the dry mouth or &quot;cotton mouth&quot; starts up. It&#39;s not too bad, as I haven&#39;t even needed to grab a sip of water while writing all this, but it&#39;s noticeable.  Let me say again that if you&#39;re looking for a really good &quot;active/get up and do things&quot; strain this is NOT the strain for you (try looking at some Sativas instead).  The indica of the hybrid is really representing itself at higher dosages. There&#39;s a bit of a playfulness to this strain though, so it feels like a good social strain (though sadly while I am writing this I have no company :( ). Like I said before, simple motor tasks are made more difficult under this strain (it was hard for me to get the wrapper off of a Ben&amp;Jerry&#39;s) while mental work is more available (I&#39;m able to somewhat coherently put together this moment-by-moment review).\u000a\u000aAll in all, this strain is 5/5 fantastic. It tastes great, it does its job, and makes those relaxing hours with friends or playing games better. A word of caution: BE CAREFUL SMOKING THIS STRAIN BEFORE SLEEPING. The effects of this strain are not very conducive to sleeping (I had a rough patch the first time I smoke this where I couldn&#39;t sleep because I had this turbulence-like feeling welling up within me and scaring me with a rush). Whether this is just me genetically or the batch that I bought or how much I vaped (which was about .45 g) or whatever, just be cautious of using this before bedtime (So this is a good lazy-day strain where you can use it in the day and do some easy mental tasks (or none at all, whatever you fancy)). I bought mine for $60 (1/8), and I&#39;d say it&#39;s well worth the money for the high.\u000a\u000aTake every review with a grain of salt. While my experiences are as I said, every person reacts in their own ways to cannabis.

VI feel the sativa feel does stick out a bit more with this one with still keeping you relaxed and chilled out. Doesn&#39;t make you sleepy but keeps you relaxed and the sativa component gives you usual happiness and euphoria feelings most sativas come with. Because of the hybrid, you get a good balance of effects from both sides.

VHow is it that phantom cookies is a sativa leaning hybrid if it&#39;s genetics consist of a 90/10 indica and an even hybrid? I&#39;ve asked every budtender in my area and no one seems to know the answer. This question has stopped me from purchasing it. Anyone have the answer?

VI just tried Phantom Cookies, and I like it just as much as it&#39;s parent&#39;s Cherry Pie and Grand Daddy Purple! [*which is saying a lot] I just got a gram of it on a 4.20 special, and rushed home to enjoy it at 4:20! So I feel I&#39;m doing it right. It smells interesting, with a distinct grape qualities. The high is positive and cerebral, plus very relaxing. I&#39;m a big fan, it really recommended it!

Euphoria within the first 5-10 minutes, then straight happy laugh-at-everything mood settles in at about 20-30 minutes in.

VPhantom Cookies is not always sativa, but it has Phantom&#215;any number of cookies...the one i&#39;ve got is bay platinum cookies...which has very little GDP influence thus it leans sativa.  I would say they&#39;re mostly 50/50 ...basically, you could get a durban poison pheno, a cherry pie pheno, a OGK pheno, a GDP pheno(which would be indica)...I personally think properly grown, cured Phantom Cookies is highly desirable. My brother always grows from seed and so far 4/5 have been Sativa dominant very tall stretch and longer flowering time, not much purple, and smells mainly earthy, roasted nuts, cherries, and a little minty...Cannabis is like having a family...your brother could look nothing like you, but have traits from your mothers sister you just never know. I believe my brother has 1 seed left and the pheno we kept is Awesome..don&#39;t need very much and is euphoric at first yet also relaxing like an indica

The high is really nice uplifting and energetic while being relaxing enough that I could crash on the couch and take a nap. It&#39;s one of those I after smoked I could go walk 5 miles or space out watching Adult Swim. Even with all this goodness Phantom Cookies manages to taste good too with clouds of thick, dense, smooth, smoke. Deffinetly 5 stars!

VFirst timer with this strain. Light fluffy nugs deliver a very clean, potent, and lasting effect. I was honestly surprised at how clean and crisp the flavor comes off when smoking this strain- tastes slightly fruity with a roasted nutty aftertone. It doesn&#39;t take long before the serious euphoric effect kicks in hard followed by a crescendoing whisper that leaves you searching for a comfy couch  or bean bag with moderate urgency. A perfect mid-day strain that lasts into the evening. Great for catching sunsets! I did get some serious munchies off this strain. Have healthy snacks ready to go or you will destroy your pantry in search of edibles. Definitely a strain to try out for the first-timer or reacquaint yourself if it&#39;s been a while.

VWhen My body &amp; mind began to get used to my current strain for relaxation and pain relief, a friend suggested trying Phantom Cookies.  I have to say that i onsider these scenarios:\u000aR\u000a         1.   Even though ur old &quot;standby strain&quot; or weed is  what makes u happy, pain free, allows u to function and it till now it worked ok.    Worked great in January, but not as great in April. But it&#39;s going to be easy and \u000a\u000a       Most likely you&#39;ll be able to find a good replacement strain / type . Always explain this situation to ur buddtender and he can help.   \u000a            2.  If all else fails get a bag of these sticky, icky buds called Phantom Cookies (kind of mysterious).  I promise after 1/2 a spliff you&#39;ll ask &quot;when did I get this stuff?&quot; The absolute top of my mountain. Starts off with that Girl Scout cookie taste but it gives way to one of the most unique flavored smoke.   About 5 min after you&#39;all are getting up, take it easy cause most likely you peed on yourself or your eyes can&#39;t focus on anything.    \u000a      Another unbelievable phenomenal strain!!!!!!   This was a surprise discovery for me and try it.   \u000a      My least favorite but most effective is don&#39;t smoke or consume any cannabis products for at least  2 or 3 days and then you&#39;ll get high on grass clippings &#128513;&#128513;&#128513;\u000aJust kidding but it&#39;s true if you want ur medicine to work right, switch strains when possible, and if u can  take 48-72 hours off.   It works!!!!!  Then roll  splif of any herb and you&#39;ll be better than ok &#128076;

Very talkative and don&#39;t have social anxiety, but I do have some munchies with this... it may just be because I have a dry mouth.
