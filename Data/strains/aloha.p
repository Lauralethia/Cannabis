VMore to follow...but I bought this strain from 112th St Cannabis in Puyallup, WA thinking it was (and seeing it advertised as such) a strong, energy inducing sativa. When I got the bud home I realized that the packaging sticker had each gram labeled as an indica. I&#39;m halfway through a bowl of it as we speak; I&#39;ll fill you guys in on the rest as it develops!

VEuphoric strain that leaves you uplifted and energized. If grown right, this strain is killer. Buds are light and fluffy with a potent citrus smell to them. They pack a hit.

VOk so,this strain?  Makes me so giggly and happy,  I love it. I deal with depression and this helps me calm my mind, be more aware and help me be positive. Would recommend to anyone wanting to laugh and have a good time. I like that it doesn&#39;t make me lazy, it just gives me lots of energy.

VALOHA! Love it! Shot out to Kush! Thanks for suppling the best Sativa on the Market. Looking for it for almost 2 weeks. No one had it and I traveled far to get it. It\u2019s everything Leafly describes it to be. I can\u2019t wait to share it with some close HOMMIES.... ALOHA!

VBoost in energy, though nothing strong for me. Cerebral uplifted head high that can help get you out of a bad mood, and was functional on Aloha as well. It was overall alright, but wouldn&#39;t mind smoking it again for the smell and taste. I recommend Aloha for a morning and day time use. \u000aFor sure Aloha will kill headaches, and moderate pain. You could use it for anxiety related problems since I didn&#39;t feel anxious or paranoid on this, but since it&#39;s a sativa I would still be cautious. Other medical uses are fatigue, and mood\u000adisorders/depression.

VAloha is the perfect sativa to kick out negativity and get stuff done.  When the difficulties of being a human on this planet creep in and I lose my get and go, I know that some sweet Aloha will make it all better.  \u000a\u000aMy first time smoking this strain in my bubbler  I was filled with positive vibes, creativity and desire to finish a project, and loads of energy and focus without anxiety or paranoia.\u000a\u000aThe smell of the sticky buds is amazing like citrus and fresh grass and the burn is just right.

VThis is a great wake &amp; bake strain with a medium high strength that\u2019s great for depression/anxiety. Good for sexy times due to the body tingles it gives. Happy and uplifting strain without kicking your ass too much. If you want an amped up version similar but with similar but stronger effects, I recommend Alien OG.

VHelps my nausea related to mast cell activation disorder. I can\u2019t medicate with pepto- bismol and this happens to be the only gram I have in the house. After 4 or 5 hits I\u2019m already not feeling as nauseas as I was. I\u2019m giving it 4/5 stars cause I\u2019m not sure how long the effects will last.\u000a\u000aIt tastes decent and smells good. It was recommended to me by one of the dispensaries cause they said it was similar to blue dream.

VA preferable sativa, Aloha does get the job done as far as a functioning body high and some mental stimulation to a peak. The psychoactive feel is very happy and pleasant while providing affects of anti-anxiety and anti-depression. This strain makes for a good day time or sunset smoke as well as a way to toast off the evening. Aloha is truly a balanced bud for the pure sativa fans out there

VWhat an interesting strain. Has the aroma of grass clipping &amp; citrus. For me it wasn&#39;t a very noticeable high. Put me in a great mood though. I bet this strains great for depression or any mood disorders. \u000aI can&#39;t wait to come across Aloha in shatter/crumble. It&#39;s cool retrying strains I&#39;ve only had as flower, but trying them in concentrate form.\u000aGreat to smoke with small group of friends, play videos games, listen to music, or even hang around a bonfire.
