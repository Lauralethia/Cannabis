VThis stuff makes me feel like all my stress draining out of my body, while at the same time makes me want to actually have some fun after a long day. Makes TV better, and video games turn in to real life. I can hear the neighborhood dogs barking from outside, and every car that passes by as well. I feel safe, but on the look out for any strange activities. Oh yeah i have a card to do this legally now. Haha. Cool.

VFirst time trying this one. I suffer from chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia. Being a bit of a skeptic, I went ahead and packed my one hitter 4 times. I am gonna sleep good tonight! Pain is at zero, I&#39;m definitely feeling the munchies, no anxiety and a goofy smile on my face. I&#39;m relatively clear headed but just feel fantastic. Cheers!

VThis is an excellent hybrid with very relaxing and euphoric effects.  Worked very well after work winding down without making me fall asleep. I could smell the ww with a hint of citrus.  Very pungent when squeezed. Taste a little hashy kinda burned my throat. I will try this strain again, although  with a different grower.

VPicked up a bit of this from a local despinsary thinking it wasn&#39;t going to be anything special, and holy crap was I wrong. Anyone who is familiar with white window will definitly recognize this right away. It comes on very strong and for me the feeling lasted quite awhile. This stain is great if you want to get to know your couch a bit better because you are going to be there for awhile.

VGreat strain. My personal grower. To start it smells delicious, citrus hints like grapefruit, great red hairs dancing around the snow caped mountains. A good smoke, burns real good. Buzz is I think a social high... you can just chill or it&#39;s good for a pre-sleep aid. Great beginner bud. Great strain for pain and nausea

Vthis strain is good and it smells good as well. It didn&#39;t make me talk until like an hour afterwards and when i was done with it i was talking a lot to random people. i was also sooo relaxed at the same time, and listening to music made it so much better.

VThe only strain I ever grew that came down with black mold. saved one plant. Decent smoke and wish I had not lost one plant. Fruity with a good body buzz. If you need something to relax with, this is a decent choice. I like better though. Papaya is a better strain and I&#39;ve never had a plant go bad on me.

VLast night, the power went out on our block. On a very hot night. So, my partner and I grabbed an eighth of Fruity Chronic, smoked a bunch, went to a park. I honestly didn&#39;t even feel all that high until we packed up into the car to drive home... 25 mph felt like 80! It was blowing my mind! And then I saw the beauty of Fruity Chronic... a nice, happy, calming strain that helps you feel good, does it&#39;s work in the background of your mind. I like it a lot.

VResenting picked up some of this from my local dispensary that I&#39;m a trimmer for. This stuff is my new favorite strain. I personally prefer indicas for there relaxation. Not only does Fruity Chronic Juice relaxing it&#39;s a very happy relaxed... But that&#39;s just me. This strain is very very leafy as a raw cannabis bud but relatively easy to trim

Vit&#39;s an excellent novelty strain...plenty of flavor and smell that&#39;s against the norm..an easy choice when you want to impress people that are new to high grade or learning to appreciate this wonderful plant...most certainly the &quot; burning bush&quot; that Moses burnt at MT Sinai was of this variety...
