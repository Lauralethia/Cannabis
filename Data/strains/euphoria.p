VAppearance and Smell:\u000aLeafy green in color with orange hairs; The buds are medium density; and the stench is loud but not crazy loud. A freshly grinded bud smells like lime and pine.\u000a\u000aOverall:\u000aThis is a great day time strain for me. &#39;Really fine wine. I can relax, make music, and not worry about getting too sleepy and wasting the day. Its a happy, focused, and motivating high. Dry eyes is really the only negative.

VI have been smoking a very short period of time compared to many on this site.  But that being said, here it goes:\u000a\u000aI think this definitely did what it was intended to do.  I am in a good state right now of being just happy.  Light high with no paranoia.  While this is an indica, I do not have couch lock that bad in comparison to other indicas I have tried.  Dry mouth is definitely a side affect.\u000a\u000aI do not have a huge catalog of strains that I have tried but I think this is a keeper for now, filed under &quot;light&quot; and &quot;happy.&quot;

VEuforia is my all-time favorite head tool.  If I&#39;m not there, it puts me there.  If I&#39;m not on, it puts me on.  Pack the pax in the morning and my mental assistant is at the ready.\u000aAs you&#39;d expect with a high percentage sativa dom, it&#39;s a silver bullet for stress and anxiety.  While I fortunately don&#39;t suffer from social anxiety, I can see where this would make someone the life of the party.  Better put the lampshades away.  Pretty slow ramping up... About 15-20 mins.  Once there, Euforia earns it&#39;s nom de guerre.  Be prepared to feel nearly ecstatically elevated for 2-3 hours, then let down gently with no negatives.  If that&#39;s not enough, it&#39;s an absolute pleasure to grow.  To me, that&#39;s Euforia.

VIt&#39;s got a slow, creeper come-on that washes over you pretty quickly within a few minutes. That can be somewhat intense, but is mostly tempered by overwhelming and near flawless elation!\u000a\u000aCompared to other strains, this does have an EXTRA amount of feel-good emotions. There&#39;s a lightness of mood and blissful contentedness with anything and everything.

Vi used a nice ceramic bowl with my buds at his trailer hit VERY nice, im not exactly to sure what the strain was actually called but according to reviews and photos im going with this one,GREAT for anxiety, I just needed to stop being so paranoid and worried and this shit helped ALOT later that day,same stuff, hot boxed inside my bro&#39;s cutlass, hit from my crappy wooden bowl(im thinking about getting a bubbler, but that would leave me mooching off other people&#39;s weed after i smoked all my marijuana) Definitely my FAVORITE so far

VFantastic strain. Smells herbal, looks typical with a little stickiness. The buzz is extremely smooth and energetic, for me, no big anxiety or paranoia. Very uplifting and happy. I believe it is a sativa dominant hybrid somewhere along the lines of 90/10 or 80/20. Its has just enough body buzz to feel good but wont put you down. Very satisfied with this strain.

It&#39;s like &quot;hakunna mattata&quot;, no worries. You&#39;ll feel such an awesone happiness that it works excellent when you feel depressed/blue. And it&#39;s the best strain for social gatherings, everybody will have and ear to ear smile while they&#39;re high on Euforia. \u000a

VA good one for daytime nerve pain, social settings, boredom, depression, sex, and for no other reason than to get high. The high from this strain is very similar to Super Skunk #1 that I grew a couple of decades ago. Long lasting high that is sensual, social, euphoric, and energetic. I believe this strain would be a good one for new smokers who want an uplifting, euphoric, social high without feeling nervous or paranoid. It seems to be energetic but relaxing at the same time. I like to use my one hitter continuously throughout the day to distract from chronic neuralgic pain and finish the day off in the evening with a good Indica, for sleep and appetite. Top shelf decent smoke in my opinion.

VThis review is for flower of the Emerald Phoenix version, &quot;Euphoric&quot;.   Overall, pretty disappointed. I opened the sealed package, and noted the scent was faint and smelled more like hay (sample jar at the dispensary smelled much better; sweet and heady). Smoked a bowl, and although I got a decent buzz, it was in no way particularly &quot;euphoric&quot; at all, and was somewhat short-lived. Also, true to dry weed, it was very harsh on my throat and the flavor was grassy. I give it 3 stars because I did get a buzz. Doubt I&#39;d purchase this batch again.

The pain and tension that I live with was simply gone- leaving only a light tingling sensation in some of the centers of pain.  The effect lasted about 3 hours.\u000a\u000aWhile this strain didn&#39;t make me want to hunt down lunch, once I got to the meal it tasted exceptionally delicious.\u000a\u000aOne thing I cannot stress enough: a little goes a long way if I want to be productive.

VThis strain reminds me of the old days listening to Rock during the summer nights. Taste profile ranges from Berry to Skunk with occasional undesirable leaf flavors. In essence a strain worth trying and possibly a strain worth using for hybridization but don&#39;t stress yourself to get at it.

VFelt relaxed throughout my whole body, definitely had me more talkative, and made me a bit sleepy. Pretty good chronic pain relief, uplifted my mood and melts away any stress you have, and will give you a major case of the munchies.

VA good one for daytime nerve pain, social settings, boredom, depression, sex, and for no other reason than to get high. The high from this strain is very similar to Super Skunk #1 that I grew a couple of decades ago. Long lasting high that is sensual, social, euphoric, and energetic. I believe this strain would be a good one for new smokers who want an uplifting, euphoric, social high without feeling nervous or paranoid. It seems to be energetic but relaxing at the same time. I like to use my one hitter continuously throughout the day to distract from chronic neuralgic pain and finish the day off in the evening with a good Indica, for sleep and appetite. Top shelf decent smoke in my opinion.

VSeems like it works..heh,. Medium sized very tight buds were what I got ( i saw a lot of reviews saying more airy or wispy buds but these were nice and thick and this is definitely Euforia (Euphoria) strain, a light/medium green color, nicely manicured and a lot of caked on crystal goodness however not sparkling to the naked eye. As you can maybe surmise  by the length of this wandering review, this strain is keeping me busy and balanced at the same time. It is nice to be euphorically high! Oh and lastly, I definitely concur with some of the other reviews in saying that this strain doesn&#39;t seem to have much if any of the properties that make you have the munchies. Definitely a little bit of creep on it as well so hit and quit it and see where you  be in 10 minutes time. I&#39;m out   Peace -try to be it!

VA bit disappointed with this strain&#39;s happiness and euphoric effects. you have to get BLAZED to get there. otherwise you&#39;ll just see some really cool visual effects that are great at first but aren&#39;t going to make you feel happy.\u000a\u000aThough, I did pick this up from a clinic. So perhaps my high was a bit more tame. \u000a\u000aThe high is pretty clean. Love the time slowing effects you can get sometimes.\u000a\u000aI would not recommend this strain for the price. for 10/g sure but this is generally sold as a top shelf strain.

VA Quad cross of Skunk, what a dream come true for this life long Skunk Amour, Respect, Reverance, and Medical useage.   I had my first taste of Euphoria in a Summer crop of 2016,  and I was blown away by the odour of the crop we were growing. The health and vigour very evident.  My first test is always to eat a live bud off a plant. Our grows are 100 % Organic.   Then we set about to trim 12 plants that top at. 15 feet.  It took two of us Six hours trimming by hand and scissors,  no electric trimmers here, by choice.
