VEven though my fairly hight tolerance, this makes me have a small one person rave party with a broken &#39;strobo&#39; light, dance to jamiroquai while cooking. The comedown feels quite like indica. The taste of my bud was strong and very rich, earthly. Probably smoked something like 7 revolver pipe shots.\u000a\u000a\u000adAnKeSt/dAnKeSt

VJust tried this strain last night after my caregiver recommended it. As with any new strain, I started off easy to get a feel for it and was impressed with the flavor and smoothness of the smoke. After a few minutes passed, I started to feel very relaxed and comfortable. I smoked a little more and really felt the effects kick in. I felt waves of euphoria rush over me. My hands and feet began to tingle and I realized that I was getting a much stronger effect with less medicine than I usually require. This is great as the pain in my back was gone for hours and it will be easier on my wallet as I get more &quot;bang for my buck&quot;. This is a strain that I&#39;m going to keep around as much as possible. It&#39;s called Wonder Woman for a reason.

VHave been a caregiver for almost six years and have been through a plethora of strains. Wonder Woman is the one I have come back to on multiple occasions. She yields like a beast, produces huge, frosty flowers, and can uptake a ridiculously strong nutrient regiment, whether Organic or Synthetic.\u000a\u000aShe has, for me, an ammonia base-smell followed by a sweet or floral taste. The base ammonia is my favorite. I only utilize a Volcano or Mighty vaporizer to intake my plants. Others have commented she has a very unique smell unlike that of anything else, especially when I blow vape near them :)\u000a\u000aTastes/flavors are subjective and there are so many variables between growing techniques.

VI got Wonder Woman as a recommendation from my friendly bud tender. I was told it was night time/sleepy/relaxation type indica. She wasn&#39;t kidding as Wonder Woman delivers a power punch. One bowl in and I was impressed with what a heavy hitter Wonder Woman is. Three or four bowls in and it was a chill fun night at Castle Guerrilla. Definitely wouldn&#39;t be a fun strain to try to function on during the day but a real chill couchlock weed. You can really tell newer generation hydro strains as they knock you on your ass. 8/10

VPicked up a gram of this strain in the for of Keif made by NAZM. I am very happy with the purchase. The Keif is a very clean golden color and smells outstanding. I like to use it as a bowl topper. Add a little on top of another indica and prepare to see stars. Add it to a bowl of sativa and you get a crazy high with the best of both worlds. Packaging said the Keif runs around 40 percent THC and the price is ten dollars less then what I normally pay for Keif or hash.

Vgrew this strain from seed and had up to 3 phenotypes, possibly 4 not sure since a few are still in flower ( been having some trouble with Nirvana&#39; s seed lately  and different phenotypes) the 1st grew medium height with nice long buds orange hairs and a sweet fruity smell. Cured and smoked a very mellow hit and a very nice calm mellow buzz yet it is a sativa dominant. I might advertise as a 50/50 hybrid. The verdict is still out on the others I will review if they are any different than this one. Enjoyable buzz....

VI love the Indica dominant version of this strain the best. But don&#39;t get me wrong, the Sativa dominant version is pretty awesome too, if you can keep up. It&#39;s like GSC but higher in a way. Soaring. Where the Indica strain is still soaring but in a more relaxed and sedated way. I guess GSC comes in 2 versions as well, and prefer the Indica side for general use. Or mix them up with other strains to get awesome effects. But all in all, pretty wonderful.

V This strain is ridiculous! It resembles a classic White Widow tingle. Only downside is that its&#39; not as clear minded of a euphoria as other strains like ATF and Napalm. However this is the shit you smoke right before going to work because it keeps you ripped for hours......&#128526; Or if you want to be happy and take your mind be off of things. *Not for beginners &#128521;

VWow, where to even start with this magnificent shatter, from Venom Extracts. It translucent, it&#39;s terpy AF and is a hug run shatter (they do full plant extract shatter that has a totally different look almost foggy, not here. Full plant/spectrum shatter is great but different but, ill save that for another time, lol.) Its hands down some of tge best shatter in a few months, well done! As for Wonder Woman, we can Tango in her lasso and I hope she never lets go! What a lady &#128525;&#128525;

VI purchased this strain today at my local dispensary in shatter form. Took it home, broke a piece off rolled in a ball and loaded onto my Puffco.\u000a\u000aUpon first hit, the description its it right on the head...a very earthy/diesel taste to it. I do enjoy it. Very different from the aromatic Jilly Bean shatter I have as well.\u000a\u000aAnyways, this is very much a clear headed high. This can be used during the day to provoke creativity or late night watching a movie. Beware, this while give you munchies.

VThe strain has a rich skunky scent reminiscent of ammonia with strong tones of jet fuel. The sweet berry-like flavor can drive your creativity and guarantee a pleasant euphoric feeling. Offering you a powerful and long lasting skunky buzz, this strain can really get you stoned and uplift your mood to greater heights. It is a great cure for stress and insomnia and can treat pain, anxiety and nausea too. True to its name, Wonder Woman has a femininely sweet flavor and leaves a slight berry aftertaste. Regular smokers will surely enjoy the rich and pungent fuel-like buzz to loosen up their nerves and relax after a tiring day.

VSeverely disappointed. Bought this strain in Tucson and it was one of the Huxton series &quot;Zen&quot; with a potency of 8. There was no smell or flavor palette what-so-ever. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve smoked weed with no flavor and I hope to go the rest of life without this kind of sad experience! I wouldn&#39;t believe anything that Huxton claims since one of the things they claim is that they hand trim... ummm well let&#39;s see unless their trim room consists of Edward Scissorhands and Wolverine because the buds are totally and completely trashed!! If you look at them under a Microscope it&#39;s clear that they have gone through a shredder/tumbler... ALL the trichomes have been slain and are totally shredded!!! Completely inferior product!!!
