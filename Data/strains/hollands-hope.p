V Dense dark green and purple buds. The buds were  extremely compact and packed with crystals. The smell was earthy and a bit grapey. The earthiness definitely carried through in the flavor, I also get some pungent fueliness. I really dig the flavor of this strain. The effects were very relaxing and stony. I found it relatively heady for an indica. Great for pain relief, insomnia, and stress relief. Store in a head stash if you can come across this lovely lady.

VVery good and long lasting high.  Makes you feel a mix of positive emotions; happy, giggly, uplifted.  Unfortunately comes with a huge appetite and dry mouth.  I tiny bit paranoid 2/10.  Thought someone was standing outside my sliding door!  LOL - good times!  I have pulled/sore muscles and bad arthritis in both hands.  I was somewhat pain free 5/10.  It was like someone turned a dimmer switch on my pain level even though I could still feel they were pulled.  Arthritis didn&#39;t begin to come back for 2+ hrs.  I never felt so good and happy.  Like I won the lottery and could finally sit back and relax and not worry so much about things anymore!  That&#39;s what they should call it, The Millionaire !!

VI loved it. 2 hits in and I can feel the relaxing effects starting to roll in... I feel happy, I&#39;m loving everything... and when I smoke later I don&#39;t have to smoke much to get back to the buzz I had going on earlier! I love it. I feel like it&#39;s a strain well worth it&#39;s price and it smokes so slowly that you&#39;re actually being frugal with it and its not even a concious choice. :) I&#39;m happy I decided to give it a try!

VMaybe it&#39;s because I was smoking it at the same time as a strain with a very heavy head-high, but I felt like Holland&#39;s Hope was a bit too mellow and light of a high for me. I would only use this when I just wanted to chill at home by myself.\u000a\u000aOne thing I will give this is that it was good for pain relief without getting much of a high feeling. If I wanted to suggest a strain to my mom, I might say this one.

VIn the right quantities, this strain is perfectly enjoyable. However, one time my wife loaded the vaporizer and put way too much in and it was one of the most jarring nights of my life. It would have probably been comical from someone else&#39;s point of view - I was terrified by what was happening on Downton Abbey and I pretty much had to huddle up and keep repeating &quot;Weed can&#39;t kill you. Weed can&#39;t kill you. Weed can&#39;t kill you. Lady Mary isn&#39;t a serial killer.&quot; And, in between whispering that to myself, I tried not to hyperventilate.\u000a\u000aSo if you have a high tolerance for THC (like my wife does), you can use this without a care, but if you have to be careful about how much you take, go easy on this one.

VWow. This is an incredible indica. The flavor is amazing, it smells like walking in a field of flowers. Both vaped and smoked, the great flowery taste and citrus accents still came through very clearly. The high? It&#39;s a really good couchlock, you&#39;ll be veeeery disconnected from reality, so get ready. However, as someone suffering from depression (and social anxiety) I find myself to be very calm and focused when active. It&#39;s strange because the couchlock is not present until you stop moving, so you can control it.\u000aAnyway, highly recommended strain. High in linalool with trace humulene and caryophyllene.

VMy friend got seeds two years running from Dutch Passion; two years running they went massive but did not bud. He grew them the second year because he thought the first year was caused by the very wet 2012 summer but 2013 was scorching and although they grew even bigger, they did not bud properly. He was forced to make bubble hash which was lovely but the quantity did not even save enough money to cover costs.\u000aKnowing that HH was an excellent strain a few years back and that he is a very experienced grower (20 years indoors and outdoors), this result shows to me that Dutch Passion company have not kept on top of their genetics in Europe, preferring to cash in on the name. IN FUTURE AVOID HOLLANDS HOPE FROM DUTCH PASSION COMPANY, you are risking your liberty for a plant that will not bud properly and giving money to a company that has sold out.\u000aNB. This comment only applies to Dutch Passion HH, I have no experience of other company&#39;s HH plants, they may be ok!\u000a\u000a#Hollands No Hope\u000a#Hollands Hopeless
