VI really love it when you get a strain that screams quality breeding, (or was one lucky accident that seems like quality breeding); well, this is one of those -for me anyhow. This particular batch of Alien Rift was grown by a medical dispensary in New Mexico and is a very pleasant strain. Although Rift is described as powerful (24% or higher), this particular batch had &#39;just&#39; 21.1% THC and .12% CBD. To me, it really feels more like an slightly-indica-dominant hybrid than an indica; it&#39;s really well-balanced, there&#39;s no couch lock (even though I&#39;m tired,) only pleasantness. I had been pretty stressed when I smoked it and that garbage got put aside within 2 minutes. It makes a good bedtime friend, but not because it&#39;s an herbal Ambien, but because it just makes things &#39;pretty good and fine in general, so if I&#39;m tired, I guess I&#39;ll sleep&#39; kinda feel. I&#39;m a graphic designer and did some after hours work, with good creativity and focus from it. Taste hit me kinda funny; I get how &quot;chemical&quot; could be described, but instead my brain let it taste like nutty, chocolate earth for some reason. Pretty tasty. The bag smell is pretty light and has kind of a spicy diesel odor, also pleasant, but I left my pipe on my nightstand all night, and it smelled like I had a party in the morning. Stress and anxiety melt away, but not the best for helping my neck (spine inflammation) pain issues. Gotta admit that almost took a star, because I like really assertive bag scents, and almost always want an indica-dom that treats my pain effectively, but oh well.

VVery good for physical pain/ discomfort. I probably won&#39;t buy this again because I get horrible paranoia and anxiety for the first 20 minutes after I smoke... but the narcotic-like body high and peaceful mind that follows is almost worth those first 20 minutes. Almost. For those of you who get the good parts (feel like you&#39;re being swaddled in a soft, warm blanket) without the bad stuff, I understand why you love this strain. If you&#39;re susceptible to anxiety and paranoia, maybe think twice before grabbing this one.

V&#128125; &#127815; &#128523; OMG This strain is out of this universe... so smooth, with a subtle grape aftertone. This is a relaxing indica dominate strain that\u2019s great for pain relief and for sleep. This smooth hitting strain is one I would definitely recommend as it\u2019s so damn delicious and hard hitting. \u000a\u000aThis is one flower I won\u2019t forget! \u000aMy Rating: 4.7 \u000a\u000a-BPop6

VI love Alien Rift! This is a great indica for sleeping, relaxing, and chillin. I feel very uplifted, relaxed, euphoric, emotional and tingly with this strain. It&#39;s a really heavy hitting indica. It&#39;s definitely going to make you feel &#39;stoned&#39;. I even felt a lot of a head and body high. The taste is also incredible, like grape.

VBest way to describe it is it makes me stupid, in a good way lol. My perception of time &amp; distance is all out of wack, it&#39;s a strong high that is very relaxing &amp; good for after work or before bed. I&#39;ve had super weird dreams since smoking this strain though. Also the munchies are real with this one. I obtained this strain at a dispensary in Alaska.

VWonderful lemon and somewhat diesel smell. Great taste quick onset with a slow come up and plateau. Worked wonders for my back pain in a dry herb vape. Long lasting high that comes in waves. Hesitation is key when re dosing. Plan on getting another one from dispensary A.S.A.P.

VAwesome strain! Picked this up at my local dispensary today on a whim, looking for a new indica to try. I smoked a pre-roll, and after 24 hours filled with panic attacks and near puking, I feel so relaxed FINALLY. This was exactly the strain I was looking for tonight, and I recommend it for anyone who is feeling very stressed, and needs to relax!
