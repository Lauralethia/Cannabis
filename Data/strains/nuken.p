VNuken is an incredible Canadian innovation. The smoke is unbelievably smooth and flavourful and has some delicious pine and citrus notes (not what you&#39;d expect from an indica!) Unlike other indicas, Nuken leaves me functional and focused rather than sleepy and lethargic. However, it definitely still delivers when it comes to pain relief and muscle relaxation. This is the perfect strain for hunkering down at night to get some work done or for just kicking back and watching a movie. This has quickly become my #1 strain and I&#39;m grateful that it&#39;s readily available out here on the west coast.

VAmazing body high from this Indica-dominant strain. Helps to combat chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety and/or stress. Is definitely an after work or night time strain. Very potent. A hybrid of a God Bud female and a Kish (double-crossed Shiskaberry) male.

VNuken is a true heavyweight among indica varieties. The nugs are dense and packed with trichomes. The buzz is strong, fast acting and long lasting. The smoke is thick and dank, but quite heavy on the lungs, leading to a fair amount of phlegmy coughing. The potent stone coupled with the heavy smoke makes this strain a one hit KO for many tokers. My friends and I, who are all experienced chronics, often found ourselves doing the typical sort of dumb stoner stuff like back when we were kids still developing a tolerance.

VPurple Nuken is a cross of purple kush and Nuken. This strain induces equal parts cerebral and body highs. A great strain to relax muscular aches. Although, it does not offer the couch lock effects of its parent purple kush.

VThird batch of Nuken now, and I&#39;m even more of a fan. The Kish in it gives you that distinct celery-soapy-cilantro-something fragrance &amp; taste as well as a distinct kind of buzz (I previously scored some Kish of God, which I imagine is very similar to Nuken)...Anyway, I highly (LOL) recommend you acquire some Nuken. A great indica buzz but couch lock isn&#39;t a certainty!\u000a\u000aHaving God Bud as the other parent gives Nuken a wonderful bud structure and the indica gooey texture we all love (Yeah, so does the Kish / Shishkaberry x2)...\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve sampled many strains in the past year and have re-confirmed my preference for indica and indica-dominant hybrids. Nuken is on the list of &quot;Will Always Buy Some&quot;.

VI suffer from P.T.S.D., panic attacks, major back and hip pain, and this strain Nuken definitely helps with it all. After smoking 1 nice sized cone, my back pain melts away, and my panic attacks stop within 1 minute of smoking the cone. I definitely recommend this strain to anyone that suffers from any of the same aliments as I do. Excellent flavour as well.

VA great Indica. The high is nice and level, definitely something you can smoke and still hang out and have conversation with friends or focus on a movie. Not too intense of a body high, and has a decent amount of cerebral effect too. Smell is very diesel-like and the taste is similar. Very relaxed, uplifted feel.

VThis review is for Blue Nuken, not otherwise listed on Leafly.  After a few vape hits, the night seems much stiller than it did, and I&#39;m feeling a bit bug eyed.  This is a subtle high, and I notice a subtler hum emanating from pretty much everything.  I sit down and realize the degree to which this strain relaxes you.  No drowsiness and little couch lock, but a very relaxed and stress free feeling just washes over you.  My only critique is that this could be less subtle and more pronounced, and I was left with a  headache the next morning.  Still, a very nice night time strain.

I can&#39;t help but giggle and have a smile on my face.  I vaporized this was the Pax 2 and it is very smooth.

VI&#39;ve tried my best to try as many strains I can. Nuken is my favorite strain of them all. I don&#39;t know what a Nuken is but I would&#39;ve called it Funky Cole Medina. I have some in my 30-day emergency kit. I try to only smoke it occasionally so I don&#39;t develop a tolerance for it. When I finally take it out of the safe, I immediately feel calm and happy in a way no other weed does. I also find it combats how irritating other people act when I have PMS. Try some, but preferably not from where I buy it. It sells very fast and only comes in every few months.

VBeatiful strain. Frosty appearance.  Amazing flavor, sweet floral vape that turns more herbal the longer its on your palate. A more hybrid group of effects. Functional happy high initially, morphing as the night goes on to very relaxing strain, medium couchlock, good sleep aid.  You can dose up with confidence without much fear of going overboard.  Oldschool strain with the complex taste of a single malt scotch .  Makes you really happy and has you coming back for that feeling over and over, like the first time you smoked. If you can find this, absolutely pick some up.  Time machine cannabis.  Like it used to be before you got all jaded about the world :)

VAmazing strain. Went to a dispensary with my buddies to make a purchase, smoke and then walk around downtown. I was looking for a strain for more pain relief since the last purchase I made did not help with my headache as well as euphoric effects. This was perfect since the dispensary had a hybrid variation so I could be able to walk around without getting tired, knowing from previous experiences that hybrids do not tend to tire me out. Hit one bowl from a bong and immediatley felt even more happier than I was at the time which I did not think was possible. My body gelt quite heavy for half an hour but still remained very awake and focused. High lasted a long time, so long I didn&#39;t even notice it come to an end. No complaints at all.

Not for running to the grocery store or visiting with the in-laws. Me like.\u000a\u000aUpdate (April 2016): Picked up a second batch. Nice, big, gnarly buds with that classic indica basenote. Yum, can&#39;t wait to test drive it!

VFrosty bright green, densely packed, and very pungent.  Aromas of tropical fruit and berries are strongly countered by petrochemical and earthy notes.  Vapour is smooth, fruity and very soothing.  Fast acting relaxation with a heavy body buzz.  Don&#39;t expect to do a housecleaning marathon after this one.  You&#39;ll just sit on the couch contemplating the ecosystem within the dust bunnies under the tv stand.

VThis Indica kicks the crap out of you, plastering you to your seat of choice(best to get comfy beforehand). However, you can still be sociable with friends etc but the body high it gives you does make moving around/ moving in general, a challenge. Would definitely try again.

VNuken was like a weaker version of Alaskan Thunder Fuck, it had all of the same properties in the high I experienced, however, they all seemed a bit toned back but extended in duration compared to the high ATF produced. I very much enjoyed it, I would recommend it to anyone that would like to deal with pain, relieve stress or listen to music as it makes music sound better and also will let you sit for hours undisturbed as I did. \u000a\u000a4/5, if Alaskan Thunder Fuck is an option it is better, if not Nuken is a great common alternative.

VNuken is my all time favourite! If you\u2019re looking for a beautiful mellow, pain and stress killing \u201clazy\u201d smoke - give it a try!! You won\u2019t regret it. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s warm and tingly throughout my body, like I\u2019m wearing a gently heated onesie.. I\u2019m just delightfully cozy. It melted away my severe chronic pain, the sciatic pain even, my stress and the insomnia too so now I\u2019m ready for bed! Pure BLISS. Sorry this review sucks I\u2019m kinda looped heh, it\u2019s a killer smoke though!! I get it whenever possible in shatter form, and I\u2019m always happy with my choice. I don\u2019t notice many side effects either, I don\u2019t get crazy dry mouth or dry eyes or anything and it\u2019s fairly smooth, very little coughing if any. Beeeeautiful.\u000a\u000a10/10 would smoke again, and again, and again...

VThis is a really nice high that carries with it a nice buzz that lasts longer than, for example, Skywalker Kush (which is very intense but not long lasting) or Blue Boy (which has a very heavy body high.) I smoked a bowl around 5 PM and was still buzzing at 8:30 PM. Not a bit munchies strain, either. Draws in with minimal burning sensation. The strain itself doesn&#39;t have a heavy scent at all. Minty overtones. A really nice strain. Give it a try!

VI literally just made an account to review this amazing strain. What.The.Actual.Fuck.\u000aThis weed is literally my perfect strain. I find that I start with a weird and unexpected head high for about 20 minutes. It helps if you smoke a lot of it too. Then, it\u2019s cool, relaxing, euphoric, and amazing and perfect in every way. Towards the end, a little hunger kicks in. And food tastes so amazing when you\u2019re smoking on this gorgeous, dense and kiefy bud, gets you high as fuck strain. Imma take a nap now
