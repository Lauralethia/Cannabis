High didn&#39;t last as long as I would prefer, but a very pleasant smoke overall. \u000a\u000aI found this strain great for daytime use, it didn&#39;t couchlock me and was great for socializing thoughout the day. \u000a\u000aI got a couple headaches smoking through an oz. but that&#39;s because I oversmoked.

VI got this strain as a free 1/8th with the purchase of the Ballpark x Grassroots hat. I was looking for a sativa that could keep me uplifted but not give me anxiety and I was told to go to Glass Slipper. I smoked a j of it, and I would give the flower a 4/5 review. This strain was more powerful than I thought, and gives me a pleasant, relaxed high. However I find that I am not as talkative as on other sativas and that I function a bit more slowly than normal. I feel really relaxed though and this is the kind of high that I was aiming for.

VVery energizing without being as anxiety producing as other sativas. Drops an insane amount of kief, even for a sativa, likely due to that Cinderella 99 in the lineage. I would recommend this to someone seeking a good sativa for focus, depression, creativity and mind openness, etc. Or, hell, have a video game marathon or a nice conversation. I recommend saving kief every other grinderfull or so for when you want an extra thc boost. This is one of my favorites.

VWas slightly disappointed. The flower was pretty enough and the smell was lovely however the effects were lacking. I didn&#39;t have any sort of mind change and whatever pain solving effects it may have had didn&#39;t work on me. Tried in a J and then a bowl and both times I didn&#39;t feel much of anything.

The strain definitely helps with my depression, however when I smoked this strain at night I noticed I started to feel some eyestrain as well as paranoia. This could easily be due to my anxiety and being a person that normally smokes only indicas at night.

VGlass Slipper is a superb cross of Cindy &#39;99 and The White.  The smoke is very thick in nature with a moderate expansion.  The initial high is very ocular and produces very saturated visual contrasts.  Beware: the effects of smoking on a full gram of this can be slightly fluttery and paranoia inducing.

A happy-go-lucky, carefree, calmness pervades your senses and consciousness as the White can be felt creeping in 45 minutes later, leaving you in a nice abiding glow for the duration of it&#39;s effects. A solid hybrid. However, its potent and of a short-duration. 4.75/5!

Halfway through smoking it I felt a smile start creeping at the corners of my face, and I also felt very giddy and giggly. It only gave me a very mild case of dry mouth. I would highly recommend this strain. The buds were extremely dense and delicious!

VHigh sneaks up on you, so be cautious of this if you are trying to be productive and stay productive, I find that a little too much, will give me couch lock. So Overall I would say that it is a manageable high, you will still be able to function and be social, while staying relaxed and calm at the same time.  I love the name, it explains it well, Because as I see it, The Glass Slipper = (explains the High you get)\u000aYou can feel beautiful, and social, even a little glamorous when your at the max, but if you &quot;overdo it&quot; I found myself feeling anxious (of the time),  and feeling a little fragile (on keeping myself together, in public) like I had to hurry home, out of the workplace, i.e.\u000aI hope this review was helpful to someone. :)

I have only ever tried top shelf strains and 2 hits and I was high. 2 hours later, I took a 3rd and I was done. strongest strain that I had the pleasure of trying! It was a little strong so I did keep some CBD around to smooth it out a little, but I am a bit more sensitive than others. Good flavor too!

VGlass Slipper is a superb cross of Cindy &#39;99 and The White.  The smoke is very thick in nature with a moderate expansion.  The initial high is very ocular and produces very saturated visual contrasts.  Beware: the effects of smoking on a full gram of this can be slightly fluttery and paranoia inducing.

VThis is one of my favorite daytime smokes; especially in the morning&#39;s. It makes me feel very creative and uplifted and a little bit giggly. The strain definitely helps with my depression, however when I smoked this strain at night I noticed I started to feel some eyestrain as well as paranoia. This could easily be due to my anxiety and being a person that normally smokes only indicas at night.

VCinderella 99 x The White makes for a sativa-dom hybrid. Could easily be mistaken for an indica-dom hybrid. Definite head buzz, but at 19% I feel it yields its true potential in the body creep. Taste matches smell, in that it&#39;s two parent plants are not super skunky. Almost similar to an OG, matches the taste with a fruity accent, mildy sweet and dry. Good Stuff! 4/5

VI am not the biggest fan of Glass Slipper, though it did leave me the first time with enough enjoyment to buy it a second time. Not a third time, however. Buds were odd in their appearance and lack of mass.  Effects were definitely those of a sativa, not an indica, though I did not find the cerebral or visual effects truly remarkable, as others have reported. Very good, but not great.

VI ate Love&#39;s Oven cookies from a local Denver dispensary, and I didn&#39;t expect too much of it. I have some experience with smoking the parent female plant, Cindy 99. I knew what ever happened would be Sativa dominant and that&#39;s exactly the experience I had with this strain. It was focused, uplifting, and very cerebral. Total euphoria and no paranoia. Excellent strain. I may like it better than White Widow, which is my go-to!

VI am not sure who is rating these strains but the batch I got of this strain was super weak. It is more of a strain for a high school cheerleader than a grown, mature adult. It does the job but not worth $15-$20 a gram and definitely not worth over a 4 rating. This is just my opinion but I feel this strain is for beginners.
