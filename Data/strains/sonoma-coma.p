VOne of the best sativas I&#39;ve ever had. The bud has a very pungent, citrusy odor and is very dense with lots of crystals. Has a very nice kick and taste to it, notes of citrus and evergreen come to mind.

VThe listing is incorrect, Sonoma Coma is a heavy INDICA bred in Sonoma California that leaves you scattered across your couch in a tingling, near-comatose state, not a light and energetic sativa.

VI picked up some amazing 79% Sonoma coma dab today. I agree with a few of the others, this strain made me alert, yet relaxed? oxymoron? ....well....Yes...This strain literally does both jobs. you get the best of both worlds, uplifting head high as expected from a pure sativa, yet, no pain in my hands or back and no anxiety or paranoia. The high cbd content of 2% ( at least it was in the dab I bought ) I think is what gives some others a more relaxed, couch lock. It actually made me very relaxed, yet productive. would definitely recommend!

VThe very tight and compact looking buds of Sonoma Coma resemble an indica and kind of reminds me of Master Kush (in apearance only). Flower grinds up almost yellow/bright green and the smell is pine. I enjoyed the uplifting effects as much as the come down, it&#39;s a great hybrid.

VVery nice effects for a Sativa dominant strain. It doesn&#39;t drain your energy but it also gives a complex head high.  A very nice combo high.

VPicked up an eighth of this from the local dispensary, and i honestly had never heard of Sonoma Coma before in my life, but the budtender said it was pretty good, so i decided to give it a shot. Now this coming off the bottom shelf for $8/gram, i wasnt expecting very much. The nugs were nice and fat and they had nice color. i packed myself a bowl and hit it for the first time, and it far exceeded my expectations!! Felt it creeping up on me after the first couple hits and wound up completely stoned soon after. The buzz is energetic and exciting; i actually smoked some before class and i felt perfectly focused and ready to take on the day. Its a really great strain for the price; im definitely going to pick up some more and i recomend it to anyone who has depression or fatigue, or anyone else who just hasnt tried it (:
