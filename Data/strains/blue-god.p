VIt&#39;s blue. It smells like blueberries. Taste the bud, it tastes like blueberries. Thick cloud on vape, a bit of a cough there too. But when I added  my bubbler piece,,, I tasted my mother&#39;s blueberry pie with  every toke. Best pain-free, spasm-free sleep I&#39;ve had in years. Good night pharma sleep aids! I should add that the cape is usually low odour but this made my room smell like hash immediately after vaping so even I noticed just going out and back in.

VA good friend of mine procured a bit of this bud for my wife and I and I have to say...he was spot on recommending this strain..  For starters, it is really great looking.  Quite frosty, with quite a few orange hairs running throughout the extremely fat bud structure.  The aroma is a bit on the sweet side with just a little touch of citrus.\u000aI loaded up the grinder and made quick work of rolling a nice joint.  Just like the smell indicated, the taste was sweet and not harsh much to the wife&#39;s delight.\u000aThe effects were a quick roundhouse to both our bodies.  After a few generous hits, I could feel it slowly roll from the top of my noggin until it numbed my whole body.  The wife even commented on how her toes were tingling after a few minutes.  \u000aSo far, we&#39;ve found our tastes lean more towards indicas than sativas (with a few exceptions...hello Strawberry Cough) and Blue God delivered exactly what we like in a strain...a mellow, chill body high.\u000aNo couch-lock but pretty damn close to the edge.  That said, we were easily able to carry on a somewhat lucid conversation and enjoyed a smooth long-lasting buzz and each other&#39;s company.  We definitely recommend grabbing this if you see it on the shelf.

VHas a very sweet smell, gets even sweeter when broken up. The buds are dense, and riddled with trichromes and it almost has a purple tint. As the first hit is inhaled, the sweet flavor lingers and gets a tad earthy (which isn&#39;t a bad thing). A fairly smooth smoke, just leaving a tickle in the chest after a big hit. Can almost immediately feel your ears getting hot, and head tingle, while enjoy enjoying a mellow warm &quot;melting&quot; slowly fall from head to toe. A nice indica hybrid in my opinion, though there is stronger ones out there. Just the right amount of heavy, enough to relax the muscles and still proceed with your day.

Perfect for soaking in the tub while listening to an instrumental soundtrack by Peter Gabriel. Excellent spatial hearing effect, I could sense certain sounds bouncing off of various surfaces around me. Fell asleep on the couch, hardly saw my show at all ...Zzzzz...went to bed and slept through the night.\u000a\u000aMy bag of this nice strain had medium sized, dense buds, light green with red hairs near the tip, nicely dusted  in trichomes.

VFirst impression is it\u2019s Euphoric smell of blueberry and delicate yet full trichromes. Beautiful dense and sparkly buds.\u000a\u000a I took 3 really big rips of this to start out. It just hit so nicely, and tasted so good. By the time I was letting out the third hit I knew I had made a good choice for my health this fine night, as I could feel my body start to relax. Peter Gabriel (as someone had suggested) was a spot on choice to listen to for this.\u000a\u000a*Good for anxiety\u000aI felt almost immediately that I could breathe easier, about the problems that life\u2019s been throwing at me lately. Slow deep wholesome breaths were as enjoyable as a cheesecake all to myself. \u000a\u000a*Sensory stimulation\u000aMy ears felt like they were standing up like a coyote, and I could turn them to any corner of the room. Not only could I hear all sorts of little sounds, I could feel the frequencies they were sending my way. I felt like I had sonar, it was so intense, I began to shut off all of my house lights because of this.\u000a\u000aThen, suddenly, because of my super sensing I heard a noise and ran up my stairs like a scardey cat. I panicked and couldn\u2019t unlock my door fast enough to get in!  I came into my room and schooched in bed with my wife. Once I closed my eyes, I could feel my body continue to relax, and then I felt weightless. \u000a\u000aPros: Anxiety relief, Great pain relief/body numbness \u000a*Warning : increases fear of ghosts - lol

Vwow. one of the best indicas i have ever tried, possibly de-throning bubba kush as my new all time favourite sleep strain. not only will it knock you out, but it will knock you out with a smile on your face, and in a great mood. extremely thick vapour, harsh, but thats a very small price to pay for such potency. relaxes your body AND mind enough to pass out right away, but unlike many other late night sleep strains (GDP ) you will feel happy to just chill out and enjoy the late hours for a little bit first, without feeling sluggish and lethargic. i just did two bowls on my arizer tower, which is alot for me, but man oh man do i feel perfect. goodnight

Although it is very high quality weed not so high in Thc levels, I had to smoke about 2 decent joints to get on a good level. Besides that I think it&#39;s a great strain and would prefer it over a basic strain any day.

The high descends upon you like a San Francisco fog, and before you know it you&#39;ll be relaxed, happy, and feeling like you&#39;re moving through a vat full of Jell-O shots. Definitely a nighttime wind-down indica. It&#39;s not a strain that allows me to get anything done, unless the only things on my to do list are listen to Dire Straits records and lay in a hammock. Run, don&#39;t walk, to get yourself some of this fire bud.

VBlue god is my boyfriend and I&#39;s favorite. It&#39;s great for insomnia and anxiety. It&#39;s a very calming strain. It is definitely a more relaxing bud rather than an uplifting high, so if you want more energy, this might not be the bud for you, but it&#39;s great if you struggle with insomnia or anxiety or stress. Perfect for a relaxing evening while staying home.

VA heavy high that washes right over you. Heavy tingles and euphoria follow, until the rush calms down and you relax into a dreamy state. I consumed this strain via a lovely little glass vaporizer with a CO2 melt of the strain. The taste was a spectacular sweet menthol berry taste, and was exhaled very easily. This is now my #1 nighttime strain, to be used an hour before you turn into your sheets. Trust me, the sleep will be perfect.

A sweet/sour blueberry taste.  This is a strong indica and produces a strong couch-lock stone. Highly recommended if you suffer from insomnia, and great for those suffering from pain. **WARNING** Do not over-medicate unless you plan on passing out!! This is a very strong strain!!

VThe first half o of Blue God I got looked so much like a Sativa hybrid that my dispensary guy, who was in training for his sake, charged me the wrong price for it. The nuggets are very light in color with an almost white widow esque layer of trichomes. The smell was amazing! It didn&#39;t have the odd skunk or piss-like smell some other strains have and left a very pleasing scent on your nose. It reminded me of blueberry crossed pineapple express. The high is amazing! The sativa genetics are minimal enough to keep away panic attacks but keep you creative and focused while the indica just wraps your entire being in a warm jacket and eases any mental or physical stresses and pains.\u000a\u000aDon&#39;t get greedy with this strain, another customer will definitely want and need this for themselves as well.

VFirst impression is it\u2019s Euphoric smell of blueberry and delicate yet full trichromes. Beautiful dense and sparkly buds.\u000a\u000a I took 3 really big rips of this to start out. It just hit so nicely, and tasted so good. By the time I was letting out the third hit I knew I had made a good choice for my health this fine night, as I could feel my body start to relax. Peter Gabriel (as someone had suggested) was a spot on choice to listen to for this.\u000a\u000a*Good for anxiety\u000aI felt almost immediately that I could breathe easier, about the problems that life\u2019s been throwing at me lately. Slow deep wholesome breaths were as enjoyable as a cheesecake all to myself. \u000a\u000a*Sensory stimulation\u000aMy ears felt like they were standing up like a coyote, and I could turn them to any corner of the room. Not only could I hear all sorts of little sounds, I could feel the frequencies they were sending my way. I felt like I had sonar, it was so intense, I began to shut off all of my house lights because of this.\u000a\u000aThen, suddenly, because of my super sensing I heard a noise and ran up my stairs like a scardey cat. I panicked and couldn\u2019t unlock my door fast enough to get in!  I came into my room and schooched in bed with my wife. Once I closed my eyes, I could feel my body continue to relax, and then I felt weightless. \u000a\u000aPros: Anxiety relief, Great pain relief/body numbness \u000a*Warning : increases fear of ghosts - lol
