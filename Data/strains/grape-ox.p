VLooks: Darker color than I usually like from concentrates, but given the genetics and how purple the flowers were I guess it&#39;s to be expected. Thick sugary goo consistency and was easy to get dabs off the gram. Good clarity as well.\u000aSmell: Spicy, sandalwood, grapes, berries, musky coffee smell and sweet almost grassy smell. Very unique. \u000aTaste: Low temp tastes like grape ape and a subtle coffee flavor a lot more of the sweet linalool terps I hunt for. High temp was more like a bubba taste but sweeter and more complex and was still smooth despite the size and heat. Clean meds forsure.\u000aHigh: Excellent body high and the genetics can&#39;t be beat for indicas. I have a deep love for Blue Moonshine and it is my all time favorite, mix that with Bubba kush, and grape ape.... It is clear headed and deeply narcotic and great for my nausea. Both the flowers and extracts are great from rare dankness seeds, def pick up when you see it. Spread some love today, peace.\u000a

VThe fruity taste was very refreshing. It had a very strong grape aftertaste as the name would suggest. I had me couch locked almost instantly, and give me a mellow cerebral high. I recommend this strain to anyone looking for help sleeping or simply relaxing.\u000a

VVery relaxing, takes away my anxiety and stress and therefore, my disability. I am able to focus without any pain or hindrance. This is a great medicinal strain.\u000aOne of those first-stage-Herbalizer-auto-shut-off strains, where I don&#39;t need the second stage until way after the Herbie has decided to shut off after 15 minutes. Some strains don&#39;t last five minutes on stage one.\u000aMain effect: r e l a x i n g
