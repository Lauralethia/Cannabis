VSo many crystals! You immediately see why this strain is named Snow White upon first glance. Nice mellow head high and quite a powerful body high. I recommend this strain if you have trouble sleeping or for minor pain. Leaves a nice tingly sensation all through the body.

VNice, dense and crystally nugs. Looks pale due to the crystals but the leaves are dark in colour. When you break a nug the amount of crystals is unreal. Dark orange hairs are pop up occasionally. The smell is sweet, earthy, skunky with slight citrus/fruit. Tastes like (vaped in a solo) earthy. That&#39;s all I get really, maybe I slight menthol/Citrus flavour. Love the taste. The early stages take around 60secs+ to come on. But it&#39;s nice relaxed feeling. Within 2-3mins and the effect are noticeably cerebral. Very nice weed. Strong top shelf stuff in my opinion. I have 2 slipped discs and I&#39;m waiting on surgery. I stopped taking stong opioids and took up weed. This is perfect. Helps forget the pain and walk around more. Which is good for recovery. Very nice weed. Not for the novice but that didn&#39;t stop me when I was 18 so fuck it.

VI smoked this strain in amsterdam it looked great real frosty and sticky. I smoked just one spliff of this with a friend and i haven&#39;t been that high in months. And that with one spliff, the only negative side was that i couldn&#180;t follow any conversation. but still it was great going back for that one for sure.

VFor Hybrid Lovers, another 5 Star Med!! The smell, taste and feel make for a enjoyable and productive, relaxation. Probably not a Indica lovers knockout punch, or a Sativa lovers better housecleaning performance. But for those like me who prefer a happy, mood elevation with a great body buzz, it ranks with the top F-1&#39;s, and my tolerance won&#39;t lie!

VI&#39;m more of a Sativa myself, but a Hybrid doesn&#39;t hurt. Surprisingly it became one of my top favorites. I could see why it got the name &#39;Snow White&#39;, it literally looks like it&#39;s sprinkled. Great to have a small get together one night with friends or doing something easy for the night/day.

VOverall effect is pretty good, this is probably what you are looking for if you are smoking weed. The reason I don&#39;t give this strain 5 stars is because of the taste and smell. Of course this might be different for you, but I don&#39;t like the muddy, cheap taste and smell. However, the feeling it gives you overshadows this pretty good

And I get in and I forget the 3 and a half joints I rolled in her apartment, so I run back up and realize I locked myself out. I was so calm and relaxed though that I just got in the Lyft and left anyways to go meet my sister. Weirdest conversations ever w the driver and I\u2019m so high rn.

VOne of the strongest indicas i&#39;ve ever had. For how indica dominant it is supposed to be I find it has a very pleasant amount of euphoria, just as much as its white widow parent. One of the greatest strains to enjoy after a hard days work, it will rest your weary muscles and put a smile on your face. Word of warning in how potent it is though.
