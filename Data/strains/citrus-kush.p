VHands down best tasting flower I&#39;ve ever smoked, such a pleasant, smooth, sweet and savory profile. The high is great, nice bright indica effects but not a daywrecker. Picked it up at Lightshade--world-class harvest, with frosty and bright green buds interlaced with sierra colored hairs. Sample data shows 29.16% THCA, I kid you not. Great for mixing with sativas. I&#39;m a big fan of this strain and recommend it highly.

VThis was just a lucky guess on my part.  I had a couple specific strains I was looking for on a visit to Oasis Cannabis Superstore.  After getting over the initial shock of their vast...and I do mean vast collection, I was surprised to find they were out of Strawberry Cough and Purple Urkle.  I knew I could find them elsewhere, so I began looking for anything that caught my eye.  I know the wife tends to lean towards the sweeter/lighter tastes and Cirtus Kush looked promising.  \u000a We actually blazed through some Blueberry, GDP and Presidential Kush (thanks Steve) before we tried it out.  Well, last night we broke out the citrus kush and both loved the taste, the aroma and the effects.  Both were very light but spot on leaning towards the sweet side of strains we&#39;ve smoked.  While not exactly a citrus blast we could both see where people would describe the taste as such.  We took some pretty decent rips and no coughing.  The onset of the effects were fairly quick and lasted almost 2 hours.  Very cerebral at first and then rolled into a relaxing body buzz.  To top it all off, when we both laid our heads on the pillow it took only seconds to drift off into a great, full night&#39;s sleep.   Citrus Kush moved right up onto the top shelf of our stash.

Vthis stain is one of my favorites, i can easily sustain an hour high from just a one-hitter. it is very potent and its smell is very distinct and pleasant. this one will get you stoned, and often times i cant get up after a session with citrus kush. knocks you on your ass
