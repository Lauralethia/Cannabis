Vat first i was skeptical because it was brittle for me and smelled like tea. so i wasn&#39;t expecting much. but boy was i wrong. i thought it would have more sedative affects but it was a very energetic, relaxing high! Took away my upper back pain. i am very hungry and tingly. would definitely recommend.

VGreat smoke to start the day! Kushage is a bit of a harsher smoke with nice uplifting and creative effects. This strains gives you a nice buzz with a pickup and go that won&#39;t leave you tired half way through the day.

VA great strain to have in your medical arsenal for combating pain.  Kushage oils my creaky, arthritic joints!  It also helps ease muscle pain.
