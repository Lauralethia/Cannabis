VAs a medical patient with PTSD, this strain is a godsend. I picked up a cartridge of it, it has a very citrus-like taste to it. \u000a\u000aThis is a review of Interra Oils Pure cartridge\u000a\u000aWithin a minute I could feel it calming me down, and putting my head in a relaxed state. This strain is more on the medical side, as it has relatively higher amounts of CBD (pain relief) and CBG (wonderful for glaucoma, insomnia, anxiety). Don&#39;t let the THC level fool you, it&#39;s strong enough to get one lifted, but not overwhelmingly so. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s probably the best go-to strain for me right now, since it is the most medically beneficial strain for PTSD. Calms the mind, calms the body. Excellent relaxation. Great for &quot;shutting the brain off&quot; when it is in overdrive and close to a fight-or-flight trigger response. Allows the mind to shift gears and enjoy life.\u000a\u000aThere are  other strains which I enjoy for PTSD, these are -- God&#39;s Gift (it&#39;s all in the name), Granddaddy Purple, Master Kush...\u000a\u000a...and for daytime where more focus is needed, Blue Dream and Pineapple Express are good sativa-dominants that possess these qualities. \u000a\u000aOG Ringo...I am impressed. First time trying it, and I think I just found my new favorite strain.\u000a\u000a#ptsd #medicine

VI don&#39;t know that it was anything to write home about really, since I liked the other weed I bought at the same time better, but whatever. It was like some commercial BC bud back in the day to me, which was worth the money, but just not stellar or really tasty.

VMy personal favorite strain. qualities of sativa but is Indica dominant. Only other strain that would compare imo would be great white shark though I much prefer OG Ringo. The high is intensely euphoric while also being a coach melter. 11/10 would recommend!

VOG Ringo is what makes OG Kush a connoisseur\u2019s choice. The first hit is an earthy, musty flavor with an aftertaste of lemon. Be warned, the instant kick delivered can catch even the hardiest of smokers off guard. Expecte euphoric effects with some visuals and a high that lasts anything up to three hours.
