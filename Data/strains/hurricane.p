VI got some Hurricane from my dispensary but it was labeled as an indica....I didn&#39;t do my research here so when I medicated I was greeted with a horrible jitteriness and inklings of anxiety as I am prone to get from vaping this dosage of a sativa. I went back to it at about 25% of my first dose and this gave me a nice mental acuity and focus to knock out a ton of errands and chores. Not the biggest fan of the flavor, however, so Hurricane is probably not a variety I will return to.

VHurricane is my daily go-to source for anxiety and stress relief.  I first tried it in flower form, but now I have switched to concentrates.  Thank you NETA for continuing to offer this medicine to us.  Big shout out to all the friendly folks at NETA.  If you haven&#39;t tried Hurricane and you see it somewhere it&#39;s worth giving a shot, especially if you enjoy being mellow.  Cheers!

VSolid daytime strain with pretty purple buds. The high is a bit slow/creeper style but builds to a heavy cerebral effect with some trailers/visuals. The body effects are lighter, but general pain and muscle tension is reduced. More mellow than euphoric, but very much an UP high with fun body tingles.

VThis is the first strain I vaped after a long month of extreme anxiety, depression and general lack of liveliness. Boy what a good start it was. Nothing too wild but really perfect for just feeling positive about things. Everything feels quite worth doing actually and I can focus pretty well, more specifically prioritizing what is most important. No memorable smell or taste but the Sativa-dominant balance is incredible. Yay. Thanks NETA. 8/10\u000a\u000a-Jake

VI suffer from anxiety and said anxiety causes me stress and depression. I have tried a lot of strains before and they all at least in a small amount amplify my anxiety. This does not. I can normaly only take a very small hit so the anxiety doesnt overwhelm me. With this i can take a full milkshot and everything is just better. Its hard to describe but i tend to obsess over a issue until it is resolved. With this i just accepted things for what they are at the moment and i had the motivation to do things about it and do other stuff. This is an amazing strain if you have anxiety. I feel exactly how i feel when i havent smoked but things feel so much easier and better. 10/10 only strain ive found that helps

VNever heard of Hurricane before but this is a good active, cerebral high. It&#39;s parent is LA Affie, which is surprising because I don&#39;t see the resemblance. It has a spicy sweet, herbal exhale and can leave a lingering tingle in your nostrils. This strain does lean a bit heavily on the sativa side for me but I don&#39;t mind. Overall good strain for anytime of the day.

VMy dispensary sells this as a hybrid. The buds are nicely frosty and have purple leaves. The aroma is sweetly floral with spicy undertones, and the taste is like roasted sweet peppers. This is a good daytime strain because it gives me a nice indica body relaxation to quell my anxiety and nausea but keeps me alert for running errands; I prefer something more energetic and creative for work.

VSold as an indica at my dispensary, definitely acts like one. Great for day time pain relief, although this strain does produce a strong body sensation it won&#39;t put you to sleep. I live with chronic pain and have found Hurricane to be reliable medicine even in lower concentrates of active content. The sativa effects do come through quite strongly (and quickly, probably leading to its name) sometimes being very cerebral and racy, but the indica qualities overpower them for me. Overall great daytime meds! If you need help with sleep, pick up a different indica for bedtime.
