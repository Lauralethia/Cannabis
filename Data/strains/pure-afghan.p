VOne of the top 3 strains I have ever smoked in my years of being a cannabis consumer. Incredible effects take immediate action relieving the pain and stress from the day. Without a question at practically a 100% indica, this is very much either a lazy rainy day or a night time strain. Made the mistake of wake and baking with this stuff and I just loathed the housework as I did it cause all I wanted to do was just sit down and watch Roseanne re-runs. Very potent, very tasty, very effective.

VI suffer from crippling depression and I&#39;ve been pretty bad for the last week or so. I smoked a bowl of this last night for the first time and then was the only strain (out of the 5 I have on hand) that was able to lift me up out of my fog. I was able to look at things objectively and have some self reflection. And I FINALLY feel like a human being again. This is wonderful stuff. I can&#39;t praise it enough

VIncredible strain! Very nice smell upon opening the bag. Smoked out of a bong - sweet, earthy aroma | typical indica effects (sleepy, relaxed) 10-15 mins. after smoking a nice warm feeling came over me, almost like a cozy blanket. Half an hour later I was asleep haha. Slept like baby! One of my favourite strains atm :)

VThe very first pure indica strain I have ever had, and to this day one of my favorite strains. Extremely heavy body high that gives you the pressure behind the eyes feeling on that first hit. I have had both the flower and concentrate forms, and I like both of them equally. Taking a dab of this stuff is super sedative and pain-relieving. Cannot focus well with it at all. Perfect for a relaxing night listening to music. Pine tree taste of this strain is phenomenal, as well. Smells like fresh pine tree sap....Delicious!

VI love this strain, never tried it and recently found some and it is amazing. The particular grower I had grew the strain to perfection. It is sticky with trichromes that are coating the buds. It smokes incredible not harsh at all with a great flush, as well as being grown to its full potential. The high is thought provoking, relaxing, and great for medicine! The taste and smell are great to with a pungent aroma of sweetness!

VMy first cannabis that I actually knew the name of the strain. Indica and well pure one for that matter. Was there long before anyone knew. Makes you very relaxed, you start to enjoy music a lot, reading is always good idea when smoking afghan. After 30 min you will be thinking about things you could eat. The whole show ends on the sofa.\u000a\u000aBy doing some little work, hobby or thinking then you will have all this nice creative ideas, feeling of enjoyment. Learning to do something new with afghan will definitely keep you interested in this strain.
