Vwhat great bud should be. this strain is just fantastic day or night. busy day or just restless and needing a nap this does wonders for both. \u000a\u000a1st impression. literally caked with crystal all over this shimmers. nice sweet smell to add to the great look.\u000a\u000asmoking out of a bing and a cape both prove to be equally smooth almost to airy definitely not a deep smoke. but hit in a instant and leaves a slight giggle and headstrong feeling before settling down and weighing in on the eyes.\u000a\u000aover all wish I had got more then a half oz as this could easily be in a top strain position for myself as I feel happy  as ever and carefree but still deeply medicated.
