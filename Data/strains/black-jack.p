VThis has quickly become my favorite strain. I find I can either relax or be active with this. First you get that relaxing, sedative vibe that an indica gives you, but it doesn&#39;t give you couch lock. After that I start getting kind of...jittery, or like I want to move, but without feeling anxious. So I could either relax and watch some tv or go on a trip and clean the house. It&#39;s the only strain I&#39;ve tried that makes both it&#39;s indica and sativa side of its genetics present in such a balanced way. This will be my daytime go to from now on. Thanks Blackjack!!

VFound another one!!! Black Jack is a one or two hit wonder. The flower is crisp, and glistening with tricomes that cover every centimeter of the buds. I&#39;ve experienced consistent elevations with BlackJack, and I&#39;ll make it a regular in my Sativa Dom cycle.

VI picked up this strain at a dispensary a few days ago, and it has become one of my all time favorites! I smoke mainly for anxiety and this indica dominant hybrid does the job in relieving anxiety. This strain gives me a very nice, calm, mellow high, it&#39;s not going to turn you into a zombie, you&#39;ll be very relaxed but still very active. The high from this strain is very chill and you won&#39;t feel panicked or paranoid at all. I also recommend this to people with eating disorders or people going through chemo since it gives you a heavy case of the munchies. If you see this strain at a dispensary, definitely pick it up, you will not regret your purchase! 5/5!

VThis was the first bud I ever smoked.  I never knew what it was called so I&#39;ve been searching for a long time.  Went to the dispensary and the bud tender recommended it.  I smelled it and got a half chub.  lol  Smells very pungent with a mixture of citrus (grapefruit?), skunk and tobacco.  Kind of spicy too.  The unique smell is what made me fall in love.  Tastes amazing, citrusy and peppery.  Awesome high that lasts for a while.  Smoked half a bowl and was feeling cloudy in my head and lightweighted throughout my body.  Made me want to listen to some music and fat kid dance while I cooked.  You can still focus, but it might take a while to do stuff.  Glad that one of my favorites finally has a name!

VI love this strain! I&#39;ve been wanting to try this for a while now and I finally came across some the other day.  This Jack hybrid is a perfect pairing of sativa and indica.  It has that classic Jack Herer smell with a slightly sweeter taste to it.  This strain makes me feel very euphoric and relaxed but focused at the same time, no couch lock here.  Black Jack is ideal for daytime use or whenever you have tasks that need to be done.  Along with being a great stress reducer and migraine reliever, I&#39;m noticing some appetite stimulation.  Def pick this strain up if you come across it.

VA good friend and fellow patient of mine brought this over to my place the other day to try and I was pleasantly surprised. The buds were VERY small and SUPER dense but they were light green and really frosty so I gave it a chance! The high was surprisingly long-lasting and onset fairly quickly. It was heady and happy with a slight body high. I would say this strain is good medicinally for Fatigue, Stress, and Nausea. 3/5

VExcellent, well balanced  strain.  Smells of rich Frankincense and other pine/earth tones, giving it a wonderful overall character.  Smoke is smooth, effects are instant and mellow.  The heavy feeling of Black Domina comes in waves but the Jack does a great job of neutralizing the relaxing effect.  No anxiety or paranoia.  Definitely a new favorite of mine.

Vwhat a combination! Jack Herer &amp; Black Domina. I love any strain that has Black Domina as a parent, but this one is particular is an awesome mix. It&#39;s like the best of both worlds.\u000aTaste 3/5 \u000aI&#39;ve read a lot of reviews on this strain before trying it &amp; I noticed a lot of people mentioning the unique flavor.  Maybe my taste buds are retarded, but I don&#39;t see what the big deal is. I dab so I&#39;ve even tried dabbing @ lower temperature, still nothing.\u000aBuzz 4/5\u000aGreat for waking &amp; baking, over indulging  doesn&#39;t lead to couch lock. I got the munchies and my eyes are dry. \u000a\u000aOverall this strains definitely worth a try, it&#39;s a nicely balanced hybrid.

The effects of the Jack usually hits me first having me feel awake! Then after 10/15 minutes of chillen BOOM Black Domina kicks in.

VWith it&#39;s sweet earthy essence, Black Jack brings focus to the scatterbrained, but be warned, you can get easily lost in this long-lasting high that cones down slow &amp; easy leaving you sleepy if you&#39;re not actively engaging an activity.  Not going to knock you on your ass but pretty good body high, with clear thoughts, good for studying, designing, or other mentally heavy activities that need your attention...tight sticky nugs too

VRather fast come on. For being a Jack hybrid, it\u2019s well blended. Jack\u2019s familiar clear, wide-eyed vision and uplifting euphoria are there in spades. But the full body feel is thicker, more weighty -not heavy. There\u2019s more of a physical substance to the high than you normally get with Jack. It\u2019s nice and welcome. The head space is also much more gone, which is an improvement for those who feel Jack is a little too clear minded. Combined, everything is extremely in-the-moment, stoned out/dissociative, just absorb whatever\u2019s going on around you. It\u2019s extremely similar to a psychedelic headstate. Very creatively tuned, everything just looks better. Very narrow depth of field makes it so you kind of passively concentrate on things. It\u2019s near impossible to really focus on anything. Even while writing, my mind is drifting constantly like on ocean waves. I can just barely keep the ship on course, but boy does it swing me around. So, not a productive high - save for R&amp;R, hikes, and chill time. Music is wicked groovy, hits a really satisfying note that can\u2019t help but move you. Again, the spacey stoniness lends to getting tranced out in music. Watching things is...ok. There\u2019s not the emotional connection you can get from so many others. 7 out of 10.

VBlack Jack was the first bud that I brought home for myself when I became a patient. At first, it was the only strain that I had smoked that gave me the right amount of high,  and it was definitely one of the more potent strains that I had.  If you are just starting out,  and you&#39;re not a fan of the harsh smoke, taking just a slow, and mild hit of this might get you to where you want to be. I recall feeling a buzz in my head, tingling in my spine and lower back, and if I had enough my mouth would get dry.  I would definitely use the strain for back pain.

VI ravaged a bargain box at a local dispensary and discovered a 1/2 oz of this strain going for $110.  I had also recently purchased a rosin press and so far pressed about ~6 grams and yield was around 5%...haha...not so great but my first time. The rosin produced had a very floral smell and the high was very cerebral and mellow. Definitely a long lasting, steady high with a heavy releasing of euphoria.

VRather fast come on. For being a Jack hybrid, it\u2019s well blended. Jack\u2019s familiar clear, wide-eyed vision and uplifting euphoria are there in spades. But the full body feel is thicker, more weighty -not heavy. There\u2019s more of a physical substance to the high than you normally get with Jack. It\u2019s nice and welcome. The head space is also much more gone, which is an improvement for those who feel Jack is a little too clear minded. Combined, everything is extremely in-the-moment, stoned out/dissociative, just absorb whatever\u2019s going on around you. It\u2019s extremely similar to a psychedelic headstate. Very creatively tuned, everything just looks better. Very narrow depth of field makes it so you kind of passively concentrate on things. It\u2019s near impossible to really focus on anything. Even while writing, my mind is drifting constantly like on ocean waves. I can just barely keep the ship on course, but boy does it swing me around. So, not a productive high - save for R&amp;R, hikes, and chill time. Music is wicked groovy, hits a really satisfying note that can\u2019t help but move you. Again, the spacey stoniness lends to getting tranced out in music. Watching things is...ok. There\u2019s not the emotional connection you can get from so many others. 7 out of 10.

Just an all around amazing bud, blackjack combines 2 heavy strains Black Domina a heavy heavy indica mixed with the extreme sativa Jack Herer  crossing these two together is going to produce very dense buds wrapped in light orange hairs and frosted all over, she produces a very pungent type smell, almost like a straight haze with a touch of pungent cheese, with the combo of a straight indica and a straight sativa expect this strain to be a 50/50 with heavy sedating body effects mixed with a great energetic cerebral buzz great for bouts of depression, stress, headaches and pains

VThis strain is an amazing hybrid with the parents being Black and Jack Herer  she&#39;s smells and tastes of earth woods and pine as well as a sweet lemon citrus primary on smell before smoking. With her lime green sticky buds she draws you in with her beauty and hits you heavy enough to take care of pain and anxiety while not giving you that couch lock effect. It&#39;s a perfect balance of indica and sativa in my opinion. Check out more of my reviews on YouTube Twitter Weedmaps and Instagram

VAmazing stress relief, with the first drag you feel that thc hug in your upper abdomen where stress is stored. echo effect is mildly felt as well. tastes and smokes great, and has a very caramel covered grape like appearance

VThis strain is an amazing hybrid with the parents being Black and Jack Herer  she&#39;s smells and tastes of earth woods and pine as well as a sweet lemon citrus primary on smell before smoking. With her lime green sticky buds she draws you in with her beauty and hits you heavy enough to take care of pain and anxiety while not giving you that couch lock effect. It&#39;s a perfect balance of indica and sativa in my opinion. Check out more of my reviews on YouTube Twitter Weedmaps and Instagram

VBeing a slightly pricey &quot;Tier 1&quot; strain from the dispensary, I decided that my last bowl from my small stash of Black Jack would be well spend. I loaded up the &quot;History of the Eagles&quot; on Netflix and loaded up my Pax 2 with the green, crystally bud I had ground up. Black Jack carries a light, grassy aroma that is hardly noticeably, and by paying attention, you can hints of sweet pine in the flavor. After 10 hits or so I started playing my movie. Live concert footage dazzled before my eyes as the high slowly creeps over my body. Black Jack offers the best of a calming indica buzz, without being totally sleep-inducing. The head high creeps on a little after the body-high. By the time you realize it has hit you, you will be on another planet. I slow cooked the bowl, keeping it on the low heat levels as long as possible. This allowed the high to come on gently at first, but I began to soar as I sipped on. Hanging out with Glenn Fry and Don Henley feels amazing, and listening to them and the rest of the Eagles makes for an amazing night. Thanks Black Jack, take it easy.

VThis is the strain that got me started smoking. I slowly quit my zoloft thanks to it, and my symptoms of depression and anxiety have been suppressed. Going back to it still gives me the same effect: an incredible indica high that sent me into a state of euphoria that&#39;s barely just the right amount to not cause a total couchlock. Absolutely recommended for anyone else who suffers from depression, especially first timers.

Bunched up the other lil mo&#39;fuckas down below and pointed them towards the light. Now got what looks like 3 main colas liftin up. Beautiful to behold. \u000a\u000aThe leaves are green af. No blemishes at all. Nuted lightly, they responded well. Healthy dose of fresh air, regulated temps in soil. Carbon filtered that bitch ass mofo tent. \u000a\u000aCurrently puffin on aurora indica and lovin that too but it sends my brain all over the place lel

VThe effects I personally get from Black Jack put it in the Indica category, which is not surprising when you look past the parent strains to the grandparents - six different indicas and just one sativa. Indicas for me are primarily body highs with little to no psychoactive high, which is perfect for some and not so great for me.\u000a\u000aBlack Jack has very good body relaxing qualities and a little bit of goofy and giggly brain buzz. As an edible this makes a really good medicine for a long plane, train or bus ride. It&#39;s like being in the firm but friendly grip of a gentle giant. Simultaneously heavy and soft.\u000a\u000aI can only give it three stars though because I prefer more sativa in the mix to boost my euphoric and uplifting factors. I bet Black Jack would be great crossed with Girlscout Cookies, Durban Poison, or backcrossed with Jack Herer, or it&#39;s grandparent Haze. For all I know that has already happened and I&#39;m just ignorant of that strain. If so, somebody please let me know!

VSmell is soft and fruity, with earthy and piney notes as well. Not extra pungent but pleasant all the same.\u000aTaste is earthy and sweet, with a sour aftertaste. Smoke is smooth. \u000aThe high comes on after the second hit, building up for a minute into a wonderful head buzz. The buzz is intense and calming, staying in the head while dropping into the rest of the body like a warm, fuzzy blanket.\u000aThe effects last quite a while compared to similar strains I\u2019ve tried. \u000aThere\u2019s nothing inhibitive or unpleasant about this bud, you can do anything on it. Want to go on an outdoor adventure? Check! Want to lounge and read a book? Go for it! After the initial buzz mellows you can have wonderfully relaxing sleep with Black Jack.\u000aDefinitely one of my favorite strains. Great for beginners if dosed carefully!

This is very mellow euphoric high , most on the mind and undertone of body. , feelings of tranquility and shit like that. Urge to talk and be heard. Umm... no paranoia . After the stone goes to high and than dopamine level slowly decrease , a sleepness and kind of couch lock sensation Beckmann and you fall to a deep sleep!!!! Very recommended to imonsia people.

VBest hybrid ever!! 1 of the major and main reasons that I love this strain is even though FOR THE MOST PART, and again. this is the case with MOST and ESPECIALLY SATIVA DOMINANT HYBRIDS and that is people sometimes prefer a hybrid because u can smoke it any time of day. Well this strain takes it up a notch from there even, these are 2 potent strains that were crossed to form this lady (Black Domina x Jack Herrer). So this strain is actually a tiny bit on  the indica dominant side, its about 55/45, 60/40 but nothing outside of that, depends on the pheno and if its even a fact that both exist. First u feel a head high, then that lasts about 15 minutes right as ur head massage ends, then your full body massage beginsand the THC levels are through the roof on this strain. the lowest % I&#39;ve found was 19.67 %THC and the highest I found was 26.88% THC. Because of this, its effects last hours. if u just want a buzz, then pack a bowl or joint etcc.,,and take just 1 hit or so as this will be more powerful than most and will last longer. And if ur trying to smoke urself stupid, a full bowl or 2 of this to the head will get the job done

As for the effect, it&#39;s a little heady, so that I wouldn&#39;t want to do anything that requires skill, like assembling something or gaming with multiple players. It&#39;s great if you&#39;re at a party and want to carry on conversations, lol. Also made my body feel a bit locked.  Overall a pleasant high, but am leaving off a star as I prefer happier highs when I&#39;m not medicating for pain.

VI enjoyed Black Jack quite a bit. It is a strain that will relax you, but won&#39;t give you couch lock. After 1-2 hits, I was ready to either sit on the couch and watch tv, or go out and be social. It has a good mix or head and body high. I did go over to a friend&#39;s house, and they couldn&#39;t tell that I was high as a kite. It is a light high, unless you go for broke. I&#39;ve noticed that the more I smoke, the sleepier I get. It smells fantastic and smokes a little harsh (though not unpleasant). It also has a beautiful purple color on the bud.

VLineage: Black Domina x Jack Herer (Well Balanced Hybrid)  \u000aLike winning it big on the tables in Vegas, Black Jack is a well-rounded smooth citrusy punch that hits you like a sack of bricks. First there\u2019s the sweet and sour lemon that\u2019s followed by a dank earthiness, all resulting in a euphoric talkative high that truly exhibits how a well-balanced hybrid has the best of both worlds. This is a wonderful strain for headache relief, and it also works well for stress, depression and pain management.

VDecent pain control and energy at the same time.  Takes a while to kick in, but the high is potent and lasts a really long time.  The buds are so incredibly dense and heavy, I actually asked the clerk to double check the weight because 2 grams looked like 1.  Even the smoke itself is unusually thick and heavy.  I&#39;d call Black Jack energetic and uplifting, rather than euphoric.

VI&#39;ve decided to make this one of my most favourite hybrids. The high comes steadily, giving me time to adjust to my surroundings and thougts. You can either sit at one place truely enjoying music or crack an infinite amount of jokes with friends (both of which I combined). The high also lasts very long with zero discomfort, I can&#39;t even notice the come down, a euphoric &amp; air-weight high.

VLoved this Indica Dom strain. used it medicinally to easy a panic attack, and the stress releasing effects were almost instant. The high grew nice and slow for about 3-4 minutes after exhaling my hit before I was fully medicated and feeling nice and relaxed. Great body high, soft head high. Pain relieving and hunger inducing. Couch Lock was very real. I was comfortable any where I sat and was extremely reluctant to move, though I was still able to move when really needed, but I honestly didn&#39;t want to. May be tough to medicate and work because of that, depending on what you do. First concentrate I have ever tried that had such an intense spearmint flavor. It came as an after taste that lingered until my dry mouth made the taste go sour. I would certainly smoke this again and again to relieve stress and anxiety.

V2/2/2012 This strain , from a dispensary in socal, gave me an anxiety attack......and Im not one to suffer from anxiety at all. Right after the second hit my chest started feeling heavy, I started to twitch and it got me very worried. It lasted a while too, around 1.5 hours. The second time I dared myself to smoke this evil bile , I had anxiety again, this time not as bad due to tolerance, though same heavy chest feeling, nausea and shortness of breath. Need to keep yourself busy, if not the paranoia will hit you. Hope this stuff wasn&#39;t laced with anything, experienced a bit of jaw clench too. Been smoking every day for five years.. something is wrong. Will stick to pure indica from now on. Ugh.

The sativa side is stronger and I have an active head-buzz, but it is not wholly productive. It is pleasant and long lasting however. It is also hard-hitting. It&#39;s a good wake-and-bake strain if I have nothing important to do that morning.
