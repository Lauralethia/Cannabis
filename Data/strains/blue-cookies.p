VA strain that left me feeling very content and optimistic. Decent for anxiety; not completely sedating but kill anxious feelings and in sum helps feeling just overall &quot;good&quot;. For this reason also pretty good for depression

VKnocked me squarely on my ass. Take it easy with this one. I smoke at least a bowl or two of whatever I have at the time nightly and religiously for the past 3 years for pain and insomnia, so my tolerance is a bit on the high side. Two hits off my small glass pipe hit me hard after 20 min and I don&#39;t remember anything after that because it put me to sleep. I was alert one minute and out the next. It was a little disconcerting at first because I didn&#39;t realize how strong it would be, but now knowing what to expect, it&#39;s probably my top choice for sleep. Definitely not a daytime strain.

VBlue Roots Blue Cookies Flower 21% THC. \u000aFlower: absolutely divine. Looks like perfect little frosty Christmas trees with light green and dark blue patches. Covered in orange tendrils. Little bits of purple and trichromes flash in the light. This is top shelf looking High Times cover shoot bud. \u000aSmell: Skunk, berry dank. Some hay/fresh cut grass notes\u000aCrumble: Perfect. Fluffs when put in a grinder.  Premium. \u000aBurn: Even and clean. Perfect. \u000aTaste: Very blueberry with a definite cookie/sweet sugar taste on the finish. Reminds me of a skunky blueberry cheesecake. \u000aHigh: I&#39;m partial to the high that any Cookies strain provides so I am slightly biased on this topic, for that I apologize. It made me happy and euphoric. Used this medicine before meditating and felt unbelievably relaxed and at peace with everything. I felt no back pain or muscle spasms. Anxiety was gone. I stared out the window for an unknown time contemplating Earth and the universe. This strain is proof that cannabis was put on this Earth for us to achieve a higher consciousness and coexist with all living things. Fuck that got deep fast. \u000a\u000aOverall Experience AKA TL;DR: \u000a9.7/10. I would&#39;ve given this a perfect score (like I had given my all time favorite Animal Cookies) if the THC % was slightly higher. Coming in at 21%, compared to Animal Cookies 29%, it has a small amount to improve. Still this is absolutely premium top shelf Cannabis Cup winning quality medicine. The high was one of my favorites (ultra relaxed in body but simultaneously euphoric in mind, happy and up). My hat&#39;s off to Blue Roots. They&#39;ve been coming with total &#128293;&#128293;&#128293;. Try their Champagne Kush or Skywalker OG if you like this.

VGot a batch of Blue Cookies. GSC x Blueberry. The smell is very reminicent of its blueberry parent, with a fruity/earthy twist from the GSC. Definetly a flavor strain!A mix of berrys and other fruit and earthy dankness. One of those tastes you will never forget or confuse or compare to another strain. The buds were dense and yellowish green with orange yellow hairs and a coating of thick white trichs. The high was really heavy. Not a strain you want to smoke before an activity, but perfect for night or chill out time. Although that may be hard, because after you taste it you want to hit it again and again.

VI love the &quot;cookie&quot; strains, this is my top favorite! As mentioned in other reviews, wouldn&#39;t recommend for novice smokers, I have a decent/high tolerance, all I needed was 3-4 hits &amp; I was gooood. Great for hanging out, talking &amp; laughing. Great daytime strain as I was motivated, happy, felt like doing things etc (I suffer from severe depression &amp; anxiety plus chronic fatigue). Any strain that alleviates all 3 of those debilitating things is great because I felt &quot;normal&quot; &amp; myself again. Also had a little bit of getting sidetracked &amp; forgetting what I was supposed to be doing. Hope this helps. I appreciate fellow reviewers who take the time to share their experiences!

I was crying, and anyone that knows me knows I don&#39;t really cry very often, so that was a big clue.  My daughter and I had picked this up as a dispensary apology for a mistake in their menu that had us going out of our way for some hindu kush they didn&#39;t actually have.  They gave us an eighth of this for thirty three, and it was worth every dollar.  My top fav now, just for how it saved my sanity, alone.

I can officially say this is my new favorite strain. Smooth smoke, beautiful bud, great taste and amazing high. You simply cant go wrong. Does not do much at all for pain, my lower back pain before smoking was about a 8 and its stayed about the same. More for depression or thinking. very energetic and tired at the same time.

VBlue Cookies is an amazing strain! It&#39;s extremely potent. I can take 2-3 hits and be goooood! It helps with my pain, depression, anxiety and sleep! First part of the high is an extreme euphoric, creative, motivated feeling! Definitely brings me back to the good old days, makes me feel very giggly and at ease. Second part of the high starts making my whole body tingle and relax, and puts my mind at a mellow, happy high. Then comes the munchies!!! Holy crap does this strain make me want to eat! I will be super nauseous and not be hungry one bit, with muscles feeling like they&#39;re tearing and ripping, but after 1 hit-- it seriously helps so much. After about 30-60 minutes into the high, though, I start to slow down and get lazy hazy. Lol I love and depend on this strain right now.

VCalled my local (Amazing!) delivery man and bud tender and received a special on this calming, tranquil and relaxing strain for $30 for 1/2 top shelf in the middle of a sleeepless night. I didn&#39;t know what to expect but after loading my pipe and smoking two bowls ( about 4 to 5 good hits) all my worries had evaporated and I felt extremely calm, sedated, relaxed, but still in reasonable control. This was a beautiful experience and I know I smoked more I would be feeling the effects of that times 100. The strain is extremely likable due to its lack of anxiety causing attributes but it isn&#39;t so sad dating that you will fall asleep. It truly is an amazing strain for anxiety and medical related issues which is why I was grateful for.Especially at that price and the quality. Very happy I took advantage of the specials, the inhale was pretty smooth, the taste was a bit chocolatey actually with hands of an earthy flavor. I definitely enjoyed it as it wasn&#39;t a particularly strong smell but just strong enough to feel the burn in the back of your throat in a good way. This is a great strain to chill out and have great conversation with or to smoke on your own and relax. I felt the tension in my body and was extremely comfortable. I highly recommend this brand to anyone who feel stressed out, needs a massage, feels a little uptight and needs a little vacation. This is a cheaper way to get one definitely check it out!\u000aFlavor: 9.1/10\u000aPotency: 9.0/10\u000aPugnan 6.5/10\u000aOverall High: 9.0/10\u000aXo.

VLoving this strain. A new fav. But not surprising since I live her pants.  \u000a\u000aAfter one bowl, felt fully functional but relaxed. I described it in my head as \u201cserene\u201d.   Felt completely in control and not too forgetful which I can usually get. Didn\u2019t get the munchies too bad, but could definitely take a nap on the come down. \u000a\u000aGreat for lovin time with the hubby too. So sad I only got an 1/8 of this.  I\u2019ll be keeping it for special nights and occasions I can tell. It\u2019s that good. \u000a\u000aOh yeah. Bring some water. A little harsh I coughed a bit. But the first couple of hits tasted liked it\u2019s GSC parent which is fine indeed. \u000a\u000aIf you can get this....check it out.   \u000a\u000aBakedTinkerbrlle&#129498;&#127997;\u200d\u2640\ufe0f

The flower doesn&#39;t smell great, but its not bad. berry and slight earthy smelling. -- Gradually got more high and its a very focused and calming high. not a real energetic strain but it is a nice calm and awake strain.

VCalled my local (Amazing!) delivery man and bud tender and received a special on this calming, tranquil and relaxing strain for $30 for 1/2 top shelf in the middle of a sleeepless night. I didn&#39;t know what to expect but after loading my pipe and smoking two bowls ( about 4 to 5 good hits) all my worries had evaporated and I felt extremely calm, sedated, relaxed, but still in reasonable control. This was a beautiful experience and I know I smoked more I would be feeling the effects of that times 100. The strain is extremely likable due to its lack of anxiety causing attributes but it isn&#39;t so sad dating that you will fall asleep. It truly is an amazing strain for anxiety and medical related issues which is why I was grateful for.Especially at that price and the quality. Very happy I took advantage of the specials, the inhale was pretty smooth, the taste was a bit chocolatey actually with hands of an earthy flavor. I definitely enjoyed it as it wasn&#39;t a particularly strong smell but just strong enough to feel the burn in the back of your throat in a good way. This is a great strain to chill out and have great conversation with or to smoke on your own and relax. I felt the tension in my body and was extremely comfortable. I highly recommend this brand to anyone who feel stressed out, needs a massage, feels a little uptight and needs a little vacation. This is a cheaper way to get one definitely check it out!\u000aFlavor: 9.1/10\u000aPotency: 9.0/10\u000aPugnan 6.5/10\u000aOverall High: 9.0/10\u000aXo.

VBlue Roots Cannabis Co. Blue Cookies 20%THC. \u000aFlower: Beautiful blue nuggets covered in light green leaves and orange tendrils, frosty trychs. Well manicured. \u000aSmell: It&#39;s got that delicious cookies kushy smell, with the fruity berry notes. \u000aCrumble: very fluffy and delicate. Once ground it can compact very tightly. Keep it loose when rolling or packing it. \u000aBurn: Glorious. Cured perfectly. \u000aTaste: I am partial to the cookies taste, and love the extra blueberry kick this strain has. Very tasty. \u000aHigh: Strong but mellow and relaxing.  I took one bong rip and watched A Fistful of Dollars and totally got sucked into it. Terrific high. \u000aOverall Experience: Great medicine. 9.6/10. Not the strongest strain THC wise, but a fantastic experience nonetheless.

VOne fat bong rip of this berry goodness will have you on cloud 9.  But be careful, if your tolerance is low might want to go easy on this strain.  High thc level will put you at a 10/10 off of one fat rip, and after about an hour a heavenly body sedation will take place.  Great strain to smoke on if you want to relax, but also want to feel that happy/euphoria.  Decent for sleep, but dont smoke right before you go to sleep.  Smoke it about an hour or 2 before bed time and guaranteed best nights sleep.  Side note, you may want to keep lot\u2019s of snacks nearby as this will have you searching your fridge for any morsel.  Overall, not my favorite but a good strain to relax to:)

The sativa effects are euphoria and bit happy. The indica made my body feel fuctional but relaxing on this strain feels absolutely heavenly. The body high isn\u2019t too numbing, and your body feels comfortable the entire time even when coming down.

Vtaste is exquisite, very good choice for a after dinner smoke. onset of high produces an immediate euphoric feeling, similar to GSC. after the high takes hold it produces a very unique and euphoric relaxing effect. to me it was almost as if the sativa and indica effects were combating for the dominant effect. not my particular cup of tea. taste is exceptional. high is too much excited mind combined with heavy sedation. After dinner smoke. not for morning or for bed. it will work but too much going on to use it for specific purposes

VTop caliber taste. The blueberry taste is simply delicious and so prevalent it&#39;s surreal. Can slightly taste the GSC underneath.  Energetic for the first 30 to 40 minutes then a bland period for 10 to 15 minutes, followed by relaxed lethargy that sometimes requires a nap.  No issues with short term memory. Feel good smoke that lifts me up for the first hour and then leaves me relaxed and a bit tired. This is a great strain to blend with other strains when dabbing. It goes with everything. Helps me with stress, social anxiety, and focus.

The body high isn\u2019t too numbing, and your body feels comfortable the entire time even when coming down.

VCalled my local (Amazing!) delivery man and bud tender and received a special on this calming, tranquil and relaxing strain for $30 for 1/2 top shelf in the middle of a sleeepless night. I didn&#39;t know what to expect but after loading my pipe and smoking two bowls ( about 4 to 5 good hits) all my worries had evaporated and I felt extremely calm, sedated, relaxed, but still in reasonable control. This was a beautiful experience and I know I smoked more I would be feeling the effects of that times 100. The strain is extremely likable due to its lack of anxiety causing attributes but it isn&#39;t so sad dating that you will fall asleep. It truly is an amazing strain for anxiety and medical related issues which is why I was grateful for.Especially at that price and the quality. Very happy I took advantage of the specials, the inhale was pretty smooth, the taste was a bit chocolatey actually with hands of an earthy flavor. I definitely enjoyed it as it wasn&#39;t a particularly strong smell but just strong enough to feel the burn in the back of your throat in a good way. This is a great strain to chill out and have great conversation with or to smoke on your own and relax. I felt the tension in my body and was extremely comfortable. I highly recommend this brand to anyone who feel stressed out, needs a massage, feels a little uptight and needs a little vacation. This is a cheaper way to get one definitely check it out!\u000aFlavor: 9.1/10\u000aPotency: 9.0/10\u000aPugnan 6.5/10\u000aOverall High: 9.0/10\u000aXo.

VThis is one of the best strains I&#39;ve consumed so far and here are some of the reasons why:\u000a1. It is not harsh on your throat.\u000a2. It is smooth with a sweet kick in it.\u000a3. It smells nice and it doesn&#39;t leave a lot of smell behind for those who want to be discrete.\u000a4. It gives a balance of head and body high.\u000a5. Great to treat depression and stress.\u000a\u000aTry it an you&#39;ll love it. Especially if you&#39;re an Indica fan.

VA nice dense flower covered in sparkling trichomes and golden hairs. The smell is a mix of berry with some woody diesel notes coming from the GSC parent. The taste of the smoke is sweet, with accents of berry and citrus on inhale and hashy cedar taste on the exhale. Starts in the forehead just behind the eyes as your brain feels heavier and heavier, until it begins to careen like a waterfall down your spine alleviating any muscle pain along the way. Good solid 3 hour medicating from this strain, with no strong desire to re-dose before coming down.

VOne fat bong rip of this berry goodness will have you on cloud 9.  But be careful, if your tolerance is low might want to go easy on this strain.  High thc level will put you at a 10/10 off of one fat rip, and after about an hour a heavenly body sedation will take place.  Great strain to smoke on if you want to relax, but also want to feel that happy/euphoria.  Decent for sleep, but dont smoke right before you go to sleep.  Smoke it about an hour or 2 before bed time and guaranteed best nights sleep.  Side note, you may want to keep lot\u2019s of snacks nearby as this will have you searching your fridge for any morsel.  Overall, not my favorite but a good strain to relax to:)

VLoving this strain. A new fav. But not surprising since I live her pants.  \u000a\u000aAfter one bowl, felt fully functional but relaxed. I described it in my head as \u201cserene\u201d.   Felt completely in control and not too forgetful which I can usually get. Didn\u2019t get the munchies too bad, but could definitely take a nap on the come down. \u000a\u000aGreat for lovin time with the hubby too. So sad I only got an 1/8 of this.  I\u2019ll be keeping it for special nights and occasions I can tell. It\u2019s that good. \u000a\u000aOh yeah. Bring some water. A little harsh I coughed a bit. But the first couple of hits tasted liked it\u2019s GSC parent which is fine indeed. \u000a\u000aIf you can get this....check it out.   \u000a\u000aBakedTinkerbrlle&#129498;&#127997;\u200d\u2640\ufe0f

VBlue Roots Cannabis Co. Blue Cookies 20%THC. \u000aFlower: Beautiful blue nuggets covered in light green leaves and orange tendrils, frosty trychs. Well manicured. \u000aSmell: It&#39;s got that delicious cookies kushy smell, with the fruity berry notes. \u000aCrumble: very fluffy and delicate. Once ground it can compact very tightly. Keep it loose when rolling or packing it. \u000aBurn: Glorious. Cured perfectly. \u000aTaste: I am partial to the cookies taste, and love the extra blueberry kick this strain has. Very tasty. \u000aHigh: Strong but mellow and relaxing.  I took one bong rip and watched A Fistful of Dollars and totally got sucked into it. Terrific high. \u000aOverall Experience: Great medicine. 9.6/10. Not the strongest strain THC wise, but a fantastic experience nonetheless.

VBlue cookies is one of the smoothest smokes I&#39;ve had in a while. It leaves you with a strong cookies aftertaste and a nice balanced high. You can expect to feel very relaxed, euphoric and content. Great strain for depression and anxiety. Probably more of a stay inside or end of day strain, but it probably won&#39;t knock you out. Again, this stuff tastes amazing. Oh and be prepared for the munchies.

VI have such a hard time falling asleep,literally hours laying with my eyes closed and waking up exhausted in the morning. I&#39;ve tried a lot of medical marijuana and blue cookies is by far the best to ease your troubles mind. Leaving you with a calming head high. Beautiful crystals covering the dark purply green buds. Wonderful.

VSuper dank. Don&#39;t let the THC content fool you. NorCal Farmz makes the most legit version. I&#39;m a heavy weight. Works well for me.

VReview for Blueberry Cookies.\u000a\u000aMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Relaxing and helps with pain. Mild euphoria.\u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth. Harsh pull and exhale. \u000a\u000aTaste/Draw - Doughy with hints of berry upon exhale. Harsh pull and exhale.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other-\u000a\u000aSorry everybody, I really wanted to like Blue Cookies, but I&#39;ve found to either love GSC strains or dislike them and unfortunately, this is a dislike. I had no problems with the effects, they worked well, but the taste was too doughy and the draw was harsh same with exhale. Made me cough and I never cough.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ll try again in the future to see if this was just a bad batch.\u000a\u000aWhile the effects work well, I would not recommend this strain, unless nothing else is available.

VThis powerful strain tastes like you&#39;d expect. The fruity berry of blue dream melds into the subtle earthier flavors of GSC creating a beautiful stanky flavor. The feeling are nearly instant and hit the head first with strong euphoria followed by an amazing body high that may cause couch lock at high doses. A top teir choice IMO.

Vcame in at 22%, but its pretty basic. Wasn&#39;t at all impressed with the high at all. it smells like any of the other cookies. Definitely not for the veteran smoker. since it has the word cookies in it everyone thinks its going to be the best, but like most things in this world. its just to good to be true
