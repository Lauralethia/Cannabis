VThis is a great 100% indica. Bred from a select hindu kush from what I have seen in the genetics .The trichomes I got on my batch were beautiful and very plentiful. It made me really sleepy and hungry; it was great for a late night munchie fest. I would recommend this strain to anyone that wants a great couchlock feeling that lasts for a long time.

VI&#39;m a medical patient with PTSD and this is wonderful for panic attacks. I was having a full fledged attack even after taking my prescribed pharmaceutical medications. I had 2 big hits of this and I&#39;m feeling so much better physically, mild sedation which is very calming but not overwhelming. this stopped my body and hands from shaking as well, which is one part of a panic attack most strains won&#39;t help. overall best strain I&#39;ve come across in awhile for my PTSD physical panic symptoms.

VI smoked some chocolate chunk by rgl private reserve. I didn\u2019t want to write this review. I wanted the video game remote but it\u2019s across the room. I don\u2019t want to stand up and get it after trying CC for the first time. This device was closer so I ended up writing this review. CC smells like candy. Tastes like really sweet hash. Looks very. Some purple and bright neon green. Scraggly long neon orange hairs. Trich is moderately frosty. Exhale is like hash from Kush and not as harsh as the taste would lead one to think it\u2019s going to pack a punch on your lungs with. I felt a blast of euphoria that quickly tapered off into a zone of relaxation. Out of the zone my rear is stuck to the ground. No, It\u2019s a slow motion punch from a giant with a huge socker bopper into my couch.\u000a\u000aI recommend this for meditation, relaxing, and sleep. I\u2019ll get that remote eventually.

(spelling) I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s genetic drift or what that causes it but after 35 + years in the game I&#39;ve never seen so many hermorphidites.. chunk&#39;s a good smoke, I&#39;m in the process of crossing a female Chocolate Chunk with a male Papaya from Nirvana, my test results so far are extraordinary!

Chocolate chunk sugar wax is probably my favorite concentrate so far.  I love the flavor and this is perfect for unwinding after a hard day at work.  Also takes any pain away that I have in my back which is an added bonus. Also, I&#39;m fairly certain I love sugar wax.

Vcliche, like super cliche but I barely rate things. but my favourite tender was having a sale and this and another strain, I will be rating as well, were the only good bargain that worked for me and gave me the most smoke for my money. btw, just smoked a preroll of this 10min ago. anyway, I have anxiety, I have insomnia like stay up 3 days in a row insomnia, pretty bad depression and sometimes I can be manic. my job is stressful. I just recently went through a divorce, my dog getting hit by a car in the last 3 weeks(alive), going through a week long constant cry a thon and an avalanche of other issues going on. when I do sleep, I pretty much just black out. I work from 3/3-11pm. I get home at 1230 maybe 1 or 2 if I get off late or need to get groceries or something. anyway, after finally closing my eyes id wake up at between 11am and 1pm. and id still be tired, groggy, could and did take naps sometimes 20min after waking. after smoking this! the time I go to sleep hasnt really chamged but now I wake up between 8 and 9am. I feel like ive slept, energized. I haven&#39;t exercised in two years, always too tired. I&#39;m back exercising, and excited about it. I think the combination of this and the Durban poison ive been waking and baking I feel like a milliin bucks. ive gotten 3 of my stoner buddies(og to compared to me the newb) to try both of these strains now and they all texted me early as fuck the next day to tell me how amazing these two baddies were.

I find myself relaxed, calm, and truly enjoying everything with the added ability to focus when I need to grind a long task. Gives headaches once reaching end of cycle. The smell is warm and pungent, and found to really bring in a crowd of individuals around stating &quot;this is the best weed I&#39;ve ever smelt&quot;. Overall 4.5/5.

VI love this strain. I&#39;m bipolar, I also suffer from PTSD and anxiety, and Chocolate Chunk helps ease the symptoms I experience. I find it especially helpful when I am having racing thoughts. It seems to quiet my head completely.  This strain is a very good choice for relaxing, it starts out kind of intense for a few minutes but then lightens up and is a super calm high. Taste a little like Chocolate too. Good stuff &#128526;\u270c&#127851;

Vcliche, like super cliche but I barely rate things. but my favourite tender was having a sale and this and another strain, I will be rating as well, were the only good bargain that worked for me and gave me the most smoke for my money. btw, just smoked a preroll of this 10min ago. anyway, I have anxiety, I have insomnia like stay up 3 days in a row insomnia, pretty bad depression and sometimes I can be manic. my job is stressful. I just recently went through a divorce, my dog getting hit by a car in the last 3 weeks(alive), going through a week long constant cry a thon and an avalanche of other issues going on. when I do sleep, I pretty much just black out. I work from 3/3-11pm. I get home at 1230 maybe 1 or 2 if I get off late or need to get groceries or something. anyway, after finally closing my eyes id wake up at between 11am and 1pm. and id still be tired, groggy, could and did take naps sometimes 20min after waking. after smoking this! the time I go to sleep hasnt really chamged but now I wake up between 8 and 9am. I feel like ive slept, energized. I haven&#39;t exercised in two years, always too tired. I&#39;m back exercising, and excited about it. I think the combination of this and the Durban poison ive been waking and baking I feel like a milliin bucks. ive gotten 3 of my stoner buddies(og to compared to me the newb) to try both of these strains now and they all texted me early as fuck the next day to tell me how amazing these two baddies were.

I prefer to make edibles out of most indicas as I find that&#39;s better on pain, and this one is a doozy.

VAlthough sometimes leaves you with a similar earthy coffee taste in your mouth after administration, this is a great productive strain that my personal dispensary recently aquaried a lot of. I find myself relaxed, calm, and truly enjoying everything with the added ability to focus when I need to grind a long task. Gives headaches once reaching end of cycle. The smell is warm and pungent, and found to really bring in a crowd of individuals around stating &quot;this is the best weed I&#39;ve ever smelt&quot;. Overall 4.5/5.

VI have very bad insomnia. This isn&#39;t the cure to all of my problems, but it is so relaxing. It helps me get sleepy and AIDS in falling asleep fast when I&#39;m tired. Awesome during the days when you want to binge-watch or just chill the heck out!\u000a

VChocolate Chunk is a potent pure indica strain that&#39;s perfect if you&#39;re looking for the couch-locked feeling. A beautiful, frosty flower, Chocolate Chunk provides a relaxed sense of well-being and a complete unwillingness to move. It made my arms and legs feel like cement. Also causes a wicked case of the munchies. If you&#39;re looking for the classic stony, couch lock body high that glues you to the couch, you can&#39;t do much better than Chocolate Chunk. A wonderful example of indica.

VFort time I had tried this I picked up a quater ounce and got to work. the smell is great but I feel like it&#39;s better to hit this one from the bong as it will burn as it hits your throat. try with some ice on the tube. high was great. very consistent just melted me to my couch and I sat and gamed for hours

VClassic indica buzz. Full body high that has some good couch lock. Great to smoke BEFORE dinner. Power munchies with this one had me in front of the fridge late at night while making some truly strange things to eat. Bacon and peanut butter work well with jalape&#241;os and chocolate chunk.

VVery smooth to smoke. Potent. Amazing for my PTSD. Great relaxer. Good taste. Have a nice warm feeling. Usually I feel cold when I smoke. Very very strong smell, and not a fan of the smell, but oddly tastes great. \u000a

Vit&#39;s good tasting nugget of a bud really relaxed me especially after a long day at work. taste good kinda a generic taste if you will. \u000aI&#39;ll let you know later about the dry mouth. I don&#39;t really have any chronic pain except my left knee. arthirits. When I walk I&#39;ll let you know about that too. \u000aso here goes.... well although the pain wasn&#39;t completely gone it was a little easier to walk on my left knee that&#39;s been hurting because of the cold weather plus I&#39;ve been working out.  Yes to dry mouth but not too bad... enjoy!

VI was surprised that this strain turned out to be a dud. The flower was very dense and tested at 26.2%/0.08% but the high was a 0.0%/0.0%. Ended up having to mix some salad in order to make it through the eighth.

VI smoked chocolate chunk last night. I ate a lot, I was hungry, so I was less intoxicated. With it I&#39;m definitely more into introspection, personal creativity, and a little less talkative. However, I am better at some non-verbal communication. Just don&#39;t put pressure on yourself to be witty. Really enjoying the music.\u000a\u000aThis one is on the radio. I like it a lot. And I don&#39;t go outside and I listen to Pandora all the time, so, most of it is not on the radio, and I am a bit excited when I heard it in my therapist&#39;s office.\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imixg3jrJS8
