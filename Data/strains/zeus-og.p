VLusht75 was right... The sex was amazing with this strain. Weed normally kills my sex drive. For some reason this strain makes us both extremely Lovey Duffy. At 40, him close to 50, We have had some trouble in the bedroom just like many other couples. My husband and i had the best sex in years yesterday. I was the only one on this strain though. Will see if this does the trick for him too.

VA positive wake n bake with a delicious mellow taste. Off for a Fall weekend drive and feel very positive and hopeful. Zeus also offers some physical relief. I didn&#39;t know how tense I was holding my muscles/body until I smoked and all the tension melted away. It was tingling and relaxing.

VI agonized over whether I should deduct a star for the less than loveable taste (at least for me). While it vaporized nicely into thick plumes, I found the taste to be almost mossy, musky and very earthy.  \u000a\u000aWhat followed was a slow onset but pretty intense psychedelic experience, mixed with euphoria and a burst of energy.  Still, no racing heartbeat, anxiety or paranoia. Visual and auditory distortion began to occur in only the most pleasant ways imaginable. Transitioning through this sensory experience Yoga seemed like the thing to do, AND IT WAS! Relaxing Indica effects on the body begin to take hold, and this strain mellows out very nicely into a relaxed and touchy/feely sort of high.  Tremble before the awesome power of touch, and try this with the one you love! \u000a\u000aListening to Miles Davis&#39; &quot;Big Fun&quot; on a great stereo in the dark now, completely comfortable and content with the utterly euphoric night I&#39;ve had. Not feeling wired or at all, thoughts aren&#39;t racing but quite placid, deliberate. Totally relaxed and in total control, a great feeling.  \u000a\u000aI generally prefer Indicas and partake in the evenings, but this strain was perfect for a rejuvenating evening with my wife. If using in the evening, just give yourself a solid 3-4 hours to enjoy before expecting to sleep.  4.5/5
