There first night I brought this home, I swear I don&#39;t remember falling asleep. Like the name implies, anyone who sees this bud will be instantly turned to &quot;stoned&quot;.

VI really wish that I could rate it higher but it just doesn&#39;t stand out to me. I grew the first phenotype out and it took 10 weeks in flower, the bud totally covered in trichomes and a very beautiful plant, it yielded about 5 oz dry just a modest yield. No special taste or smell and not a real special buzz. We thought this would be fabulous but it just isn&#39;t. I have a few more phenos and clones to grow out, hopefully they will be better. I will review the others when they are ready and might possibly be able to rate it higher

VIn Greek mythology, one look at Medusa&#39;s eyes and you&#39;re turned to stone! Say what?\u000aAnd that&#39;s where the similarity ends, because this Medusa is no monster. On the contrary, she&#39;s lovely. You&#39;ll feel the super stone all right!---but you won&#39;t be frozen in time and space. \u000aAnd this Medusa, though not at all subtle, will be your friend. Suddenly I&#39;m beginning to sound like Mr. Rogers.\u000aAroma and taste: Not an OMG, but pleasant enough. \u000aShe is an even hybrid, say the experts; I found her to be definitely sativa. You can easily have a very productive day if you so choose, and it will be tempered all the way through with a warm feeling of smooth sailing. Sail on, earthlings, and let&#39;s make a better world.

Va uplifting and focusing strain for me. If the focus is only on one task, like in our case here playing darts, it&#39;s good. trying to focus while vacuuming, walking through the whole house. .... distractions are everywhere. so choose wisely :)\u000athe munchies go crazy after a while and smoking too much kinda gave me a headache. it might have been the dehydration feeling though. walks are really nice. A lot of things caught my attention while strolling through town. just for a second but then very intensely.  A good strain for a weekend with friends, socializing, brunching, strolling around.  I like!

VI usually smoke for stress/anxiety, and Medusa was great for this.  I am not usually prone to migraines, but this saved me with the last one I had - it was so bad I was pulling over on the drive home to throw up.  Smoked some Medusa - within about 30 minutes the migraine was completely gone, and I was able to function and be social at a dinner party instead of canceling.  Strong calming yet uplifting effect for me.
