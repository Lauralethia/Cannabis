VPeaches and cream slips it&#39;s way in pretty quick so much so that you don&#39;t even know it hit you, you&#39;re just smacked, you can def taste like a spicy mint and a fruity sweet, and music sounds just about amazing makes you energetic to do work or maybe after a long day for a party is highly recommended makes you so happy

VThis one is such a peachy dream! &#127825;  &#129371; &#129316; Vaped some of this and it\u2019s mostly a mellow peach flavor with a smooth aftertone.  Definitely not too creamy at all, this is a great afternoon hybrid for social gatherings or just chilling &#128526;. If you want a slightly sativa dom hybrid with a mellow peach flavor, than this is for you. \u000a\u000aMy True Rating: 4.6 \u000a-BPop6

VThis strain is as great as it\u2019s been hyped up to be, in my opinion. The bud I got is covered in trichomes and weighed 2.5 grams. It smells amazing and the smoke was smooth as hell, I hardly coughed at all. Huge selling point for me since I have a rough time smoking flower because of how harsh it is on my throat. Peaches and cream is the perfect name for it too, because you just feel so... peaches and cream. My best friend and I felt very peaceful  after smoking this, and we had interesting conversations. 12/10, I want to go back and buy an oz of this stuff.

VPeaches &amp; Cream, from Verdes! Another knock out from Verdes. This strain was perfect on V-Day, a nice after work hybrid that gives you a heady feel. Terrific for the wind down on the day but this strain can also getSmooth, peachy &amp; sweet tasting with the undertone of spice is the unique taste this flower had.  Quality flower from a quality dispensary.

VLove at first sniff. Very strong peachy scent, makes the mouth water a bit. High comes on strong within a few minutes. Strong pressure around the eyes, mind feels refreshed and creative, body feels relaxed but I&#39;m ready to go do some hiking. Smoked a 1/2 gram pre roll and I feel it&#39;s the perfect dosage of meds to ease the mind and carpe-diem.

VIt&#39;s very pleasant to smoke both smooth and sweet. The buds actually do smell like peaches when you bust open a sealed bag not a super pungent or skunk smell at all and the appearance of the weed isn&#39;t all that outstanding to make it look like a top grade smoke. Very typical looking dispensary quality Hybrid strain. The label says it is not 70 sativa 30 indica as I often see of this strain but I purchased some that were labeled as 60/40 Hybrid... I smoked 3 or 4 bong hits of peaches and cream and found it very relaxing and happy after 7to 10 minutes when I was done toking up. Most incredible as reducer of anxiety and stress. Somewhat of an indica feel to the high after some time passes and even came close to napping. Likely to be a strain I will purchase again!
