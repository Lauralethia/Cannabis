VThis is a sativa strain that will make both the connoisseur, and new-comers a good experience.\u000a\u000aYou can definitely smell why they called it grapefruit; thankfully I love it. \u000a\u000aOnly a few hits (based on tolerance) I could start feeling the effects. It was a very active and pleasant experience .  \u000a\u000aIn my opinion one of the best qualities for those whom feel uncomfortable talking to other people, or heck, even strangers. \u000a\u000aThe only downside is that it made me a little dizzy and a tad clumsy. A quick brain adjustment was needed to walk without looking like a dork.

VThis is a solid sativa that hits hard quick. It is a cerebral experience to say the least. If you are a fan of listening to music, sit down with some Grapefruit and a good playlist and your next hour or so should be a great one. Too much of a good thing can be bad though, I&#39;ve found that one too many tokes of this can leave you feeling lazy and tired with classic red-eye and a daze sort of feeling on the way down.

VOooh, exceptional come on. It\u2019s all smooth and rich with a genuinely happy mood elevation that so floods you with positivity, you can\u2019t help but smile. Things have an \u201coff\u201d cinematic quality...like you\u2019re placed on set of good movie. The dominant mental vibe is a bursting euphoria that\u2019s now seamlessly meshing with physical bursts of tingles all over the body. Almost equally strong feelings of having \u201cfun\u201d! Which makes observing everything and even just existing radiatingly enjoyable. Headspace rather quickly stones out, making head feel heavy and pulling your consciousness down with it -mellowing vibes a scoach. Things are rather serious, but relaxed and laid back. A bit tired / suppressive on the whole head...but concentration remains surprisingly clear and functional. Very top heavy high. Music and sound is accentuated to noticeably pleasurable degrees. It \u201cfeels\u201d good listening - but more so, stoning out to it. Very easy to drift out very quickly. In fact, I\u2019m kind of getting lost now but it\u2019s like I\u2019m successfully swimming...there\u2019s resistance, but it\u2019s fun resistance. Short attention span makes watching stuff very captivating with a good amount of emotional sensitivity and awe-inspiring wonder. Mild distance/suppression dampens potential empathy, so it\u2019s not \u201cperfect\u201d for connecting...but certainly above average.

VJust smoked a huge rip of this for the first time a few minutes ago, and that was after smoking alot of other bud so take this review for what it is i guess.  First off the sample I received was of fairly high quality, taste and smell i s very pleasant like a typical sexy foreign sativa.  Effects were surprisingly calm and very spacey in the head, which i personally love.  Great for doing almost anything if you have a creative brain.. high is somewhat narcotic as well if you smoke a bunch.. overall a pretty solid sativa 8/10

VThe batch I received was the perfect texture for rolling jays, dense with no seeds. The buds where long and somewhat thick with a non-uniformed hybridy sort of structure. Smells just like grapefruit and when smoked from a Jay   the consumer tastes the fruity citrus profile. \u000a I experienced little to no paranoia on this strain. I have anxiety induced ADHD so usually a sativa makes me to thinky and paranoid. I had a very productive day on Grapefruit. Did 6 hours of manual labor at my job aswell as 5 hours of class and hw today on a dose of 2 medium sized jays. When doing a manotanise task I feel inclined to plan and think big picture concerning my future ect. and to make lists and keep a journal. I also got way into my music theory hw. \u000a         As for treating my inflammation based autoimmune disease, this stain is just ok. Definitely a whole hell of alot better than advil though....  But no worries, this strain is perfect to mix with CBD hash oil whenever inflammation, pain, and anxiety need an extra kick in the ass.

VHere is my overall review on this strain:\u000a\u000a(I tried this strain both at home and outside in the forest)\u000a\u000a\u000aInside:  Felt a little anxious; tried watching a movie or tried doing misc errands in the house and got a little anxious with my thoughts.  My mind started to race a bit, but not too much where it was overwhelming -- It was just a bit uncomfortable.  I did notice that the &quot;uplifting&quot; effects from the strain started to turn on me a little bit and develop into a manic state.  \u000a\u000aOutside:  Immediately felt happy and relieved from stress, frustration and a little bit of depression.  I was on a couple of walks during separate occasions and felt slightly energized and motivated.  The air was fresher, interactions with other humans weren&#39;t as annoying as they usually are, and I was very talkative and happy -- I was in a very easy going mood.  The world seemed to be more enjoyable.  \u000a\u000aOverall, this strain was enjoyable all around.  The taste was exceptional and the buds were extremely resinous and dense.  The sweet citrus smell was very aromatic and the colours were gorgeous:  purple, white, lime green and a bit of orange -- a very masterfully grown batch of bud.  Top notch.

VPicked up 2g of Sub X brand &quot;grapefruit&quot; and was very pleased. The buds were beautiful and dense with red hairs and ample amounts of THC crystals.  It makes for a great strand to roll joints with.  It leaves a nice crystal gift layer in the kief catcher of the grinder.   The scent is a well balanced blend of grapefruit citrus with hints of earth tones. \u000aSmoking it is smooth and leaves you feeling happy, relaxed, giggly and a little bit energetic. Perfect for enjoying a beautiful day in the park laying out sun bathing with friends, or watching an intense episode of Game of Thrones....no matter what it&#39;s good :)

VThis is a very clean sativa, but there&#39;s some clear remnants of an indica stone from its mixed lineage, with a contrasting energy that is initially energetic, and then relaxing. Smells and tastes incredible - I love the aroma of grapefruit. It&#39;s almost like the cultivators had me in mind.\u000a\u000aThis is my current favorite strain at the time of writing for introspection, meditation, creativity, and basically anything that requires me to be in touch with my emotions. One thing in particular stood out about it: I noticed a very strong feeling of empathy towards complete strangers on the internet. (I&#39;ve tagged this strain as Empathetic.) I&#39;m at a loss to explain this, but it&#39;s definitely an effect I&#39;d seek out in the future. If I had to use but one word to describe it: Nuance. You&#39;ll notice its effects most if you concentrate on self-improvement.\u000a\u000aGrapefruit feels more &quot;productive&quot; than other strains I&#39;ve tried, in the sense that it doesn&#39;t knock me out or overwhelm my senses. I did have a fairly challenging experience after I had smoked too much, however. My thoughts became arrested with a somewhat disturbing thought-train that was enormous in scope and impossible to stop. In some ways it mirrored anecdotes of religious revelation. I could not sleep, because holding still was intensely uncomfortable. But, this thought pattern demanded every ounce of my attention, and I couldn&#39;t actually bring myself to get up and move. The sum of my mental resources had been hijacked, like an unruly process in need of a task-kill. Moreover, I was physically exhausted in that way that one is when they&#39;re only kept awake by coffee. If you have laid in bed at night obsessing over some intellectual problem, then you already know the experience. However, this scarcely felt voluntary.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m still looking for that personal holy grail of sativas, but this ranks up there with CHERNOBYL. I&#39;ll be looking into that one more, next. I&#39;m strongly considering recommending this to my friend, who is theologically inclined, and will no doubt find some interest in its more spiritual overtones if he is able to re-create my experience.

VI am delighted with the Grapefruit I&#39;ve gotten from both 172nd st Cannabis in Arlington, as well as The Vault in Lake Stevens, recently.\u000aFor me this is a happy, zippy, energetic, loosen muscles, wake &amp; bake without teeth clenching, edgy jitters or HIGH anxiety. \u000aOne of the few I&#39;ve found that lets me function, be active, stay awake, even socialize &amp; still get measurable relief from muscle spasms &amp; nerve pain. I don&#39;t feel couch locked, drugged or dizzy so there is no panic triggers.\u000aI have an unfortunate genetic tendency towards Narcolepsy, falling asleep often enough during normal awake hours, involved in activities that are not sleep inducing, that I no longer drive, use power tools, or cook unsupervised :( This in combination with high levels of pain from Muscle Spasms, Arthritis, Nerve Damage &amp; well seasoned with PTSD, Panic and Anxiety issues has made it difficult for me to find relief from standard pharmaceuticals.\u000aI don&#39;t need anything that increases my sleepiness, makes me dizzy or feeling drugged, AND having enough energy to dance &amp; go for walks without fear of falling asleep on my feet is amazing.\u000aI partake in more of a Alchemy micro-dose fashion when trying any new strain &amp; I am still comfortable with Grapefruit in larger doses.

VCitrus and Desiel flavor profiles combine to nail a grapefruit flavor &amp; scent! Couple that with it&#39;s stereotypical sativa effects of an uplifting &amp; creative nature. This makes for a great daytime smoke, but it&#39;s sativa effects can accentuate anxiety.

VThis is now by far currently my favorite strain! It helps so, SO, much with the muscle spasms in my back in my trapezius muscles as part of my Fibromyalgia and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome - also great for depression, too! Anxiety? Not the best, but it&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s definitely not one of those strains that causes paranoia, anxiety or panic though. It is a bit hallucinogenic and I really would discourage trying to operate any heavy machinery while under the influence of this one. The effects I would describe as... Drowsy, couch lock, heavy &quot;stoned,&quot; feeling in both mind and body, very comfortable, peaceful, serene, makes lots of things funny or laughable, time can pass either very slowly or very quickly, quite psychedelic but suitable to be legally sold as either a recreational or a medical strain in my opinion. Not helpful for insomnia though - in fact, this is one of the better ones for a daytime buzz because you can continue to function as normal and without sedation - eyes do get red, but they don&#39;t droop. The only downsides I would make note of would be dry eyes, dry mouth, others may possibly notice bloodshot eyes, hard to sleep on, driving is difficult/confusing (not recommended), easy to continually misplace things. Nothing big though. I love it. Like I said - my new favorite! Two thumbs up and five stars :)

VBeen very busy! Thx for hanging in there :) \u000a\u000aAs a Sativa lover and a veteran user, I like the \u201cclean\u201d high of this particular strain. It takes the edge off any pain I have and it doesn\u2019t burn me out right away, instead giving me the classic Sativa lift! I get physical and mental effects and for me that equals a decent strain for a nice uplifting session. This one would be great in a muffin or cookie and useful for days when people with arthritis want to get stuff done. My mobility / physical challenges are intimately connected to my mental health &amp; this clean, motivating, uplifting strain helps both aspects. If you have depression this is a good strain I think. If you are prone to anxiety this might be a bit much depending on your supplier/quality. \u000a\u000a*** And speaking of quality lol the cannabis I got from a local dispensary is excellent quality but I wish it was a bit more grape-fruity flavour :) I still find smoking the cheapest way for those of us who use a fair amount to consume daily- again I\u2019d rather eat it but what do you do? If you use it to mitigate symptoms or disabilities then you do what you can. Even with \u2018medical\u2019 or compassionate pricing it can still be challenging to access what you need in the way you need it! Enough preaching hahaha \u000aSo, lastly, this strain I also like or almost love because it does not set my asthma off. Now again a quality issue- the last time I rated this strain I did NOT like it as much as this time and I swear that\u2019s the difference in the grow/supply!! Some strains make me cough or wheeze so much but not this bad boy this time.  Woot! \u000a\u000aHappy high :)

When I first tried this strain I had no idea it would smell as much like grapefruit as it did it&#39;s almost uncanny. I live in the Seattle area and have only tried Royal Tree &quot;Grapefruit&quot; it&#39;s always been amazing quality with a total THC at around 24%. So try it if you see it.

VWhen I first seen this strain I laughed. Grapefruit? You&#39;ve got to be kidding me... My friend assured me otherwise. He opened his container and instantly I got the whiff of grapefruit! Amazed I took a bud out and took a good look at it. It was very dense very stanky and very very danky! Instantly I bought some. When I got home i whipped out my grinder, roll tray, and papers. When I got my medicine out I noticed it crumbled when a little pressure was put on it. I didn&#39;t even need my grinder! So how does it taste? You know that bitter sweet aftertaste you get after eating a grapefruit? Well enough said! Absolutely WONDERFUL!

VBeen very busy! Thx for hanging in there :) \u000a\u000aAs a Sativa lover and a veteran user, I like the \u201cclean\u201d high of this particular strain. It takes the edge off any pain I have and it doesn\u2019t burn me out right away, instead giving me the classic Sativa lift! I get physical and mental effects and for me that equals a decent strain for a nice uplifting session. This one would be great in a muffin or cookie and useful for days when people with arthritis want to get stuff done. My mobility / physical challenges are intimately connected to my mental health &amp; this clean, motivating, uplifting strain helps both aspects. If you have depression this is a good strain I think. If you are prone to anxiety this might be a bit much depending on your supplier/quality. \u000a\u000a*** And speaking of quality lol the cannabis I got from a local dispensary is excellent quality but I wish it was a bit more grape-fruity flavour :) I still find smoking the cheapest way for those of us who use a fair amount to consume daily- again I\u2019d rather eat it but what do you do? If you use it to mitigate symptoms or disabilities then you do what you can. Even with \u2018medical\u2019 or compassionate pricing it can still be challenging to access what you need in the way you need it! Enough preaching hahaha \u000aSo, lastly, this strain I also like or almost love because it does not set my asthma off. Now again a quality issue- the last time I rated this strain I did NOT like it as much as this time and I swear that\u2019s the difference in the grow/supply!! Some strains make me cough or wheeze so much but not this bad boy this time.  Woot! \u000a\u000aHappy high :)

V\u000aI vaped grapefruit flowers from a herbalizer (via balloons) and via the prima portable. taste from herbie, at 295 decrees, was exceptionally citrusy with clear tart pink grapefruit notes.   taste from prima was smooth and citrusy but less specific; still, great flavor from both devices.  \u000a\u000avisually, the flowers are nice, super tight radial colas with fresh citrusy notes.\u000a\u000athe effects after vaped are uplifting and energetic with, for me, zero anxiety or paranoia.  as a heavy smoker who nonetheless gets tweaked out by both sati as and indicas, well, this was quite the coup. this is a cannabis to which I will return, and often.

It smells so similar to an actual grapefruit. I use a number one grinder and f**k me, it grinds to dust. The taste is something else, you&#39;ll just have to try it for yourself.

VThis buzz is a relaxing one. A way to get rid any anxiety and/or the stress from the day. A couple hits is all I really for a while.\u000a\u000aI found out a month ago I have cancer, they say it treatable. My Dr. suggested I try some marijuana to help out any way that it can.\u000a\u000aThis strain Grapefruit Kush has helped me in so many ways. Right after chemo this stuff works great on the mind and on the body. It takes away the anxiety you might have, picks you up and puts a smile on your face. It relives or takes away the muscle spasms, body pain, muscle/joint, and nausea, all which can that can be felt after having chemotherapy.\u000a \u000aI am having another chemotherapy treatment next week and I am going to make sure I have my share needed.

At low to moderate amounts I&#39;m VERY clear-headed.  Any more than that and it starts to interfere with my ability to form complete sentences.  Your results may vary.

VChill, light high. Great for after work, chill time. Euphoric, cheery. Definitely, not a productive high. Cook dinner and relax type-vibe. Effects are not long lasting. Vaped/wax. Definitely, great for giving your mind break while still being fully present. Great strain for taking a leisurely walk.

VMy friend and I had the pleasure of trying sub x&#39;s grapefruit. Love this strain&#39;s strong citrus scent. The flower was coated in a significant amount of beautiful thc crystals, especially for a sativa, and long orange hairs. The large buds looked fluffy but were also very dense. First, we rolled a joint and smoked it out on my deck as we gazed out at the moonlit Seattle skyline. It was a very lovely joint, and it got us feeling relaxed yet very talkative and happy. After catching up on life, we loaded up my bong with my new ash-catcher attachment. The already sweet taste was even more apparent when smoked out of the bong. Great strain to catch up with friends!

VBuena sativa.\u000aCogollos un poco largos, duros y gordos. Verde intensos, pero con muchos hilitos marrones.\u000a\u000aFumar es agradable, se nota claramente la parte citrica con el final dulce. A veces me parece pillar el pomelo, aunque es mas de olor que de sabor.\u000a\u000aMe hace sentir energetico, tranquilo, y enfocado. Seguramente optima por el dia o para escuchar musica y pasar una tarde entrenida.

Head high heavy/sleepy; weird for a Sativa dominant (may have had too much or been that tired). Body high exactly what I needed. I was fast asleep by 2030 or so. Can&#39;t make up my mind whether this&#39; good for daytime or nighttime use. Highly recommend for pain/nausea.

Vl like this strain a lot.  It keeps me focused and it is a great pre workout for the gym. Great if your trying to get something done.  Good after taste as well, just like grapefruit.  Be mindful  tho because if your used to having a heavy euphoric effect from indicas you wont really get that with this nug because it doesn&#39;t really get you all loopy but just try to do something you&#39;ll see you will be active

VProbably one of my favorite sativa strains the smell is awesome everytime I crack open a jar I get an intense grapefruit smell, that is so much like real grapefruits it still jumps out the flavor is just like the smell only maybe not quite as intense. Which lends itself to a nice fresh flavored smoke that when grown, harvested, and cured properly is extremely smooth, flavorful, with quite high THC levels . The high is very upbeat, and creative ,there&#39;s zero anxiety, and it&#39;s plenty strong but with very little come down after it starts to wear off. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a great wake and bake strain it&#39;s kinda like a cup of coffee you get instant energy, after a bowl  a long day at work doesn&#39;t look quite so long. Great flavor in concentrate form almost forgot to mention this stuff makes great oil! All in all this is a great Sativa!

VGrower: Mt.Baker Homegrown 15$-1g THC 26% CBD .5% This is one of the best Sativa&#39;s I&#39;ve had and is very pungent and potent. The smell it gives off is a super sweet grapefruity and slightly skunky and fills the room instantly. It looks really nice too with little wispy dark orange hairs and are chunky semi dense buds. The smoke is really smooth and let&#39;s you take huge hits without much coughing and tastes slightly fruity like a starburst candy. The high is really uplifting and isn&#39;t racey and doesn&#39;t give much paranoia unless you smoke a lot. It is pretty hazey but it gets clearer after an hour and gives more of a body high that is relaxing after a day of work.

Nice pungent citrus smell, tasted very sweet. One of the better sativas I&#39;ve had in a while. Definitely recommend if you need to do work or concentrate. .

Listening to music was fantastic after smoking this, you really do understand it more. The second joint made me even more talkative and giggly which is exactly the uplift you need after the first joint wares off. Would highly recommend this to a group of friends smoking, or even just yourself and a friend.

VThis combines all the nice effects of a good Sativa with a really enjoyable sense of physical relaxation. I think it&#39;s due to the lineage connection to Jack Herer, in my non-expert opinion.\u000a\u000aMedicinally, the relaxation part helped me a great deal with some shoulder osteo-arthritis. I would imagine this strain would be good for stress relief, as well.\u000a\u000aRecreationally, I&#39;d say it&#39;s perfect for any social scenario with a relaxing vibe, I would say: small parties, happy hour, chilling at home, etc. Not sure it&#39;s ideal for a workday-get-it-done thing, though I can add that I noticed zero &quot;spacehead&quot; effects. All in all, I love this kind of strain.

VI give this bad boy a like 3.3 out of 5 for me. I like the grapefruit taste on exhale but this stuff makes me cough- sets the asthma off right away. The high is uplifting and it is a good one for doing things- chores, walks, etc. but I find the effects don&#39;t last as long for me as some of the other strains so I was puffing a bit more often than usual with this one. I like the &quot;clean&quot; feel of it though, good one for a morning pick up if you have to do stuff that requires mental clarity. Didn&#39;t really feel much in terms of effects on my physical issues/pain but decent enough for a lift that will help you get &#39;ready done!

VNice tangy flavour true to its name, this is a good strain to wake up too! A nice pick up and go without leaving you hazy and cloudy on the down side. Grandma always told me to get my grapefruit in early ;-)

VWhere to begin, oh let&#39;s get high.  Ok now I&#39;m ready, taste is citrus with a underbite of fresh earth and a exhale of dry tongue (dry tongue; strain that causes throat to dry up) but the euphoria is on point with a clear delivery of a high. On point strain.

VThis is quickly becoming my favorite Sativa in recent memory.  There is something special about this one in regards to its effect on me personally.  It lacks a lot of the body feeling and feels like a bud I can smoke a lot of.  But when using a traditional one shot/dugout combo, I feel like I&#39;m motivated and ready to produce on days I&#39;m feeling a bit tired.  If I use the Pax/flower combo, its only one shot (if its my first of the day).  I am still trying to recall a Sativa that I use during daytime with such extended energy.

VA score of 4.3 is considered low on this site. But i would give it 4.5  Copped it on sale and was looking for a sativa. Like my review, It kinda lacks creativity and the smell/flavor is very boring. Ive had dirt that tastes and smells better. Kinda dissappointing with Durban Poision being so good. Decent euphoria. Pretty clear head high. If you are lucky like some of us that can go to a dispensary legally, then you already know theres better choices than this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too bad for a sale bud tho

I was either in a full blown panic attack for an hour after smoking it, or I had little to no effect. I tried long tokes, short tokes, and limiting myself to one or two hits at a time; never got the hang of this particular breed. I am going to continue testing this out and will write another review in a month. Lets hope I figure it out. For now, I cannot recommend\u200b this to anyone that has an anxiety disorder.

VHad this strain and something called a stealth stick. If I could&#39;ve given it zero stars I would have. Yuck

Vthis must&#39;ve been the pre-roll i got from the dispensary 2 days ago. it really did nothing for me. when i go back for my next free one [today], i&#39;m going to ask me to let them smell them so my nose can do the choosing! i want the NYC Sour D pre-roll, so we can quit playin around with all the other mess!

VThis strain is not very good.  From all the medical strains I have tried, it ranks in the lowest.

VFeeling was disgusting. Throat felt horrible the whole time. High was definitely not worth the pain that also lasted the whole time.
