VI now know what it&#39;s like for cannabis to combat depression and fatigue. Sometimes I just wanna smoke weed that doesn&#39;t make me feel like I smoked weed. I feel physically energetic, clear headed, happy and &quot;normal.&quot; The high CBD makes it more difficult to accidentally oversmoke and crash. No dizzies, swimmies, sleepys or munchies. My new favorite wake n&#39; bake!!! Later in the day, it&#39;s an easy come down with the help of a light indica. Pleasantly surprised. My new favorite!!!

VMedihaze from Patriot Care in Boston is currently my favorite strain for medicinal use and in my top 5 for recreational use. It is a 2:1 CBD:THC and the THC percentage usually hovers in the 5-9% THC. It provides a great little head high but a amazing body high and a general overall effect. I use it for IBS and pain from a wrist surgery years ago. I have gone down the opiate route ( I was on them before surgery but was not quite a daily user but definitely used them too much).  I find that Medihaze treats the inflammation and distracts me from the wrist pain. For my digestive issues it is a damn miracle medicine.  It is a amazing wake and bake strain that goes along great with a coffee. The high is great for the day also. Plenty to let you know the THC is there and the sky high CBD levels give you a overall sense of wellbeing and a ready to take on the day attitude. This strain is also a great way to introduce someone new to medical or recreational cannibis use. It gives the beginner a great high and the CBD is great for many conditions as well as taking the rough edges off of too much THC. If this is available in your area go buy some.

VThis is the first high-CBD strain that I&#39;ve tried and it took about 3/4&#39;s of a bowl before I really felt the relaxing effects. Keeping in mind I smoke all exclusively minimal cbd bud(0.0-1.0%) usually, this was a suprisingly delightful strain it relaxed me without putting me to sleep which is strange for a strain with 19% CBD.\u000a\u000aGreat strain, Great Grower (Orgrow)

VThis is my number one daytime strain for fatigue, anxiety, and depression. I got this at The Kings of Canna with 16.3% CBD and 4.3% THC. Just one or two hits in the morning and the same again at lunch and I&#39;m nicely productive during the day. No munchies, no paranoia, just clear, better energy and focus. Otherwise I&#39;m exhausted all day. Gotta love that limonene sativa high CBD low THC mix.

VI&#39;ve just recently gotten my Massachusetts medical certification but I&#39;ve been a daily cannabis consumer for over 20 years now. I don&#39;t have much experience with the cbd strains (or if I do I didn&#39;t know). Really enjoyed this strain. 27% TAC with a 1:2 thc:cbd ratio. Spicy notes on the inhale with a slight peppery taste on the exhale. Good for my after work medicating  (I&#39;m a commercial Glass worker with chronic back pain), a couple of trenches vaped in my magic flight and the aches and pains from the day relax right away. will probably get again.

VFirst review I\u2019ve ever felt I needed to post on a strain... because MediHaze is that good. I suffer from tension headaches as well as migraines, and this strain relieves pain so fast. I\u2019ve tried a lot of different CBD strains and this is by far the best. I definitely think the THC content boosts the pain relief. The buzz is nice and light, just enough to remind you that you smoked, but still be productive. Highly recommend for anyone looking for pain relief, especially those who don\u2019t feel like pure CBD does much.

VI&#39;m that weed customer who buys a half gram at a time because I want to try evvvvvverything available. I&#39;ve been looking for about a year, for a strain that will relieve anxiety and stress as well as give me a little happiness boost but will not sedate me or space me out.  I&#39;m a little sensitive to some Sativas- I tend to get dizzy- but medihaze was able to meet all of my qualifications without a trace of dizziness.  Before this I liked a mix of Sour Tsunami and Elecric Koolaid, also a decent combo if you can&#39;t get your hands on this beauty. Something specific to this strain for me that I really enjoy is the gentle giddiness. Very sweet. Soothing body buzz. Could def. work or stay active in a social setting- can&#39;t recommend it highly enough!

VThis is my daytime medicine. Simply amazing, doesn\u2019t get me super duper stoned (which I prefer at night) and therefore helps me function throughout the day. I find with some sativas, I tend to get tired later in the day. However with Medihaze I\u2019m energetic and stress free. AWESOME if you like to stay active while still enjoying the psychoactive effect of cannabis.

VCBD Medihaze from my garden is a trew beauty to behold !  She was perhaps the best Soaring Sativa Cloud Reacher that I have had since I left the Wet Westcoast where MY Burmese ruled the Heights.  \u000a\u000aThe Phenotype that we grow has been tested in a Health Canada approved laboratory where it yielded 17 To 1 CBD over THC. That is in this case 17 % CBD and less than 1% THC.   This is no big fish story as I will post pics of mature plants in my next review of the herb.\u000a\u000aThis is  fresh made golden gold green Rosen was made last night !  And as I highly believe that any strain in my grows deserved to be tried alone no adding as I generally prefer, first thing in the mornings when I am first up.\u000aSativas as they are a relative rarity in the grows we do, deserve this taste alone test for which Rosen is well situated, it just doesn&#39;t need anything but itself.\u000a\u000aThe strain is from CDB Crew and they will be seeing the strain report within a month as we are almost at harvest time !!!!\u000a\u000aShe is a genesis from Super Silver Haze x Neville&#39;s Haze x some well known Canadian Hemp strain that has only CBD and no THC.   But CDB crew won&#39;t reveal lest their sales suffer.  \u000a\u000aI would happily back trace the strain and make the same three way cross.   It still wouldn&#39;t get the test results we got !\u000a\u000aNow back to the Rosen which fresh made contains all of the semi-volatile terpenes that almost all other forms of concentration lack !

Put on top of that a content of 16.3% THC this is a strong candidate for Number One with an overall rating of 31.6%.  You can feel the density and resin content readily and with  its sweet aroma and taste it&#39;s definitely in the top THREE of my favorites.  It also does not have such a strong nighttime affect as other high content THC strains with the HIGH CBD content providing quick, long lasting relief from chronic pain and inflammation of Arthritis without the dangers of Stroke, Heart Attack and High Blood Pressure that NSIADs (Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) can cause.  This is available only at the TAKOMA WELLNESS CENTER as far as I know right now.  It is DEFINITELY worth looking into.

VMediHaze (Super Silver Haze X Nevilles Haze) \u000a\u000aTHC 4.81%  CBD 12.84%   \u000a\u000aThe Greener Side\u000a\u000aOf the ten or so cbd strains that have crossed my path this one is so far my favorite.  For one its stands apart from the other cbd rich strains in taste straying from the more pungent hay-like flavor into a more zesty lemon note.  This very buoyant terpene profile sets off a nice heady buzz that carries the heavier cbd drag down of the body very well.  So as said of a flower that was reviewed right before this I would call this a more &quot;functional&quot; cbd strain.  So many benefits........\u000a\u000aThere is no doubt that cannabidiol does not create the same high as thc.  With that being said, the effect of cbd is a complete buzz unto its own creating a feeling of peace of mind &amp; relaxation in waves across muscles.  Be warned it usually makes me very sleepy much like an indica.  Wonderful!!!  Even more so when this feeling is more balanced out by a sativa like contemporaries Neville&#39;s Haze or Mango Haze I would suggest trying all of them.

VUsually with higher CBD strains, I get a little bit of a feeling after doing a lot of it but it doesn&#39;t usually seam worth it. But I keep trying them, because I&#39;ve been wanting to find a good daytime strain that I can feel comfortable smoking/vaping anytime without getting too weird or overwhelmed. I think I found it! This strain really seamed to me like having a few beers and getting really happy, without the comedown and sleepyness. It just made me feel very fun-loving and excited. When it wore off, I felt completely normal except for some residual &quot;good&quot; feeling. It&#39;s great for getting rid of inhibitions and having some fun with life. I pretty much felt like dancing. All of this was a welcome surprise from a higher CBD strain. I highly recommend it for fatigue and depression.

The taste was interesting, kind of a peppery soil flavor. There was just enough of a head high to make me feel paranoid and a little agitated for about an hour, and I got all warm and flushed.

VI&#39;m new to medical marijuana but this was recommended to me as Boaty McBoatface at Tweed. It&#39;s definitely a nice daytime strain, very mild but pleasant buzz. I have Fibromyalgia and literally all the co-morbid disorders, so I have a lot going on. For me, I felt much more relaxed, and it helped dull out some of the pain, but if I&#39;m honest, I wish it worked better on the serious muscle spasms/soreness. I do love that I can function pretty normally on it all day, and get some much-needed relief from some of the pain. :) Strongly recommend as a starter strain as the lower level of THC helps without a lot of the possibly unwanted side effects.

VReally disappointed with this cbd strain. For the record : upon further examination of obtained bud from my local dispensary I believe it was poorly grown. Even discovered some seeds. Nothing like tjs cbd which is the most chronic crystalline skunky packed with medicine cbd I have found yet. My medihaze had zero pain relieving or anti inflammatory relieving effects of any kind. Anti anxiety forget it. But like I said I&#39;m willing to try it again from a better grown crop. But this was a major box office flop. I cannot recommend it at this time.

VThis is definitely a nice dual THC/CBD strain with an almost 1:1 ratio and slightly higher CBD with the wax I got. It immediately takes any slight back pain that I usually have away and also gets me high enough to where I can still function normally but still have a fun crazy spinny head thing going on. Tastes very fruity and sweet!

Vgreat strain for depression, hunger depressant, and as a good replacement of caffeine with its energizing affects.\u000a\u000aThis strain does offer some psychoactive effects but very mildly, you will get a pleasant relaxation throughout your body and muscles  due to the CBD content.\u000a\u000ahighly recommended for Sativa Lovers!

VI&#39;d like to give this bud 2 1/2 stars. It has sativa-like qualities, but not a very strong high. It is like immediately going into the mellow come down phase.

VAMAZING Strain!  I&#39;ve been dealing with stress and lack of appetite, and inability to focus was really becoming a problem.  This REALLY helped with my focus, but my appetite came back STRONG!  This is now one of my favorite strains for relief.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. This review is on behalf of Mrs. Mule, who is a PTSD patient and will be less than complete since it is more from my observation and less from my direct experience of this weed. As soon as she took some she started feeling a little sick to her stomach. My take on that is that she was getting first signs of immanent attack, triggered by the smoke. She then went to bed and within a few minutes was shaking and moaning. I talked with her and got her to eat a little string cheese and crackers, thinking she might be so hungry her tummy was hurting. That seemed to help. When I left the room ten minutes or so later she was still having an attack but it was pretty mild. Since she never did call for me from her room I can only assume she did get to sleep relatively quickly, so the effects subsided shortly after I left. My conclusion? I don&#39;t think she can deal with anything Haze, even with high CBD. Critical Cure has been working well for her during the day. Rubber Cement, a GG#4xAfghani cross, had been her night smoke but finding it is near to impossible without a four or five hour round-trip drive. \u000a\u000aIs Medi Haze for you? I don&#39;t know. I can smoke it fine, but for Mama Mule, no. Her PTSD doesn&#39;t go well with it. For another PTSD patient it might be fine.
