VI saw an episode of Strain Hunters when they went to Africa and found the pure Malawi Gold so when my boy told me he had a Hybridized 70 Malawi gold/ 30 silver haze his buddy just finished curing after a year and a half.. So i bought this surprisingly expensive bud which had that signature sativa stringiness and sweet smell plus the resin production of haze so i knew i was in for a good time.. I made Rosin and BAM right away i was in euphoric heaven.. Its like all the positive things a sativa has to offer with absolutely no paranoia or ill thoughts at all(at least for me). So my curiosity worked out this time any sativa lover should try Malawi before they die.. See what mother nature intended a sativa to feel like..

VI HAVE FOUND MY STRAIN! I consider Malawi not so much a recreational herb as My Spiritual Ally From the Plant Kingdom.\u000a\u000aMalawi is everything you hope cannabis will be. Music sounds good, food tastes great, your bodily senses come alive and ordinary routines like stretching, massaging your feet and washing your face feel AMAZING. At the same time, your mind sparkles with curiosity and clarity; my first time out I was able to absorb myself in a creative project that I had been putting off for a while because I just wasn\u2019t \u201cfeeling it,\u201d but which I now was able to connect with emotionally and aesthetically. \u000a\u000aMalawi takes you to a place of 100% honesty with yourself \u2014 a place where you can look at your life without fear, shame or wishful thinking, and see clearly what improvements can be made.  Malawi gives me the freedom of mind to dream big about my future, while at the same time giving me the clarity to plan, in zero-bullshit terms, how I can achieve those dreams. This is definitely a problem-solver\u2019s strain (and probably also great for playing games of strategy like chess or go, if that&#39;s your thing.)\u000a\u000aThe odor of this flower is wild, strong, earthy, mythic.  Definitely smells like something that would grow in Middle Earth, Wakanda or in the magical forest of Princess Mononoke. One whiff of it and you know your nose is plugging directly into some serious Ancient Vegetable Intelligence. \u000a\u000aA very smooth, pleasant launch. While some strains might make you feel like you\u2019ve been shot out of a cannon, Malawi lifts you up gently. After vaping a tiny amount, I felt like I was taking off in a solar-powered glider, easing out onto warm thermal updrafts lofting me up into a wide and welcoming blue sky. \u000a\u000aShortly thereafter I had a vision of a female pixie - who looked like young BernNadette Stanis, (the actor who played Thelma on the 70s sitcom Good Times, whom as a kid I had a celebrity crush on) dressed in an amazing green furry faery costume, fluttering around me on emerald green butterfly wings, urging me to smile and relax. And I certainly did! I was suffused with a sense of warm, happy arousal which, as a person living with Depression, I feel rarely, and was most welcome.\u000a\u000aAt the risk of sounding like a hippie cliche: I live in an apartment overlooking a park, and at a certain point around sunset I looked out at all the people jogging, strolling, walking their dogs, and I felt a crazy Walt Whitman-esque love for EVERYBODY. Cynics may snort at this, but if you\u2019ve been there, you know what I\u2019m talking about. The human brain contains many programs, and one of those programs is a feeling of familial love for ALL your fellow humans. You don\u2019t need cannabis to launch this program, but if you\u2019re stuck in day-to-day stress loops, it certainly helps.\u000a\u000aNegatives: Cottonmouth comes on strong, so have some water or a tasty beverage close at hand. Your balance will be off so don\u2019t try riding a bicycle or \u201cbouldering\u201d at the rock climbing gym. \u000a\u000aIncredibly, this was $10 a gram (the lowest price point) at my local dispensary. I purchased a few other \u201ctop shelf\u201d strains (Golden Goat, Holy Grail) for more than double the price, but they did not compare to this humble yet mighty Malawi. Apparently it\u2019s not an easy flower to keep in stock, so if your local dispensary has it, do yourself a favor and snatch some up!

VThis is one of the top strains in Southern Africa. Usually found in corn cobs, africans also get the buds directly from Malawi. With it being an old growing region, with growers that take pride in thier product, you can find great produce. However majority arrives with quite a few seeds. But still a good smoke.

VReview for the strain &quot;Equanimity&quot; (Strawberry Chunk {Strawberry Cough \u2640 x Deep Chunk \u2642} \u2640 x Heirloom Malawi \u2642):\u000aI obtained a gram from Farma in Portland, OR. Tested at 29.7% THC. Grown &quot;in house&quot; by Newcleus, using &quot;organic living soil&quot; method. \u000aI have had my eye on this strain for some time, as I am always eager to try landrace genetics. I expected this to be a sativa dominant strain, however I was surprised to find that Farma lists this as a &quot;relaxing&quot; (indica-dom) strain, based upon their system that classifies strains based upon their effect vs more traditional sativa/hybrid/indica categories. \u000aThis strain is phenomenal. I would describe this as a versatile day or nighttime indica. For its staggering potency, this strain is remarkably non-stupefying. I found myself clear-headed, while all anxiety melted away into a blissfully mellow, happy head space. Profound relaxation and physical ease is achieved without laziness or fatigue. The strain does carry the sativa-like ability to lift low spirits and obliterate depression, but without some of the more psychedelic/inside-your-head effects common to sativa strains, thus making conversation easy and not impacting short term memory and focus. Effects are fairly long-lived and there is no abrupt come-down/crash/burn-out. \u000aI have depressive tendencies along with (to a lesser extent) anxious tendencies, and I find that these issues are best helped by sativa-dom and indica-dom strains, respectively. Few strains are able to tackle both these issues with equal effectiveness. Therefore, I tend to prefer the sativas, but I sometimes am looking for an indica to specifically target and melt away my anxiety. The problem is that in some instances indicas can take me too low and aggravate my depression or leave me feeling too tired, unmotivated, and too heavy to do anything but eat everything in sight and then pass out. For these reasons, I find the aptly named Equanimity to be the best &quot;indica-dom&quot; strain to mellow me out, ease anxiety, and lift my spirits. It&#39;s unique traits make it suitable to use anytime throughout the day (even morning). For me, I would not hesitate to use this strain before work, school, social activities, or exercise - it is perfect, but probably not the best strain if you&#39;re looking to put your brain on the frying pan or induce a mini-coma to combat insomnia. \u000aI find the flavor/aroma fairly unremarkable, other than that it is an exceptionally smooth, pleasurable smoke. But it is a visually stunning flower, absolutely caked in glistening trichomes. Just beautiful. \u000aI will definitely be heading back out to Farma to stock up on some more before it runs out. \u000aExceptional!

VWhen I find a strain like African Buzz (a variant of Malawi Gold) I get very excited. As it is a 100% Sativa strain the body high is lacking and so I do need to smoke more before I begin to really notice the THC activating but the effects are much preferable to an Indica Dominant strain like Northern Lights. African Buzz/Malawi Gold is the perfect strain for daily cannabis use. I like smoking a lot but I\u2019m also a busy guy so I can\u2019t have couch lock sitting in when i\u2019m trying to get shit done. After smoking a few bowls a I feel energized, uplifted and my creativity begins to flow. \u000aThe smell and taste of this strain certainly leaves a lot of be desired. When I was buying the 8th my friend remarked \u201cthat smells exactly like the Zoo\u201d and to be honest it sorta does. The smell is dominated by an earthy and slightly flowery fragrance - almost like the straw found on the floor of the elephant habitat. The taste isn\u2019t particularly pleasant either. It\u2019s that stereotypical grassy taste that you might generally associate with lower quality shake. There is some hint of a fruity aftertaste but not in the notable way like a bug of Blueberry Cheesecake.\u000aOverall 4 out of 5 stars. I love pure sativas and i\u2019m very happy to be smoking on this but there are other sativas with a bigger punch and a better taste.

VPurchased Golden Malawi from Shore Naturals LLC in Maryland. \u000a\u000aBeautiful, well cured buds. Smokes easy and is delicious. Pretty quick body high, followed by a creeper of an energetic head high. I find I can have great conversations on this strain, and feed off the mounting euphoria of connecting with others while on this bud. Highly recommend for daytime use, or social use.

VVery pleasant taste. Within the first 10-15 minutes, I felt completely relaxed. A few moments after that I felt a sudden sense of euphoria like someone had opened the window and a spring breeze had come through the air. My back went from having achy, sharp pains to being able to simply stand or sit without wincing. My shoulder and knees went from horrible movie excruciating pain to wanting play volleyball (sort of). When I thought it was mellowing out, after quite some time, I thought I needed more. I stood to get a drink only to feel that spring breeze all over again. Needless to say, the relief is pretty lasting. \u000a

VExcellent Sativa.  A semi-rare strain that hails from the cradle of life: Africa.  Strong, heady high that precedes a nice, energetic body buzz.  High in THC.

I recommend walking around the park while high on Malawi, or sitting on your porch listening to the birds. At night, it\u2019s great for watching trippy stuff. 3 rips in right now.

VTough to review this with 100 percent certainty. I have been smoking on some Purple Malawi. I was advised by the tender, that it was bred Malawi X Purp Haze. I sense all Sativa. It is not a good strain for bedtime. I get a relaxed focus, but very energetic. Even after being awake 24+ hours, I tried some. This was a mistake but, my mind is focused, but racing. That is why I felt the need to review. Great taste, great cerebral. I am technically reviewing my shop&#39;s version of Malawi. I would stick to the Purple Haze, on the other end of these hybrid genetics. I felt the need to do one good review. As I am looking to get regular sleep patterns, this Sativa does not work for my brain. Other Sativa strains can help me with sleep. Maybe that&#39;s what others are looking for, maybe it is this genetics. This specific Malawi, is a brain stone!

V\u000aChuang Tzu and his old master, Lao Tzu, are against culture. \u000aThey are for nature, pure nature. \u000aTrees are in a better position than you, even birds, fishes in the river, \u000aare in a better position because they are more alive, \u000athey dance more to the rhythm of nature. \u000aYou have completely forgotten what nature is.\u000aYou have condemned it to the very root.\u000a\u000aAnd if you want to condemn nature you have to start by condemning sex, because the whole of nature arises out of it. \u000aThe whole of nature is an overflowing of sex energy, of love. \u000aThe birds sing, the trees flower \u2013 this is all sexual energy, exploding. \u000aFlowers are sex symbols, the singing of the birds is sexual, \u000athe whole of Tao is nothing but sex energy \u000a\u2013 the whole of nature propagates itself,\u000aloves itself, moves into deeper ecstasies of love and existence.\u000a\u000aIf you want to destroy nature condemn sex, condemn love, \u000acreate moral concepts around life. \u000aThose moral concepts, howsoever beautiful they look, \u000awill be like marble graves and you will be there inside them. \u000aSome-drunkard may think that you know what life is,\u000athat you know how to live, \u000abut anyone who is in HIS state of awareness is in no state even to call you alive.\u000a\u000aYour morality is a sort of death:\u000abefore death kills you, the society kills you.\u000aThat is why Chuang Tzu\u2019s message is one of the most dangerous, \u000athe most revolutionary, the most\u000arebellious \u2013 because he says: \u000aAllow nature! \u000aAnd don\u2019t give any goal to nature. \u000aWho are you to create goals and purposes? \u000aYou are just a tiny part, an atomic cell.\u000aWho are you to force the whole to move according to you?\u000a\u000aThis is most dangerous for people who are religious, \u000afor people who are moralistic puritans. \u000aThis is a most dangerous message.\u000aThis means break all the barriers, \u000aallow nature to erupt \u000a\u2013 dangerous it is.\u000a\u000aI repeat again, Chuang Tzu is very rebellious. \u000aHe says: Nature, energy and the ecstasy that comes by overflowing,\u000aand the balance that happens spontaneously, is enough. \u000aThere is no need for effort,\u000aSo much beauty happens all around in nature without any effort:\u000aa rose is beautiful without any effort, \u000aa cuckoo goes on singing without any effort....\u000aLook at a deer, alive, full of energy, fast.\u000aLook at a hare, so alert, so aware, that even a Buddha may become jealous.\u000aLook at nature everything is so perfect.\u000a\u000aCan you improve upon a rose? \u000aCan you improve on nature in any way? \u000aOnly man has gone wrong somewhere. \u000aIf the rose is beautiful without any effort on its part, why not man? \u000aWhat is wrong with man?\u000aIf stars remain beautiful without any effort, \u000awithout any of Patanjali\u2019s yoga sutras, why not man? \u000aMan is part of nature, just as stars are.\u000a\u000aSo Chuang Tzu says: Be natural, and you will flower. \u000aIf this understanding enters you, deeper and deeper and deeper,\u000athen all effort becomes meaningless. \u000aThen you are not constantly making arrangements for the future, \u000athen you live here and now, \u000athen this moment is all, \u000athen this moment is eternity. \u000aAnd Buddhahood is already the case, you are already a Buddha. \u000aThe only thing that is missing is ,\u000athat you have not given it any chance to flower ,\u000abecause you are so engaged in your own projects.\u000a\u000a- OSHO

VI&#39;m new to smoking weed and the 1st time and the only times I&#39;ve ever smoked weed so far, it was Malawi Gold, and I must say the 1st time it only kicked after like 12 min and it was a really chilled vibe after that, the 2nd time I did it it hit me really hardcore and I only smoked 2 medium J&#39;s, and it was really great. Some people say that if u drink after you take a hit, it kicks in fast so that&#39;s what I did with the 2 medium J&#39;s and well yeah that&#39;s my story/opinion on this strain but yeah its pretty strong cuz after those 2 J&#39;s I was out for the count &#128076;
