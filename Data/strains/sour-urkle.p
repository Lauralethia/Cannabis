VAmazing smell and smoke. Great relaxed high. The mental creativity is great too. Just wish high lasted a little longer. I\u2019d say 1-2 hours max depending on how much you\u2019ve smoked. I am a daily smoker with a high tolerance and the first time I  smoked 2 bongs of this it rocked me within minutes. Great strain if you want a indica heavy high

VAmazing looking strain! Light green with hints of purple sprouting up through each bud; long orange hairs looking like Ron Weasley, with crystals covering each night like you\u2019re gazing at a night sky full of stars. Delicious berry taste, a top tier in my opinion if you like fruity tasting strains. Superb body n head high mixture, though it feels like it leans more on the Indica side. It\u2019s a heavy hitter that\u2019ll make its presence known immediately. lol

VOn point with the description! Dense buds all .4-.9 grams. Lighter green color with yellower orange hairs. Real frosty (23%thc), the smell is a small kick of pungent goodness. haha It&#39;s a wonderful aroma really! The smoke is very smooth imo. Not much for taste going in, but coming out you had that light airy fruity somewhat pungent taste. I don&#39;t want to say it was that of your S.D. kinda pungent but similar. It was just... airy light and sweetly fruityish. If you consider yourself a veteran or heavy smoker as I see someone else said in a review this strain only kicks for 30 to an hour... Good for novice users or light users. I smoke .6 grams too. I feel H strains seem to be short lived though...  Sour Urkle - worth a try!

VI&#39;ve always thought of sour urkel as sour diesels little brother. It carries that gas taste while having overall maintaining a light taste composition.  Not to overpowering, but plenty of flavor to notice other than ash. My batch looked pretty good, mostly green in color. Great smell! I ended up rolling most of the bud into joints and that is still my favorite way so smoke diesel strains.

Vi had this strain when i started up smoking again and i was gone for a couple days. sure i smoked over five moderate sized bowls, but i really liked it. i would do this again. it gave my mind such a rush that i feel like i probably exploded. the long-lasting effects, however, did not agree with me. it was a massive hangover. still would do it again.

VYeah, this strain does it all. It&#39;s heavy while being light. It&#39;s energizing while being relaxing. It&#39;s a really nice strain, but can feel a bit powerful, so it may be better to take small tokes if smoking, or lower dosed edibles if ingesting, because this stuff is strong.

VOh my, what a wonderful balance between a spicy berry and standard diesel flavor (smells like diesel too). Sour Urkle hits me HARD and it&#39;s one of the few strains that truly screams &quot;hybrid&quot; to me. It stimulates appetite, it promotes sleep, it gives energy, it initiates introspection, it makes you crave social interaction, it&#39;s got it all. One of my favorites after the first taste,
