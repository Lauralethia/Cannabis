VOne word: wow.  Slow clap.  This is a phenomenal sativa-dominant hybrid,  calming while remaining cerebral and energetic.  Awesome visual effects, a walk outside was incredible.  Gave me the munchies something fierce though.  \u000a\u000aThis was a hand-roll from Mister Bills of Buckley.  I normally vape, but treated myself with a J which may be why I found it so delightful.

VBlack haze- Pioneer Nuggets\u000aOne of the most unique looking strains I have every laid my eyes on. The darkest purple you can imagine with touches of green and orange sprinkled throughout. Very gentle high perfect for daytime use. Clear minded while being very uplifting and social.

VI been exploring higher cbd strains. 4.36 % thc and 9.56% cbd. for me this was a perfect pick. I&#39;ve been hesitant to smoke much because of my anxiety and PTSD but this just diminished all of those feelings. I can feel a little high without the negative paranoia affects I would normally get on higher thc based strains. I would definitely purchase this again. as for smell, it wasn&#39;t so appealing and taste is not the best but it wins in the effects. \u000a\u000aI recommend this strain if you suffer from anxiety and PTSD like myself or if you prefer higher cbd. This percentage of thc and cbd was just my fit.

VThis strain really made my day. I&#39;ve been doing a lot of sampling strains lately and all of them have been exceptional quality, but Black Haze was special. Its color is such a dark, rich purple and the aroma, especially when broken a little,\u000aIs more than just eye-watering and powerful, but has a smell totally unique. Definitely a strong &quot;purple&quot; base, but with an entire boquet of sweet, heavenly\u000ascents all its own. This is like something I&#39;d smoke if I were in a fantastic dream.\u000aMy Black Haze was labeled as being only\u000a12% THC but that only made it a better choice for me. Happy, heavenly bliss, not a blow from a sledge hammer. I&#39;ll be back in black soon.

VI originally gave this a 2 star. I changed my mind. This does make me sleepy. not good for day time use as I was told, but it has a nice head high. Although it makes me tired it gave me enough energy and motivation to make a cauliflower grilled cheese. Don&#39;t ask. it&#39;s not worth the time. But I will say, I am a really good cook while high.

VHad it last nigh 7% THC 12% CBD felt high without the paranoid feeling... I&#39;m still looking for something with less THC . Not looking to get stoned, just want the pain to go. I&#39;ve found that here in Washington at most of the recreational spots only have high THC percentage with very little CBD. But Black Haze was to bad for me.

VI got this black haze at the green door in Buckley. it from omg Sykes. This is a sativa dominate strain that does not disappoint.  Comes on kind of slow at the start but ramps up to a really clear headed, relaxing buzz. I had so issues getting stuff down while smoking this through out the day. the buds are a real nice dark purple, with dark green sugar leaf. the buds I got are not real dense. I like a real dense tight nug. the smell is amazing. It has a strong piney/floral smell. it really is a pleasant smell. it taste exactly how it smells. the taste stayed through out the whole bowl. omg Sykes is a grower I really like. I have had quit a bit of there strains. while not all are great none have been utterly disappointing. it&#39;s all quality. if your local shop has this give it a try. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed. quality smoke for sure.

VI give 4 stars. While I think its cool that cannabis can produce fruity smells, it is not what I prefer. I personally just like my buds to smell earthy and piney. However, the high is absolutely amazing!! Very euphoric and instantly a rush of creativity! Love it! Oh and not at all sleepy after!

VThis stuff will make you feel fantastic... If! IF you can get past the *cruddy* flavor.\u000a\u000aThis is by FAR the worst tasting strain I have ever tried. Normally I love the flavor of weed, even if it is a little diesely or skunky. This stuff, however, tastes like shoe leather, asphault, dandelions, and Starbucks Tribute Blend coffee.\u000a\u000aThat said, I still gave it four whole stars, because the effects are very nice.  Very very nice.\u000a\u000aMore details:  great for daytime. I don&#39;t really want to be sitting or lying down, but I don&#39;t want to be running or even jogging either. Yoga, walking, doing light chores, or a leisurely ride on a bicycle on a sunny spring day are recommended activities.\u000a\u000aHigh is cerebral, but in more of an emotional way than an intellectual one. Its a little creative, but barely. Mostly theres just a feeling of increased wellbeing and intuition. Possibly also the giggles. No paranoia noted, nor anxiety exacerbated.\u000a\u000aAlso this stuff made EuroTrip an enjoyable movie, despite/between all the insufferable SA jokes. So there&#39;s that.\u000a\u000aP.S. Scotty doesn&#39;t know... How that bottle of scotch ended up becoming a structural component of the warp core.
