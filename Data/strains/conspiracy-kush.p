VI LOVE THIS STRAIN!  I am a Space Queen anything lover. Tru|med you have done an amazing job on your new shatter pen strain! Hands down, it is in your top 3 strains and I hope is available continously ;) Conspiracy Kush stayed true to its parents with a light and floaty head, but not too spacey. There is a heaviness behind the eyes. Sooo mellow from head to toe, without couch-lock. You can enjoy going out with friends to writing reviews to watching a movie to crashing into a nap. She&#39;s a sweet citrus creeper EVERYONE should partake in, for sure!

VI fell in love with Conspiracy Kush. I purchased an eight for my birthday in March and have smoked a bowl in the evenings when I needed to really relax and let go of the day&#39;s stress. This had a sweet smoke, not a lot of taste but wonderful effects of calming, sedative, bring you to sleep almost. I love it when a strain is like that and Conspiracy Kush is just that, I wish I bought more or went back to Stumptown before it ran out. I am now going to seek out this as a strain to eventually grow.

VI really like this strain. Comes on smooth and heavy. A good strain for a veteran smoker towards the end of the day. Offers enough cerebral effect to keep you awake but kicks your butt like an indica should. Not a good strain for functioning normal in public. Hashy earth flavor  with tangy citrus and sweet musk.

VMy dispensary had an amazing deal on this heavy indica, so after looking at the nugs, I picked up a ton of it. The buds were large, were crystallized like crazy and smelled strongly of sweet sandalwood.  Smoking it gives a strong earthy taste, with hints of sweetness and pine and / or sandalwood. Hard to tell exactly but it is tasty.\u000a\u000aIt begins with a strong, cloudy, but relaxing head high which after about 15 minutes gives way to a very strong body high. This is total couch lock and it feels like I&#39;m wearing a thick, warm, tingly blanket from head to toe. \u000a\u000aWonderful weed, but definitely a nighttime smoke.

VWas gifted this particular strain by a good buddy and he knocked this one out of the park. He knows I (and the lovely bride) am partial to indicas and found this particular strain when he couldn&#39;t locate his favorite (and one of mine)...Presidential Kush. Now this was some great looking candy...covered in gorgeous frosty trichomes and phenomenal purple hues just bouncing off the bright greens. I was immediately stoked. I thought there would be similar nose appeal but it was a bit subdued. Ahhh...remember what they say about the quiet ones folks. After grinding enough up for an evening joint, the wife and I lit up and POW! BAM! ZING! Holy smoke Batman!! (SWIDT?)  We both were floored by how fast and hard this one hits you. I checked the label the following day only to learn the THC content was an astounding 29% which explains a lot. It was a remarkably smooth smoke but neither of us could really describe the taste when we tried not 5 minutes after sparking up. Too high already I guess. The effects started out heady as hell but 15-20 minutes in and it just washed over our entire bodies to the point where you could feel every little sensation multiplied 10-fold. Quite the experience. Kudos to the guitar buddy for this wonderful gift. We&#39;ll be looking for this one in the near future.

It has a sweet earthy smell, with a hint of fruitiness. Beautiful green and purple dense bud, grinds very fine but smokes like a dream. Smooth earthy sweet taste as well, with a very relaxing body and head high.

This particular strain will make you think Sharknado is an Oscar winner. \u000a\u000aFor those needing a good &#39;body-high&#39;, this won&#39;t really do it. But, it will make you feel relaxed at a psychological level. I would give this strain a 5/5, but for me it is just a tad too dry on the esophagus going down.

They recommended this and after trying it; it became my new favorite strain. Not only did it help with my symptoms but it also relives insomnia. Which is fantastic for those trying to fix sleeping schedules or in need of a good nights rest.\u000a\u000aAll around you can find various orange hairs with beautiful purple and green leaves covered in a thick coat of frost. Conspiracy Kush has a nice berry smell with a taste that matches. \u000a\u000a5 stars for this presidential space beauty

I&#39;m a pretty seasoned smoker, but I was so high I couldn&#39;t believe it was &quot;only&quot; 17% THC. Definitely do recommend if you&#39;re looking for a fun night-time strain that won&#39;t keep you up all night, but won&#39;t force you into unconsciousness before the party&#39;s even started.
