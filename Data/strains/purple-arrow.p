VOne of the best most potent strains of bud I have ever smoked. I am an avid smoked with a high tolerance (no pun intended) and this shit knocked me on my ass in 3 hits off thr pipe. This strain is popular in the puget sound region but this is a bud you just gotta give a chance but be warned; the purple arrow of the Cannabis Huntress may strike right in your forhead.

VWell well. Isn&#39;t that a deep subject?  And isn&#39;t this one heck of a nicely balanced product indeed.  It comes on slowly but doesn&#39;t feel like a creeper. Nor does it hit all at once. More so, it feels like it has stages. The first stage is, &quot;hmm, nothing, I&#39;ll take another hit&quot;.  The second stage is, oh that just tastes good, is smooth, and feels nice so I&#39;m going to take another just because its nice.&quot; Third stage - well well, isn&#39;t this one heck of a nicely balanced product.  :)   This may very well be my favorite, running a close race with Blue Dream.  The body is relaxed, the mind is open and quiet yet attentive. The need to rush disappears. Colors seem a bit more vivid. Overall, a fine selection for me. Your mileage may vary of course, as always.

VThe first sentence of the strain description is exactly correct:  When it comes to knocking out pain, NO medical strain hits the target quite like Purple Arrow.  \u000a\u000aOr comes anywhere close.\u000a\u000aI have severe pain from lumbar arthritis, and I swear, Purple Arrow makes me think I have cannabinoid receptors in my back.  The pain relieving/anti-inflammatory properties of this strain come mostly from the  Black Domina side of the family, while the pleasant-but-not-overwhelming head buzz comes from the Permafrost side.\u000a\u000aReally, really fine Purple Arrow is unquestionably the best weed I&#39;ve ever had, and I will go well out of way to get it.  But beware: sometimes, what&#39;s sold as Purple Arrow is actually Permafrost.  TRUE Purple Arrow had a very distinct &quot;bite&quot; to its smell, also from it&#39;s Black Domnia ancestry.

Vin my zeal to try as many strains as possible, I rarely try a given strain more than 3x (I&#39;m just not the pothead I used to be - sigh), but this strain has so many &#39;uses&#39; that it&#39;s won my popularity contest - if the measure is frequency of use. a budtender recommended it for going to a concert so I wouldn&#39;t be jumping out of my chair - or nodding out. he was right; it was perfect for that - but it&#39;s also got other great traits: it&#39;s creative, clear-headed, and unusually analgesic (I think I&#39;ve noticed a correlation between purple strains and analgesic, but more &#39;research&#39; is necessary). it doesn&#39;t make you get too much into your thoughts, which makes sense since it&#39;s a hybrid, not a full-on sativa, and, as if that wasn&#39;t good enough, every sample I&#39;ve had of this has been quite potent. definitely worth picking up if you see it; it never sticks around long, from what I&#39;ve seen.

VMy strains for pain so far:\u000a\u000a1.  Purple Arrow - Like it&#39;s name suggests it targets pain very quickly, and you can still mow the lawn or paint a portrait immediately after medicating.  No real plateau, and no need to smoke into oblivion.  Slightly lower in THC than most strains these days, and that&#39;s fine with me.  Also very productive.\u000a\u000a2.  East Coast Sour Diesel - Great to toke when drinking your morning coffee and reading the news (back pain free).  A very CLEAR high.  Watch out, though.  This high has no plateau, and you will be too high to function on anything other than vedging out if you smoke too much.\u000a\u000a3.  Hell&#39;s OG (f.k.a. Hell&#39;s Angel OG) - The best &quot;knock you out&quot; strain pretty much ever.  Great for killing pain but get ready to CRAWL into bed or lay on the couch shortly after.  Too much of this strain will first put you into an almost LSD-like psychedelic high.  Great for sleepless PTSD after the first 15-20 minutes.  If you suffer from Pain/Insomnia/PTSD this is the greatest stuff ever.\u000a\u000a4.  Trainwreck - Also great for pain, but first 20 minutes is pure psychedelia before targeting pain and slowing down to a more Indica-type high.  Will also put you to sleep after about 90 minutes.\u000a\u000aI would live happy with a lifetime supply of these 4 herbs.  No specific order except for PA which I consider Pain Enemy #1.\u000a\u000a5.  Gorilla Glue - Great smoke, great high.  Might put you to sleep after 90 minutes or so.  I almost left this out just because there are better strains for pain out there.  But also, a good pain strain, and also good for insomnia.\u000a\u000aJust my $0.02...

VTerrific strain.  We&#39;ve bought the strain from two different growers, but both seem to carry the same effects.  I&#39;m a little confused about the genetics of this strain, however.  Some folks mention that it is a cross between Black Domina and Permafrost; but by and large, the information I keep getting recently traces Purple Arrow to a cross between Purple Afghani and Hindu Kush.  The sativa effects are pretty far in the background, I&#39;d say, but there is definitely a wonderful euphoria lurking in there, something you feel right away.  Mostly, we find the strain to be relaxing -- great with pains -- and deeply arousing.  The arousal, of course, is one of the main reasons my wife and I keep returning to it.  It&#39;s quite terrific during the first hour or so.  It will always be one of our main go-to strains.

VThis strain seems very effective for what it is supposed to do: deliver reliable pain and nausea relief while adding a relaxing feeling that is not intimidatingly intense.  Good strain at anytime of the day, alone or to mix with other strains.  Which brings me to my 3-star rating: although delivering exactly what it is supposed to I prefer other high CBD strain, specifically Harliquin, and hybrids that deliver the same medicinal benefits with more potent positive psychoactive affects (such as statins that deliver better energetic or more expansive relaxed states effects .  Otherwise, this strain would do well for those who wish to medicate without feeling significantly altered.

VVery relaxing and helps with headaches.  I like that it doesn&#39;t feel too stoney.  I tend to use this when Blue Dream doesn&#39;t work or I&#39;ve had BD too recently and i need to switch it up. The only downside is the voracious appetite I get. The word &quot;munchies&quot; doesn&#39;t even describe it.  Most strains actually don&#39;t give me the munchies. I guess I&#39;ve been lucky that way. One hour in, Purple Arrow makes me feel like I didn&#39;t eat all day, even though I just had three squares. A day of meticulously counted calories goes out the window and I HAVE to eat. Two-hours in, I suddenly feel so tired that I can&#39;t keep my eyes open and I have to drag myself to bed. This is OK but I&#39;m not generally looking for a sleep aid - that&#39;s not my issue.  But really, if I&#39;ve prepared for both of these outcomes in advance, PA makes a great pain reliever without any anxiety or paranoia, which is paramount for me in any strain.

VAs advertised Purple Arrow is great.  Several years ago I had a tumor removed from my lower spine.  The procedure required removal of a section of vertebrae and the installation of rods to hold my spine in place where the section was removed.  I can now move around a lot better but pain is a constant.  I was on morphine for years and I was concerned that my  liver was paying the price of using morphine.  In August of this year I started weaning myself off the morphine and found that the Purple Arrow did the job controlling pain.  I will never let Morphine or any other drug control me again.  Thanks again Purple Arrow.

VThis strain is a mix between permafrost and black domina, and the results are fantastic.  Smell and taste is piney and earthy, not impressive at all but that&#39;s not even an afterthought after you feel its effects.  Very high in CBD indica that will have even the most seasoned smokers fully medicated in every sense of the word.  This is a VERY strong medical strain, careful though it will zombify you if you don&#39;t respect it, and you will be too high to function.  Heed my warnings.

VI had high hopes for this strain, based on reviews that I saw here and elsewhere. But for those who are in real pain and looking for a flower version of Vicodin or other heavy pain med, this is not it. It&#39;s good, but for me, it is not the knockout pain med that I was hoping for. I have tried this a few times, and while very nice, it was not as effective as Fucking Incredible or Blueberry for easing chronic back pain and relaxing muscles. I will try it again, might be the batch I got, but it&#39;s not what I hoped for.

VReally great strain for pain relief, also gives a nice mild high that keeps you focused, sociable and alleviates depression and anxiety. I have bone spurs in my foot so severe they&#39;ve been shaved off during surgery and still there was substantial pain. This does a fantastic job of minimizing or removing that pain. This is now my new favorite strain. Try it, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Seems to have a bit of a lavender taste, just something I noticed, not objectionable.

VI was looking for a strain that would help me with pain and discomfort from an eye surgery.  After 3 separate sessions on different days, all that it did was give me headaches,  The high was alright but nothing too wonderful.  Better smoked than vaporizing.  YMMV

VJIZ Jamming...this is some lovely stuff. I got this on tip...straight had to pass on the goodness.\u000a\u000aNever even considered how smooth something hit, unless it was harsh but this is like champagne versus vinegar. \u000a\u000aInstantly zooms in on your head and leaves your body trailing after. Absolute new favorite indeed...most suitable for social times, or anytime ;) you are in the mood to get seriously lifted.

VI was surprisingly shocked for the price I paid (which was very good) that it was such a good strain.  Comes on instantly, hits strong and goes straight to the head.  \u000a\u000aAs for the pain, I would have to disagree.  This would not work well for people with chronic pain.  PA did help with nausea very well though. \u000a\u000aKept me happy, stress-free, and calm.  My motivation goes down on this strain, but not so low that I can&#39;t do anything and am couch locked.  I still managed normal house duties such as helping with homework, cooking meals, cleaning, etc-but with a little more effort than I would like.\u000a\u000aTaste is pretty good- some earth flavors and a very faint sweet taste at times.\u000a  \u000aSmall buds, and easily turns to shake quickly which was a downer for me.  Smell isn&#39;t over powering and is light.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you are coming home from a long day at work, this is a great strain to unwind with.   Will help you sleep like a champ.

VA solid strain, smells wonderful with a sticky and dense product that packs a wallop. Just one strong pipe hit gets me quite high and a second pipe hit is blissful. \u000a\u000aMy only warning is if you consume too much, you&#39;ll get nasty cotton mouth and probably a headache a few hours later.\u000a\u000aGreat for chronic pain management.

VHate it. This strain did F-all for me after puffing away at *plenty*. Not the slightest bit of pain relief, not a single yawn in the way of helping with sleep. Just a very mild generic, dirtweed type of stoned feeling that I despise.  This is a confused and broken strain in my opinion.
