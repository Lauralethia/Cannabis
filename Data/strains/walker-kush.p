VVery Dank, and super fluffy these have huge amounts of trichromes all over these rounded boulder nuggets. The Look: A complex pattern of red orange hairs covering more of the bud than these dark sage looking leafs. The frostiness flakes off when breaking them off into the grinder cured to perfection to wet and not dry a mix in between.\u000aThe Smell: A light of the chemdawg is definitely in here I can totally smell the afghan in here as well sort of a herbal light chemdawg smell like that of a chemical notes and a soapy aroma peaks my interest.\u000aThe Toke/Taste: Super heavy thick bag at 190C, very chemical tasting with hints of floral\u000aI can feel the focus concentrating me and giving me a large dose of energy and creativity I will be doing this energy booster for sure and its a bit funky tasting like woody. very thick vape and would choke any novice or medium user. I would recommend walker kush for those who feel like their legs are super heavy and just don&#39;t have the energy to do anything. One of the reasons for my mdd is that I do not have a normal energy like its completely depleted all the time. You gotta try this it affects me in a way that I look forward to doing a lot of chores and seeing responsibility as a choice not as an imprisonment walker kush helps me a lot with my lack of energy and motivation. I suffer from a list of ailments from ADHD to schizophrenia, the ghost linage helps me tune out the voice and act completely normal, do you know how wonderful it is not to have a walking nightmare, this Walker Kush is making me walk with confidence.

VThe Look: Super Oynx Black purple and almost brown in trichs I was surprised to see this being sold at 14.5%thc normally they sell 18% and above. However these small nugs have like a blueberry bush look to them if you can picture a cartoon drawing of it :D. ?The Smell: It smelled like super chemical like tar mixed with ginger snaps, chemical aroma.\u000aThe Toke: The bag vapor was thick and was incredibly tasty like if a termite had mahogany wood and hard hitting me like a bruce banner. I felt my enerhy and focus increase It really helps with what it says. ADD/ADHD. I am also looking for ghost town strain to do a review next thats legendary, I finally have some. I recommend this specific for mood and  concentration issues if you are looking to be your own rockstar party of one and things done I highly recommend those. Who just have a little more energy than some people or if you&#39;re looking for that excitement back its a great inspiration! Just figured out crushed potatochips of a flavor + gf flour = great batter for fish :D

VMy all time favorite. So relaxing, but doesn&#39;t knock you out yet if you get into bed you have no problem falling asleep. Doesn&#39;t give you couch-lock either, but I&#39;m not saying that if you sit/lay down you won&#39;t feel so comfortable that you&#39;ll never want to leave.\u000a Great for stomach pain/nausea. AMAZING for anxiety and panic attacks (and probably PTSD). It doesn&#39;t make you stupid or foggy-headed. It&#39;s actually a really introspective high. Great for deep conversations or just thinking about anything. It puts you in a rational and clear, yet euphoric state of mind. Basically it&#39;s not overpowering like so many strains. You have more control over the high than it has over you. Unless you smoke too much of course ;)

VThis is my daytime go-to. If I feel a panic attack creeping on, I can take two or three puffs from my vape and I find myself grounded, clear, calm, and much more cheerful. It also doesn&#39;t relax me too much and doesn&#39;t cause drowsiness with light use - I work about 60 hours a week and am a complete insomniac so I need to remain alert. It is my life-saver. Bonus: yummy!

VMight be my new favorite strain for morning/daytime use. Pretty much the best of all worlds. Solid heady euphoric high that sets in very quickly and stays both tight and mellow for quite a long while. Adds lots of the indica style body buzz and muscle relaxation without any real tendency towards laziness or sleepiness. Also brings with it an increase in appetite and solid pain relief, in my case related specifically to arthritis and soft tissue damage in my back.

VA solid indica lean that&#39;s OK for daytime use and even workable, not overpowering, long lasting, enough happy sativa overtones to allow conversation, good pain relief for a slightly lower potency, bright green and orange, pillowy cones, nicely trimmed, piney earthy some citrus and wood, very nice from NETA.
