VThis is very hard-hitting high, even when compared to Silver Super haze weed. I took one hit of it about two hours ago and still am &quot;on one&quot;. Very potent, so use in moderation. Still, I had the giggles, felt like I was on E. Still knew where I was and who I was. But this stuff is for very experienced smokers. Not recommended for wusses.

VCannalope Haze is an odd one. The smell and taste make this one worthy of notice in itself. The effects are kind of loopy and unfocused, no doubt from the haze side. \u000a\u000aThe batch I&#39;m reviewing is decent. The nugs are very small, almost popcorn sized. The color is light green mottled with slightly darker green with red/orange hairs throughout. The smell is very sweet, with floral and fruit undertones. To me it smells more like faded strawberry than melon. Vaping it, produced a medium vapor, with the smell carrying on, for the most part, to the taste. The effects begin after about five minutes and hit with a unfocused, loopy effect. Mostly cerebral, not a lot of body effects, except for a general feeling of relaxation. Didn&#39;t make me sleepy or unusually hungry. Effects are similar to Amnesia Haze. Not my favorite, but not unpleasant under the right circumstances. I think this would be good for relaxing in the evening and watching a funny movie. It makes you forget your cares, and everything else too.

VCannalope? Oh why the Hell not. Twee name, solid bud, relaxing high. Cannalope, &#39;tho; who thought up this name? Cloud-9; Somulax; Dream Reeper -- these would all be good names for this pot. Cannalope sounds like a cross between a Cantaloupe and an Antelope. Actually, I don&#39;t think its possible to cross those two: one&#39;s a mammal and one&#39;s something people allegedly stick their dicks in. I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to knock-up a cantaloupe, despite that. Ok, so the name sucks, we all agree with that, so how&#39;s the high? Glorious! A couple of hits off a freshie and you are go for at least two hours of smiley-face. You&#39;re not going to want any Devin Townsend Project on this ride. Talk Talk&#39;s 1991 classic, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; will be a perfect co-pilot. While you&#39;re at it, you&#39;re going to want to get MIGHTY comfy because this is some majorly somatic tokage. Dim them lights and take a couple deep ol&#39; hits. Hold . . . hoooold . . . HOOOOOOOLD -- exhale! Aaaaaaaaaand melt. (Oh, shit, NOW I get it: CANNALOPE, because it&#39;s CANNABIS! Whoa, that&#39;s some pretty heavy shit right there. Damn, now how am I supposed to sneak an antelope back IN to the zoo?!)

VThis is a very pleasant &quot;All day&quot; use strain! The flavor is just that.. On the exhale, you get a mild fruit rine flavor that coats your tongue with a gentle sweetness. This is very soft on inhale, which is typical of its Mexican lineage, yet hits the back of the head like Haze does! You get quite active with it, in a relaxing approach, while your mood mellows. Again, you can even roll this, light it, and keep inhaling.. You will forget your lungs are full as you don&#39;t even notice the fill up. Not a cough on exhale. That pleasant!

VI love Indica&#39;s and tend to only smoke the indica&#39;s but the last time I went into the dispensary they had a bunch of Cannalope Haze shake on sale so I figured I would give it a try! (not knowing it was a sativa). It smoked so smoothy and left me with feeling awesome! I went back to get more assuming it was an indica from the way it affected me! So if you love indica&#39;s and want to try a sativa I say Cannalope Haze should do you right!

VSimply, this is a tremendous summer &#39;enjoy, relax and be happy&#39; strain. An uplifting immediate reaction might lead to a little upper-body dancing. A strain that not only allows you to be upright and doing stuff, but also allows you to find yourself sitting on the porch listening to music. Don&#39;t be afraid to have fun after consuming this, it becomes contagious! I would recommend this also be a daytime, or even morning, strain. For those that get dry mouth, I suggest a Gin Mule...a soothing summer citrus drink that mixes well with the tropical and sweet taste of Cantaloupe Haze.

VI&#39;m not sure how to pronounce the name but the high is amazing and I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s not better known. The high is energizing and doesn&#39;t make you feel sluggish or tired in any way. Euphoria and happiness primarily along with great bursts of creative energy and a slight aphrodisiac too.

I have PTSD, generalized anxiety, and major depression but this strain makes me really happy and euphoric, and always takes away the panic I wake up with every morning.

The high came on with a strong rush, which lasted about 40 minutes, then mellowed out into a very uplifting, energetic finish that left me feeling happy and talkative for hours. The flowers I received from Mr X were once again top-notch.

VThis bud smells so good. Waking up to this smell for a wake and bake got me in a good mood. The buds are small with orange hairs and a nice sparkle under them, I could also see small purple patches on the bud. Its also super soft and fluffy to touch, when i broke open a small bud the smell of mangos and that fruity niceness came at me more. \u000a\u000aThe small bud that I threw into my Grinder didn&#39;t break up or fluff out as much as I had hoped. It did break up fast an smooth but it&#39;s not a dense as I had thought. The fruity tones got more and more pungent once it was ground up. \u000a\u000aI smoked a bowl of Cannalope, the first hit was super smooth, it did give me a slight tickle in my throat but I didn&#39;t cough. Within a few moments after my first hit I began to feel very happy and euphoric, it wasn&#39;t very overpowering at first but as i finished my bowl it grew greater and greater. The good vibes began to roll. I felt very energetic, the need to do something was getting to me, which is great for a wake and bake, along with a good breakfast this strain was filling me up nicely. The second I finished the bowl and sat down on my bed I was happy to be lying down to some food, a good tv show and the sun glaring in on top of me. Any depression that may have been hanging off me seemed to be non existent. I felt a pressure behind my eyes and the dryness in my mouth, have some water on the go folks. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t usually try a Sativa because most Sativa&#39;s don&#39;t suit me. Paranoia, Anxiety, Racing thoughts..all the bad stuff you don&#39;t want when you smoke. Cannalope Haze had me feeling very focused, creative and mentally energetic at first, the physical side was non existent too. I was so zoned out of life yet so focused on any task at hand at the same time. It was a new sort of high for me. \u000a\u000aI did have small paranoid feelings and thoughts, I was at first fearful of conversation and worried people knew I was high. But it didn&#39;t ruin my day or effected me in such a way that I wanted to stay at home and not go out. It had the opposite effects on me.\u000a\u000aAn hour later and I&#39;m still on my bed melting into some tv show! I got up and went about my day feeling energetic and happy out. I did get a slight pressure in my head and a serious case of cotton mouth. In small amounts for me this would be my new favourite Sativa. \u000a\u000acouch&gt;

I was so zoned out of life yet so focused on any task at hand at the same time. It was a new sort of high for me. \u000a\u000aI did have small paranoid feelings and thoughts, I was at first fearful of conversation and worried people knew I was high. But it didn&#39;t ruin my day or effected me in such a way that I wanted to stay at home and not go out. It had the opposite effects on me.\u000a\u000aAn hour later and I&#39;m still on my bed melting into some tv show! I got up and went about my day feeling energetic and happy out. I did get a slight pressure in my head and a serious case of cotton mouth. In small amounts for me this would be my new favourite Sativa. \u000a\u000acouch&gt;

VI tried a cannalope-haze joint and it was great. A very strong sativa, this strain made me feel uplifted, energetic, and creative. Definitely more of a day-time medicine. The high came on with a strong rush, which lasted about 40 minutes, then mellowed out into a very uplifting, energetic finish that left me feeling happy and talkative for hours. The flowers I received from Mr X were once again top-notch.

VCannalope haze is a mainstay for me in South Jersey. Local grower mastered the strain, large sativa nugs with milky white crystals dusting it,but the motherload comes when you break it up,looks like a platinum coating inside. The smell is fresh/fruity with a hint of spice. The effects are very haze like, uplifting and energetic for most of the duration, but will level out in the end, perfect to start your day with. It makes the daytime shine, making colors seem brighter and a very happy feel with it. Also i have never had any of thise &quot;sativa anxiety moments&quot; with this strain, very good overall, the only reason i dont give it 5 stars is while the smell/look are both pleasant. Neither will be something your talking about down the road,.

She filled my lungs and took my to a new height of high... I am able to function and my funk is gone. No more pre-pms at all. Yes!!! \u000aI was also wanting to have some honey time in with the huns. My stupid funk was being a cock blocker.  Oh well Ms. Cantalope Haze blew thru that bitch and said &quot;Let your freak flag fly!&quot; and I did. I had so many orgasms and was actually hyper after our many rounds. This shall forever be a favorite.\u000aMunchies Beware Though... I have a strong urge to eat now. Make sure you surround yourself with healthy snacks or you&#39;re screwed cause you might eat anything in sight.
