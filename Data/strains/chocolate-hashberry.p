VReviewed under Hashberry prior to its listing as its own strain.\u000a\u000aMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer. \u000a\u000aPros: Strong pain relief and euphoric head high. More hybrid than straight indica. Good if you need to eat, made me quite hungry. \u000a\u000aCons: Dry eyes and some dry mouth. Little groggy after waking up, still felt some of the head effects.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Smooth draw and exhale. Taste was sweet/earthy. I could taste a light hint of dark chocolate/coffee flavor. Gradual build into euphoria, starting with a light headband effect around the brow and then behind the eyes. Body pain melted away. Effects were stronger than I expected. Head high was almost too much, but leveled out. I would recommend this if you need pain relief/relaxation combined with some euphoria. More of a nighttime strain due to sleepiness.

VI recently bought a gram of this strain from a local shop (ReLeaf, Vallejo CA) for migraine pain. It was the first time a strain actively numbed my pain. Though only the mild ones, it did nothing for the higher pain headaches.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a wonderful little bud covered in trichomes and it&#39;s always fluffy. I was attracted to it initially by look alone. It&#39;s definitely a pretty bud.

VThis is consistently the best looking bud in the shop. Others are more dense but this one is simply covered in trichomes. Its green leaves verge on tan because of this. This provides a visually appealing contrast to the orange hairs and large amounts of purple. \u000a\u000aTexturally speaking I&#39;ve found it to be fairly soft - easy to break up into small leaf fragments, but not so pliable that you need to rip it apart with 4 fingers. I&#39;m not sure how much this depends on the case-specific drying process used, though.\u000a\u000aBuzz-wise it&#39;s mellow. I think it&#39;s more suited to night time but can make for a chill day as well.\u000a\u000aSmell and taste wise, it&#39;s a bit floral and does smell like berry. I don&#39;t really get much of a chocolate taste but maybe I&#39;m not sophisticated enough to appreciate it. Despite what others have said, I haven&#39;t found this one to be particularly fragrant or tasty, which is why I give it 4/5 (really more of 4.5/5)

VChocolate smell all the way.  These buds looked amazing, thanks to Level Up in Scottsdale. Purple &amp; super frosty. Was excited to try this one, &amp; it didn\u2019t disappoint. The high was relaxing and euphoric, evoking some strange thoughts &amp; perception was a little funny.. but maybe I was just tired. Medium - strong , I liked it. I usually smoke in the evenings. Last night I took a puff before bed, didn\u2019t wake up once during the night. Fantastic for sleep.

VThis strain is not one that called out to me through appearance.  The name Chocolate Hashberry was enticing enough to get me to take a sniff from the jar.  Even that left me a little turned off with the bud giving off a light sweet grass smell.  This budtender obviously new his herb because like a true professional without a word a bud was broken open with tweezers.  Such a simple act spoke volumes in my nostrils giving off only a little of the terpenes.  Radiant. Sweet.  Spice.  \u000a\u000aThat tease brought this bud home.  Only the start of a truly special flavor experience that leaves a mark on every part of my tongue.  There is a tart raspberry like feeling on the back part of my tongue.  Ammonia on the exhale of last few puffs.  Chocolate was only smelled on my fingers when first breaking up the bud.  There is an essence of thickness in the smoke and aftertaste that could be described as Dark Belgium Cocoa.  The kind with little chocolate wafers &amp; sometimes a cinnamon stick, but no marshmallows although I prefer them. \u000aSo not like milk chocolate.  Bitter with an unmistakable spicieness that makes it unique &amp; in my opinion perfect for a chilly winter evening. \u000a\u000aIn fact the flavor seemed such a perfect combo with cocoa a small batch of ganja butter was prepared.  This cup of thick butter mixed with a heavy cream, dark cocoa is making this cold stormy night rather pleasant.  Smoking the strain at the same time has given my achy body pleasant euphoric waves.  Like having a personal masseuse =)\u000a\u000aSleep is well on the way, yet this relaxation of the muscles &amp; positive mindset kicked in over an hour ago.  This flower is great medicine. Working heavy machinery or driving a care at this point is out of the question for me.  Yet this buzz from multiple experiences seems to be mentally motivating all the while creating a intense medicinal body numbing high.  Very happy to pick up this strain as well as experimenting with the wonderful taste in edibles.

VNot sure if this one is for me. I smoked a gram of this in a blunt and it made me feel so happy and uplifted, everything was great. However as the high went on I became a bit easily annoyed and frustrated at simple things. Other than that it was a brilliant high, I liked it but again it didnt suit me 100%. I would imagine in smaller doses and perhaps on a couch with friends in the evening time after work would be the place for me to smoke this one. \u000a\u000aIt did make me feel paranoid and anxious at one stage but if I was in a less public place this might not have been such a buzz kill for me. couch&gt;

VJust picked this up from green therapeutics and let me tell you this, I found this specific strain to really helped with some muscle spasms I was having, plus it helped with appetite, as this strain got me the munchies like a MF.This strain is not one to put you to bed but it sure does relax you.highly recommended if your searching for something to Alleviate pain or muscle spasms or cramps.
