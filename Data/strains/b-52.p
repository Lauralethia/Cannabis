VA great strain, not as sedating as most indicas but not Racey like most sativa&#39;s. A nice relaxing buzz. Nice dense little buds with orange hairs. The smell and taste matches the mellow high. All n all I like it and my guy has it a lot so haha\u000a

VI had this strain for awhile and it always made me fall asleep right after I smoked it and I like sativa more because I like to move around when I&#39;m high

VI dont agree with the relaxed and sleepy comments. This strain makes me energetic and hyper! Increases focus and high euphoric effects. A tiny hit of this strain will get you ripped.

VThe use of B-52 (Crystal) in tai chi or qigong.\u000a\u000a45% head, 35% boddy and 20% grounding.\u000a\u000aI found this strain very usefull to visiolise your Qi flow. \u000aAfther seeing it, it&#39;s easyer to feel it in the parts of your boddy where you are not so connected to. \u000a\u000aFor example... standing like a three.... evey figure you can find the meaning of the figure (posture) by just thinking of the name of the figure and visiolise how this can be this figure... (how did the person that invented this movement/posture came to this paticulare posture/figure?)\u000a\u000aIt also helps to keep your focus really to the movements your making. So much that you will get lost in time. Some times I practice 5 min. and it&#39;s like 3 hours..or 3 hours and it feels like 5 min.

VDefinitely a sweet taste to the bud I picked up this time. Haven&#39;t had this before very nice even keel with lots of laughs watching comedies for sure. Good relaxation effects while foggy still clear enough for minor tasking in my limited experience.

VSmoked this way back in the day. It was locally grown outdoor in Northern Illinois. Grown off the Kishwaukee River. \u000a\u000aVery smooth and functional indica high, the skunk background shows up in this one. Buds were nice and tight, had good bag appeal.. especially at the time (we are talking late 90s). The whole &quot;skunk&quot; hype was huge back then so anything with it was prized. \u000a\u000aHoping to run into this one again someday as it will bring back lots of memories.

VHad a fun evening on B-52. Got a snack, danced to some Jay-Z in the kitchen, watched an episode of Portlandia that was funnier than usual, made out on the couch with my partner, went to the bedroom for some sexy times but we both completely passed out before sexy time could begin. Super relaxing strain, all my muscles just felt so nice. Pretty groggy in the morning, needed lots of coffee to function.\u000aLessons learned for next time: Don&#39;t smoke it on a weeknight, have sexy time first and then watch Portlandia and eat popcorn.

VI&#39;m not sure whether I like this, or hate it.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve been using it as an evening strain because it relaxes me without making me sleepy, or couch locked.\u000a\u000athough on the other hand, it sometimes just knocks me out right away, and I&#39;m sleeping in 5.\u000a\u000aI find for myself it&#39;s best enjoyed before dark.

VI grew this strain from Nirvana and its definitely not indica dominant. It grows tall like a sativa and definitely has strong uplifting qualities. It&#39;s still a hybrid though so there&#39;s a bit of indica in there.
