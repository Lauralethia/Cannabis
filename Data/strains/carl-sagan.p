VVisual : Excellent presentation; dense, crystal laden hairy flowers\u000a\u000aSmell : Sweetly pungent, earthy and fruity\u000a\u000aFlavor : Disarmingly strong lemon taste on the front mellowing out to smoky, piney and woodsy on the back.\u000a\u000aEffect : A wonderfully pleasing and mellow yet active cerebral come on, not overwhelming though certainly has couch lock potential.  Good for day time or all around anxiety and mood management.

VSuper relaxing and euphoric!! Recommended to us at the Kushery at Cathcart. Grower is The Fruit of the Root, coming in at about 22%. Smells like tropical punch and tasted incredibly sweet, all-around amazing smoke and already in my top 3!

VI had this in cartridge form. The high was short, which is great for certain situations. I was able to get some work done without appearing intoxicated, but didn&#39;t feel necessarily energized to get more work done that I normally do. Not great before sleeping. Very even, didn&#39;t really bring out any personality traits for me (being talkative, laughing, more sociable etc.)

VCarl Sagan by mad Mark is very good. Dried berries, wood, flowers and hash stink off feathery frosty bright neon green nugs with numerous sprawling long bright red hairs. Relaxed moderately in body and very relaxed in mind. A good happiness. Some what of a focus to it, but over do it and focus dissolves into a zone. Smooth smoke with a decent expansion and light cough. Highly recommend all day for the experienced smoker. Nice indica dominate hybrid, not to heavy. I will get again.\u000a\u000aTwo thumbs up.

VNot very impressed by this one.  Sativa dominant hybrid with a VERY short duration.   Focused on the head, but with a residual body affect that will leave you in a weird place after the high is over (as in not really wanting more of it, but left unfulfilled and thus needing to hit it again.  Every single other aspect of this one from taste to affect are average and unremarkable.  The pricepoint was fair but not worth the money IMO.  I am big on sativa heavy hybrids and had high hopes (pun intended) for this one, but alas, my search continues and I will not be purchasing this particular strain in the future.  Might be good for someone\u2019s first smoke ever or for a situation where just a buzz is desired.

Vthis strain smokes sweet, like you&#39;re inhaling whip cream. smooth 8/10 sativa high with Spacey moments, but overall focused on the overall. feels like the bowls go up in steps. 2 bowls is a good creative space to hang out.

VCS is a very tasty, inspiring, happy, hybrid that is sure to please just about anyone.  The perfect daytime appetite stimulator with the best of both sativa and indica.  I always pick some of this up when I see it.
