VThis Bushy, sturdy, resilliant Cannabis Plant is Legendary! I&#39;ve grown her outdoors in the Puget Sound Region and she loves the atmosphere. After the Dark Green Foliage is formed I cut the larger fan leaves to give the bottom some love too. This babe flowers at warp speed without much smell at all. It produces light green flower with the most trichome coverage i&#39;ve ever seen! After the full plant hang dry and subsequent meticulous trim and air tight 8-12 week cure the bloom booms with the sweetest,honey-pine, gas, syrupy aroma on earth. The smell alone will have your nostrils addicted to opening the jar just to get that exotic whiff. The indica effects tend to creep, while the the intitial effects are a sense of well being, enhanced senses and a true playfull or frisky kind of mood. Eventually, the relaxing full body buzz takes over all the limbs and puts the mind to sleep as well. This strain is Epic if you can get the real deal

VMaple leaf was my first high. I felt very relaxed and my whole body had a slight vibration. Wonderful head high with it as well. Smoked one joint 1 gram lasted about 4 hours of complete and total bliss. Like other reviews state this is like having your favorite blanket wrapped around you.

VFirst strain of Indica I have ever smoked and all I can say is WOW! I am super relaxed, my anxiety has calmed, and I could easily fall asleep. I have a few chronic issues that cause pain all day and this has relieved much of the pain.

VOne of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked yet. Definitely a very heavy indica. I just smoked a bowl of this listening to &quot;late night jazz&quot; on Spotify, it&#39;s been a great night.

VNot only does this smell delicious, it tastes so yummy and fruity. You can smell and taste a strong grape flavor and for me, that&#39;s always a plus. Something about fruity strains. This high kinda creeps up on you. The body relaxing happens right away though, and I just sank back into the couch feeling relaxed and warm and happy. Maple Leaf isn&#39;t too heavy of a hitter but more than gets the job done. I have nothing bad to say about Maple Leaf, although I do wish it were a little heavier. Excellent daytime indica.

VExcellent strain really relaxing,puts you happy, get a deeper sleep, concentration the only that I didn&#39;t liked was feeling sleepy, also my eyes were near to close because I am asiactic but I hate that because it makes you look really passed out.\u000aGreetings everyone from Mexico City were they are excellent Kush.

VI have nick-named this strain, &quot;Night Night&quot; as it is simply exceptional for giving you the best sleep you have ever had. It truly is one of my favorites of all time. Very consistent and the flavor is wonderful and not overpowering. I would call this a &quot;heavy indica&quot; which has obvious medicinal qualities. A truly wonderful companion after a hard day of work. I LOVE this strain . . . you will not be disappointed in this one if you like indicas.

VA quality indica strain to say the least. The onset is fast and sedating. It seemed to have an aphrodisiac effect that was smooth and euphoric. Never had it or even seen it before, but I would keep this strain on hand at all times if I could!!

VSmoked this after I got out of the hospital, and it was pretty decent. More of a strain you&#39;d wanna smoke if you can&#39;t sleep though. Didn&#39;t help much with my joint pain or the inflammation throughout my body, but I definitely passed out every time I smoked this.\u000aOverall rating would be about a 3.5/5.

VA good indica it really helps with sleep also it is sedative and you will feel so relaxed that you won&#39;t get up hahaha. The smell of this strain is pretty sweet and the flavor is sweet.\u000aI smoked this strain in vaporizer and pipe, i think that is better to smoke it in vaporizer because it kicks better and last longer.\u000aGreetings from Mexico :)

VOne of my all time favorites :) perfect indica-balanced high not couch locking but uplifting. Years ago she gave me a few expressions-one that tasted like drinking maple syrup, another like eating pancakes. Was a fine yielder as well. If i could grow would get seeds and do the whole garden to find the syrup again. To this day flavor wise only the dj shorts blue from 2000 era can compete-the one that tasted like the mini blueberry muffins one finds at the generic store
