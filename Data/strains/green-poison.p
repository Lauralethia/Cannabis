VI don&#39;t get why anyone wouldn&#39;t rate this strain less than 5 stars. Beautiful numbing of digits and the most relaxed, without getting sleepy, I&#39;ve ever been after smoking. When I think deep indica; I think &quot;Green Poison&quot;.

VThis is a hybrid of Early Skunk x Skunk#1, and I prefere it over the classic skunk!\u000aThe effect is almost totally indica for me, it provides a violent couch lock and a good head buzz without any anxiety. Little dry mouth but insane munchies!!\u000aThe flavour is predominantly skunk with hints of flowers and nuts! \u000aFor the taste I prefer the haze hybrids but this is really good and the effect are dreamy and chillin..great herb, it deserves a try\u000a

VRead the opening line in the &quot;Strain Highlights&quot; section three times allowed before loading your instrument of choice. &quot;Green Poison is a dangerously flavorful indica&quot;\u000aThere it is my friends. If I could have one Stain for the day, it might be Blue Dream. However the night belongs to Green Poison. Very hypnotic to me. I feel like I am in a cool 90s rap video, slow mo with fish eye lens. Do me a favor? If you are gonna get some, can you pick me some up? True Blue (or Green) Couch Glue. Its an Indica so, hit it softly or it will be nighty nighty for thee.

VHi to the people who run this site, you are all wrong with telling my stoner ass that Green poison is not available in my area, you can not possibly know that shit man eh unless you can see inside my head...oh god. Ok first of all this is a pleasant high that wastes no time in traveling straight to your head, giving you an intense head float that lets your ears ring with glee, the high of green poison says in the middle of ones noggin and almost seems to shift every now and then to one side of the back of your eye ball to the other side, giving you a pleasant tingling, this is defiantly a strain that someone can enjoy taking a walk in the park with the dog on it sparks creativity that comes in spurts, if you like working on projects or hobbies with your hands, then this is your weed, like to draw? shit go for it,  and hell do that masterpiece in watter color fuck it. like  working on cars? then fix that piece of crap the wife is sick of looking at it for fucks sake it just sits in the goddamn driveway looking like shit. this weed will be your helping hand in your creative undertakings. The taste is a power packed floral high notes accompanied by citrus tang that hovers on the tip of your lips and gums (its great honest) and good for those who wish to dive a little deeper in the THC pool this being a 20%thc 0.9% cbd  0.4 cbn.  also I&#39;m warning you this girl will make you grin,smirk,laugh and giggle at random sometimes. people who&#39;s children are usually loud annoying hobgoblin spawn are akin to a playing monkey that you are laughing at (it builds character so lets not judge OK ) suddenly the annoying chirping birds are singing sweet songs about life and shit. this weed is an uplifter and opens up your creativity but I can not say  a lot for pain, this is more for the blues. want to enjoy a day with an open mind and a case of the giggles that will guide you in creative endeavors? Then please by all means, spark up a bowl of Green poison.

VThis strain is friggen great, however I have no idea what Leafly is talking about with this &quot;Indica&quot; thing. \u000a\u000aSO if I&#39;m not wrong about the Durban Poison heritage,(which is infamous for being a sativa that grows very much like an indica variety), than this puppy is exactly like the high feels: Sativa. This shit is barely vocal about the indica qualities, if any. \u000a\u000aSeriously. Can&#39;t find a tracking of the lineage online at the moment, but I thought it was Green Crack/Durban Poison.\u000a\u000aI know when I grew Green Poison, it certainly rose up like a Durban P, which, again, is the only known sativa to grow like an indica. (I&#39;ve read that it&#39;s likely due to the plant being indigenous to the Durban Port of Africa and the equatorial heat prevalent there. A squat plant that retains moisture and offers itself more shade is more likely to survive in the region. Why this only happened in the northern African area, well... get me some dirt from north africa and I&#39;ll see what I can come up with).

Like if you&#39;re tired you&#39;ll go straight to sleep, if you&#39;re just feeling down it will make you happy as a mf and totally destressed for like 2-3 days if you get really high. And keep in mind I live in Germany so if you live in a legal State or even probably anywhere in the U.S., you can find way better

VEnjoyed this strain. Nugs were quite tight. Pea green colour, quite a bright green. Quite a sweet and sour smell to it, a bit floral, really nice scent. Tastes the same but with a bit of earthiness added in. Very strong smell when smoked. Nice relaxing indica effects, didn&#39;t find the couch lock or the munchies too strong. Nice for early evening after a long day. I did like it but it was nothing too special, run of the mill indica.

VThe Green Poison strain took me by surprise. the smell is subtle until it is burned, then it&#39;s very skunky. The look of the buds I&#39;d say is an 8/10. Nice bullfrog green color, and very dense and dank. The taste is about a 6/10, but the high is very nice. It&#39;s a good mixture of body and mind. All around I&#39;d rate this strain an 8/10.

VI have Sativa Dom. Hybrid Green Poison. It is very sativa like in my opinion. I feel stoned right in the middle of my brain. lol I feel stoned behind my eyes. I feel it in the top of my neck/spine in that last soft spot before the skull. My mouth is a bit cottony, but not completely dried out. \u000a\u000aThe bud looks really good. The green is darker then it appears I believe. This batch is sitting at 25.18% thc so those trichomes are thick. Some of the hairs are orange, some look more reddish orange. The smell is not flowery... lol it smells like fresh mj/potting soil lol. It is pleasant though if you are like me and simply love all the smells of maryjane. \u000a\u000aOver all I give Green Poison a 5. It is a potent S/I Hybrid. \u000aMaybe more for having fun, not medicinal imo... I bet it would make a dang good shatter.

Doesn&#39;t look like a lot has bee. ground up despite using big buds. The high is kinda nice, pretty chill. Eyes a little dry/itchy, I found it to be dopey kinda hard to concentrate.

VA dank one! Grows pretty tall and lanky for an indica dominant, beware of the stretch with her. Got 100% germ rate over 16 beans, all nice ladies, no hermie. Some phenos especially one gave me the most compact buds I&#39;ve seen in a while. Killer smoke, left absolutely everyone who tried her wanting for more. Feels like some nice guy put a blanket on you, don&#39;t expect to get anything done after smoking this one. I wouldn&#39;t give it 5 stars cause I know there&#39;s better out there, but I&#39;m overall really satisfied with this genetic, which is stable, easy to grow, and that would put any non-seasonned smoker&#39;s a** to sleep if not used with caution. Truly recommanded.

VI really love green poison. I&#39;ve had it a couple times and it&#39;s like it adapts to your needs. Like if you&#39;re tired you&#39;ll go straight to sleep, if you&#39;re just feeling down it will make you happy as a mf and totally destressed for like 2-3 days if you get really high. And keep in mind I live in Germany so if you live in a legal State or even probably anywhere in the U.S., you can find way better

VI picked up a healthy portion of Green Poison the other day. I was instantly drawn to its dense buds, held together with a generous dusting of sticky crystallized trichomes and its sensational scent of sweet citrus and a hint of woody/pine. It was so gorgeous, I didn&#39;t even want to consume it! ...but then I broke down! I busted it up and packed my pipe and lit it ablaze! The smoke was a creamy, mildly thick and very pungent. It burned clean and quick, leaving nothing but weightless ash behind. At first I was a little disappointed by the immediate effect as it seem a little to light for my seasoned smoker tastes. But within a minute or two, all my disappointment was erased into a cloud of thought and appetite, without even noticing! While this strain packs a wonderfully clear and potent euphoric punch, it&#39;s late onset heavy effects generally wear off relatively quickly (within a few hours) only to leave you in alert but still in a state of relaxation. I highly recommend this strain if you find it; not a heavy high, but a wonderful high!
