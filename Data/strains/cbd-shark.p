VCBD Shark calms my nerves without becoming stoned. I&#39;m not sure if it helps with my insomnia but it does the trick. I prefer the stronger ones like Skywalker Kush, Romulan or OG Kush for insominia. I find CBD Shark a great strain for day use when I want to function and socialize with my family without being too obvious that I am medicated. If CBD Shark wasn&#39;t so expensive around here, it would be one of my regular batches. Cost-wise, I will grow it when I have my future grow room set up.

VIf this had an option for 10 stars, I&#39;d choose 50. Do I like this strain? Hell ya!  I&#39;m experimenting again because I&#39;ve learned that the same strain does not always work the same way it did the day before. So I went and ordered five grams of this to try and I am so happy I did. I have Complex PTSD, anxiety and ADHD. The higher THC strains are hard on me - they make my anxiety worse sometimes even with a high CBD-only bud mixed in. I decided to try lower THC strains and they work the best for me. I&#39;ve always been sensitive to medications so this strain gives me the 1-2 punch without the punch so it&#39;s exactly the right combination of THC and CBD. This strain had me staring at the brick wall of my garage for 10 minutes before I even realized I hadn&#39;t moved, was sitting OUTSIDE in the middle of a deck staring at a wall with a stupid smile on my face. Yep, the whole anxiety thing is a very distant memory. I feel really good with the CBD Shark. Nothing matters which is what I need to feel because with PTSD, all of what you&#39;ve been most afraid of begins to consume you and your ability to be in the moment feeling ONLY this moment. Most people with PTSD lost their ability to enjoy life. PTSD is painful and all consuming and right now, I just don&#39;t care. The leaves are green and my cat is purring. THAT&#39;S how good I feel having just vaped this 20 minutes before I wrote the review.

VThis strain has pretty much saved me over and over. I have experienced migraines for almost 8 years now. I&#39;ve tried every over the counter medication around and if they did work the side effects were absolutely awful. I also get cramps to the point of puking and having to miss work. Since I&#39;ve started vaping this strain I&#39;m able to still function and go about my day without being crazy high. It also have helped a lot with my anxiety. I try hard not to rely on it too much for my anxiety but as for a pain reliever it has replaced most of my medicine cabinet.

VMy first medical strain and I am in love. I used to use cannabis for anxiety and insomnia. Unfortunately as the years have gone on, many strains exacerbate both conditions, but not good ole&#39; CBD Shark. It has the exact opposite effect, and the one I originally turned to cannabis for. My general, low-level anxiety is quelled and I can fall right asleep. This is definitely a drowsier strain for me, which I don&#39;t mind, but would llove something similar that din&#39;t make me so sleepy. Even still, I love it and it&#39;s become my go-to strain.

VAs someone who has a low tolerance for thc, this strain is perfect for me. I do not enjoy feeling stoned, and this strain offers a mild level of intoxication that is clear-headed. It relieves my aches and pains, melts away the stress, leaving me with a relaxed and happy sleepy feeling. I can smoke this all day and be focused and relaxed on weekends when I&#39;m just chilling, socializing or running errands. And then smoke it at night and fall into a comfortable sleep.\u000aAs a side note, most weed provokes my social anxiety, but not this strain!

VMigraine pain 4; nausea 8 when I medicated round 0330 or so. I could not sleep las nite due to my increased anxiety symptoms. Takes bout 10 min to start working. Pain gone; nausea all but gone. Meds tend to work a lil less when I&#39;m having anxiety issues as I was yesterday. This strain worked a lot better than the last CBD strain I tried. Body/head high allowed me a few hours sleep. I could have easily stayed up all nite also. Love the strains that can be both daytime &amp; nighttime! Highly recommend for anytime use for pain/nausea/insomnia/fatigue/etc etc! :-)

VEnjoyable strain, sweet and earthy smell with some berries mixed in. Smoke was fairly harsh but was probably caused by its low humidity level. Overall it was a well balanced strain which was very relaxing and kept me focused. I would recommend this for its good medicated state and very minimal head high.

VI got this from Starbuds Kelowna. I&#39;m a very big fan of this strain! In combination with my pharma meds, this stuff knocks out my nerve pain completely. It&#39;s also extremely potent; about 0.75g knocked me flat on my @$$ and couchlocked me. I can see this being used recreationally for those who want a deep, relaxing, calming chill to some movies or music; medically, this stuff is so much more important than recreational use. I can see it being used for pain, inflammation, anxiety and insomnia. 5/5, I&#39;m going to keep buying this stuff. Note: This strain is extremely similar to Pennywise in effect.

VI love this strain. Got it from overseas into my little ol&#39; country half way across the world after reading past reviews on this site. All the reviewers were spot on with this strain. I get zero paranoia which is awesome. It treats my stress as its very relaxing, its not a full couch lock buzz tho. I am currently using it to get off fulltime insomnia medication woohoo.\u000aI think there may be something to the anti-inflammatory properties of high CBD strain as I seem to wake up in the morning without the little aches and pains I have from the day before from having a physical job. \u000aThis strain has helped me to start smoking again after years of not so I&#39;m pretty stoked right now. Can&#39;t say much bout the flavor I vaporize so all the same to me. Dry mouth but that&#39;s a small price to pay for so much goodness.

VI will be honest with this, I struggle with severe anxiety and panic disorder as well as insomnia and restless legs. When I am getting ready for bed I will smoke some and everything just disappears. My anxiety is gone and my legs start to relax as well. In my experience with CBD Shark my heart rate stays steady which in the past some other strains I&#39;ve tried have elevated my heart rate, which is a common trigger for anxiety. Some of my back, shoulder, and neck pain will lift a bit too, not all of it but, it does enough for me. I will wake up the next morning and not even remember falling asleep, which for me, I enjoy because I can stay up for hours just trying to sleep. I also feel more rested when I wake as well. I&#39;ve noticed I become more talkative though, and I&#39;m a quiet person. But, I don&#39;t see that as an issue. So if you have similar issues as me, I&#39;d recommend trying this strain.

I did get a little anxious about smoking it so made me a little anxious after about four hits of a joint but 10 or 15 minutes later I got a nice buzz but clear headed can still think and function normally. High THC strains make me have really bad panic attacks but not the CBD SHARK. I haven&#39;t smoke a High CBD strain before it&#39;s all I thought it would be and more.

VI got some CBD shark shock via Tweed Main Street here in Canada. This is the first time I\u2019ve tried a balanced THC/CBD flower (I\u2019m usually taking blue dream/holy grail/cotton candy). I love that I can smoke a little more than usual with CBD shark - I find smoking a super relaxing activity and am usually a little bummed that my smoking time is short (total lightweight). The effects creep up - nothing happens instantaneously. Super nice buzz that you can socialize through. Knees, ankles, shoulders and elbows get this kind of fuzzy buzzing feeling and it almost feels like your melting into this super warm bowl of love. Love this strain and it\u2019s ability to relax me. Great for daytime or nighttime use, sore joints, pain, and anxiety.

VReally impressed, the near one to one ratio with THC gives it an anxiety free high that is also very stoney. Definitely got a solid body buzz off this one. The oil concentrate I tried had an herby and earthy taste to it.

VAfter my years of indulgence, I decided to take a different route and smoke for healing. Over the past 2 years I have had muscle and joint pain due to previous athletic injuries. The Blue Shark has been a great alternative to pills. It helps with muscle flare ups and really relaxes the body. Nice chill strain. Great earthy smell. Bump this to the top of your list of great CBD\u2019s.

VUse for anxiety.  This is the perfect level of euphoria that is entirely non-anxiety producing.  Plenty of CBD to soothe the nerves.  Not overly sedating, although it is particularly pleasant at night to wind down.  Very enjoyable.

VThe CBD shark I purchased was more of a sativa than an indica. It is a pretty effective strain for pain relief and relaxation. Not much of a cerebral &quot;high&quot; but more of that spacey, tingly feeling. I found  there is a bit of burn out and dizziness with this strain. Overall a reasonable good strain but not in my top five favourite high CBD strains.

VAll the people that this stuff made anxious probably don&#39;t have the same  brain chemistry as I have. On it right now : don&#39;t feel like sleeping, feel like getting things done. Yes is makes you a bit groggy at first but after 15 min it becomes a very clear and active high. It toned down almost completely the parano&#239;a, stress and social anxiety I have when toking in public downtown of a big city in Canada. Sometimes, I can identify other stoners in public because their body appear well relaxed but their faces and looks seem to indicate they are super parano&#239;d. With this strain I can talk to my boss making decent eye contact while vaping outside after work without it feeling like a living nightmare. I like the smell and taste it reminds me of a sativa but with a musky undertone that is definitely indica.

Head high moderate but even (not overwhelming). Ate eggs &amp; spinach after medicating. No anxiety/paranoia (a must for me). Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea! :-)

VJust smoked a little of this. I like it so far. It is a indica dominant hybrid so it does give a mellow indica type high but nothing too strong. The high is light and comfortable. Nice body buzz too. It&#39;s making me a little tired so maybe this is best used as a evening or night strain. If your looking for a strain to get you &quot;comfortably high&quot; and not &quot;lazy and silly stoned&quot; then I recommend this. \u000a My only complaint is that it&#39;s not a smooth smoke and tasted pretty bad.

VI often have problems with anxiety and paranoia when using cannabis, but have been smoking Harlequin and its been amazing. No issues whatsoever. So I decided to branch out and try another CBD strain. Bad decision. It was like a bad trip. There is now aluminum foil duct taped to the wall behind my smart meter and anything with a light on it is unplugged in the entire house. I also seemed to lose all control of my body. I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and my legs were shaking involuntarily to the point where I could barely stand up. I was convinced I was dying. I&#39;m giving the rest of it away.
