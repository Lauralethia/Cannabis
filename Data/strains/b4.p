VIncredible!  All stress is gone and i feel so happy even hours after i smoked.  I was very social.  shared half of a 0.5 gr joint with a fellow patient.  It might have been a bit too much initially, but everything worked out and still continues to be wonderful!

VSolid strain, I am vaping Chong\u2019s Choice line from Shango and it has a great spicy/pepper taste to it which reminds me of traditional Thai, also has a bit of berry from its blue dream lineage but this one seems to lean very heavy towards the Sativa side.  Very uplifted, focused feeling, very interested in what I\u2019m doing without couch lock while retaining the ability to change your mind and do other stuff.  Now, as a person with ADHD you\u2019ll often head upstairs to go do that next thing and by the time your up their with this strain you\u2019ll possibly forget why you walked upstairs.\u000a\u000aOnly reason for 4/5, unfortunately vape a bit to much and that blue dream paranoia sets in a bit and it keeps you awake thinking about everything rather than a night strain.  Would recommend before going out for the morning or afternoon.
