VAfghani meets Goo to bring us this sweet piney indica. This strain is what i consider a &#39;all day indica.&#39; Meaning dont turn to this for couch lock. It will do the trick to fall asleep and you newer smokers may experience some couch lock effects after all. Solid smoke :D

V&#128532;..Bummer Buy!..I was Surprised by this poor Az grow. The bud Looked good but the &quot;chi&quot; just was not there. The smell was meh, taste meh as well, the High?..NOT!! I only purchased an eighth &amp; received a good-discount, so no whining here.  I am soo anxious for Az to LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL in November, to have Testing/Regulation/Quality Control..Yeah&#128525;..I might try another grow in another state, for sure. Please take my Review with a Grain of Salt if you are Not a fellow Canna-Zonie (AzHeads Unite!!)..Be Well, \u270c&amp;&#128156;......

VAfgoo is simply put amazing. A strong indica that will have you feeling your hair (not literally) its perfect for back pain because you cant help but sit upright with the body high that it gives you. The cerebral effects aren&#39;t as strong as most Sativas worth their leaves, but it is on par with some weaker strains, which really surprised me since its not even a hybrid.\u000a\u000aCivilians: use it to have a STONED evening or getting ready for bed\u000aDabblers: use it to help with physical tasks that need done that you are already motivated for (motivation unfortunately is not a side effect of this weed)\u000aConnoisseurs: use it to help you with any physical task that needs accomplished

VPuts me right to sleep. I have the best dreams when I smoke this strain. I have one of those brains that can&#39;t turn off the million things I&#39;ve got to do. this helps me with that. Also great for helping me sleep through the night. I&#39;m a super light sleeper and wake many times. A puff or two of this and I sleep amazing. Also it should be noted that this stuff is super strong. I made the mistake of taking a few pulls during the day and I was couch bound for 2 hours. a little goes a long way and I wouldn&#39;t recommend unless you can sleep soon after smoking!

VI love this strain! but, it&#39;s all in who&#39;s growing it. I don&#39;t like any of the hybrids bade out of it, Afwreck, Afgooberry.... I don&#39;t think they have the punch. I can always tell from the very first toke if it&#39;s a good Afgoo or trash, not worth of my glass! It hit&#39;s across my chest! I mean I get the sensation of a lack of breath! And then I get warm from head to toes and I love it! I&#39;d like to find the best strains of it, who&#39;s got the best? Ya&#39;ll got any sug&#39;s for the nug&#39;s? I have horrible insomnia, I try to lie down to sleep at 11. With the Afgoo I&#39;m asleep by mid-night? ish? Without, I can lie there till 5 or 6 am. Try and get up at 7 or 8 am. I don&#39;t nap or anything, I just can&#39;t sleep at night without the Afgoo. With all that&#39;s &quot;Wrong&quot; with me another medication made in a lab just didn&#39;t sound like the right direction. The cannabis therapy along with the pain management drugs that didn&#39;t work without the pot! Once adding the pot in it got rid of the pain, I was able to stop taking as much of the opiate prescription they have me on and 9 other drugs to deal with a litany of medical ills from Arthritis to Asthma, I&#39;ve a bone disorder fragmenting pieces of bone off and small pieces of bone get lodged into the muscle or where ever it decides to go and sticks in somewhere and can cause quite a bit of damage in an active area. It&#39;s literally like being stabbed and sawn on all day long. It sucks but that&#39;s like. Enjoy the strain! Afgoo, it does a body good!

VI had a fantastic hybrid of this called Purple Afgoo. Smoking it made me very calm, relaxed, yet extremely talkative and social. I was literally stopping random strangers on the street and talking to them. I have not experienced much, if any, couch lock from this despite it being an indica.

VIncredible epiphany!!  I had heard of Afgoo... noting it never really was upper level of top shelf.....decided I needed a PUNCH to knock  down panic, pain and some sleep issues.\u000a\u000aGot the DANK oz.  from Green Path Collective....and must say, it hits like a freight train with no brakes!!   Amazing sweet piney taste... rest assured... it crawls up your spine like a &#39;pain governor&#39;  \u000a\u000aAMAZING....now, joins last weeks take of BEST FIVE with the Skywalker OG {Indica prevalent]....   BOTH of these, in my book, address anxiety, fibromyalgia....the stress of certain times daily.... Thank you Creator, for such a HEALING herb.... I VAPE...and am HEALTHIER for it...... look into Arizer M107..... got mine from Amazon... loved it so much, bought another.....   Stay healthier!!  Brooster

VThe best strain for anxiety. Can&#39;t say it enough, the Afgoo I got was amazing, let me explain:\u000a\u000aGet home from a super stressful day at work and then realized I forgot to finish one of my jobs but the office was closed. Seriously started stressing out and went for my prescribed Xanax.......but instead decided to get a delivery of bud.\u000a\u000aThat was the best decision I could&#39;ve made. Super relaxed, even when I thought about the stuff I forgot to do at work I was still able to sleep well and head into work early the next day. Gotta shout out Soco.la for the delivery too.\u000a\u000aAfgoo releases any tension in your muscles and that leads to a legitimate feeling of &#39;weight off of your shoulders&#39;. If you get a chance to try it, I recommend it. Great strain, my favorite by far.

VAt first glance the buds aren&#39;t very eye catching but while it lacks in looks, break some up by hand and you&#39;ll see where Afgoo really shines. Extremely sticky, your fingers and grinder are going to be covered. Very smooth clean tasting smoke, this also seems to help with bowel movements. Preferably better to smoke individually, it offers mild viagra effects. When having sex, expect some lights out after orgasming. If you need something to help you eat, afgoo gives you the munchies but be aware, smoke too much and you&#39;re off to bed.\u000a

A very good medication to use for sleep ;0) very low thc high cbd strain. Good for a lot of illnesses we have thousands of different pills for the same thing. I wonder which is better sheez have we all lost our freakin minds ????????? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH sorry all coldent help it&gt; Not sure on that CBD level and definately a lower THC level. More to come from the cancerous bum LOL ;0) I do have cancer though. celebrate your life when your number is called there isn&#39;t a dang thing that can be done when it calls you have to answer for Judgment or what ever happens when your expire. Life is cool but there is something cooler out there I feel it!! Also the CBD level is not exact it is my best guess which is usually pretty good.

VI tried this one on a whim. It had been a bit since I&#39;d tried any new strains, and it was on the menu. \u000aFirst thing I have to remark on is the smell. It&#39;s a strong blend of fuel and compost with a strange hint of rotting fruit. If this stuff was bad, I would&#39;ve been tempted to bury it on hallowed ground or something because that smell was almost evil. \u000aThe first hit packs a burn. The eyes instantly water. The cough is crazy powerful. \u000aI took one strong hit, and one really wimpy one and it was enough to chase a migraine away, open up my lungs and sinuses, and melt off a 10 hour day of back to back client appointments away. \u000aYou know the scene in every pothead movie ever where the two characters smoke a joint and then big trippy cartoon flowers float around and they stare at lava lamps muttering &quot;grooooooovy&quot; and giggling themselves silly? The weed they were depicting in that one joint was probably Afgoo. Seriously. The body high is relaxation in its purest form. The euphoric effects can knock back even the worst of bad days. Creative, relaxed and deep analytical thought sessions come easy with this strain. It&#39;s great for rewatching a favorite old movie. \u000aEven though it smells like diesel, dirt and decomp this strain is a 5 star winner.

VI normally target the sleepy weed strains, as I suffered from insomnia for a long while. Now I just enjoy the euphoria they bring. \u000a\u000aAfgoo is a very subtle Indica strain that doesn&#39;t necessarily &quot;creep&quot; up on you, but it hits quickly. \u000a\u000aI only use a vaporizer, so I&#39;m not sure how the Afgoo tastes or smells when smoked, but the route I use... it is delicious, piny, and really fruity. A pleasant taste, aroma, and high. \u000a\u000aProbably my go to favorite so far in my tasting.

VIn my top 3 favorites. Tastes like mild, smooth hash, and has a similar effect... reminds me of opium in that you drift away mentally into the starry sky, past the nebulae and supernovae, surf Saturn&#39;s rings, all before hitching a ride on one of Orion&#39;s arrows back to Earth, where you find your body melting into your bed. \u000a\u000aYeah. Like that. \u000a\u000a

VThis is your classic Indica smoke.  Great for the PM when you are looking to unwind.  Has some nice pain reducing effects and will have you asleep on the couch if you over indulge.  2 bowls/bubblers of Afgoo will have you feeling pretty content, just be aware of the munchies this guy tends to bring on

VAt first glance the buds aren&#39;t very eye catching but while it lacks in looks, break some up by hand and you&#39;ll see where Afgoo really shines. Extremely sticky, your fingers and grinder are going to be covered. Very smooth clean tasting smoke, this also seems to help with bowel movements. Preferably better to smoke individually, it offers mild viagra effects. When having sex, expect some lights out after orgasming. If you need something to help you eat, afgoo gives you the munchies but be aware, smoke too much and you&#39;re off to bed.\u000a

VI suggest this for night time only use - I passed out half way through my bowl.  Before passing out I was able to write down some notes, teeheehee what a nerd.  Tasted heavily of gasoline/diesel, heavy pine, heavy citrus, and peppery - oddly enough it was a light smoke, just heavy flavors.  Rolled this with Peaches &amp; Cream and it was a no go, had to reroll it with Black Magic Juicy Jay paper and it was decent.  I very much preferred this in my bong vs a roll.  Hit my head hardcore, I was super relaxed and ready for bed within 15 minutes.  I&#39;ll have to get this again for sleep, this was more relaxing than other sleepy strains that I&#39;ve tried.

I was really sore from working out but this made me feel fine. Didn&#39;t make me paranoid like the last strain so that was nice. Not sure if it&#39;s supposed to but I got a pretty good body high. Also not a couch locker so that was a big relief. Didn&#39;t really affect my energy much at all actually except I was a little tired. But if you wanted this would still probably be an OK day smoke. In my opinion more of an after-dinner type situation though. Overall good strain. Nice dense nugs too. 7/10. Would buy again.

VWhen I heard this was available I couldn&#39;t pass up the chance to try something new.  I lived in Burlington Vermont for awhile and had a wide range of strains at my disposal.  This one easily jumped into my top 5.  The smell is aromatic, fruity but not overwhelming.  The pull is harsh, but like so many have said before, it&#39;s a good harsh.  The kind of harsh that tells you it&#39;s going to work well.  The come on is unassuming and quick.  Two or three pulls later I found myself on my couch with my headphones on and Paper Diamond pulsing in my ears.  It&#39;s not a couch lock, but don&#39;t expect to run a marathon.  The stone is euphoric, mellow and happy.  For my tolerance level, the duration of the stone was much longer then expected.  If you have the means I highly recommend this beauty.  I am very interested to see how it reacts to some downhill snowboarding.

VMy ultimate favorite! Giving me the best high I have ever had from any bud. I love afgoo. Gives a strong heaven and relaxed feeling. It&#39;s absolutely marvelous for video games and gives me the munchies easily. It helps my insomnia and anxiety. I wake up feeling refreshed after using this fantastic bud. No dry eyes or dry mouth for me after using this either.

VI suggest this for night time only use - I passed out half way through my bowl.  Before passing out I was able to write down some notes, teeheehee what a nerd.  Tasted heavily of gasoline/diesel, heavy pine, heavy citrus, and peppery - oddly enough it was a light smoke, just heavy flavors.  Rolled this with Peaches &amp; Cream and it was a no go, had to reroll it with Black Magic Juicy Jay paper and it was decent.  I very much preferred this in my bong vs a roll.  Hit my head hardcore, I was super relaxed and ready for bed within 15 minutes.  I&#39;ll have to get this again for sleep, this was more relaxing than other sleepy strains that I&#39;ve tried.

VThis was taken as a &quot;crumble&quot; style kief type hash. Earthy flavor, less bright than other hash I&#39;ve had. Got a good deal on it so not complaining. I wouldn&#39;t complain anyway- love Indica hash for sleep medicine and this fits the bill. I forgot this was concentrated and smoked a bit more than recommended. Ha- kind of tripped out in a fetal position while hearing birds chirping but great sleep after. It is a matter of dose- with all medicine take only one hit first. Adjust accordingly

VI love this flower. I had been in a very bad and irritable mood of late. Thankfully I got this strain and I am in a much better state of mind. Afgoo is incredible for treating stress and anxiety. If taken in smaller quantities it is uplifting and stress-busting. Consumed in larger amounts and I get very very mellowed and eventually sleepy. Not just any sleep but one of the most satisfying and deep sleeps ever.\u000a\u000a\u000a  Over all I love this strain and its effects. Depending on the amount taken it can be a smooth day time medicine, in larger amounts great for night. One very noticeable effect is the enormous increase in appetite. I could rip through a buffet and never look back!

I&#39;ve had different experiences with this strain depending on what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;ve sat and done homework for two hours or laughed my ass of for an hour. Lets you down pretty quick but leaves you feeling relaxed afterwards. Doesn&#39;t last very long at all. If you wanna stay high all day you gotta  smoke a bowl every hour or so. But I&#39;m also a big guy with kinda high tolerance. Overall ok strain.

VGoodwill. My perfect balance of warm body high and creative head high, with a light sleepiness at the end. Great for an evening of indoor activity. Good for pain. Burns well, at least in the prerolls I have bought. This strain confirmed my love of Goo! Definitely a strain &quot;family&quot; I will look for from now on.

VGreat for just relaxing and really helpful if you have anxiety/depression/sleeping problems. I didn&#39;t feel like it put me to sleep but if I laid in bed I&#39;d be ok to fall asleep too. only downside is it gave me the munchies pretty badly. But if you have snacks on hand, this is a great strain.

VMaybe it&#39;s just my chemistry, but Afgoo doesn&#39;t really do it for me.  It looks pretty and sparkly, smells and tastes sweet, fruity, and piney, but for me the most desired effects are practically nonexistent.  I have to smoke quite a bit (for quality, expensive bud) to feel any kind of a &quot;buzz&quot;.  Even then, when it does kick in it&#39;s not really a &quot;buzz&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, or &quot;stone&quot;, feels pretty weak, and doesn&#39;t last long.   I gave a generous rating of 30 Minutes for my experience.\u000a\u000aWhat I do experience is eye/sinus/head pressure around my left sinuses, and slight pain in my temples; some light dizziness/floatiness (not in a particularly pleasant way); and definitely sleepiness.  I will have to give it good marks for treating insomnia, but for me I have to use so much to feel anything that I feel fatigued and sleepy the next day.\u000a\u000aFor me, Afgoo isn&#39;t worth it just to treat my insomnia.  I have depression and anxiety to deal with as well, and even though I don&#39;t feel anxious, it&#39;s because I&#39;m just sleepy.  I think extended use of this strain would probably not be good for my depression either.  Your results may vary.

VThis strain is awesome! I picked up a half gram cartridge of Afgoo and loved it. It has sedative like effects, just a few hits off a cartridge and I ended up taking a 3 hour nap at 4pm. So if you&#39;re looking for a strain to smoke with friends or be social, this is not for you! It honestly is like taking a sleeping pill. I have been using this before bed for the past few weeks until a couple days ago when my cartridge ran out, and it knocks you out! If you want to smoke this during the day and not sleep, get flower and microdose. Even a few hits off a dab cartridge made me pass out, and I smoke 3 to 4 times a day.

VI tried this strain for the first time last night.  It had a mild flavor and since it is Indica, I did not get the head effects I have grown used too.  In spite of warning about its high THC levels, I smoked a bit more than usual.  I finally surrendered to the idea that it just wasn&#39;t going to work.  After about 10 min, I got the familiar I&#39;m buzzed &quot;tingle&quot; and then I was snoring.  Slept like I was DEAD!!  Virtually no munchies, a slight bit of dry mount.

Vnice forresty smell. by dawg star cannabis, purchased at seattle cannabis company. i am a new smoker after about seventeen years. three good puffs on a pipe. very strong for me after a few minutes. quite intense but only a couple of times did i feel momentarily worried or anxious (is this music really loud?!? what if someone comes to the door!?) holy moly i was really out of it. reality very shifted and dreamlike. music was completely changed and very absorbing. was definitely zoned out, or in. can&#39;t say i felt especially tired or sleepy... just really high. mood was good. body high but mind stimulating too. not unpleasant. definitely an experience in itself. not sure how it would be around people or in public...might be too weird for me. i slept hard and was a groggy after 6 1/2 hours sleep. my aim is for relaxation and help for depression and anxiety. will try this one in a smaller amount or larger for an audio/mind/dream experience. pretty nice for my first indica.

VVery pleasant flavor profile that has a slightly dry, blue cheese taste. My intended use for this strain was during the late evening to help me unwind and fall asleep after work. While Afgoo certainly proved to be relaxing, I was hoping for something stronger to end my day with. The effects are more pronounced in the body while the cerebral feeling of being high comes and goes. I was left wanting something a bit more sedating to help me sleep.

VI tried this strain for the first time last night.  It had a mild flavor and since it is Indica, I did not get the head effects I have grown used too.  In spite of warning about its high THC levels, I smoked a bit more than usual.  I finally surrendered to the idea that it just wasn&#39;t going to work.  After about 10 min, I got the familiar I&#39;m buzzed &quot;tingle&quot; and then I was snoring.  Slept like I was DEAD!!  Virtually no munchies, a slight bit of dry mount.

VI&#39;m not kidding, this stuffs my headstash for a reason, hands down the best painkiller I&#39;ve ever found, this strain gives me such a heightened sense of my body I feel like I can do almost anything, definitely the best strain I&#39;ve found to exercise on. the stock I have was outdoor grown and harvested two weeks early, so the high is intensely cerebral. instead of the golden colored trichomes seen when this strain is allowed to grow to full maturity, the buds I have all have clear trichomes, and instead of the musky, almost wine-like flavor the mature stock gives, this stuff comes across with the most sour flavor profile I&#39;ve seen in this strain yet, just pure sour with each fresh toke. the buds are only about the quarter of the size this strain can get, but the main cholas are definitely twice as hard and dense. definitely an A-list strain.

VThis strain is awesome! I picked up a half gram cartridge of Afgoo and loved it. It has sedative like effects, just a few hits off a cartridge and I ended up taking a 3 hour nap at 4pm. So if you&#39;re looking for a strain to smoke with friends or be social, this is not for you! It honestly is like taking a sleeping pill. I have been using this before bed for the past few weeks until a couple days ago when my cartridge ran out, and it knocks you out! If you want to smoke this during the day and not sleep, get flower and microdose. Even a few hits off a dab cartridge made me pass out, and I smoke 3 to 4 times a day.

I&#39;ve had different experiences with this strain depending on what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;ve sat and done homework for two hours or laughed my ass of for an hour. Lets you down pretty quick but leaves you feeling relaxed afterwards. Doesn&#39;t last very long at all. If you wanna stay high all day you gotta  smoke a bowl every hour or so. But I&#39;m also a big guy with kinda high tolerance. Overall ok strain.

VMy preferences tend to be more sativa than indica, but I took a gamble on a 1/2 oz of Afgoo, and generally speaking I haven&#39;t been disappointed. This one is a creeper; it takes me 2-3 minute before I feel it working, and 10-15 before it starts to show its real potential, making dosage a little tough to gauge. It leaves me relatively clear-headed, with a pronounced body high - not quite couch-lock, but don&#39;t plan on a trip to the gym. Instead, plan on a trip to your kitchen - powerful munchies! \u000a\u000aI made oil out of it (50% ABV / 50% fresh decarbolized). It was a little on the weak side (I only used 4 grams). I mix 15 ML at a time with some nice cherry/pistachio/cream flavoring and create a thick VG e-cig juice. The flavor is fantastic. You can fill a small tank (I have a dedicated Kanger Nano) and puff away for hours. The one thing I found is that the tendency to get sleepy near the end of the high is even stronger in this form. Either you keep your high alive, plan on a short nap, or use after 8pm and drift away at the end of your session.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a hair on the short side for me. After a moderate-to-heavy dose, at 3 hours, I&#39;m back on the ground. After 3 1/2 to 4 hours, and I&#39;ve shaken off the cobwebs completely.\u000a\u000a4/5

While the buzz lasted about an hour and a half I felt relaxed and did not experience a come down.  Made my body tingle.

VMaybe it&#39;s just my chemistry, but Afgoo doesn&#39;t really do it for me.  It looks pretty and sparkly, smells and tastes sweet, fruity, and piney, but for me the most desired effects are practically nonexistent.  I have to smoke quite a bit (for quality, expensive bud) to feel any kind of a &quot;buzz&quot;.  Even then, when it does kick in it&#39;s not really a &quot;buzz&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, or &quot;stone&quot;, feels pretty weak, and doesn&#39;t last long.   I gave a generous rating of 30 Minutes for my experience.\u000a\u000aWhat I do experience is eye/sinus/head pressure around my left sinuses, and slight pain in my temples; some light dizziness/floatiness (not in a particularly pleasant way); and definitely sleepiness.  I will have to give it good marks for treating insomnia, but for me I have to use so much to feel anything that I feel fatigued and sleepy the next day.\u000a\u000aFor me, Afgoo isn&#39;t worth it just to treat my insomnia.  I have depression and anxiety to deal with as well, and even though I don&#39;t feel anxious, it&#39;s because I&#39;m just sleepy.  I think extended use of this strain would probably not be good for my depression either.  Your results may vary.

VI am relaxed.  Not glued to my chair, though I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying its company right now.  My body is definitely feeling the indica, but I feel like I should be doing something more important than writing a review...\u000a  \u000aI won&#39;t say this helps much with depression, but I can kiss my anxiety goodbye.  I thought I&#39;d be hungry, but that&#39;s not the case.  My sinus cavity was definitely relieved of some grossness...runny nose, etc.  Granted, I smoked a good gram or more in a cone, with help.  Regardless, I would describe this as a pleasantly heady indica.\u000a\u000aI would recommend smaller doses for during the day.  Larger doses if you need a nap, or are headed to bed anyhow.  \u000aA great grab from my favorite dispensary in Seattle.

V*Whew* this is some strong stuff. Really smooth on the onset.. your head lifts up, your mood elevates, then after a few minutes it moves into your body. Sort of a trippy high at first. Calls itself a hybrid but I&#39;d say it leans more toward the Indica side of things, and has the light &quot;layer&quot; of a good Sativa. Really good stuff, not for amateurs.

Gorgeous dark green plant in veg that explodes when lights blink 12/12. The caylex and leaves keep turning Whitener by the minute. A slightly picky eater in hydRO systems, but in a soil bed I&#39;ve found it thrives. Tasty pot, with a great high that encompuses your whole being with a warm blanket of goodness. It&#39;s got my recommendation.

Vnice forresty smell. by dawg star cannabis, purchased at seattle cannabis company. i am a new smoker after about seventeen years. three good puffs on a pipe. very strong for me after a few minutes. quite intense but only a couple of times did i feel momentarily worried or anxious (is this music really loud?!? what if someone comes to the door!?) holy moly i was really out of it. reality very shifted and dreamlike. music was completely changed and very absorbing. was definitely zoned out, or in. can&#39;t say i felt especially tired or sleepy... just really high. mood was good. body high but mind stimulating too. not unpleasant. definitely an experience in itself. not sure how it would be around people or in public...might be too weird for me. i slept hard and was a groggy after 6 1/2 hours sleep. my aim is for relaxation and help for depression and anxiety. will try this one in a smaller amount or larger for an audio/mind/dream experience. pretty nice for my first indica.

I would recommend this strain to people who need help relaxing. It didn&#39;t cloud my judgement or make my head fuzzy, but it left me happy and relieved. A good buzz all around.

VI am kind of surprised to see other people&#39;s reviews of this strain after my experience. This strain hit me in 3 stages: First, the initial head cloud right after smoking made me think it was indica, for sure. I was planning to get couch locked based on the reviews, but after a few minutes, the second stage hit and my heart started beating faster than usual and I felt like I had to move around, which is the reaction I ALWAYS get when I smoke a sativa (and I hate the &quot;heart rushy&quot; sensation of a sativa). After about 10 minutes of that, the high chilled out to a super mellow, cloudy head high that cannot be mistaken for indica. I only took one hit, but I can tell multiple hits from a bowl would put me out for the count in bed. I really enjoyed the high after everything calmed down, but I take 1 star away for feeling like a rushy, heart-racing sativa when first smoked.

Afgoo lived up to it\u2019s reputation, 2 bowls had us relaxed and feeling more peaceful and contemplative than any of us had been in a long time. I can see why this is a favorite among medical marijuana patients. I highly recommend Afgoo to anyone who enjoys an indica high.

VI&#39;m a newbie at mmj.  This is probably the 4th strain i&#39;ve tried.  I didn&#39;t like it at all.  Apparently i&#39;m one of the few it makes paranoid. I tried it because I could not sleep for anything. I smoked it in bed and at first I felt just a faint body high. My body started relaxing from my feet up and I could feel my pain going away. After about 20 minutes I laid down to go to sleep. I could feel the &quot;sleep wave&quot; coming over me, then all of the sudden I started having CRAZY thoughts. I mean to the point where I didn&#39;t want to get out of bed(even thought I was starving) because I was afraid I might follow through with one of those crazy thoughts. After laying in bed for about half an hour the crazy thoughts stopped, but sleep did not come.  I ended up getting up to get something to eat, and watch tv for a bit. After about another hour my body felt ready for sleep, and I did go to sleep the second my head hit the pillow but i&#39;ve got another joint and won&#39;t be smoking it.
