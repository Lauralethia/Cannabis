VI really like this strain. Big, pretty dense, fruity, frosty buds with a great sativa high. Great for beginner growers looking for that awesome sativa high. It has a weird tangy, citrusy, strawberry flavor. Although, it&#39;s not as potent or strong flavored as a good Jack H. or Super Silver Haze, or others in their category. The increased yield more than makes up for not being as potent, as it&#39;s not so much weaker to negate the increased yield. I wish I could include more effects in the rating, as it hits them all except for tingly and sleepy effects, unless you really smoke out with it. It has a strong, focused, creative buzz and energy for other endeavors being the most dominant. I found it very good at combating depression as well, as you would expect from a good sativa. It&#39;s also good for hashes and oils/waxes, with returns being closer to more indica based phenos than many mostly sativas out there. \u000a\u000aWhen you compare the price point of DD genetics to more popular/powerful sativas, it&#39;s an all around winner for sativa heads IMO. Especially when you factor in the fact this plant can produce at least 450 grms/sq meter, and as much as 500 or more, if done right ;) I never experienced head aches or paranoia/anxiety with DD, but that could just be me. It does have a powerful cotton mouth though. Overall, I&#39;d give it a very solid 8.5/10.

VLike this smoke, but for more daytime or &quot;wake me up&quot; use. I can tell you I have smoked the best of all kinds and this particular sativa is excellent for energy. One small downfall is when you come down there can be a slight headache included. Almost like a comedown from a caffeine buzz. If you want something to help you stay ripped and happy but awake and energetic this is a great smoke for you.

VI received a single dutch dragon fem seed as a promo for picking up another Paradise Seed pack and I totally hit the jackpot.  The flowers are dense and give off a strong citrus perfume.  It comes on fast with a brief moment of duhhh but then continues to ramp up for the next 30 minutes. The slow start is followed by a long period of zen like insight.  It&#39;s close to being hallucinogenic but just not quite.  There is a sense of well-being and a floating that passes through a very positive space.  \u000a\u000aI harvested at day 60 which was a hair early but as the bud has continued to cure it just gets smoother, stronger and deeper.  This is what I imagine an award winning strain feels like.  Hopefully I can keep clones going for a long time.

VLight doses through my vapourizer at low heat setting results in an extremely clean high. Totally functional, energetic, happy, euphoric - without any of the downsides such as red eyes, munchies, cotton mouth, anxiety, etc. I can only give this 4 stars because I do find it to be a bit on the harsh side regarding throat feel. I rarely cough when using my vapourizer, especially way down at 190 celcius, but this one caught me off guard.\u000a\u000aUpdate: I had one too many large pulls off my vaporizer the other day and about 15 minutes later I had full blown anxiety/panic issues with a big dose of self-hatred/loathing. Be careful with the Dragon, folks. It only lasted about 30 minutes but it was very unpleasant. Respect.

VSmoking this stuff makes me feel like I need to consider profound universal knowledge. I find myself listening to books on tape about buddhism, studying martial arts, and staying up late into the night doing sit-ups with this particular Mary. The name is well deserved, for it makes me feel like one of the great chinese masters, for a time. I can empty my mind, and be formless, and shapeless. The Dutch Dragon Must be one of water, for it makes me feel as if a great master. I highly suggest this strain to any professional martial artist, and I believe this will be the strain I smoke when I visit the Dojo.

VA beautiful blend of orange, scale like trichomes cover the soft bud within. The sample was a little harsh, but the high made it worth it. The power of the dragon will be unleashed upon you as you sore around, energy and creativity await you in this mythical beast.  Super sticky but rolled well.

VHas quite a nice body high for a sativa and, a dreamy headspace. \u000a\u000aMade me hungry, so I had a snack. I struggle with appetite loss and I&#39;m still hungry! \u000a\u000aJust one large bowl has helped with my mood, and also many of the medical symptoms I face. \u000a\u000aStrong, wonderful smelling medium sized buds. Smooth to smoke.

VThis is a very interesting strain. Firstly the aroma in my opinion smells like a dirty diaper. Don&#39;t let that fool you this plant is one of the most potent strains I have had the pleasure of smoking. Fantastic. I get a energy burst right after using.

Va great strain! starting with watching this beauty while growing and flowering - brought a large yield (outdoor 70 days = 65g dry buds) in european weather conditions. at the end the plant has reached a height of 145cm while it is also known to grow up to &gt; 300cm. anyway this is a wonderful strain and also the taste and smell while burnin&#39; is very delicious. love it!

VI really like the Dutch Dragon! It has a great taste and burns nice each time. I find that it really helps relieve the uncomfortable feeling and pain I have from my inflammation. After I get off work and burn one I feel like I&#39;ve caught a second wind.

VDutch Dragon is the very definition of having the giggles. The taste is very fruity and sweet, and the effects are even sweeter. I think I&#39;ve finally found my favorite sativa! &#128175;&#128175;&#128175;

VI keep trying it thinking maybe I ate too much, etc... I&#39;ve tried on an empty stomach as well.\u000a\u000aI don&#39;t want to sound rude, but I am almost done with 1 g I bought.  I don&#39;t know why, but the one and only effect I get is Major Depression.  Suicidal thoughts.\u000a\u000aNever will use again after my experience.\u000aSorry!
