Vi like BSC.to me it`s good all round smoke.good f/ pain,anxiety,depression and a multitude of others.nice medium size,dark green solid buds with different color hairs.it smells skunky when u open the bag but he skunk doesn`t transfer into the taste.taste wise.earthy,spicy with what a lot of people say.a woody taste but very pleasant.1/2 a joint and i`m pretty well buzzed.i prefer it to GSC,i got a better buzz and i liked the taste.great f/ wake and bake!

VFeeling mellow as fuck. No paranoia (I&#39;m not a person that weed always makes paranoid. Pretty consistent with the majority&#39;s experience). Just super content and happy. Reminds me of how wonderful Blue Cookie made me feel. This shit is crazy great. Haven&#39;t found a strain that made me feel this happy in a long time.

VPurchased from World of Weed. \u000aFlower: like most cookie strains, it is very photogenic. One of my nugs from this batch was 4 grams and I had to stop and admire how colorful and prefect it was. Then I ripped that bitch apart and loaded the bong.\u000aSmell: skunky. pungent and sweet. \u000aCrumble: fluffy and voluminous once ground up. Certainly feels like you get more for your money when it fluffs in the grinder. \u000aBurn: Great. Very clean. \u000aTaste: cookies for sure, but a little more indica woody. Sweet on the exhale. \u000aHigh: I&#39;m always fairly clear but relaxed and happy with cookies, and I like the slight increase in indica with BSC. It is a great wake and bake strain. I was making some blueberry crepes and playing the temptations. It was the shit. \u000aOverall Experience: 9.8/10 love me some cookies, especially when they tweak it to be a little more body buzz. \u000a

VI have now bought 3 grams of bsc concentrate over the last 2 weeks. This stuff knocked my Dick in the dirt. Taste is ok , kinda woodsy and plant like with a little sweetness. The high is super heavy. 3 or 4 dabs of BSC will help me get to sleep. Only reason it didn&#39;t get a 5 is the flavor wasn&#39;t insanely terpy .

VThis is a killer one! Now a days it&#39;s harder to get to that same groovy way you used to feel, this hits me in the right way!\u000aLet&#39;s Get into this.\u000aBud Structure: Super compact like a small little cola the way it foxtails towards the top and those fine dark mossy green leafs some bright green in other parts of the bottom bud a darker green love the purple boulders here in there. \u000aThe Smell: Super sweet like fresh fruit punch like passion fruit.\u000aThe Vape: it&#39;s a little funky, and fruity like jam and cheese, smells can be deceiving in a good way.\u000aThe effect: I notice that I am very creative and the way light reflects off of surfaces is bright beams of light. I am also quiet accurate in my spelling and using different parts of my brain; to make the connections I use my eyes off the keyboard ohhh man this is crazy fun! \u000aI recommend those who suffer from glaucoma, ADHD, Anxiety, Agoraphobia, depression. Writers block and Cachexia, and tinnitus.

Vlove is love love.  love is love love.   This one is a new personal favorite.   Super tasty. Beyond delicious. Uber sticky-icky dense nugs of super pungent smoke.   Grabbed this on recommendation of the bud tender at my local dispensary and wow. Most certainly will be grabbing more! If you have a chance to try this one properly done don&#39;t hesitate.   Its amazing.   Tastes like a cross between the dankest bubba you&#39;ve ever smoked combined with an equally as deadly girl scout cookies.  Really happy with this one.
