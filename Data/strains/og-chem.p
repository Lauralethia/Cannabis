VWent to a dispensary and asked for a Sativa or Hybrid/Sativa dominant strain with a high THC and was given this beauty. The first thing I did after coming home was to smell it and it is a strong smell, definitely chemical. This is so far the strongest strain I have smoked and I been smoking for 15 years. It WILL slap anyone in the face, I don&#39;t care who you are, Snoop Dog or anyone one, this strain WILL slap you good. I&#39;m just in love! You want a head high? This is the one for you. Not recommended for newbies because it will make you say OMG while you are drifting away.

VI sort of feel bad for those who think this is the best strain, then again maybe my standards are too high from the old road kill skunk I used to smoke regularly. Although this is not a novice strain by any means. It unfolds, and the most intense part is at about 2 hours, and then you come down off of it. There is a sort of hysterical speed to the whole thing. You will find yourself navigating your thoughts until it wears off. It can be hard to endure at times. What all this means is A higher dimensional perspective... This will make sense to anyone with an intetest in the magic of psychology.

VMy body&#39;s lounging from the Kush but my mind&#39;s screaming Chemdawg. Thought-provoking and inspirational as my mind races but doesn&#39;t get too carried away with how relaxed I feel. You can swing this strain either way. Stay couch-locked watching re-runs of The Office or use it to write or do chores around the house, depending on how you feel going into it. Whatever you decide to do you&#39;ll feel your worries and stresses completely melt away. Great medicine for anxiety, stress and depression.

VI picked this up on advice of a bud tender who could see how heartbroken my hubby was when he learned they had just sold their last bit of Jack Herer.  Ms bud tender recommended OG Chem as a replacement for Jack Herer, but (even with my limited experience) I don&#39;t see how one could be swapped for another.  Hubby is a lucky lightweight: it doesn&#39;t take much for him to get knocked on his ass.  He likes the happy uplifted high that Jack Herer gives him.  I smoked a bit of OG Chem (over another strain), and I could tell it would be instant lights out for hubs. So either Ms bud tender is trying to move some OG Chem or she just doesn&#39;t know her stuff.   \u000a\u000aI haven&#39;t yet smoked OG by itself, so when I do, I&#39;ll revise this review.  I smoked OG Chem on New Year&#39;s Day to tamp down the intense eagle-like focus that Strawberry Ice left me with.  \u000a\u000aAfter smoking 2 bowls of Strawberry Ice, I realized that  I had just spent 10 minutes alphabetizing and organizing my spice cabinet into neat little Nazi rows.  I like getting organized for the new year, but this was not the high I was looking for.  I smoked a bowl of OG Chem to tamp down the intense focus of Strawberry Ice, and it worked like a charm.  I was still focused and smart, but the OG Chem relaxed my brain and body and I got a little slurry.  Smart and slurry is pretty much my hubs favorite me, so he liked the mix of OG Chem and Strawberry Ice.

VI&#39;m a lightweight, I used to smoke a ton, but these days I usually only smoke about 4-5 bowl hits a day. Phat Panda&#39;s OG Chem turns that into 1/2 a hit - 2 hits. This stuff, at ~37% THC, is the strongest flower I&#39;ve ever encountered. It can definitely be overwhelming for one who doesn&#39;t smoke much, I usually relegate this to the end of the day when I&#39;m done dealing with people because it rocks me, not in a paranoid way as much as a stupefied way, running at the mouth and forgetting what I&#39;m saying half-way through saying it or losing my train of though completely.\u000a\u000aNot for noobz, but certainly worth seeking out for the connoisseur.

Uplifting and relaxing without any sedative effect and a blast of euphoria. Puts me in a clearheaded good mood, ready for anything, even if its nothing. For me, seems right at that edge of potency where I can function at 100% while still being completely blasted. 4.5/5.

We were baked (and I mean BAKED), but still able to function with enough precision to do things like bake a cake. I found the effects of this one to be primarily a head high, with a slight body high that left me tingly and floating. I strongly recommend this as a good social smoke.

VMMJ patient in NJ for PTSD from my involvement in Desert Storm as a combat medic.  This is my favorite indica selection at my dispensery. From the taste to the stress relief it provides me to the way it doesn&#39;t couch lock me, I am finding much relief from my condition via this strain.

VThe bud smells tru to the og lineage. When broken down in a grinder it smells strate chem/ with a slight sweetness. The Pheno received was foxtailed which I don&#39;t like but still very dense. Super frosty not completely even tho. Light green with a minimal amount of hairs/pistols, the pistols are of pail orange which highlights each bug as a whole. I recommend to anyone who&#39;s go to choice is chemmy/thraxy type buds over berry/sweet buds. I think a even more pronounced chem flavor could enhance the experience when smoking this bud.

VOne of my absolute favorites. The smell is an earthy minty and almost medicinal eucalyptus OG type smell. The effects hit you quick and are super euphoric. The effects are from head to toe, and I get buzzy waves going up and down my body almost every time. Intense euphoric feeling in the pit of my stomach. Dreamy, but still very functional and slightly stimulating. Works good 24/7 as well, just smoke less during the day. Great potent strain!

VFive Star Strain.. No questions about it and it liniage speaks for itself.. I personally think this is the best pheno off of OG Kush with the pine, earthy, diesel like flavors with a nice pinene tingle on the throat then a smooth exhale.. Euphoria at it&#39;s max backed up with realed happiness... Definitely got a potent skunky odor...this ranks in my personal top 5 go to strains.

VMy memories of pot have always been being  happy and laugh out loud watching funny movies.  \u000aThis one is pretty powerful (30% THC) but does not unfortunately have that effect. It has more of a body high with a couch lock effect. \u000a\u000aWould be good for body relaxation and mind numbing, but did not work for me for feeling funny and goofy.

VI&#39;d asked for a strain that would smack me in the face with a pound of wet spaghetti. This pretty much did the job. Was new to this strain but pleasantly surprised. Like most products of Phat Panda very dense buds, nice color and taste was smooth when vaped. Not in my top ten strains but definitely earns a nice spot. \u000a\u000aIf you want something to relax your body and let the mind roam, give it a go.
