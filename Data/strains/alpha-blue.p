VThis is my go to strain! Alpha is an amazing buzz, at night it helps me sleep but it usually isn&#39;t too heavy for daytime. It is claimed to be a Sativa, sometimes a Sativa heavy hybrid (which is more accurate to the buzz as it does have a decent amount of Indica feel to the buzz). The CBD count is low however this strain helps with my back and nerve pain better then anything I have smoked. If you have a high tolerance, give this a shot, you will not be disappointed!!\u000a\u000a**CAUTION** Creates serious munchies!

VTonite I&#39;m getting high with Alpha Blue, and I&#39;m thinking maybe I shouldn&#39;t have chosen this one for night time?? ha ha yes, this is a sativa according to Leafly, its parents are Blue Dream and NYC Diesel, and since I love both of those I knew I couldn&#39;t go wrong with Alpha Blue! \u000a\u000aThe Alpha Blue that I picked up from Glisan Buds tested out at 20.78% THC and .06% CBD.  I feel wide awake, energetic, and just devoured 4 small Asian bananas.  Now I&#39;m wrestling with my inner self, do I really want peanut butter toast right before bed?\u000a\u000aAlpha Blue is definitely best for daytime use or if you need an energy boost. It smells wonderful, like sweet berry with zing.   My mind keeps leaping back to childhood when I would have dreams of flying amidst flying teddy bears and kites.  Off to go color a mandala.

VNY Sour Diesel x Super Blue Dream.\u000aThis was the freshest looking bud I&#39;ve seen. Green dense buds with short orange hairs, bud can be very big. All covered in lots of crystals, too much crystals it make the bud&#39;s color looks way lighter.\u000aVery floral scent, hint of berries, super loud and mellow, grind some and leave open in your room overnight, it smell like heaven.\u000aSmoke was smooth, very kushy feel.\u000aThe high was not creeping on my body, pretty good strain in the morning along with coffee. Since this blue dream was already got crossed around bunch of different sativa strains, it lost its hybrid indentity and turn kinda sativa which is not bad but no more reccomended using at night.

VReally nice Blueberry based strain. Not as intense in the blueberry flavors as Blue Haze (my personal fave), but a nice flavor profile nonetheless. This one I seem to prefer vaped over smoked, but that may just be me getting used to the flavor difference between the two consumption methods. Effects are as expected for a sativa dominant strain. Nice, slightly giggly, buzz that lets me relax without bolting me to my seat. Allows some get up and go without demanding it. Would purchase again.

Now I&#39;m a daily smoker and had 2-3 bowls of this and it does hit good and high is good but it gave me the worst possible migraine I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I wanted to rip my head off to get it go away. The worst part about the migraine is it came 10-15 minutes after I smoked and absolutely came out of now where. One minute just couch locked and the next minute my head felt like it got hit my train over and over again.

VEnergetic and euphoric, Alpha Blue is a great day time strain. I had a lot of great laughs after smoking this strain.  In small doses it beats a cup of espresso in my book. Initial buzz was very cerebral, but quickly moves into a light body buzz that is perfect. My favorite strain out of the three I bought for my colorado trip. I got mine from The Farm in Boulder CO. A FANTASTIC Dispensary. I would highly recommend it.

VThis is my go to strain! Alpha is an amazing buzz, at night it helps me sleep but it usually isn&#39;t too heavy for daytime. It is claimed to be a Sativa, sometimes a Sativa heavy hybrid (which is more accurate to the buzz as it does have a decent amount of Indica feel to the buzz). The CBD count is low however this strain helps with my back and nerve pain better then anything I have smoked. If you have a high tolerance, give this a shot, you will not be disappointed!!\u000a\u000a**CAUTION** Creates serious munchies!

VSmoked 1/2 bowl out of a small glass pipe.  The smell was fruity, the taste was piney and earthly with an earthy taste that lingers on the palate.  The High comes on quick.  Smoked this strain after waking up from an Afternoon Nap and it had that Classic Wake n Bake feel just like when you smoke a bowl in the morning.  This Strain definitely snapped my our of my Afternoon Grogginess.  This is a Wake You Up and Bake You Up High :)  The Best Part - No Racey Heart and some interesting body effects mainly in the chest and arms.  A Spacey High, yet still very Sociable High.  As this solid 2 hour high fades the relaxation effects kick In... I love when Sativa Strains do this :) Another Shout Out to Show Grow Ramona !  Bringing the Flower yet again :)

VI thoroughly enjoyed this strain for a handful of reasons. First and foremost, the high of this strain is invigorating, blissful, and creative. Secondly, the smell is unbelievable; it literally smells like blueberry candy. Lastly, the nug structure pretty dense for the most part, and, they glistened with trichomes. I wanted to try this strain to test out its anti-anxiety properties; to which the strain barely prevailed. I found myself getting a bit too in my head with this strain, something that I try and avoid. All and all, this strain is a pretty decent one.
