VI&#39;ve always loved Blueberry crosses and this is no exception. It smells of sweet berries after being ground up. The hit was berries and menthol. The high was very relaxing and slightly euphoric, taking me a bit of time to fully feel the effects. no paranoia or anxiety at all. Overall a great strain if you would just like to relax and calm down.

VThe nugs were a nice frosty, chronic green. The high was a nice sativa like high, the &quot;rush feeling&quot; while the couch lock is somewhat there, as long as you remain active and not lay down for a while you should have a creative positive uplifting high. This strain is a fun way to really boost  your day! \u000a

VGrants a very solid body high for me. Clears my head and mellows me out. Has great taste and smell, a little on the pine-ish side. Not a strain I&#39;d recommend for sleep disorders, but rather for a nice midday functional high.

Vthis strain is pretty great for a nice last pump before the night. as it starts kicking in I get a nice uplifted buzz eventually it mellows out and brings you back down  slowly leaving you at a calm relax mood. If I kept trying to chase that first energetic uplifted buzz it works but eventually you get dizzy and then extremely relaxed. Great for a now calm but exciting day! for me better at night times before I sleep

VA really great mellow strain.  This strain smells so great, like a fruity smell. The high truly mellow in my opinion and I really love it. The high takes about 15min to set in. Starts with a mild head high and perception change. Mood becomes very happy and giggly. Light body high leaves you relaxed. This strain is relaxing but not couch looking. Didn\u2019t experience any anxiety or paranoia. Would highly recommend for someone looking for a mild strain that\u2019s not too strong like a lot of the recreational strains can be. \u000a

VSo another review mentioned shroom level effects from this cross of Blueberry and THE classic Indica NL. Normally I would dismiss this kind of review as being overblown... but not in this case. THIS SHIT IS STRONG.  Go easy, because she hits fast and hits HARD. Not that you&#39;re going to have that trouble... because  you&#39;re gone by the third toke and likely forgot the pipe/joint/glass is even in your hand. Even if you are a seasoned user... this is gonna knock you on your ass and then out.

VI\u2019m prefacing this review by making it clear I\u2019m a veryyyyyy self aware person, so the body high I got from this left me disassociating for like 2 weeks after. Which is an awful feeling, if you\u2019ve ever felt it. Anyway. This strain can also make you just move slower, and make it hard for your body to like, catch up with your brain if that makes sense?? I did have pretty bad back/neck pain when I took this and that went away completely which was great, it\u2019s kind of numbing in a way. Which is good for pain but not great for other feelings? Like food kind of lost it\u2019s taste, and music all sounded the same, etc. It wAS relaxing &amp; helped me sleep pretty well, but not so much that I felt groggy the next day. It also gave me the munchies to a degree, more than other strains I\u2019ve tried. It was more mindless eating than anything and just losing track of time lol like an indica does. A bit of couchlock I\u2019d say as well. Overall it\u2019s probably good if that\u2019s the feeling you\u2019re going for but disassociating for so long kinda messed me up so I\u2019m not a fan of how indica-heavy this strain is and how much it slows me down. I also don\u2019t like how it can make you feel like you\u2019re not in your body?? But my friend who I did it with liked it, and it\u2019s great for body pain/sleeping/appetite stimulation.

Vsuper relaxing, great for end of day, nap time, before bed. sweet aroma and taste on the greens hit, takes the dense bud structure of classic Northern Lights and adds that beautiful blue tint and blueberry hints credited to the widely popular Blue Dream. if you get a chance, I highly recommend trying it!

Vvery nice euphoric high. beautiful leafy buds, and nice red hairs. has a frosty tint of crystals coated on every aspect of the bud. my batch smelt like an earthy, and had a fruity pinsol aroma. almost a musty smell in my opinon, but a very good musty HAHA!

VI&#39;d probably still just go with Northern Lights or Blueberry over this, but this is a solid indica strain. Takes on more of its look and scent from the Blueberry, but looks like Blueberry on steroids with more filled out big pillowy frosty buds. Very sedating/relaxing. Good for stress/insomnia.
