VLooking (waiting) for this strain in Toronto, but I don&#39;t think I have much of a chance at the present time... \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve yet to even HEAR someone mention it&#39;s parent strain, gorilla glue (any of the phenotypes) in my network. I&#39;m sure that there are private cultivators, and maybe some of the small connoisseur grow circles, that have proper G.G. genetics somewhere in or around the city... but I&#39;ve yet to come across it.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s other parent strain, the famed girl scout cookies, shows up in my circle every couple months. Sometimes it&#39;s the thin mint cut, and has a menthol taste on the exhale. Other times it is the sweet dessert flavoured pheno (I personally prefer it over the thin mints). Either way when there&#39;s gsc around, it gets bought up very quickly.

VDefinitely an interesting strain, to say the least. The aroma is quite unique, almost minty but with the pungency characteristic of Gorilla Glue, and can be tasted during consumption. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of Gorilla Glue&#39;s heavily sedating effects, but this strain is just the right blend of the parental lineages. The nugs are impressively sized, sticky and dense, caked with crystals and short, dark orange hairs. The high will leave you couchlocked for hours watching videos of spiders on youtube- and absolutely entranced the entire time. Great strain for vegetating or knocking yourself out after a long day of work.

VSmoked a bowl of this for the first time last night, and enjoyed a very pleasant wake and bake this morning. Very soothing, focused high. I suffer from anxiety and panic disorder. Typically I&#39;ll use an Indica strain to ease the constant tension I feel. However, I was recommended a hybrid to not only relax me, but also elevate my mood. This beautiful little strain definitely does the trick. The aroma of the buds is nothing short of fantastic. Sort of a grassy, earthy scent. A bit of a burn on inhale, but the exhale is smooth, very delicious. Earthy taste, with a hint of kind of a fresh, sort of mint like after taste. At least to me. This is the first time I&#39;ve tried a hybrid strain. But I can see why this particular hybrid bud is so highly rated. I would definitely recommend to a friend. Great for a good morning high. Definitely wonderful if you like to write, helps me stay focused.

VGorilla cookies was delicious. The distinct cookies flavor pairs well with gorilla glue creating a unique spicy earthy sweetness. Great for relaxing but I didn\u2019t notice many other distinct effects. Nice head buzz and light body relaxation but little for pain or appetite.

Vwell it is 11:26 a night and i currently have smoked already, but wanted to try this strain out (flower)  as i know it is potent. method of smoke for this one is a backwood i prefer these when going flower over cigarillos and they do not affect taste and burn slow enough of that let me grind and roll.\u000a\u000aBUD: very dense and coated with trichs inside and out it seems and to the smell to me piney or what you would call a earth to me a balanced mix between the two and on the end very slight sweetness that fades quickly almost candy like but subtle all kinds of things going on with this once grinded oh baby she opens up pungent and very aromatic not quite skunk but on the cusp of that has been added to the smell profile\u000a\u000aTASTE: first light was kind of what you would expect from what was explained  before inhale there is a sweet like taste that to me never quite forms well yet anyway but that you know is there at this moment the taste is very light i am four five pulls in. oh lordy the taste on the pallet has begun to develop and has a piney like earth taste that is balanced well enough you dont get one over the other and the sweetness that is candy like is kicked up a notch, the flavor coats the whole of your mouth and leaves an after taste shit i can tell this here is going to be good as  my mind is sharp im there i dont know what to do or thinkk bu my ass sure is thinking  like  there has to be some kind of midget or something on the back of my tongue like a boxer midget training hitting that ball at the back of your tongue at the roof of your mouth just hitting that that harder and harder each time i pull this backwood. this is a heavy high one that has the forehead and the eyes heavy, you feel yourself lifting them up from falling down  like you are weigh lifting only to realize that your eyes havent moved once not one bit! be prepared this one will have you locked the couch or stuck both in mind and in body heavily not for a beginner in my book but hey who am i? just realized it is 1:54 now and i havent even finished this review lol

VGorilla Cookies is definitely a potent strain of cannabis. The flowers are extremely sappy and dense. The buds are not the prettiest of buds but makes up for it with the potent punch it delivers. You can pull a little flavor from each of the parents to this strain, especially the Gorilla Glue.  Has a coffee like flavor on top of the classic cookie flavor. Gorilla Cookies is a potent cannabis strain that will surely be able to take you there....

VI know I already wrote a review about the strain but I just purchased the most dankest fresh strain  from a new dispensary in Michigan that just opened.  I smoked one joint and now I want to sleep and laugh or even both I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m talking about now bye Lol.\u000a\u000aPs helps with period cramps the best!!!

VIt&#39;s quite a good strain. A bit harsh when you inhale it but still it was delicious. This strain gives you a head high and a body high after. If you are an indica fan you&#39;ll probably love this.

VThis was a very nice high. I was wayyyyyyy relaxed but at the same time I was didn\u2019t feel \u201ccouch lock.\u201d A perfect strain for if you want to be high during the day but not have the sluggish feel. Pain went away very quickly and I am now ready to start my day.

Vmy eyes almost popped out of my skull when I saw how many trichomes were on the buds of Gorilla Cookies. without my glasses on, it looked like a nug covered in pretty sand. With glasses on, it looked frosty as hell and had the slightest, most subtle purple tinge to it.\u000a The smell wasn&#39;t too powerful, but it smoked well and definitely gets you stoney with only a bowl. It&#39;s fairly relaxing and good for winding down at night. Incorporating it into my nighttime yoga routine was pleasant.

VExcellent stain. I have tried quite a substantial amount of different strains over the years, and this would be my number one. It can even be quite psychedelic at times, and it partners with psilocybin mushrooms like no other. Try it, you will be glad you did.

VOne of the first strains I got excited about because it had everything I needed in a strain was Gorilla Glue #1, then I got a 1/2oz of this today and.... DAMN!  At first, because I&#39;m a daily toker (I suffer from chronic back and knee pain, and sports related plantar fasciitis, along with other issues such as ADHD, PTSD, GAD. and depression) I didn&#39;t feel a high (I&#39;d smoked a half a gram), so after a while of waiting to see if maybe it was a strain that was slow in &quot;kicking in &quot; for me, I toked another gram.. And 12 min later that&#39;s when it hit... I have to say it&#39;s the strangest high I&#39;ve ever had, but I LOVE it!  First I felt all the pain leave, it was like it opened a door and just left.. I was jumping up and down, touching my toes, leaning side to side, all without pain.. Then this excitement hit.. I wanted to do something, run, go for a walk, something active, it was a real URGE (my friend sitting next to me in the car that we were fish-bowling was feeling everything I was feeling, so we started cracking up that we were on the same level.. lol. So it gave us dork brain too.), even though all this was going on, we felt high but not high.. That&#39;s the strange thing, for the first 15 to 20 minutes we felt that way, stoned but not stoned, just freaking weird, but in a good way.. lol.  Then came the couch lock, but it started in our jaws, then hit our elbows, then the backs of our thighs, and the full lock.. Weirdest experience ever.. But an enjoyable one and this strain is just WONDERFUL for pain.. I&#39;ve been given so many different medications, but I always refused to take opiods or barbituates, it&#39;s never worth the risk to me.. so everything else I tried or was given had zero to little affect, cannabis the the only thing that helps me, and this by far is the best strain I&#39;ve ever tried when it comes to my pain.  \u000a\u000aPardon any typos, run-on sentences, ganked up grammar, and nonsense that may be present in this review.. I&#39;m beyond stoned right now and well, this strain has a way of making your brain stop, and making you not there.. lol.   I&#39;m sure it took me 2 hours to type this for all the long pauses I&#39;ve taken.. I feel like Calculon... lol!\u000a\u000aP.S.  This site always says most of the strains I&#39;ve tried is not available in Massachusetts.. Well, I&#39;m sitting here, in Massachusetts, toking on come Gorilla Cookies.. So, color me confused.. lol.  It said the same thing for the Gorilla Glue #1 I had, the Kobain, and the Girl Scout Cookies. o_O

VWhile the yield isnt quite where i would like it to be, its made up by in its potent, crystal covered buds. The crystals often cover any leaf to the tips that is near a bud. Lots of purple shows up in this strain later in flowering as it ripens. I also grow the original GG #4 and they sre so very similar in every way but the Gorilla Cookies adds a lil bit of weight and a slight difference in the flavor. Very tasty and as expected has a powerful effect. Concentrates are always top shelf from this strain as expected with so much resin production on the flower and close trim. Lots of stretch during flower. Anybody can grow this strain but it takes a good few crops, (im still working on it after about 9) to really get to know and figure out this strain and how to best cultivate it. The Gorilla Cookies likes the natural sun and is a heavy feeder both outdoors and indoors, or if grown indoors lots of light is a must.

VI&#39;m not gonna lie, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever write a review on weed in my life. I&#39;ve been looking on leafly for about 5 years now and have never thought to write a review until I tried this. DAMN. If you love indicia and love to just sit back relax and eat some food, this is the absolute best strain for you. Also, all pain will easily get relieved (had a bit of a headache before smoking it). My body feels so amazing and cozy no matter what position I sit in and I overall feel at complete bliss. Great strain, very happy, and it doesn&#39;t have you sitting there laughing and nothing, it&#39;s great for just an amazing chill session and happiness. Not to mention, I also just had some amazing sex after smoking it :)! Overall amazing strain and definitely goes in my top 3.\u000aPS: Forgot to mention, dry mouth is a bitch with this one. I mean it&#39;s really bad. My mouth feels like a desert but luckily I have water nearby. Still an AMAZING strain though.

VI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t like it reminds me of Gellato or Wedding Cake even Tangie Dream cuz the effects were light weight Sativa all the way. I know people love having euphoria and energy with little stone and no couch lock but it was too clear headed for me. I prefer a little Stoney effect from my hybrids. But taste and looks incredible doesn\u2019t get much better when it comes to look/taste/flavor but effects are lacking, my IBD is still killin me so not for me!!

You can smoke it anytime of day, but it&#39;s more indica so if you wanna be super productive I wouldn&#39;t recommend. If you&#39;re looking to mop your floors or reorganize your bookshelves then I&#39;d recommend it. Enjoy it guys!!
