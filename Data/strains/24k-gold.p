VVaporized in a Da Buddha, Crafty and Pax 3\u000a\u000aPicked this up from Fweedom Cannabis in Mount Lake Terrace. I&#39;m  medical patient with a lifetime of experience and a strong tolerance and this is a winner.\u000a\u000aBefore I&#39;m even finished with my bowl any stress I&#39;ve had is gone, my mood is happy and uplifted and I want to engage more with the world. Also quite relaxing, which is fine if you want to sit around. I have CPTSD along with high levels of stress and anxiety, this strain knocks them all out. &#128591;&#127995;\u000a\u000aThis is an end of day strain for me. It leaves my body too relaxed to want to do much of anything, not quite couch lock, just cozy feeling. Like you&#39;d want to curl up in blankets and watch a movie. Or gaming, either with friends or solo and video games. This doesn&#39;t produce a lot of hunger in me, which is a bonus.\u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re just starting out, please enjoy it!!!Holy, when I was young we got &quot;weed&quot; in baggies, no fancy names, you were just happy to have some. Go big, have fun, try all the strains! it&#39;s not like it will hurt you, can&#39;t overdose on thc. \u000a\u000aIf anything feels at all too much or uncomfortable, have some black pepper. Honest, just put a few sprinkles on your tongue and feel any unpleasant vibes melt away. Works like a charm. \u000a\u000aOne star docked because I dance around 2-5 hours a day and this strain doesn&#39;t enhance my practice time at all. \u000a\u000aMy favorite strains for being physically active are: Double Dream, Candyland (sativa or sativa dom hybrid), Chem Stardashian, golden ticket and narnia. \u000a\u000aIf you train, perform or are extremely physically active, the above strains are great for relieving pain and inflammation. They are also uplifting, happy and euphoric which feels great when moving.\u000a\u000aThanks for joining me on another journey of a review. \u270c&#127995; \u000a

Vyou can change the name, give it no name, call it schnauzerganj...Kosher Tangie now 24K Gold is better than any Gold chain, Gold ring, Gold tooth, even better than ancient mayan gold artifacts. This doll is a dime, atleast mine is but I have the benefit of a hall of fame producer who generates all star herb on a routine basis. GEESH in WA is not commercial..it&#39;s 1000 times better...24K will have you feeling like you just base jumped off a 20,000ft cliff with your winged suite on.

VGood for sleep. Knocked me on my butt. My partner uses it for pain and insomnia and she&#39;s able to consistently crash out and get a full night of restful sleep without that 2 am &quot;rebound effect&quot; that cannabis is known for. Not a social strain or even that good for TV or other couch lock activities. I smoke it and I am ready for bed. Munchies weren&#39;t that bad. No particularly creative strain. Just good for sedation.

V     I only give a five star rating when it is so bomb I can&#39;t stop thinking about it! This here is very close to five but the taste isn&#39;t my favorite. \u000a     I have major social anxiety and ADD to the extreme, I got my hands on some of this 24k and immediately started to calm down. I don&#39;t smoke a lot but when I do, I make sure it is something that we&#39;ll help me not just get me stoned.\u000a     I like this strain a lot but after I smoke it, she puts me out like a newborn baby haha! I&#39;d rather have that upbeat stone, so if you&#39;re like me, make sure you smoke this before bed &#128077;&#127996;

VNugs are dark green, with dark orange hairs, and are covered in green kief. The nugs have a strong, sweet smell of oranges, with a little earthiness.

VMore. Munchies. Now. Excellent pain relief at a smaller than usual dose. Onset was quick and it really deepened over time. Mostly body effects, but with a fairly strong cerebral element, especially while  listening to music. Really sleepy at the end. I recommend this strain for anyone who needs an appetite, and anyone like me who deals with chronic pain.

VKosher Kush is one of my favorite strains, so naturally I was intrigued by this cross with the legendary citrus Sativa, Tangie.\u000a\u000aSurprisingly, the flavors of both parent strains come through: the earthiness of Kosher Kush combines with the citrus to make a very tasty smoke. And the high. Wow. It comes on quickly, but then grows over at least an hour before it hits its peak. \u000a\u000aLike most hybrids, it starts with a head high, which is clear, but strong, and the body high gradually gathers strength until it&#39;s the dominant experience after about an hour. It&#39;s perfect for chilling out in the evening because, though it will help you go to sleep, it won&#39;t put you to sleep against your will.\u000a\u000aTop shelf stuff. I&#39;ll be getting more of it.

VGot this from a dispensary saying their version was a sativa dominant hybrid. I believe the general leafly description though, definitely have more indica dominant effects.

Sometimes I feel like people go overboard when combining strains, but this hybrid hits the nail on the head.\u000aForm: Shatter\u000aTHC: ~70%\u000aTaste 5/5 One of the best tasting strains period. The Tangie mixes with the Kosher Kush &amp; makes it almost tastes like an orange tic tac on the exhale.\u000aHigh 5/5 \u000aFor me in heavier doses this provides a nice couch lock. In lighter doses it is a great muscle relaxant.

Vbag appeal and nose are top notch. GF described as perfect for a So Cal beach christmas, piney and intense lemon and orange peels. unfortunately also tastes like orange rinds, dry pine needles and something vaguely earthy. nevertheless, the soaring tingly and euphoric high kicks in immediately. watching basketball I feel like the court cam soaring to and fro getting every second of the action in vibrant HD full color glory. I&#39;m also thirsty as fuck. keep dosing and the indica kicks in, crushing but not locking...I could get up to do something, but imagine it would not be enjoyable.

VThe taste and smell is pretty good. I tried this when I had a cold, it help me rest for about an hour. There&#39;s no waiting on this one, after two hits I&#39;m definitely feeling ripped. It&#39;s probably 20%+ THC because it had a good effect, there are some strains where you have to wait a bit to feel something, maybe I was just tired. In addition, the aroma was delightful.\u000a\u000aI have nothing bad to say about this. The initial high is effective and you seem to get to second gear after 20 minutes. I had this with cheeseburger and it was great. If you&#39;re more of a Sativa guy like me then this would be good strain for after work relaxing at home.

VWooooow man....told myself I wasn&#39;t going to review any more strains but I had to log in for this one....\u000a\u000aVery rarely can I find a strain that is extremely sativa AND indica potent. Usually I will 99.99% of the time feel a dominance in there somewhere. \u000a\u000aWith this? No. It&#39;s like I&#39;m asleep. The extremely GDP reminiscent indica has put me into a sleep paralysis. I feel the weight of my head as everything seems to be sucked downwards almost like I&#39;m in a centrifuge. I can&#39;t even sit up for a drink or water. My jaw, neck, shoulders....they&#39;re stretching downwards and unable to stop it. \u000a\u000aThen the dreamy sativa kicks in. Not behind the eyes like you might expect. It&#39;s in the forehead. As I look at my hands I begin to feel like I can no longer recognize myself. Like my person is different from my consciousness. \u000a\u000aIt really is like I&#39;m asleep. This is one solid ride here everyone. I&#39;ve taken this strain to a 10 and it does not disappoint. \u000a\u000aSmell: Oranges and pine.\u000aTaste: Spinach, bitter, quite awful actually. \u000aLooks: Nothing special.\u000a\u000aHigh: Refer to whatever the hell I wrote earlier. This is solid stuff. Paranoia is a little there, but manageable. Very mild tactile hallucinations, again, very manageable. This could be the greatest strain I&#39;ve ever tried.

VThe taste and smell is pretty good. I tried this when I had a cold, it help me rest for about an hour. There&#39;s no waiting on this one, after two hits I&#39;m definitely feeling ripped. It&#39;s probably 20%+ THC because it had a good effect, there are some strains where you have to wait a bit to feel something, maybe I was just tired. In addition, the aroma was delightful.\u000a\u000aI have nothing bad to say about this. The initial high is effective and you seem to get to second gear after 20 minutes. I had this with cheeseburger and it was great. If you&#39;re more of a Sativa guy like me then this would be good strain for after work relaxing at home.

VThis is one of my favorite strains! It leaves me clear headed with a very nice body high. All of my senses are heightened and it makes me feel extremely happy and relaxed. Being outside after medicating with this was amazing. I felt the breeze on my skin and was very in tune with my surroundings. This strain is one of my top choices for my anxiety and depression. Some strains still give me a slight anxious feeling after using them but I don&#39;t feel that way at all with this strain. I also suffer from insomnia and still had a hard time falling asleep after medicating but it is great for day time use. I will definitely be getting this again!

VHot damn, just like the name suggests, this may be the gold standard in Indica dominant hybrids.\u000a\u000a24K Gold starts with a delicious sour orange flavor, which stayed strong throughout the session.\u000a\u000aEffects were extremely relaxing, deep body soothing, and mentally calming. It was like one of my other favorite nighttime strains, Frida, minus the CBD effects and much more potent. \u000a\u000aThe last time I slept this deeply, I was knocked out by Strawberry Fields, but this keeps you asleep without the same grogginess I got from the SF. \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re looking for a new strain for pain and insomnia, this is one you should move to the top of your list.

VPurchased for only $10/g @ Green World on 8 mile in Detroit, MI. Very surprised that a $10 strain was exceptional for me &amp; I have a VERY HIGH Tolerance. I smoke $20 grams daily, but there are still strains that blow me away. This strain didn&#39;t quite do that, but is the best $10 strain I&#39;ve tried that I can remember. Remember, I&#39;m used to top shelf, but was given this free &amp; was very happy with it. Great hybrid high, no paranoia or anxiousness for me. \u000aWould highly recommend to get this to save money &amp; in my opinion it&#39;s almost top shelf. Jet Fuel @ the same place ($15/g) was better than any bud I&#39;ve tried @ Herbal Remedies (Used to be my normal spot..hard to pass up 5g &#188;s on Wednesdays..if u get a $60 \u215b ($20/g), u are getting $30 more bud for free.

I&#39;m vibrating such positive energy right now.  Smoked this with my husband and it didn&#39;t put us to sleep ... how ever it is very very relaxing. But it is very strong, so that we parked in front of the garage, rolled another joint, smoked it, chilled a bit in the car watching soccer videos (mostly him) and funny cat videos..... and I complete forgot what I was thinking as I&#39;m in the house now ... and there was a crippy guy outside .. but I didn&#39;t get paranoid ! so..

I&#39;m not sure about the upbeat part, but I was DEF mellowed out. Lots of giggles. High behind the eyes and totally relaxed. Taste was bomb. Highly recommend if you want to lax out with friends.

VA simultaneously mellow and uplifting strain; I suffer from severe depression and mild PTSD, so this has, so far, been able to balance between lifting my depression, but not setting off anxiety and panic. I&#39;m very lucky to have found this one, and I can&#39;t wait to find a dispensary near me who stock it regularly.

VThis is one of my favorite strains! It leaves me clear headed with a very nice body high. All of my senses are heightened and it makes me feel extremely happy and relaxed. Being outside after medicating with this was amazing. I felt the breeze on my skin and was very in tune with my surroundings. This strain is one of my top choices for my anxiety and depression. Some strains still give me a slight anxious feeling after using them but I don&#39;t feel that way at all with this strain. I also suffer from insomnia and still had a hard time falling asleep after medicating but it is great for day time use. I will definitely be getting this again!

VIt almost taste like a sour tangerine candy, it smells a lot of tangerine or orange. The taste is weird at first. For anxiety patients like me, I recommend first trying this strain in a relaxed setting as the tangie sativa side can border on unnerving, it fades with tolerance.

I can smoke this and still make dinner, go on errands, etc. I haven&#39;t had much of it yet, but I can see this strain becoming a mainstay on the shelf. Calm mood mixed with a modest energetic motivational feelings. 10/10

I like a balance between being high, and alleviating my pain and chaxia and insomnia. It didn&#39;t last very long either. But I also give it 4 stars because I know it has the potential to be better. Anywho it did what I needed it to do just need more quantity.

The taste, when smoked, also has a citrus tinge to it but without that earthiness and cheesiness I picked up in the scent of the bud.\u000a\u000aThe high comes on relatively quickly and it is pleasant. Not super intense but not lightweight either. It makes you euphoric and very giggly. Good times.

VScent is amazing, GF describes as perfect for the season, sunny and cold So Cal summer, pine and citrus. the batch I got is somewhat dense, and VERY sticky and covered in trichs. flavor is like vaping orange rind, sage and pine needles, as in the scent of vanilla extract and the flavor are not one in the same haha. high is extremely fast acting, euphoric and crushing all at the same time. not couchlocked by any stretch of the imagination, but I can imagine getting up to do anything would be less than pleasant. still a world class trip and would suggest to anyone looking for a good chill around the house strain.

I got this in an 8th because it was a premium strain but honestly this is the worst bag I&#39;ve had since I got my MMJ Card. I&#39;ve had great strains from this dispensary (Cherry cream pie is my favorite). But this one was a huge let down.
