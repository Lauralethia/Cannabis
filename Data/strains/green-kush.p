VHit fast!  One B load and I was on my way, walking of course.  A bit of anxious paranoia as the mental kicked in, mellowed out while walking outside, serious cottonmouth.  Generally gentle but powerful high, awake, bright eyed, music is genius.  Go for a hike, find a new hobby, make dinner for loved ones and sleep content.

VWhen I first say GK I was not very excited. However, the smell was wonderful, the taste waste yummy, and I was moving around and doing stuff. Incredibly sticky and dense. The high for me lasted hours on very little and I found myself smoking less.

VGot a batch of this under the assumption it was its Green Crack Sativa alternate which obviously was not the case. Ive since switched it to my evening time batch where it lay best for me. For a evening time its really not bad at all. Not one of my favorites but certainly not bad. It does produce a certain level of brain fog and the taste is rather bitter for my taste buds however that aside id say this is a smoke better used for watching a movie or something to that effect.

Vit could really use another round of cross breeding to.bring more of the energizing buzz of green cracking to the forefront. had great smell and taste.  doc oc, lovely dense spreads far.  tastes fits description. it ends in eventual slight burnt out feeling.  cross this with some quality Nigerian haze and you got a winner

VGreen Kush is cerebral &amp; I am all for cerebral. I tried it out &amp; about the city so the relaxing body feel simply mellowed me out &amp; kept a smile on this face. Good for retreating under the covers or a weekend at home, feet tucked &amp; some good food! Maybe a friend or two. I can dig it!

Vsome strain to relax to. well.... let&#39;s say just not to have any task that requires focus. it&#39;s hard. But washing the dishes, looking into the phone for hours or humping the wife are good things to do while being on this strain. A very very nice body sensation and a mindset to be surely not distracted by thoughts. have food and beverages ready and you&#39;ll have a good time!
