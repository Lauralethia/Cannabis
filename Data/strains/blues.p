VThis is one of my favourite strains as if you wanted to relax and get some sleep or just chill out with mates, it&#39;s perfect. \u000aI don&#39;t think it has any bad sides to it (other than feeling lazy the day after) but the following day(s) feel very motivated and determined \u000aI rate blues highly!

VLike other reviewers have said, Ive had lots of different kinds of blues - the quality, taste, and type of high vary from grower to grower. generally a sweet berry smell with blue cheese flavours. high is typically a strong body high with a little head high. generally speaking I love this shit.

VPeople to this day up north still don&#39;t realise that (pukka) blues and blue cheese are totally diffrent strains. this one is more heady and totally smells of berries not the strongest around but does the job.

VI can&#39;t get enough of the taste of this bud. It&#39;s a very common strain in some parts of the world and when you get a choice of very standard strains (blue cheese, amnesia, lemon haze etc) this is my go to choice. It&#39;s an extremely  acquired taste and smell, it&#39;s pungent of chemicals and tastes just the same. A lot of people won&#39;t like this strain because it&#39;s a such a strange taste and smell but I love it. It&#39;s  very moreish. Even if it doesn&#39;t seem very appealing to you, I would give this strain a go.

VThis strain is definitely not blue cheese. Grown both out many times and livers has a sweeter taste and less couch lock than BC. Livers is the clone only and Ugorg seed co have cubed it which they called blues basically one and the same. When taken at nine weeks gives me a really giddy high with plenty of euphoria. Taken after nine weeks becomes more couchy and earthy in taste.\u000a \u000a\u000a

VIf I can help it, the only strain I smoke. Northern UK. Great tasting, berry skunky aroma with a sweet after taste. It&#39;s pretty rough and ready, doesn&#39;t look up to much but it has a long lasting pleasant effect that rounds off nicely. This strain is rare if you don&#39;t have a link but also it&#39;s one of those strains where there&#39;s no fooling the buyer, you can tell straight away it&#39;s blues, there&#39;s nothing quite the same. No anxiety, racing thoughts or uncomfortable feelings present. Very good for anxious smokers or those looking to aid sleep or relaxation peacefully. Only heard good words about it, except maybe from kids who want the strongest mind twisting strains, real long time smokers know what&#39;s up with Blues.

VIve smoked this strain on and off for over 10years back then it was 1 of the best buds around but its hard to get a good batch of it most of the time I can&#39;t get high smoking it unless it&#39;s been grown ten out of ten
