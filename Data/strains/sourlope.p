VI like the lope. This strain is strong, tasty and relaxing for a sativa. It definitely got my mind loose but it&#39;s no prom queen. I&#39;d recommend it for sure and would not turn it down if it passed my way again.

VVaped nicely. Strong head buzz but overwhelming paranoia and not the energetic, uplifting feeling I was going for. It&#39;s personal preference of course but I did not care for this strain at all.

VOne of my favorites.  I&#39;m high tolerance and &quot;paradoxical&quot; so it&#39;s difficult for me to find strains that don&#39;t mess with my anxiety, depression or ptsd. This does nicely.  A strong buzzy head, but not fuzzy. It&#39;s good for daytime for me.  Not motivating or energizing, but doesn&#39;t make me lazy.  On my personal scale, I give it an 8/10

VI waited more than a year for this wonderful strain to make its way back to the area--and it was worth the wait!!\u000aArizona Organix are the only ones around that have it, and their flower did not disappoint.  It&#39;s a nice head, not too buzzy,  but you feel the stone, and not too &quot;focused&quot;  but leaves you with clarity that is perfect for daytime.  \u000aLove Love LOVE Sourlope &lt;3

VJesus. You&#39;re going to get things done, that&#39;s for sure.  Mucho energy, si? Little short on legs, though. 2 to 3 hr. before having to remedicate. .. but they&#39;ll sure as hell be productive hours. deals with inflammation fairly well, good smell.

VBest strain I&#39;ve ever had. The batch I got tested over 26% THC and left so much kief. Super clear headed and uplifting. Good for days or evenings without harsh sativa effects.

VThis is a strong Sativa that has a very fruity or tropical taste to it.  Has a lot of trichomes on it, so use a grinder to harvest some kief from breaking it up for smoking.  When the medicine is working on you, true to its Sativa nature, its very energetic, euphoric, and just lively.  It does have a kick to it, meaning it&#39;s runs on the stronger side of the Sativas.  \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve used this during the day for pain management, when I need something a little strong, but that won&#39;t necessarily knock you out.
