VJust picked up 5gs of this strain fresh and new to there dispensary, it was their highest shelf and that was true. very dense buds with dark green leaves scattered among lighter ones with dark orange almost reddish hairs entangling it. the smoke is smooth and light on the throat and lungs (unlike post 98 bubba strains) leaves you feeling fully relaxed with no pain what so ever and wanting a nice meal. you dont get out of your mind high but it gives you the full body effects. 2 thumbs up.

V&#127861;&#127794; Pre-98 Bubba Kush is the perfect indica for beginners. It gives you just the right amount of relaxation without leaving you feeling totally stoned. It smells like mild decaf coffee mixed with a forest. It didn&#39;t leave me as sedated as I like with my indicas, but I did enjoy the high very much. Limonene: 5.98 mg/g, a-Pinene: 3.95 mg/g, b-Myrcene 0.62 mg/g.

Vreally nice end of a long day strain I felt myself unwinding and calming down since it was a peaking bad day I was putting behind me, real amnesia effects though I don&#39;t really mind it but some people do, taste look and buzz were all mostly great just not really the strongest indica out there but not every indica needs to be, giggle fits here and there and muscle relaxation to the max. I would recommend this strain to a novice toker or a high tolerance looking for a good medicated feel, if you&#39;re looking for a crazy strong indica you&#39;ve definitely found it however it&#39;s still not the craziest or strongest, but definitely memorable and worth the price

VI&#39;m a huge kush fan since I&#39;m under 30 with osteoporosis and epilepsy...and the P98 was great!!! My cousin, uncle, aunt and I went to a great collective just outside Seattle; we picked up 6 other strains of medicine and we kept turning back to the P98...the other kush&#39;s were good but NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE P98!!! It&#39;s up there with MTF and Jack Herer

VI really like the Pre-98.  This indica is PERFECT after a long work-day, in the middle of the week, for relaxation followed by a deep long sleep.  Zaps pain, anxiety, but can make you lazy.  Personally, I can get a little  anxiety for a few minutes if hit too much, too quick.  However, this drawback is short lived and followed by hours of bliss.   Waking up after using this before sleep poses zero layover.  Like it!

VI cannot stress how dank the Pre-98 is, it smells amazing plus gives you a very very nice HIGH. This is mostly Indica dominant and if your an Indica fan it&#39;s a damn strong strain, mostly Indica with a tad of sativa, I recommend this strain to all as you will not be disappointed!

VWe have here an awesome strain! And yes, it&#39;s from before 1998. Even if the modern weed feel sometimes stronger, there&#39;s something great about this herb. It&#39;s buzz is much more stress relieving than it&#39;s Bubba Kush more modern declination. Both have similar painkilling effect except that the stoned buzz is much stronger when you take it&#39;s sister plant. Very tasty. Less pungent than her family, the weed have this nice pine aftertaste better than the recent version but couple with the same Earth and Sweet taste. Great to alternate when you&#39;re a big Bubba Kush consumer.  The declination provided to me by my dispensary was also perfect so that might have an influence on my final mark. Simply great cannabis!

VI&#39;ve had sleeping problems all my life, and now thanks to this amazing strain, I&#39;ve been consistently getting 8 hour blocks of sleep. As a bonus, music sounds great, and day smokers will also be rewarded with a powerful high and a case of the giggles. The aroma of the herb is a great, rich sweet/sour, and the flavor is milder but &quot;tastier&quot; than other indicas. Of course, I did get dry mouth and an increased appetite, but the hunger attack was noticeably less severe than with other strains. It&#39;s also great for pain relief. My friend sprained his ankle, and he mentioned that it greatly reduced his pain. Indeed I&#39;ve also noticed that it helps me out when I get a bad gout flare up. This has quickly become my favorite strain, and a favorite of most of my friends, and is my go-to bud of choice. It&#39;s been a miracle drug for me, and I seldom feel the need to smoke anything else.

VPre-98 Bubba Kush is good, but ONLY Pre-98, regular BK is meh. Love the soft sweet smell with the gentle pungency. The buds are not really dense, but that seems to simply be genetics. I have tried it from several places and its all pretty much the same. A good go-to if you are helping someone new to smoking navigate strains.

VJust bought and tryed for the first time... Really enjoying it! Pre-98 Bubba Kush is very reminiscent of my high school years in the late 90s; the description is quite accurate. Felt the effects pretty moderately after just one hit and 10 minutes, two more hits and I was was good for the night. I feel calm and relaxed, a little hungry, and am not in pain, but I&#39;m not totally out of it which is nice... Decent amount of smoke per hit and smoother than most (no throat burn). Flavor better than expected, really does have a bit of coffee aftertaste and I don&#39;t feel like I immediately need to brush my teeth. There is a lot of turnaround with strains in my area and very few dispensaries, so I rarely get to buy the same thing more than twice. I will be going back asap to pick up more of this one before it disappears. Five Stars.

Make no mistake...if you hit this stuff hard you&#39;ll be in the happy relaxation stratosphere. \u000a\u000aThe smell I get from the bud is earthy with a hint of coffee.

VI have epilepsy, and this is one strain that is seizure free approved by me.  A very heady high usually provokes my seizures, and I&#39;ve struggled for years to find a strain that I can thoroughly enjoy.  I nearly cried when I smoked this one.  A very sobering high, and just makes you feel satisfied wherever you are.  Doesn&#39;t glue you to the couch, and encourages creativity without the tweakiness of a sativa.  Adaptable and versatile.  If you are new to smoking at all, this would also be a good strain for you as you learn to navigate things.

VPossibly the best come-on you&#39;ll ever experience. Voraciously excited and full of life, just bursting with happiness and optimism! Makes conversation infinitely more interesting and allows you to talk as intricately as you&#39;d like about complex topics. Incredibly satisfying with waves of physical pleasure washing over your entire body. Things effect you at a piercingly emotional level that&#39;s thrilling and enjoyable. Visuals are excessively rich and pop with an eye-catching intensity rarely seen with most strains. There&#39;s a ton of synesthesia, where experiencing one sense will effect a different one. Like, visuals and music stimulate a potent physical response. Music and movies are roller coaster experiences - perfectly cinematic and involving. Touch is wonderfully heightened, inducing surges of intense pleasure. One of the absolute best - and almost downright overwhelming - for sexy time. Still quite, quite high after a surprisingly long while. Goddamn, this is a good come down. Still perfectly positive with no slump or crash. Still could do something if energy required. Really feel part of a place. Good for atmospheric and moody environments. Concerts, I&#39;m sure. Of the close to a hundred different strains I&#39;ve tried, this is likely the best. The perfect balance of gone-ness, euphoria, potency, length, and sensory accentuation. No other strain has this much of this goodness without more notable flaws. #1.

VPossibly the best come-on you&#39;ll ever experience. Voraciously excited and full of life, just bursting with happiness and optimism! Makes conversation infinitely more interesting and allows you to talk as intricately as you&#39;d like about complex topics. Incredibly satisfying with waves of physical pleasure washing over your entire body. Things effect you at a piercingly emotional level that&#39;s thrilling and enjoyable. Visuals are excessively rich and pop with an eye-catching intensity rarely seen with most strains. There&#39;s a ton of synesthesia, where experiencing one sense will effect a different one. Like, visuals and music stimulate a potent physical response. Music and movies are roller coaster experiences - perfectly cinematic and involving. Touch is wonderfully heightened, inducing surges of intense pleasure. One of the absolute best - and almost downright overwhelming - for sexy time. Still quite, quite high after a surprisingly long while. Goddamn, this is a good come down. Still perfectly positive with no slump or crash. Still could do something if energy required. Really feel part of a place. Good for atmospheric and moody environments. Concerts, I&#39;m sure. Of the close to a hundred different strains I&#39;ve tried, this is likely the best. The perfect balance of gone-ness, euphoria, potency, length, and sensory accentuation. No other strain has this much of this goodness without more notable flaws. #1.

VThe real Bubba Kush! Pre-98 Bubba Kush is  as rare as a rainbow maned unicorn. One of the best Indicas ever created and the base for many crosses. Strong and pungent earthy and spicy flavors permeate the bud and the quick onset body high is hard to forget unless you smoke to much and it makes you. Good luck finding a true pre-98 bubba kush, although there are plenty of examples out there on the recreational Washington market but they are probably not a true pre-98 bubba kush.

VI&#39;m melting into my couch. This stuff smells like chocolate and coffee. At first sniff I couldn&#39;t even tell you that this is cannabis. It&#39;s been said this weed is more similar to what was grown in the golden day&#39;s of the hippy. This is nice and tranquilizing. It relieves in a very bodily capacity, letting the user feel truly mellow in mind and body. This stuff makes a toker quite comfortable. This would be a top pick for any indica lover.

VFrom GTI and Rythm CO2 Cart- I feel a warmth as the anxiety rushes away. This is a new strain for me in general so I was interested in this 1:1\u000aTHC To CBD strain of course. I diddnt enjoy the other 1:1 I\u2019ve tried so hoping this is different. Now a second puff ...it just tastes old school. Earthy. I feel both my mind and body slowly becoming one \u261d&#127997; and feeling the same anti anxiety fighting CBD in this strain. The Indica THC + Cannabinoids truly also give your mind and body a nice kick in the ass to lay down or atleast it feels like you could and that\u2019s amazing for PTSD. I have to take a 4th puff as I\u2019m really enjoying this strain. I\u2019m known to get anxiety and this truly is nice having the relaxing of my mind but not anxiety present. Atleast now. Ok 4th puff - I also have Crohns and this also relaxes my stomach to be able to eat which is really hard for me. Also I really again am enjoying this mental relaxation without anxiety or too much energetic thoughts. Well guys I wasn\u2019t sure about this one but it may be put into my top 5 have to have strains for PTSD peeps. Let\u2019s wait 10\u2019minutes and see if anxiety creeps back. But first another puff ... 5 puffs now ... 10 minutes later - no anxiety I feel great. It\u2019s a medical strain that does it\u2019s job plus a little bit more ;) love this strain.

VThis is hands-down one of my favorite strains. I don&#39;t like to get too spaced out but getting a little ethereal never hurts, and this little baby gets you there. Increased sociability, decreased anxiety, and a slight inclination toward the giggles... but for me, an active lady with 2 rods and a fistful of screws in her spine, this is really an incredible pain reliever that doesn&#39;t slow you down. Helpful for muscle spasms, nerve pain, and bone pain. I think this would be great for toothaches actually! The only downside is some pretty annoying dry mouth, but I have yet to personally experience a strain that doesn&#39;t cause this for me. No munchies though. Just a straightforward little buzz with big body benefits. Not my fave for daytime (it makes me a little too foggy), and wouldn&#39;t be my first choice for insomnia (not a super sedative), but great for those magic hours in-between - and weekends!

VI&#39;ve signed up just to review this strain. As a 16 year veteran, who&#39;s moved on to concentrates and oils to really get &#39;blazed&#39; again, this was a pleasant surprise. I rec&#39;d some pretty goopy Live Resin, got home and loaded up a mild sized dab. After heating my nail, I let it cool and took the dab. First noticeable reaction is, holy shit that tastes clean, and very good. About 5 minutes later I was stuck to my couch, and would be that way for the next three hours. Extreme body buzz, and laughing like a teenager. Medical note; I&#39;m a terrible sleeper, having trouble getting more than 6 hours, and this bad boy knocked me out for 9 hours.

VThis herb was/is  PRIVATE RESERVE $20/gr.  It smells amazing. Light green with hairs and frosted in trichs.  This is a nice strong indica with one bowl allowing me to be social and two bowls getting me ready for bed.  I can smell the jar it comes in time and time again because this lady has one awesome scent. \u000a\u000aThe smoke is great but not over powering (I like the over-powering effect of the OGs)  like some of the OGs. This weed pairs up well with the FIRE OG I also got there (Long Beach GREEN ROOM) . It is slightly psychedelic, which I like. Very relaxing and stress relieving, there is a body numbing affect making this particular strain good for pain relief as well.

I&#39;ve been waiting to try this strain and I think once I did it wasn&#39;t what I expected and not in a bad way either. I thought Pre98 would be more of a loud smell and overload heavy hitter but it wasnt. I still really enjoyed it. I would probably try something else next time though.

VMy review is for those with body aches (back problems for me). I&#39;ve been back at it lighting up for a little over a year now (after a 15yr post high school break). My budtender recommended grinding P98 with another non-CBD strain. \u000aI hadn&#39;t felt that kind of relief since I started smoking again. The high is a bit more mild, but the absence of pain is hard to argue with. I start my day with a microdose of P98 mixture and it has made all of the difference.

VFrom GTI and Rythm CO2 Cart- I feel a warmth as the anxiety rushes away. This is a new strain for me in general so I was interested in this 1:1\u000aTHC To CBD strain of course. I diddnt enjoy the other 1:1 I\u2019ve tried so hoping this is different. Now a second puff ...it just tastes old school. Earthy. I feel both my mind and body slowly becoming one \u261d&#127997; and feeling the same anti anxiety fighting CBD in this strain. The Indica THC + Cannabinoids truly also give your mind and body a nice kick in the ass to lay down or atleast it feels like you could and that\u2019s amazing for PTSD. I have to take a 4th puff as I\u2019m really enjoying this strain. I\u2019m known to get anxiety and this truly is nice having the relaxing of my mind but not anxiety present. Atleast now. Ok 4th puff - I also have Crohns and this also relaxes my stomach to be able to eat which is really hard for me. Also I really again am enjoying this mental relaxation without anxiety or too much energetic thoughts. Well guys I wasn\u2019t sure about this one but it may be put into my top 5 have to have strains for PTSD peeps. Let\u2019s wait 10\u2019minutes and see if anxiety creeps back. But first another puff ... 5 puffs now ... 10 minutes later - no anxiety I feel great. It\u2019s a medical strain that does it\u2019s job plus a little bit more ;) love this strain.

VPicked this up at Beaver Bowls when it was the Bowl\u000aof the Day , so for an eighth it was $35 after tax.\u000a\u000aThese compact dark green nugs smelled strongly of hash and sweet incense, but the taste isn&#39;t sweet at all. Earthy, woody and a strong taste of dark, black coffee on the exhale.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve smoked a couple of joints so far, and the effects come on quickly: an uplifting rush followed by a strong body stone. It&#39;s very relaxing and contemplative, and certainly helps out putting you to sleep.\u000a\u000aOne downside is that I&#39;ve never had a strain dry out my mouth and eyes like this one. Transformed the whites of my eyes into fiery red coals.

VPre 98 bubba from tru med in AZ. Best bubba I&#39;ve ever had. The pre 98&#39; definitely has the most &#39;authentic&#39; bubba kush experience I&#39;ve had. these buds are sticky, dense, with purple hues and lots of trichs. Smells extremely pungent with a chemical coffee exhale. Amazing strain!

VI&#39;ve signed up just to review this strain. As a 16 year veteran, who&#39;s moved on to concentrates and oils to really get &#39;blazed&#39; again, this was a pleasant surprise. I rec&#39;d some pretty goopy Live Resin, got home and loaded up a mild sized dab. After heating my nail, I let it cool and took the dab. First noticeable reaction is, holy shit that tastes clean, and very good. About 5 minutes later I was stuck to my couch, and would be that way for the next three hours. Extreme body buzz, and laughing like a teenager. Medical note; I&#39;m a terrible sleeper, having trouble getting more than 6 hours, and this bad boy knocked me out for 9 hours. Pre 98 Bubba Kush took me back to the old days, instant favorite.

VFirst time trying this strain, I had avoided it for a long time. I tend to be such a lightweight with indicas. I can&#39;t function at all when using them. But. as with most things, there&#39;s a time and a place. My more common goal is to find a strain that can help me function, feeling physically energetic (though not necessarily active) as well as mentally, stay focused and work consistently. I don&#39;t need to do a lot of physical work, but the usual chores and so on have to be done. For these goals I know more or less what works.\u000a\u000aOn days that I might be in severe pain, or if you sometimes wonder whether you&#39;ll ever sleep again due to the &quot;M&quot; word (or the peri &quot;M: word), this did it for me! I read a lot of reviews: I know my own lightweightness with anything indica. I was prepared for the &quot;heaviness&quot; that accompanies it, and which I usually don&#39;t like because it just stops me in my tracks, and that&#39;s the end of the day, no matter what time the clock thinks it is. Knowing this, and being quite conservative because of it, I smoked some sticky green bud in a bong, my usual method nowadays.\u000a\u000aI took just one rip from my bong, about eight seconds. I went outside and sat in the hot tub. I enjoyed floating and the warmth of the water, as I always do, but nothing else seemed to be happening. I stayed in there just thinking and floating, didn&#39;t really notice much of anything else. I felt relaxed, and I&#39;d say, &quot;content&quot; which is a word a rarely use, and seems to be a good fit for the feeling I had. I stayed in there twenty minutes at the most. I decided to get out and ..... I couldn&#39;t! I did not have enough strength to stand up or pull myself up, once the water&#39;s assistance was removed. That was the effect I had not been noticing! It took me a while to get out, and into bed, which was where I knew I needed to get. I had to be careful. I felt uncoordinated and extremely heavy. It really was a struggle to walk. I have no idea if the whole effect would have been this pronounced had I not been sitting in the hot tub the first time I smoked something that I knew was likely to do this. If this happens next time, I&#39;ll be amazed - and quite happy! I did get to bed. I lay down and drifted off to sleep easily and happily, I slept for about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, and woke up with no heavy head, no blurry vision, no heavy-body residue that requires me to take a shower to shake it off and wake up properly. I do not like that. This did not cause that hangover effect. I feel alert, awake, rested and ready to go and do something. This is really wonderful. I will use it infrequently but now I know how this helps me (and it something I had almost given up finding) I will make sure I buy a good bit and keep some on hand. This is &quot;one of those&quot;, for me. When you need it, you need it. It&#39;s worth keeping a little bit back for those days or nights.\u000a\u000aHope this helped someone.

VThis hashy sweat taffy/coffee tasting herb, is defiantly a later on in the day smoke, best for after work or just before popping off to bed. For sure has that old school hashish smell to it, that is a good indicate of its Hindu Afghani heritage. So in conclusion this defiantly worth a try but not for beginners, do to the lung expiation that it tend to give.

VIt has very powerful sleeping affects I feel very relaxed and I also feel stress-free and very very sleepy.  If you&#39;re looking for something to hit you hard and make you feel very soothed then I would say try some of this doesn&#39;t have paranoia like the Bubba Kush has a pre-98 Bubba Kush is better for it&#39;s relaxing affects.  Helps out with hunger a great deal you&#39;ll eat three times the normal sizes you would eat.  Can be manipulated in a vaporizer at 186 to be sleepy and that centigrade or 190 and above to be more energetic it depends on temperature is a great deal depending on which cannabinoids are released.  These extremely small bug smell of spinach bike fresh canned spinach or some on the field of a farm   Overall grade affects it tastes a little bit of earth wood and classic herbal spicy ness.  If you want something to just chill out this is perfect without giving you any extremely heavy effects that kind of linger after you&#39;ve been medicated.\u000a I use Bubba Kush for all sorts of ailments ranging from anorexia cat had Sia ADHD depression mood disorders arthritis and pain.  Even if I&#39;m not feeling in the best of mode I know it&#39;s usually because of my ANTS  hey paranoia sort of check that always puts us down no matter what it&#39;s a mental mode psychological disorder.  Pre-98 Bubba Kush allows me to function correctly without all the negative bad stuff it&#39;s really a blessing  in disguise.

Wasn&#39;t in LA or anything, but was still smoking shit from shwag to Chocolate Thai around here. This is like my favorite high with its mellow woody taste not too stanky (kinda how a lot of weed was &#39;round here back in the day) and crispy rich in trichomes. Mmm. If I knew then what I know now. Makes you feel no pain, no insomnia. Testing Tuesday I picked up a little, smoked a bowl in the late afternoon by evening I was ready for a nap. &#128175;\u000a

I&#39;ve never made such smooth actions with my hand this makes everything friendly rather than sporadically everywhere. I would love this for a night knock out fer sure, but its great to deny sleep and turn it into focus its a nice creative fuel if you need a mini vacation before facing hell all over again. It leaves me refreshed and ready to face my fears and go for the gold.

VI typically avoided weed until now due to the paranoia I would feel and other negative effects.  I was given a vapo pen with P98 in it and I think I finally found a strain that I enjoy!  I didn&#39;t feel any paranoia at all, I felt happy and calm and found myself giggling.  At one point I was having a stomach ache and felt better after smoking this.  If there was one negative I guess that it would be the ravenous munchies.   MMmmmmMMMM  HAA!

This is like my favorite high with its mellow woody taste not too stanky (kinda how a lot of weed was &#39;round here back in the day) and crispy rich in trichomes. Mmm. If I knew then what I know now. Makes you feel no pain, no insomnia. Testing Tuesday I picked up a little, smoked a bowl in the late afternoon by evening I was ready for a nap. &#128175;\u000a

VFirst time trying this strain, I had avoided it for a long time. I tend to be such a lightweight with indicas. I can&#39;t function at all when using them. But. as with most things, there&#39;s a time and a place. My more common goal is to find a strain that can help me function, feeling physically energetic (though not necessarily active) as well as mentally, stay focused and work consistently. I don&#39;t need to do a lot of physical work, but the usual chores and so on have to be done. For these goals I know more or less what works.\u000a\u000aOn days that I might be in severe pain, or if you sometimes wonder whether you&#39;ll ever sleep again due to the &quot;M&quot; word (or the peri &quot;M: word), this did it for me! I read a lot of reviews: I know my own lightweightness with anything indica. I was prepared for the &quot;heaviness&quot; that accompanies it, and which I usually don&#39;t like because it just stops me in my tracks, and that&#39;s the end of the day, no matter what time the clock thinks it is. Knowing this, and being quite conservative because of it, I smoked some sticky green bud in a bong, my usual method nowadays.\u000a\u000aI took just one rip from my bong, about eight seconds. I went outside and sat in the hot tub. I enjoyed floating and the warmth of the water, as I always do, but nothing else seemed to be happening. I stayed in there just thinking and floating, didn&#39;t really notice much of anything else. I felt relaxed, and I&#39;d say, &quot;content&quot; which is a word a rarely use, and seems to be a good fit for the feeling I had. I stayed in there twenty minutes at the most. I decided to get out and ..... I couldn&#39;t! I did not have enough strength to stand up or pull myself up, once the water&#39;s assistance was removed. That was the effect I had not been noticing! It took me a while to get out, and into bed, which was where I knew I needed to get. I had to be careful. I felt uncoordinated and extremely heavy. It really was a struggle to walk. I have no idea if the whole effect would have been this pronounced had I not been sitting in the hot tub the first time I smoked something that I knew was likely to do this. If this happens next time, I&#39;ll be amazed - and quite happy! I did get to bed. I lay down and drifted off to sleep easily and happily, I slept for about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, and woke up with no heavy head, no blurry vision, no heavy-body residue that requires me to take a shower to shake it off and wake up properly. I do not like that. This did not cause that hangover effect. I feel alert, awake, rested and ready to go and do something. This is really wonderful. I will use it infrequently but now I know how this helps me (and it something I had almost given up finding) I will make sure I buy a good bit and keep some on hand. This is &quot;one of those&quot;, for me. When you need it, you need it. It&#39;s worth keeping a little bit back for those days or nights.\u000a\u000aHope this helped someone.

VTried this strain last night after a 750 mile drive and I\u2019ve never had a better night of sleep. While the flavor left me wanting something tangible to hold on to, the effects were wonderfully similar to Xanax leaving me relaxed with a mild sedation and relaxing as if I just had a massage. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t get a coffee taste in my buds but it was definitely earthy. It\u2019s definitely worth a try and I\u2019ll be looking for it again.

Vhave yet to find a bad Bubba strain,  amazing for stress,  pain,  or a need to relax,  still able to think clearly but without any bad thoughts of that makes sense,  much more peaceful then any herbal tea,  by far,  any Bubba strain will leave you in a better mood!  much better med than pretty much any cbd related strains I&#39;ve tried such as Charlotte&#39;s web which has literally no effects other than inhale and exhale, similar effects of a cigarette or the vaping that some people do.

VIt has very powerful sleeping affects I feel very relaxed and I also feel stress-free and very very sleepy.  If you&#39;re looking for something to hit you hard and make you feel very soothed then I would say try some of this doesn&#39;t have paranoia like the Bubba Kush has a pre-98 Bubba Kush is better for it&#39;s relaxing affects.  Helps out with hunger a great deal you&#39;ll eat three times the normal sizes you would eat.  Can be manipulated in a vaporizer at 186 to be sleepy and that centigrade or 190 and above to be more energetic it depends on temperature is a great deal depending on which cannabinoids are released.  These extremely small bug smell of spinach bike fresh canned spinach or some on the field of a farm   Overall grade affects it tastes a little bit of earth wood and classic herbal spicy ness.  If you want something to just chill out this is perfect without giving you any extremely heavy effects that kind of linger after you&#39;ve been medicated.\u000a I use Bubba Kush for all sorts of ailments ranging from anorexia cat had Sia ADHD depression mood disorders arthritis and pain.  Even if I&#39;m not feeling in the best of mode I know it&#39;s usually because of my ANTS  hey paranoia sort of check that always puts us down no matter what it&#39;s a mental mode psychological disorder.  Pre-98 Bubba Kush allows me to function correctly without all the negative bad stuff it&#39;s really a blessing  in disguise.

VThis hashy sweat taffy/coffee tasting herb, is defiantly a later on in the day smoke, best for after work or just before popping off to bed. For sure has that old school hashish smell to it, that is a good indicate of its Hindu Afghani heritage. So in conclusion this defiantly worth a try but not for beginners, do to the lung expiation that it tend to give.

VI&#39;ve never been a big fan of &quot;bubbas&quot;. I&#39;ve gotten the top-shelf from several disp. from CA and it&#39;s always been headache weed. But 98 not too bad for an indica considering it&#39;s a little more cerebral than the normal bubba. 3/5 if grown/cured,etc.  correctly.

VThis was my favorite high CBD strain for a while, but I built up a tolerance fast as it has more CBD than THC and takes more leaf/concentrate (I used The Lab Live Resin) to get nice. When it worked it was super relaxing and super smooth. Great for inflammation, pain, and stress. It doesn&#39;t make you sleep but the relaxing effects can aid getting to sleep. My friend really liked it too, he was like &quot;dude this is sooooo relaxing.&quot; Body loves it. It had a little bit of a creeper effect mentally and a little bit of anxiety at first that wears off as soon as the creeping stops. Really helped with my leg pain.  The taste is delicious, if the concentrate bottle didn&#39;t say not to eat it because of the butane residue I&#39;d be tempted to eat it plane. That&#39;s how delicious the taste/smell are. My only qualm is I wish it had a little more THC.

VThis strain really helped me relax. Originally picked it up to help me sleep but the high was to much to just lay down after a bowl. Instead it helped me settle down and watch a movie or listen to music. The relaxation did settle my muscles as well and once I fell asleep I was able to stay asleep for a solid 6 hours. The smoke was clean and not to harsh with a weak earthy flavor. The buds broke up easily and burned just as easy. Not too bad if you looking for a less intense indica high.

Nice body high couch lock feeling but it makes you happy and really enjoying  just kicking back with friends.\u000aThe taste is amazing and earthy kinda like fresh soil. The high didnt last to long but was really nice while it lasted then it just made food taste great and yr bed sound real nice. \u000aAs far as medicine i recommend it for general aches and pains as well as depression.

VI had never heard of this strain before until I just recently tried it. This indica strain is good for relaxing and stress relief. The high itself is not super memorable, but still an enjoyable smoke, however. My favorite characteristic of this flower is the taste. Lovely earthy taste with subtle hints of coffee and pine. The potency was somewhat lacking, and that is probably my biggest issue with this strain. It&#39;s good for those who don&#39;t want to be overwhelmed, but still want the indica relief, but those who need a little more kick, I&#39;d suggest something more like Master Kush, or, the classic, OG Kush. \u000a\u000aOverall, I would recommend this strain, but to those who have a low to moderate tolerance. At a high tolerance, this flower has trouble getting the job done, But the taste is definitely a consolation as it is fabulous.

VI am very glad I got the opportunity to try this bud! I&#39;ve been waiting for a while for this to show up and it finally did! The taste is very dark. Almost like a soil or a rich coffee bean. Definitely Indica dominant. I have been using it for the last couple nights as I unwind and play some GTA 5 after work. After a couple bowls i&#39;m ready to relax and just zone out or get lost in a movie or game. I would say medicinally it would be good for Stress, Pain Relief, and Insomnia. I would give P98 Bubba a 9.2/10 overall. Very unique.

Earthy, woody and a strong taste of dark, black coffee on the exhale.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve smoked a couple of joints so far, and the effects come on quickly: an uplifting rush followed by a strong body stone.

Most every strain has SOME degree of mental alteration, this just feels like a strong cup of herbal tea to me. Not recommended for stress or other mental/cerebral needs. There&#39;s better strains out there that blast pain -and- bring your mind where it needs to be. Save this one for your kids if there&#39;s no Charolette&#39;s Web on hand.

VI am a sucker for any Pre 98 strain. Some of my favorite long time stuff. I can say they always pack a punch without fail. This Purple 98 is good for me in the morning for stimulation of appetite and pain management. When I dumped the bottom of my jar out there was a pile of trichomes on my hand :)

VTook a surprisingly long time to kick in, maybe 20 min?  Good pain relief, deep relaxation, super couch-locked, but raised pulse a lot. A bit sedative.  Also lasted a good while, almost 3 hours.  Just a good quintessential indica/nighttime strain with a mild but funky flavor.

VNot bad, but I think the batch was &quot;mislabeled&quot; or just not cured right or something. It didn&#39;t have the prominent coffee smell that everyone keeps raving about. It had a very slight coffee aftertaste, but it was hardly noticeable. We got a two gram bag labeled Pre 98 Purple Kush when asked for the Pre 98 Bubba. Apparently there are a few cuts floating around, and purple is one of them. \u000a\u000aThe bag also had a note on the back that said, &quot;The use of Azamax and Dyna Neem Oil were used on this product during the growing season.&quot;\u000a\u000aSo I&#39;m not sure if it was for prevention or if they had a bug outbreak. Might have something to do with the off taste. Other than that, a really beautiful looking, frosty covered bud. I would like to perhaps find it from another farm to compare.

VThis multiple Cannabis Cup winning Indica by Graham&#39;s Brand is a clone only phenotype of OG Kush named after the area in which it was developed. With heavy sweet, earthy and pine accents, your pain and stresses will lift away. Alum Rock OG  has a flavorful and smooth hitting smoke and cooling body high. The effects of this strain are immediately euphoric and the flavor of the smoke upon exhale carries aftertones of cookie dough or vanilla ice cream. If you like Kush, you will definitely want to experience Graham&#39;s Brand Alum Rock OG.

VOne of my all time faves for flavor and effect.  I love the coffee/mocha/hashy flavor of the smoke and how relaxed it makes me.  I believe it does carry some cbd content as well.  Buds are always very dense and frosty with insane smell.
