VYou ever see that scene from the movie \u201cFriday\u201d where Smokey (Chris Tucker) gives Craig (Ice Cube) his first hit of chronic?? Yeah, white 99 is like that. \u201cMy heart\u2019s beatin\u2019 too fast\u201d Very motivating strain for first hour or so then nice and warm transfer to the lower extremities. As stayed by some other users, this strain can tend to exacerbate anxiety, for me at least.

VI enjoy the overall high of White 99, especially its ability to deliver some serious relaxation, but this strain will shlump you if you aren&#39;t careful. Very thin line between functional and zoot city.\u000a\u000aMy least favorite things about this strain are its tendency to make for a harsh and, in my opinion, poorly flavored smoking experience. This is possibly my least favorite strain in that regard, but I can&#39;t deny the results. Potent, just not something I&#39;ll buy again.

V4.8 baby! It doesn&#39;t get much better.  And earthy zesty smell and a slightly similar taste. Very quick buzz onset in the dome, and kinda nice chill body high.   Much more potent than I expected and the heady high makes me uplifted/happy and focused.  It depends on your mood before you smoke that is lethargic or energetic, in small doses it will match your mood very pleasantly.

V39.9% medical grade oil. A gift from a dear friend. After 3 hits I feel light. Care-free. Oh man, my whole body is tingly. It pairs well with the empty, quiet house. Shhhh, don\u2019t talk. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. I sit close me eyes and revel in the rare silence. I could sit here all day. J/k I have chores to do. That\u2019s ok. I still feel good. After an hour I\u2019m still feeling breezy. I take another hit and that\u2019s all it takes to return me to tilt. The house is still quiet except for the hum of the appliances.

I&#39;m severely bipolar and white 99 is a strain I know I can count on to lift me out of a rut if I feel low. it&#39;s a very euphoric strain. it usually tastes fruity with some musty, earthy taste to it
