Vi got a half zip of this from my boy. who ever grew it didnt trim any of the littlenleaves on the bud, making it look kinda trashy at 1st. but the smell is outrageous. super pungent citrusy sweet smell and the flavor was the same but slightly mosre harsh, most like from all the little leaves i diddnt feel like picking off. the high is very nice, definetly a solid mid day strain. PS trim your freakin bud you bums.

VThis is a really excellent hybrid. I enjoy sativas for when I need to be productive but I often get anxious or fidgety from them. Supernova gave me a nice calm, indica influence that didn&#39;t inhibit my ability to hold a conversation. ;) I felt mellow and relaxed, almost too relaxed but I easily perked up and could focus when I needed to. This is a great strain if your feeling a little anxious but you&#39;ve still got to get stuff done.

VA great strain, Super Nova takes you to a place of bliss. you will start out with a head high with this since of Euphoria that seeps diwn to your body at the end giving you a relaxed feeling. If you smoke at night itd be a great way to end the day. However if you smoke mid day itd work for that as well if you&#39;d wanna smoke mid day.

VHave you ever bought some nugs so frosty that they just kief up your grinder? That&#39;s what this strain is all about, but...the kick was nowhere near what I thought it would be. It was nice, but I thought I&#39;d get a little more out of it, especially for being 29% THC! Looks like numbers aren&#39;t everything! Then again, maybe I expected too much. The batch I had mostly consisted of popcorn nugs that looked absolutely beautiful. No stem. Extremely smooth smoke. The only drawbacks were the taste and effects. I&#39;d suggest you to try it and see for yourself. You may have a different experience. Cheers!
