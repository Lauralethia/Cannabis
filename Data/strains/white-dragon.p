VThe smell is out of this world. The taste is right on it&#39;s heals. A fire strain that takes away the pain. It even helps me rhyme

VAmazing night time strain. Pain leaves your body and a nice tingle in the areas that usually cause pain. Hard to stay focused on the movie I&#39;m watching but when I do I get a sudden rush of more high. Then my eyes focus back. Definitely not an optimal daytime strain as I had to fight the high to stay awake.

VHow\u2019s this for a brand new strain?  With parentage like White Widow x Afghani this is truly a fabulous Indica dominate strain that has now just appeared here in Quebec  !\u000a\u000aWhile the couch lock is not perhaps everyone\u2019s favourite cup of mud this strain has surprised an often jaded cannabis market within the Province I do truly feel that this strain should have a home in everyone\u2019s alternative pharmacy cabinet along with great wards Cannabis Glycerin Tinctures and Cannabis CBD throat sprays and distilled Cannabis eye drops. \u000a\u000aThis wonderful strain has full mouth watering turpenes and seductive flavours of leather pine tobacco wet loam cedar forests rain smells that take me back to a life I don\u2019t visit often.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m a chronic pain patient in a wheelchair and this strain is an absolutely wonderful pain reducer that generally only happens with pure strains like Afghani or Hindu Kush.  \u000a\u000a\u000a
