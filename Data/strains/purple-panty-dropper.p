VWell I picked this sexy strain up looking for something for my pain. My usual dispensary had this earthy beauty on the shelf and I couldn&#39;t resist. A very dark bud, not too tight, very &#39;light&#39; fruity smell and it weighed up very nice. Honestly was chasing the Indica effects for pain but it&#39;s no lie, this one spiced up my entire evening ;) Very interesting taste and almost numbed the end of my tongue and lips a little bit. Could be the grow but it was not &#39;chemically&#39; so to speak. Dries out my eyeballs but a very nice tension reliever and a definate go to for massage or other manipulative therapy appointments. I&#39;m tempted to stock up for my knee replacement in the New Year because it does the job with a nice easy heavy, not a burn out or crash, good one for easing into a nap I bet. Very relaxing and warming, a bit of a darker tasting smoke than the fruity scent leads you to think it will be and although it smoked pretty easy I was a tad wheesy after.  Interesting strain and one I will grab again when I see it on the shelf, good medicine.

VThe buzz on this one is pretty good. A lot stronger than most of the cannabis I have tried. It helps with my pain for sure. It did not, however, taste that sweet, like I thought it would. It actually didn&#39;t really have a flavor at all. But it does creep up on you, and one bowl will do the trick for a really good long lasting high. Give it about 30-45 mins to feel the total effects of it, which means don&#39;t smoke too much if you have to go anywhere where you would not want to look high. Oh yeah, one last thing-it&#39;s really fun and really trippy, my kitchen looked like it was moving last night!

VI grew out two phenotypes of the PPD. One was like PEZ candy... super frosty large flowers but with only light purpling. My other phenotype was heavy on the purple but lighter on the resin production and terpene depth. Will purchase again and hunt for the fat PEZ flavored phenotype. Terps trump color all day long.

VEh. Not that great. The buds look okay, but have an earthy, almost tea-like scent and taste. It takes some getting used to, and the potency is merely average. Furthermore, it wasn&#39;t an aphrodisiac for me.

VAmazing!!!! Such a heavy hitter one of my new favorite strains out there. Bud stucture is super dense and very beautiful to look at. From the first toke it hits you right in the head then quickly develops into a nice body buzz. Such a nice strain, would definitely purchase this one again and again. But the have a lot to choose from if this one is not for you.
