VGreat strain!!!! ordered some of this strain of my M.O.M site and I was pleasantly surprised for the 25 dollars for an 1/8th. I would say proceed with caution as this strain is a very heavy hitter and will set you back! at first I found the high to be heady like you have been hit in the face by a Mack truck then moved towards a very sedating couch lock type high. very nice dense buds that bust up nice in the grinder, with the usual OG type taste with a little but of funk from its parent strain King louis 13th

VTotally Awsome. I love all the OG&#39;s, of which there are many. But this one comes with a almost super natural terpene profile. One could be forgiven when tasting it for the first time and almost being skeptical of how tasty it is. But it&#39;s a natural taste totally unique amongst connasuer hybrids. Also powerful. Like all OG should be.

VWow, Gandalf will fuck you up. Felt so relaxed and ready to sleep for like 2 years. Fell asleep in an armchair and still woke up feeling rested. Had this in a shatter and when it heated up it smelled like dandelions.

VGandalf is a sneaky indica. Three songs into an outdoor concert it was time to get baked so I power up my vape. My excitement builds as the well packed oven heats up and produces scents reminiscent of walking into a dispensary stocked with top shelf ganja. I take 3 rips and exhale clouds of vapor the size of an Oklahoma twister into the air overhead. The smell was strong because I immediately got several head turns from my fellow concert goers as if to say &quot;damn that shit must be good!&quot;. The taste was really sweet with a hint of grape, awesome. The high was creeper for sure. It took about 15 minutes to kick in. But it did with a bit of muscle relaxation and a ton of mood elevation. The high was still going strong two hours later. Got lost walking the city streets on my way back to my hotel.
