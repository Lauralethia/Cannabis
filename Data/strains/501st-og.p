VI have MS and this strain was suggested for me to help with muscle spasms that can occur while I&#39;m sleeping.\u000aThe first and second times I smoked it before bed and all went well. Nice, sedative high...easily fell asleep. Last night I had to smoke a hella lot (for me, I&#39;m a lightweight) and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep to save my life. \u000aOdd.\u000a

But there&#39;s no such thing as too much when it comes to terpene goodness, right? The high is powerful, but even. Great buzz from three hits out of a side car. I know a lot find this one a favorite for insomnia, however I don&#39;t feel especially drowsy. Just relaxed and in a pleasant mood. Hot days put me on edge, if you&#39;re similarly attuned, I highly recommend this one for a perfect after dinner wind down.

VI love this strain!! It tastes great and has a very great soaring high. Puts a smile on my face. The buds are beautiful with every color and are very sticky. Similar to star killer except using the Sativa Leaning Phenotype that leans toward Triangle Kush as opposed to the Indica Pheno RD2 that leans more towards the Ghost cut. Great for pain and nausea and depression!

Vthis strain is a great anxiety shredder. mostly a body high, with some good head euphoria, but definitely indica effects throughout. not the best for being creative or thinking, it kinda numbs your mind a bit, but otherwise just very calming and relaxing. its the classic stoney kind of indica high where you can zone out staring at something in total bliss. downside is that your body adjusts to it quickly and it gets boring/dull, hence why I&#39;m not giving it 5 stars.

I smoke a lot due to permanent nerve damage and I&#39;ve become immune to THC but with just a few hits of this it&#39;s like my tolerance went to -1000% haha definitely recommend this strain for folks with pain, stress and overall short fused kind of people.

VThis was bought right around the time I picked up Ewok. Guess I was on a Star Wars themed shopping spree. The smell was earthy and not too pungent during the grind. The inhale was a little harsh at first but mellowed out the further I got into my stash.\u000a\u000aThe high hit fairly quickly and was strong I tend to hit my vape 6-8 times before it burns out and didn&#39;t need to hit it again before the end of the night. It is a high that requires you to concentrate and I wouldn&#39;t take it if I were going out to party as you will zone out and find starting at walls entertaining. When you do pass out at the end of the day the 501st knocks you out until the alarm goes off. \u000a\u000aWouldn&#39;t smoke it if you only had a few hours to sleep, as it will leave you a little drowsy a while when you first wake up. If you take it with a few hours to enjoy its affects and then get 6-8 hours of sleep you should be find but short naps will find you zoned out for some time.

VI first need to say that I don&#39;t do MMJ for the flavor, and the only reason this missed a star for me is the flavor. I&#39;m not big on diesel and this seems particularly pungent for that. \u000aThat being said, it is a quality medical strain. Its indica properties cause this strain to feel more sedating than your ordinary hybrid. MJ strains hit everyone differently, but this is an okay night strain for me. I medicate for Crohns and pelvic pain, but I also have anxiety and this doesn&#39;t make that worse. \u000aWhat I do like is that this strain allows you to medicate without losing your mental faculties. The feeling is somewhat sleepy and does provide peace and muscle relaxation. I tend to mix this with CBD oil given that it isn&#39;t a high CBD strain. This is effective for me, and luckily not too heavy. In all, I&#39;m fond of this one and find it pretty helpful for mild to moderate pain, but I pull out my stronger indicas for my worst pain.

VAlong with a relaxing body wave, I found myself &quot;honestly introspective&quot; after a few dabs of 501.\u000aVery calming effects with a hint of (what tasted to me like) toffee.\u000aI will look for this again when I&#39;m in Glendale.

VAn indica hybrid that smokes like a indica. Strong earthy scent. For me the smoke was a bit harsh with instant dry mouth/throat, but it has a tasty earthy pine flavor. Strong heavy potent lasting body high with a spacey or loopy head high. Great pain relief! Great for getting a sound sleep.
