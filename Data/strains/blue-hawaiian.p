VBeen usining mmj for 6 months and vaping Blue Hawaiian for the last few weeks. The first mj I&#39;ve used that possessed a name. \u000a\u000aVolcano heat setting needed to be a little higher (6.25) for Blue Hawaiian compared to previous no-name mj. Usually vape 0.3g 1-2 times per day. Result was a Smooth vape with balanced head and body effect. Pine flavor. Smooth increase over 10 minutes to maximum high.

VGrown greenhouse, crossed with northern lights to make the rendition I picked up Hawaiian Lights. Pretentious folks would call this regs, but this the best regs I have had. The outdoor and earth grown is very distinguishable in that the bud structure is strong more fiberous than hydro. The high is mellow too with which I believe to be a balanced THC:CBD ratio. \u000a\u000a

VThe strain I had from Nectar was 25.3%thca.  Needless to say this is a strong hybrid.  \u000a\u000aThe nugs are a sight to see.  Blue Hawaiian is one fine mamma jamma. Red orange hairy crystal smothered buds. \u000a\u000aThe smell was underwhelming until a nug was broke open. Sweet, subtle whifs of lemon and pineapple arouse. Tastes pineapple-ish, it doesn&#39;t scream &quot;blue pineapple&quot;, but I can see how why they named it as such.\u000a\u000aPowerful even keeled high that doesn&#39;t leave you passed out on the floor...er...whoops I mean couch....with your hand in a box of cheez-itz.\u000a#BLAZETHENUGS

VPicked up some Blue Hawaiian live resin that tasted absolutely amazing kinda pineapple, lemon, citrus also very sweet I was dabbing off a Quartz Castle going low temp the flavor was almost overwhelming. There was a instant pleasant pressure behind the eyes and in the temples. I&#39;ve only smoked this in the evening but it seems to lend itself to that time of day being highly euphoric but without any real problem staying off the couch. Anyway so this strain tastes awesome has a nice mellow euphoric high that definitely feels more traditionally Indica if you like Maui Waui this is like that only Indica heavy.

VAwesome strain, very clear head high which is accompanied later on with a decent couch lock. Muscles and body become very relaxed, without feeling overly sleepy. When it is time to knock out, you will have absolutely no trouble. Smell is tropical, yet smells like blueberry. Name is representative of what it smells like. Would recommend!

VOne of my new favorite Hybrids. I thought it would of been a heavy Indica effect but I was wrong. For me, the heady sativa effect hit me first and followed with a nice and easy relaxing Indica effect and wasn&#39;t intense. Very enjoyable.

(i tried &#39;agent orange&#39; as well, and i was just as hungry...took me awhile to figure out that BOTH strains are known for increasing your appetite. oops! if you&#39;re an active person, this side effect shouldn&#39;t be a problem. i still use this strain as a staple because i like how chill it makes me without feeling lazy or dumbed down.

Gives me a clean, happy uplifting buzz that really creeps stronger with time, no mental fog or lethargy while still being relaxing/pain relieving. Rare type of strain I&#39;d recommend to both people who don&#39;t smoke often and to those who smoke all the time. 4.5/5.

VI\u2019m strictly a sativa smoker during the day, but really enjoy indicas when I\u2019m ready for bed. Unfortunately the dispensary I got my blue hawaiian from had it\u2019s ratio listed incorrectly: 70% sativa &amp; 30% indica. That is definitely not the case! Another reviewer described this strain as 45%sativa &amp; 55% indica; this is far more accurate in terms of BH\u2019s effects. I had a brief upswing of happy energy &amp; then crashed hard. The indica swooped in after about a half hour &amp; put me straight to sleep - at 3pm!! I enjoyed the aroma, flavour &amp; effects of BH, but if you are a sativa smoker be cautious! This will lift you up for a short time &amp; then pull you down into your body. Nice hybrid, definitely indica dominant.

VThis was easy to smoke, but honestly too easy. I smoked way too much and ended up being a paranoid mess. I think if I would have stuck to 1-2 hits I would have been fine but I went from smoking Purple Trainwreck to Blue Hawaiian and it was just way too much for me. I may try it again in the future because I was very giggly and euphoric at first and loved that part.

VThis strain&#39;s definitely a sleeper! Migraine pain 6; nausea 7 (ate too much earlier same day) when I medicated round 2230 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start kickin in. Body high dang near perfect; pain/nausea gone. Head buzz very strong without any anxiety/paranoia. Tastes like blueberry/pineapple heaven! Fyi, you are going to sleep; must be an indica dominant! :-) Highly recommend for medical/nighttime use.

Vhad some friends/family come in from CO to CA and gave them some blue Hawaiian. They were quite impressed. I think since it&#39;s rec legal in CO first they think they have better weed, but I showed them otherwise.

VMild, balanced high.  Floral Aroma. Good If you are into subtle, turned-down High, that gives a mellow appreciation of environment.  Sorta the wine cooler(chick) version of a mixed drink.

Vthis was one of the first strains i ever tried &amp; it was a great way to get introduced to marijuana. smooth, calming, took me to a very focused &amp; peaceful place. however....it made me so hungry! so cliche, i know, but i wanted to eat all the time.  (i tried &#39;agent orange&#39; as well, and i was just as hungry...took me awhile to figure out that BOTH strains are known for increasing your appetite. oops! if you&#39;re an active person, this side effect shouldn&#39;t be a problem. i still use this strain as a staple because i like how chill it makes me without feeling lazy or dumbed down.

VA very nice classic bud.  Flavor and scent to match.  The lower THC  takes nothing away from the full effect.  This was the first flower to experience after a long hiatus.  When it&#39;s available, you will want to try some Blue Hawaiian.
