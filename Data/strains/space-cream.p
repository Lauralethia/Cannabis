VGreat strain overall. You can definitely taste a cream-like aftertaste on this one. Really an outstanding euphoric high especially at higher doses. A heavily packed 1 or 2 bowls normally gets me pretty high. I\u2019ll normally smoke 3-4 bowls to fall asleep. Only thing I don\u2019t like is how the high doesn\u2019t last as long as I prefer, but still an awesome strain. I wouldn\u2019t say you get couch-locked with this one, unless your smoking heavily. The buds are not super dense, but easy enough to crush with my fingers if I wanna smoke a quick bowl in a hurry. All in all, I would definitely recommend this strain.

VI love this strain. Tastes good, kinda tangy- takes away pain, stress, and depression. Really really makes me want to get up and move (I have a joint disorder that causes pain and moving is often difficult). Quite possibly my favorite strain thus far.

VToday I was drained and exhausted, from lack of sleep, but when I came home and smoked a bowl of Space Cream everything faded away. I was able to relax and feel good. Definitely one of my favorites! I think &quot;hops&quot; is a good description of the flavor.

VHands Down the strongest Indica I have tried.  Great physical high, perfect for night use or before stressful situations.  clear headed yet very heavy feeling.
