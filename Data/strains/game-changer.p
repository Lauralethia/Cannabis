Vthis is a game changer lol I have bad anxiety and pain from fibromylagia and lot of strains are hard for me because they lift my anxiety to new levels and makes it worse for me but at the same time I need somethingn for my chronic pain that I have every day and this is why I love game changer it puts me in the best mood it helps take all my pain away and makes me want to get out and about in the world and feel like my normal self it has super fruity notes with hints of spice and sweet was one of the best strains I have ever had to be honest and there are some great ones out there I highly recommend for any one with high anxiety or stress

VNice-sized kolas give Game Changer a bag appeal to go along with its smoke appeal.... Fruity and floral aroma on breaking up for the bong.  Flavor profile is complex, yet subtler to the palate than the nose. I find this to be a very manageable stone - a couple hits is nicely euphoric, a few more hits and you start to feel a bit spacey (this is from the perspective of a very experienced smoker mind you). Still manageable though. So does it live up to its name? Well, I didn&#39;t begin the session in a bad mood, so I can&#39;t definitively state that it changed my game in that sense. However, that&#39;s a minor technicality - I can definitely recommend this as an excellent all around strain from flavor to high.

VThis was definitely more on the indica side. Made me feel warm and fuzzy all over, felt buttery. Less of a head high but it was there. Good for talking and hanging out in small groups. If you just want to chill out without being too tired, you won&#39;t be disappointed. I did get super dead 2 hours after a blunt but it&#39;s sort of hit or miss with the fatigue, at least with my experience. Taste pretty sweet and a bit of grape flower.

VMy problem with buying a specific strain is that these days beginning growers or growers looking for more money will just use a popular name. Unless you obtain some legitimate seeds or know a trusted grower. What I do personally here in Washington, is find a good company/farm.  I bought some game changer from commencement bay cannabis grown by hemp kings, and I just did a little research and found that the information provided by leafly was contradicting. I say this because it taste a lot like sour diesel, and that strain is not present in game changer thus backing up my initial point.   Dank bud though

VReal! Game Changer is potent and very direct. Its effect gives you a energetic punch that&#39;s bound to put someone to bed after a smooth conversation and just pure enjoyment of the effective properties that game changer possess.

VIt&#39;s really great and i made brownies with some of it and its a really great high with stages. I do not recommend if you have anxiety for this strain does cause paranoia.

VIt definitely lives up to its name. Good earthy aroma (could just be me but almost a pine or fruity smell) very relaxing and overall sense of calmness.  Stress seemed to just float away within a few minutes.  Only downside for me would be the mild constant dizziness, otherwise definitely a strain I look forward to trying again!

VA decent hybrid, but it sure seemed heavy on the Indica. Not the greatest for pain, either. Good smooth flavor. Long lasting head high with not much dry mouth. Good for PTSD, Depression, etc.

VThis was definitely more on the indica side. Made me feel warm and fuzzy all over, felt buttery. Less of a head high but it was there. Good for talking and hanging out in small groups. If you just want to chill out without being too tired, you won&#39;t be disappointed. I did get super dead 2 hours after a blunt but it&#39;s sort of hit or miss with the fatigue, at least with my experience. Taste pretty sweet and a bit of grape flower.

VMy problem with buying a specific strain is that these days beginning growers or growers looking for more money will just use a popular name. Unless you obtain some legitimate seeds or know a trusted grower. What I do personally here in Washington, is find a good company/farm.  I bought some game changer from commencement bay cannabis grown by hemp kings, and I just did a little research and found that the information provided by leafly was contradicting. I say this because it taste a lot like sour diesel, and that strain is not present in game changer thus backing up my initial point.   Dank bud though

VThis is a great strain for anyone who likes a 50/50 or indica Dominant hybrid. I would say it&#39;s on par with Snoop&#39;s Dream as far as effect. Definitely changes your mood and alleviates pain (or makes you forget about it) However, the only thing about this strain is that the relaxing body high lasts a long time after the fact. Other than that, awesome strain, will definitely buy again!
