VFelt some of the effects immediately, but was surprised by the sudden peak of the high because it took 30 minutes to fully take effect. I love the deep reddish/purple color of the nugs (it&#39;s so much prettier busted up). Very euphoric and relaxing high. I got munchies and cotton mouth pretty horrendously.

VThe Predator is a nice relaxing stone and provides me with a little bit of pain relief although not as much as I expected provides its lineage. Not too bad to smoke, made me cough a bit but did not set off a full on asthma attack or anything. A mellow feeling with a bit of dry mouth at first but holy did I ever get the munchies! Not good for me but if you need help with nausea or appetite increase then def give this one a try! I give it a 3 because it&#39;s not one of my favs but each user is unique so give it try if your looking for a cool high.

VGot my hands on some today. Tastes like that old school fruit stripe gum(with the zebra) but with a slightly spicy finish. Very heady with a decent body buzz too.

VDefinitely a top shelf stain, has a very sweet tropical smell that makes you want to come back. The high starts fast but takes it&#39;s time to reach the peak. Once it does though you&#39;ll be lazy and calm for hours. So put on a long chill playlist, lay back and enjoy! I wouldn&#39;t recommend consuming before work or any important event otherwise enjoy this strain to keep you calm at anytime.

VMellow feeling. Happy and talkative but not speedy. Similar to GSC but with less Euphoria. Has a candy taste to it. Has a slow onset. I thought it was weak so I signed up for leafly specifically so I could comment that it was weak but after I got signed up my opinion changed lol. It took about 45 min before i felt it. It&#39;s a slow creeper

VGot a Curaleaf cart from this strain. It&#39;s definitely a favorite of mine now. I can definitely feel the indica part of it. It doesn&#39;t hit you right away, but the euphoric effects creep up. Feel very relaxed but not completely couch locked.

VThis is a great afternoon stain for most. Enjoy in the morning to help with spasticity.  A little goes a long way. This is good medicine to help focus in the correct dose for you. Before bed, go heavy for muscle relief and deep sleep. Enjoy responsibly.
