VIt is a hybrid of Blueberry and Blue Dream and this Dream Lotus holds up to the reputation of smoothness.  I could take the most massive hits I have ever taken with this strain.  If dried properly the smell will bloom into the fresh-like smell that stimulate the nostrils.

VSolid 4 for this one. Nice strain for the afternoon, but it doesn&#39;t get you a soaring high nor does it get you a nice body buzz--more often it&#39;s just a nice little high, pleasant but not overwhelming. If you&#39;re looking for something functional, this is a good choice. Otherwise, you might be better off with a more powerful sativa, a more chill indica, or a more better hybrid.

VConsidering it a personal favorite at the moment, I have a huge issue with insomnia and I need as much sleep as can get at once. Typically throughout the week I am awake all day long only sleeping 2-3 times a week. Back to the bud: it&#39;s very heavy on the eyes, eliminates headaches migraines kind of shit quickly, makes bodily pain manageable. Knocked me the fuck out after awhile haha\u000a

VPleasant but light head high. Nice if you want something mild. Calming but not sedating. However, head effect are a little short-lived so be prepared to take several doses if you need something that lasts.

V&quot;Dream&quot; is right. This is not an out-in-public weed. Very cerebral, makes me super spacey, one of those where you suddenly realize you&#39;ve been staring at the wall for 20 minutes thinking barely coherent thoughts. Pleasant enough, but I can get the overall relaxing effects from other strains without the fog. If you do focus on a task, you can get shit done, but don&#39;t expect to have a conversation doing it. Don&#39;t expect to have a conversation, period. I&#39;m going to experiment with using small amounts of this to soften hard-core sativas, but for me, I think I&#39;ll only ever use the rest of my gram for seasoning. I can&#39;t see myself smoking it solo again. It&#39;s weird to have something make me that spaced-out without accompanying tiredness, but that&#39;s almost more disorienting. That said, I was able to write some clever, coherent paragraphs. This stuff might work for some people, but it&#39;s not my favorite. I won&#39;t buy it again.

VBlue dream similarities are very minimal. \u000aSmell: Slightly sour, with a slight pungent fruit aroma. No hints of bluedream at all, no blue composition at all. Smell was not chemical or jet fuely at all. Also lacked any traces of durban. \u000aTaste was smooth, sour, with a higher note to the taste. It definitely can&#39;t be considered sweet in any capacity. There were more hints of the snow lotus. No Blue or durban taste whatsoever.\u000a\u000aThe effects are calmness, and relaxation. This is not the uplifting creative high I get from blue dream. The high is not bad, it&#39;s just not what the description says it is. Very smooth curve to an overall mellow high. It does increase happiness levels but it is very slight and you are not overwhelmed with joy.\u000a
