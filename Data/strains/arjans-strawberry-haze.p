VI picked this strain up a few days back and I&#39;ve decided that I should&#39;ve picked up a larger amount than I did. This has to be one of the smoothest buds I&#39;ve smoked in a while, the smell of the nugs were sweet and the nugs themselves were dense, it&#39;s what you would like to see in most buds, I would buy this strain again 100%!

VEvery hit coats your mouth with a flavour that&#39;s hard to pinpoint, definitely strawberry but it&#39;s way more complex than that, very unique.\u000aThe high is powerful, EUPHORIC, heady, almost comparable to an MDMA buzz but much clearer.\u000aSomeone already mentioned it being like when you first started smoking and I couldn&#39;t agree more.\u000aThis bud is something special and it has honestly earned a place in my top 5!

VThought this was a great strain. Very light buds. The smell is a very nice and sweet aroma with the hint of strawberry notes. Smoking was smooth. Felt it almost instantly. High lasted fairly long for me. Smoked a couple hours before bed and I was up later than usual. Definitely a daytime smoke, but the night owl would have fun with this one as well.

VSmoked and vaped some of this strain during the day and into the night, was good for both! I was at home during the day watching TV and eating some pizza. Then I went out to a bar with some friends and it proved to be quite a social high too.

VDefinitely tasted that hint of strawberry, quite tasty. I rolled the joint a little loose, so the flavor wasn&#39;t nearly as good. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to try it in a vaporizer soon. The stuff I got was poorly grown, not very potent. The buzz, when it finally appeared, was happy and slightly giggly. I liked the high, I&#39;m sure the grow could&#39;ve been better. I&#39;ll try it again at a later date.

VThe high from Arj is a very pleasant high but I find this a very week strain that does not do much for me.\u000a\u000aThis is a strain that is best suited for wake-n-bake. It is a small wake up call in the morning but that is all.\u000a\u000aDefinitely a beginner strain. This is for the person that is afraid of getting high for the first time. It will relax and mellow you out while making you happy.

Vthis is one of my favourite strains. this was so fruity i honestly thought it had been sprayed with some sort of candy spray. the taste was also amazingly sweet, even when mixed with tobacco. a great focused head high. very energetic perfect afternoon smoke. also great for wake and bake. whenever i can get this strain i will.
