VI bought this in the shatter and made a vape pen out of it. It\u2019s such a nice high! I have anxiety and get stoned quick. This got me feelin\u2019 giggly and happy and surprisingly super creative. I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable going out or working after taking my pen hit only because it was so obvious with my smile and eyes that I was high. But for me, again someone with anxiety, I was super happy and felt creative on this, not super tired either. The only downfall I had with this which I have with a lot of strains that get you giggly high, I get the body jerks like you feel like your falling and you jerk your body to stop from falling. Maybe I\u2019m the only one that gets those but besides that I loved it! I\u2019d like to try it in flower form.

VWookies has become a favorite flower strain of mine.  I used to call upon narcotics for my pain, but between Wookies, Mendo Breath, Jack Herer, Sour Tangerine they all speak a language of sweet relief unlike any other.  Plus I feel so much better free from the opiates. Wicked Wookies!!

VKind of a letdown, honestly. It has a very strong skunky smell, with a bit of menthol. It came in a lot of mid-size dense nugs, they&#39;re different shades of green with brown trichomes all around. It made me cough a bit, but it was pretty smooth. It gave me a nice head buzz. But honestly,  it being labeled 28.60% THC and descending from Girl Scout Cookie, I was hoping for something better. Plus I just wasn&#39;t digging the menthol taste that was left in my mouth.

VI just took. .2 snap out of my shower head perc bong and this strain definitely taste amazing! It had this minty fresh vanilla cupcake like taste to it that is super pungent with a creamy and earthy undertone. This strain delivers a very relaxed euphoric high with a happy uplifting sativa high you feel on the forehead/temporal part of your head. Recommended for anytime of day

VI like this strain.  Focused, cerebral high, great for relaxation and pain relief.   I purchased this strain after reading Leafly&#39;s description that gave it medical high marks as a treatment for insomnia.  Do not buy Wookies as an insomnia treatment,  as there are much better strains for this purpose.  This is a better strain for afternoon or early evening use.  I docked it one star, not because it is a bad strain, but because suggesting this one is for insomnia is rather misleading.
