VFirst and foremost, Emerald OG smells like heaven. When I first got a hold of this strain I was floored with the smell. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is the citrus that, at least for me, was the dominant scent emanating from this strain. The earthy undertones really give this a sweet and aromatic flavor. Indicas are my personal favorite ways to medicate for my own depression/anxiety. The bud itself is absolutely beautiful with beautiful green notes and orange hairs. When broken up, the citrus flavors absolutely pop and this thing was STICKY and dense. \u000aI chose to vaporize the Emerald OG and the citrus comes through beautifully through the vapor and I didn&#39;t notice any of the earthy notes you normally associate with cannabis. The high itself was definitely couch locking and is perfect before you head off to bed. Something to note is that it can flare up some anxiety so be careful if you are prone to anxiety to start small before you head up. This strain was different from other indicas in that, while I was couch locked, I felt a deep relaxation that made me feel more meditative and introspective. Indicas are my personal flower of choice for mindfulness and this strain holds you closely in that journey. This flower is definitely more for personal use rather than social settings otherwise you&#39;ll be sitting there anti social as hell.\u000aDo yourself a favor, if you&#39;re a lover of indicas, try out Emerald OG. That OG flavor comes through beautifully and Emerald OG is award winning for a reason.

VI&#39;m very finicky to cannabis and this was very light for me even. It was a body high for sure, had waves of heaviness and then they&#39;d subside. Nothing cerebral for me. Not too pleased though with all of the hype that was surrounding it so that&#39;s why I gave it a 3 out of 5. The dispensary I went to said it was top shelf and to me it was just a normal little body buzz. If you are after just a nice, very chill body high with no head games this is a good bud. No paranoia what so ever.

VEmerald OG was an excellent indica. Emerald OG had me feeling relaxed right away, which turned into couch lock, and finally me falling asleep. If you have trouble with insomnia or just want to have a nice relaxing night time smoke before bed then Emerald OG is definitely for you.

VThis strain is smooooooth! damn!!! &#128154;\u000aSeriously though, the fragrance of the buds was lovely! Took me back to the early days of smoking and the excitement that came from knowing you&#39;re about to burn a great bowl. The flavor is sweet and mildly eathy and hits super smooth. Fast acting and effective for relaxing at the end of the day. Will definitely be adding to my favorites and in future purchases.

VGot a gram of this very goopy, stretchy, tasty oil, practically taffy or pull and snap. Loaded a large dab&#39;s worth into my Evolve Plus and it sent me to flavor country. Deep rich earthiness with a slight pungent aspect, a slow body tingle crawled up my arms, back, and face. Deep shoulder and neck pains are but a memory but I do feel stronger orbital pressure around my eyes. Nothing unpleasant though!

VThere&#39;s not too much bad things I can say about this strain--except maybe the smoke is a bit thick, but most indicas are like that. I felt like I was in a different world and could only focus on one thing. Definitely a nighttime strain since I can barely keep my eyes open by the time its wearing off.

VAwesome pure luck find on 420. I came across an old bag of emerald I&#39;d forgotten about, it was 2.3 grams and I rolled all of it into 2 zigzag 1 1/4s connected lengthwise and smoked about a third of it. Very mild, pure indica high, according to the label 24%thc but doesn&#39;t feel near that strong. It&#39;s difficult to review because the effects are so understated even after smoking a lot of it (and not smoking at all for a week prior), but it also has zero negatives aside from lack of productivity, which, who gives a shit? Munchies are completely off the scale. It&#39;s a really good strain as long as you don&#39;t expect too much from it.

VIf you want to obliterate your superego and ego and explore your id and all the suppressed emotions then this is gonna get you there. I used my vapor bong attachment with my Kvape on 420F and took a few really good hits. Only negative was I could not stay awake to watch &#39;Live by Night&#39; which I guess was not that good anyway. I recommend this strain for sleep, pain, and introspection.
