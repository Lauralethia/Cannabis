VThis is an indica dominant hybrid, if not indica purely. This strain is amazing and that&#39;s underestimating that value of it. The nugs are covered in layers of white trichomes that literally make it look like a tiny snowball. And with the bright green look, tiny orange hairs everywhere... It&#39;s a beauty to look at. Very vibrant kush tones of earth and sweetness. Now the smoke is the best of course, with a bottomless pit of near sedative relaxation. I say near because you can somehow maintain a straight thought pattern while your body sinks into a blanket of tranquility. Nothing but good thoughts, a euphoric high and not to mention excellent for sleeping as well. Nothing much too say other than try it and you&#39;ll have no regrets. \u000a\u000aLook: 5/5 (beautiful bud!)\u000aScent: 5/5\u000aHigh: 5/5 (very nice indica relaxing high)\u000aBurnout: 5/5\u000aOverall: 5/5 (please try it if you get a chance!)

Sure this weed gives me munchies just like any other, however the next day I find myself not eating anywhere near as much as I normally would.

VThis White Lightning strain was my pick over Grand-daddy Purple and Pink Candy and believe me I knew from the get-go this was going to be a wise decision.   Very pungent, and it&#39;s inherited the Skunk aroma and it&#39;s got that sweetness at the end of the exhale.  My batch is from an expert and I know he&#39;s cured this strain for at least 6 weeks as it&#39;s that fine.  As an indoor grower I know this following my first toke or two of this White Lightning the cross of both Indica dominant strains White Widow x Northern Lights.  My bubble hit was that fine it&#39;s elevated me to a bliss of comfort and ready for a couching zone.   Getting to be my personal favorite here this strains Cured extra-fine and due to this fact my rating is quite high at 9.7 out of a full 10.0  .  Should you be a Skunk-fan and high on the taste, this strain is it.   Would well suit your fine evening and night and should keep you at good company.   Strain grade:  Solid A

Vamazing is all i can say. I had anxiety until this strain crushed it away...wow. So good i had to share. If you have anxiety and have a tolerance this strain still works.

VI bought some of this from a local dispensary, and first things first, it smells like feces. It was a pungent skunky smell at first when I opened the bag, but as soon as I started busting it up, BOOM, dookie. It doesn&#39;t taste bad when smoked or vaped, and the poop smell goes away when you start burning/heating it. But dang, gang, that&#39;s some poopy poopy bud. \u000a\u000aI find it to be a nice alternative to a daytime sativa. It&#39;s a little more heavy-headed but still functional, while bringing the intensity that you expect from its indica parentage.

VWhite Lightning smokes like the name.. Electrifying! \u000a\u000aThe smoke is a little woody, but hits you like a grizzly bear with rabies, going from 0 to 100 in a blink of an eye! \u000a\u000aDefinitely brought out the anxiety in me, time after time.. So much that I ended up making brownies with the rest of the half OZ. I don&#39;t really recommend this to anyone, would not smoke again.
