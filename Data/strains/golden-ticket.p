VIf you don&#39;t like this strain, you just got a bad batch. Or maybe you don&#39;t like hybrids. \u000aDefinitely stony &amp; euphoric high, beginners medicate slower you don&#39;t want to be overwhelmed by the euphoria.\u000aThis is the golden ticket to a great mood. It puts up a fight against the blues &amp; will leave you giggly.\u000aI picked up a half gram of shatter by Canamo @ Harvest of Baseline yesterday, and it&#39;s my favorite out of the 3 different half grams I picked up.\u000a  I could see this strain lending a hand for those wanting to be creative, now some strains you get you don&#39;t feel are that special it just feels like meds? This isn&#39;t one of those, it stands out.

VThanks again to those BudTenders at Thrive in NLV!  This strain is a funkly lemony lime with this odd sour skunk undertones - very pungent!   Excellent coming on strong cerebral rush settling into a nice big body blow.  No couch lock but very very relaxed.  No anxiety attacks for days now.  My new weekend daytime favorite.  Thanks again, Thrive !!

VI had a chance to try this through a friend of a friend. I hadn&#39;t heard anything about it so I sat down with a pen and paper and reviewed my high and my buddies high. We laughed until our ribs hurt and ate everything in the refrigerator then McDonald&#39;s. It tasted great, it smoked great, it was great. Although the high didn&#39;t last very long, bout an hour tops before you wanna smoke again. All in all, I&#39;d buy it again.

VForm: Shatter\u000aBrand: Canamo\u000aTHC: 65%\u000a\u000aAroma 5/5 Those who have Golden Goat on it&#39;s own knows how tasty it is, combined with Face Off OG it combines to make a super skunky yummy experience.\u000a\u000aExperience 4/5 It is a good strain, I don&#39;t apparently get &quot;access to Euphoria&#39;s top for&quot; like the description suggests but it&#39;s an overall stony chill high. I have 5 different strains right now &amp; this is the one I use as my 50/50 hybrid. \u000a\u000aOverall if you want to, try it. But if there were other strains I haven&#39;t had I&#39;d pass this one up for the other.

VMan I\u2019ve been having the worst couple days... a few of those days in a row where anxiety is just off the charts and you\u2019re mentally/emotionally feeling the cumulation of all the difficult things and shitty stuff you haven\u2019t had time or space for - it\u2019s been a few of those days straight. \u000a\u000aEnter the \u201cGolden Ticket\u201d\u000aI\u2019m feeling ok with everything overall &#128522;. I\u2019m smiling again, even laughing at stuff. I\u2019m sitting here comfy in my lovely room, enjoying some food I just cooked. I almost feel ready to tackle the world and everything else again, but more importantly - I\u2019m ok with not being 100% there yet. I get to take time and have a break. 2 hits from my table top vape, and all is becoming right with the world. Thank you golden ticket &#128157; &#128591;! \u000a\u000aExcellent for anxiety, stress, depression. If I can update (and remember too), I\u2019ll add more nuanced observations after more diverse use.

VI like a gentle, delicious effect that doesn&#39;t slow me down too much and is free from anxiety or paranoia. Golden Ticket is just that! A Golden Ticket! This strain is on my short list of favorites (Also on my list Killer Queen &amp; Golden Goat). Personally, I don&#39;t smoke a lot so I discovered that at higher THC percentages one puff is enough for me to get the effect I want or I mix it with a little Cannatonic (low THC/High CBD strain). Smoke a little more and you find a relaxed, euphoric relaxation/sleep. Very versatile! LOVE!

Upon arrival I was not only elevated in mind and body but swept off the roof on a cloud of cotton candy and my bodies stress and fatigue were relieved. Flavor profile matches my preference for the citrus as well as the skunky, pungent strains... best of both worlds. Great balanced high combines energy and mental wandering. Medicinal values rate high in my book because my chronic shoulder pain was reduced drastically and my problematic tummy was relaxed.\u000a\u000aVery yummy \u000aGreat cerebral buzz\u000abalanced benefits including both recreational and medicinal values\u000aspread the word, Golden ticket gets you to euphoria&#39;s top floor!

VI picked up a nug run pre-roll of this bud, originally testing at 28% THC. Flavor was great on this flower, and this flavor of the bud was much more sweet than skunk. In a joint/blunt strain, I like bud that really can carry flavor through the heat of combustion. I feel like the floral taste tied together an enjoyable smoking experience with a nice, level high.

I ordered Fortune cookie, and got this by accident; is really hard for me to give accurate feelings on this strain because I smoked it, and was expecting something else. \u000a\u000aThat being said, it definitely makes your body feel heavy. I smoked this whole cooking, and 20 minutes in, I felt exhausted and had to sit down. I just feel the strong urge to get up and do things, but my body is weighing me down. The buzz itself, however is very nice. Would definitely call this an &quot;after work, I need to unwind&quot; strain that doesn&#39;t make you fall asleep.

VOne of my new, favorite go-to strains... What sets it apart for me is the complete mental awareness that I experience while also enjoying full body relaxation. I continually become absorbed into deep cleaning my house, playing with my oil paints, etc... ***The high with GT is very consistent, and I appreciate that. Doesn&#39;t matter how I feel going in, I can trust that I am going to have an enjoyable time, and that is a big deal for me. Some strains have worsened my paranoia or anxiety, but this strain does not. I become extremely introspective in a positive way, very bubbly and content. I experience NO negative thoughts whatsoever, which is a big deal for me. 5/5 stars for this strain. Definitely one of my favorites. NOTE: I do experience dry eyes and dry mouth with all strains, including GT.
