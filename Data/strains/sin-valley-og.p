VI&#39;m not personally a fan of the taste of this strain, but the effects are a perfect balance of sativa and indica. You get the head high first and it slowly trickles down into your shoulders, chest and arms. It&#39;s a throbbing numbness throughout your body. Didn&#39;t make me sleepy, but didn&#39;t keep me up either. Good strain for watching serious dramas.

VI have chronic pain from severe scoliosis which was followed by 2 spine fusions and several surgeries with metal implants. I need pain relief! That&#39;s where this outstanding strain comes in. It starts with a relaxing cerebral high which allows me to be less focused on the nagging pain in every joint. Need I say more?

VThis was a time-slower for us which made a fun 1 hour high feel like 4 hours. It starts fun and social and giggly then slowly transitions after an hour or so to a heady thinker. Next comes the heavy body followed by an immediate need to sleep. The Sleep is deep and hella restful. Memory is spotty next day. For when you wanna have a good time but need to go to sleep in a few hours.

VAnother great hybrid balance!  Kicks in fast - I get that sensation in my eyes telling me &quot;it&#39;s working&quot; while I&#39;m only halfway into what I think I should consume. :-) This is a really contemplative, insightful high for the first while - the kind where you just sit there and think.  Fantastic for listening to music or watching something intense, as well.  As the head high fades I find I&#39;m knocked out on the comedown.  If I don&#39;t take that as a cue to go to bed, when the high fades I&#39;m back to not being sleepy at all.  (I suppose that isn&#39;t really related to the weed but whatevs.) It&#39;s amazing as a wake and bake with a cup of coffee, if you have time to come down and let the sleepiness pass (the coffee helps with that!)  Anyway, I really, really like this strain.  The only brand I&#39;ve seen/tried is Liberty Reach with 25% THC, so I don&#39;t know how it is from other growers or THC levels...that&#39;s my only disclaimer.

VThis is an utterly common strain, looks good, smells okay, would not get a fly high. The stuff we got came from Mohave Cannabis and it was very disappointing since it was supposed to replace another strain that they grew that was absolutely great. We are what they call seasoned consumers and from our point of view this is just fluff weed, good only as a sort of marijuana helper.

VIt Nice and light at first with a touch of sweetness and touch of bitter. It&#39;s a welll round pinch of lemony fresh on the finish. The feelings sneak in slowly. It allows for a light and joyful effect surge of relaxation and allows those stresses to just melt away.

VBeing an indica hybrid, I chose this as an evening strain. It was recommended to me by the budtender as one of the better strains so I went with it. It&#39;s a stronger strain and I definitely suffered some couch lock, but that&#39;s fine, that&#39;s kind of what I got it for. Others say this strain makes them feel &quot;relaxed&quot; and &quot;euphoric&quot; and I think that sums it up pretty well. Was nice to relax with while watching some tv and winding down for the night.\u000a\u000aI found the flavor to be a bit pungent with a hint of citrus.
