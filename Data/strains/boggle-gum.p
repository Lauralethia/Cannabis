VUnfortunate, the nugs looked good but this is a lame strain for me. Packed no punch, held no length and overall a bad purchase.

VSweet smelling, gum-like taste. Mellow high with a lot of focus. Must be high in CBD? Not overpowering and lasts about 2-3 hours.

VBy and far, this is my favorite strain that I&#39;ve found so far.  It is an Indica-heavy hybrid combination of BOGBubble and Northern Lights #5.  I can&#39;t even begin to explain the feeling, but each time I use it it seems to be better than the previous.  I only regret that it&#39;s difficult to find.  I found it at Elemental Wellness, but I purchased only 1g.  When I went back, they had sold out of the WHOLE batch, and were saying that it sold insanely quickly.  So, if you can get your hands on some, do so.  It&#39;s fantastic.

VPersonally, I don&#39;t like the taste.  I&#39;m not sure why.  But I like the high.  Smooth, happy, relaxed.  Just big on the happy.  I will definitely be adding this to my pain relievers.

VLoved this smooth happy euphoric feelings. Great sensory boost to sight, sounds and touch.  You can get through a whole day with energy to do stuff, no hard crash at the end just a light fading out of being high. And no headaches :)

VNear perfect but does stimulate my appetite - hense only 4-stars.  No anxiety or tenseness.  This is going in my keeper pile.\u000aUpdate - Really difficult to locate strain

VPretty nice stuff, bought an eighth after smoking it with a buddy. Has a really mellow flavor, with an almost citrus-taste. The effects were instant, rushed right to my head and spun it like a top. Also had a nice body high to accompany it. One downside, however, was  how fast I built up tolerance to it, faster than anything else I&#39;ve smoked, but overall, a great strain.

VLeaves me really calm, content but inspired, and I definitely notice some pain management. Makes me SUPER sleepy.  Not my favorite tasting bud but definitely one I&#39;ll get again.
