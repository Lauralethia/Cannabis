VGood strain - pain is gone. Numb and sitting outside myself. Feel light headed (and hungry). Fun to watch tv on - hyper focused but eyes are heavy. Neat. Like this strain a lot!

VThis is a brilliant Indica! Surprisingly there&#39;s no couch lock effect that usually accommodates the heavy body buzz you get with this strain. Instead you&#39;re very uplifted almost energetic yet you keep the hefty body relax feel you get with great indicas. This blend helps to create a very nice focused effect that makes it easy to accomplish tasks if in the mood all the while that dense body buzz is relaxing the bodies aches and pains making it easy to melt to a couch if needed. considered your mind relaxed as well because this strain also eases stress and anxiety. This in large part may be due to this strain having no real paranoia side effect. All in all this is a wonderful strain great for when you need relief of the daily pains and stresses whether it during the morning up and go or the evening wind down.

VWhat can I say, an amazing flower. Tastes great and knocks the hell out of pain, but it doesn&#39;t couch lock you.  First time I had it instantly went into my top 5 strains.  Can&#39;t say enough about it.  I have extreme arthritis and this does a heck of a job helping me get through it.

VThis one hits back!!! Even for a seasoned guy this one blows your hair back. Tons on tricomes on these solid little nuggets. 27% THC this isn&#39;t for beginners. Good before bed, shuts me right down but in a good way. When I want to get stoned this is the first jar I reach for.
