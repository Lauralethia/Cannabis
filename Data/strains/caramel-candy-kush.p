VFirst hit tastes better than any weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. It&#39;s delicious; almost tastes like chocolate or something sweet. Very easy, smooth rips. It&#39;s pretty potent, but not as heavy as a typical sativa-heavy strain. It&#39;s effing pretty to stare at, too. I show this stuff off to newbies and friends whenever possible. My local guy always has some available, and it&#39;s always so damn sticky I can barely roll it up!!! Get this strain and make it one of your favs.

VBest indica strain I have tried so far but you know but before medical marijuana we had no idea what an indica, sativa etc was. All I know is this strain gave me a nice mello body tingling stay at home and read on the couch kind of high. Pain and anxiety were forgotten, but not truly gone just dulled for a while. I will keep my eyes open for this strain again once I run out #420sweepstakes

The effects are strong yet creative and energetic. Gets your mind thinking, any project you have been putting off, you may just have an idea and finish it. This particular flower was grown by Sons of Agronomy. THC 18% CBD .09

VWow I get a THC 81% wax from the CT medical program and the first thing I noticed when I took a dab is that it tastes like caramel popcorn or a caramel apple. The wax is nice a gooey and clean. Beautiful dark color. Takes a few minutes to hit but a calm high hit me. My muscles spasms slowed down and a sense of calm about something that had been weighing on my mind became something I can deal with. \u000a\u000aIt does not hit as hard as some other Indicas. More like a sativa high in my book. Not the kind of stuff I would use to just melt into the couch. Your mind keeps peppy and you don&#39;t go into &quot;the zone&quot; I would recommend this to people with high tolerance as a nice daytime and or evening medication session. \u000a\u000aI can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever had a strain that had tasted so much like its name sake. I&#39;ve included a photo of the wax but who knows if it will get posted but if your a CT Mrs patient I would recommend it. But it&#39;s not my favorite.
