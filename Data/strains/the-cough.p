VI love this strain!  After going to school in Fort Collins it was easy to take for granted but for some reason it is hard to find these days.  Living in denver now have finally tracked down a couple clones and look forward to having this available year round.  Top three strain for me.  Achieves a relaxed high that is just perfect whether you want to head outside or couch it.

VI will just say this, it wasn&#39;t the strain for me. It made me cough uncontrollably, the high made me dizzy, kinda paranoid and a bit nauseous. I couldn&#39;t do anything but drank a bunch of water and try to get it out of my system as quick as possible

VNot sure if this is the proper strain page, but I picked up a strain from Pure dispensary just called &quot;Cough&quot; that was labeled a hybrid...\u000a\u000aSo far, this strain hasn&#39;t given me either a sativa or indica high. Pretty much down the middle (hence it being labeled a hybrid, I suppose). I&#39;m primarily an indica smoker, but wanted to start trying strains that wouldn&#39;t make me so sleepy when I wanted to smoke and go out with friends. It basically gives me a basic high with no profound effects besides being mellow and &quot;light&quot; (that&#39;s the best way I can describe it). I&#39;ve also smoked this with the intentions of sitting at home and watching TV before falling asleep and this definitely didn&#39;t hurt with helping out. \u000a\u000aAgain, I could be reviewing the wrong strain, but this is the closest name I could find for it. Also, the dispensary I got it from could&#39;ve had some insight as to how long this particular strain was in flowering cycle, which would have had a considerable effect on its effects (i.e. - longer time spent in flowering = darker trichromes = more indica-like high). I&#39;ll change this review once I have more info on the lineage of this strain.
