VUplifting and intensely cerebral but not racy. A bouquet of spring floral notes with what I though was a slight background of chocolate. A bit longer lasting than typical sativas with a very fast onset and slower come down. Very exotic.

VGrabbed this on sale at Herbal Remedies in Quincy IL. PTS brand white film style bottle. Upon opening the bottle I was rewarded with a fresh sweet bubblegum odor. This product was very fresh and the buds were light and fluffy. The flavor reminded me of fresh greens with a light dank after taste. This particular strain began slow but picked up steam and settled squarely in my head. With a nice buzz yet retaining the ability to accomplish goals, I highly recommend this strain for daytime activities. 3 stars.

VTHIS IS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY! If you want to get high and this is the only option then smoke with people you are very comfortable and close with. This will make your high more enjoyable. Also play some chill ass music and relax, think happy thoughts. Might be challenging but talk about some informal shit. Don&#39;t be a nice around people who are dramatic as hell, this will throw off your high and increase anxiousness.
