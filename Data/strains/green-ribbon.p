VIf in moderate doses, this strain can be amazing! I am not much of a Sativa guy, but this strain is one of my favorites now. I picked up a gram from a local dispensary that tests the amount of THC and it registered 18.8 percent. I started off with a couple hits from my pipe and journeyed out into world. I had an instant buzz which was quite energetic and peaceful at the same time. I wouldn&#39;t stop talking my girls ear off and she seemed to be a little more conserved than I was. Anyway, i made some purchases and headed back home to load a bowl in my bong. This was a little much! I took a fat rip and could tell already this may be a bit much. It was, but it sure made sex amazing! I came down a bit rough but mellowed out with some White Rhino. Great weed.... top 3 now. This stuff is running rampant in the Sacramento area.... check it out.

VOut of the hundreds of strains consumed through various mediums, this one is average. It is a social strain that did provide any anxiolytic relief. On the contrary: its created an abundance of anxiety and paranoia in both private and social situations, in both negative and positive cognitive biases (that is, moods and predispositions,environment, etc). Felt strung-out and unfocused with grogginess and an apathy that is a hallmark of Gorilla Glue #4 in my many experiences with it and its phenotypes.

VA great one for high energy and perkiness. It gives a decent physical euphoric feeling for the first few minutes, but I found that the high energy this strain provides exacerbated my stress and paranoia like no other has before. Probably not the best one for those prone to paranoia and anxiety,

VGreen Crack x Afghani X Trainwreck.  Beautiful light green nugs covered in white trichromes. Bud almost looks like white widow.  Has that unmistakeable trainwreck taste to it with a slight spicy haze kick.  Definitely sativa dominant but was still a very hard hitter.  Wonderful euphoric high without the racinessof some sativas.  Has enough Indica in there to balance out the effect which I am greatful for.  I dont usually go for sativas or sativa dominant hybrids but this was too pretty to lay off.  Im glad I got it because this was fantastic.

I like how it doesn&#39;t get you smacked, and you can still function in social settings. Very potent and fruity smelling. Came straight from the grower and was amazing.

VI have a new Pax 2 vaporizer which I love, but it seems as if I puff 3x as much to get the same high as smoking from a pipe. In search of stronger bud to vape, something suitable for daytime consumption when there is shit to do, I came across Green Ribbon. It tested at 24+% THC and as you&#39;d expect, this weed gets you lit. I feel very awake, very aware, with heightened senses. Primarily heady, less body high. My problem now is what to do with all the other weed I had been smoking before. Maybe I&#39;ll make some green butter. Tastes like pine tar and a bit of exhaust like diesel. This would be good bud for interior painting, hiking, Occasional smokers beware: strong effects ahead.

VFirst 2 times I tried this strain I couldn&#39;t stand it ! But now that the homeboy has it dialed in , WOW! Incredible mix of strains - obviously stativa dominant ; but I can feel the affgo indica side for sure. A little to sativa for me I&#39;m guessing 70/30 sativa . But a really well bred flower and a damn good high. 8/10

VI smoked my flower of Green Ribbon in a bong and it was very smooth. I instantly felt good. My body felt amazing and like I was ready for anything. The more I smoked, the more tired I got. It kind of had a earthy taste so it was a little strange, but not bad. My bud was super crystally and looked beautiful. It hit fast and strong. My father in law said &quot;feels like gravity is pulling my legs to the floor&quot;. We all had fun with this strain, very uplifting at first, then a mellow finish.

I&#39;m not usually giggly when stoned, but I was not only euphoric - I was full on giggly and talkative. I don&#39;t think I could socialize on this, but great strain for low pressure social situations. :)

VI have a new Pax 2 vaporizer which I love, but it seems as if I puff 3x as much to get the same high as smoking from a pipe. In search of stronger bud to vape, something suitable for daytime consumption when there is shit to do, I came across Green Ribbon. It tested at 24+% THC and as you&#39;d expect, this weed gets you lit. I feel very awake, very aware, with heightened senses. Primarily heady, less body high. My problem now is what to do with all the other weed I had been smoking before. Maybe I&#39;ll make some green butter. Tastes like pine tar and a bit of exhaust like diesel. This would be good bud for interior painting, hiking, Occasional smokers beware: strong effects ahead.

Taste was amazing, very floral and sweet, what floral flavored candy would taste like. The buzz is an uplifting, chatty talkative high. Definitely good if you have to be around folks in public (in moderation). I say bc too much will have you giggling and laughing. Strong strain, I would have to agree the effects are a little more on the sativa side, but get a euphoric body rush as well. Great strain for anxiety. Good smoke, grabs your lungs.
