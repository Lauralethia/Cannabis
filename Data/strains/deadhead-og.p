VThis strain is a rising star about to tip the charts right side up.. The smell for starters is skunky, danky, with a twist of punge.. Their hoick trichome little boners can be seen by the naked eye with clusters of frost and sugar on the side.. Its hue&#39;s of greens and purple oranges glow like little fire flies sparkling their ways up here to Canada day!!                        Chemdawg Another known Aliase  was the match that started this chain like diversified dominal affect with a sea saw Cali Connection touch that solidified a &quot;Second Place&quot; slam dunk in the Cannabis Cup!!  (The owner won 1st)

VDead Head OG is pure \u2018fire on the Mountain.\u2019 After sparking up some Dead Head OG, one will revel in the elevated mindset and accompanying body high, a warm relaxed sensation grips the frontal cortex and calms the body for a prolonged period of time \u2013 providing both introspection, a case of the giggles, then deep relaxation. Dead Head OG is a potent 60-40 indica dominant hybrid. Crossed with ChemDawg X San Fernado Valley OG, so the taste is near perfection. While there are many derivative Kush strains with questionable degrees of pedigree sitting on the shelves at dispensaries these days, few strains have enjoyed the never-ending popularity of this old-school high-powered OG.

VReal Stoney strain with a decent head change. Really tasty strain with hints of berry flavours. After about an hour or so I was overwhelmed with hunger. 3 TollHouse chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches, 3 churros, a chili dog, fries and a soda dropped my high like a rock. \u000a   Food coma and sleep kicked in and put me in full zombie mode. This is not a day time green if you have shit to do. \u000a   High tends to last until you eat, then when you ingest more, the cycle repeats. \u000a\u000a

VThese Very large Nugs create a nice lime, tree fruit, and pungent smell. I absolutely enjoy deadhead of how it makes me feel in terms of ADHD &amp; Depression. It works quite well for pain since it has og kush the kush is what create that pain numbing feeling. It just gets me in the zone. I few puffs and I just feel engaged in what I need to have done. A Test or an exam on this is tremendous brought my grades up and allowed me to get higher grades rather than the usual F&#39;s, and D&#39;s in my college courses. It works for me in this way as well as getting what needs to get done earlier and out of the way. It has dry mouth and you feel kind of tired but overall for me 5/5.

VAs I start the review process I can honestly say that after the first dab I could feel the effects within a minute (it is important to note that I rarely feel the effects after the first hit). Granted, I&#39;m not stoned but I definitely got a &quot;head tap.&quot; The flavor itself, based on the first hit, was an abundant diesel. The second hit brought on a subtle piney/mint taste. But I can&#39;t quite out my finger on it. The third hit came with even more confusion. As I take my next (insert pause here), I am overwhelmed with a &quot;chemical&quot; taste. I hate to use chemical as a flavor, seeing as it&#39;s such a general term, but that&#39;s what i get. Overall, the flavor is abundantly chemical with undertones of pine and ammonia saturated in &quot;sweet&quot; diesel (sweet as in flavor, not &quot;awesome dude!&quot;). At this point I&#39;m about 6 or 7 dabs in. Normally I would be high by now, but aside from the initial buzz, sad to say I&#39;m just okay...... Now I&#39;m at 10 or so, having taken several hits in rapid succession. This is a great high! I have literally become stupid. It&#39;s taken me about five minutes to write the last two sentences, not because I didn&#39;t know what to say, but because I couldn&#39;t stop staring at the screen. I mean, just staring. The only downside is how much I had to smoke in order to get to this point. As it seems to be leveling out as well. But needless to say, effective communication and Dead Head OG don&#39;t compliment one another........... Okay, now that I&#39;m back :) From a medicinal point of view I tried Dh to relieve my back pain. From a one to ten scale I was at a four, nothing serious. I can honestly say the pain subsided, and if anything it simply dulled the pain. But I do have a slight headache, almost as if I&#39;m crashing from the high. Or I might need to drink some water. Overall this is a nice strain. The high is fantastic, euphoric and tranquil. If only it didn&#39;t take so much to get there. Medicinally, it dulls slight pain and loosens (joints) you up. But risks include a slight, short lived headache. \u000aThanks for reading and I hope this helps you make an informed choice. These opinions are based solely on my experience as I wrote this review.....

VIt was kind of weird the first time I smoked it. My friends and I all laughed for about 45 minutes then passed out in my bed. It gave a few of them the munchies but weed doesn&#39;t ever make me hungry. I have extreme back pain all the time. It helped with that. And it was a nice body and mind high. Helped me focus. Didn&#39;t make me want to stay up all night on tumblr made me want to go for a run or explore the outdoors.

VWith superior genetics, &#39;91 Chemdawg (Skunk VA Cut) x SFV OGK, The Cali Connection has blessed the cannabis community with a strain that is all around great. (60/40 sativa/indica ratio)\u000a\u000aAPPEARANCE: Deadhead OG nugs are all small to medium sized, VERY dense, bright green, coated with milky white trichomes, and has very bright orange, thick, long hairs coming out of the bud in every direction.\u000a\u000aSMELL: The Smell is not very pungeant (AT FIRST). It is a weak lemony/pine smell, a very sour and soft aroma, pungeant to the nose while up close but neat undetectable otherwise. However removing a bud from the bag, and giving it a soft squeeze, or breaking it open, or grinding it up reveals a VERY skunky smell (skunk va cut expressing its genes).\u000a\u000aTASTE: The taste is very similar to the original smell (lemony and piney), however cannabis connoisseurs, will be able to taste slight undertones of skunk, causing for a very tasty cannabis variety\u000a\u000aEFFECTS: Immediately felt after first puff, very sativa driven effects making you feel giggly at first then the indica effects blend fantasticly with the sativa ones to create Euphoric, uplifting, and tingly high.

VI picked up a couple of pre-rolls of this a few weeks ago and i tossed it in a box with probably a dozen other strains and proceeded to forget about it. I rediscovered it last week and occasionally took a  couple hits in the eaely evening and late afternoon as a little mood enhancer and some pain relief. The first few times the effects seemed very similar to chemdawg with a some OG kush type effects. It is a nice blend for me at a very low dose. It&#39;s an instant good mood but also mellow. \u000a\u000aHowever, yesterday I dumped out part of a pre-roll into a bowl and torched it. The flower was ground up so fine it looked like keif, it was super fluffy and i didn&#39;t pack it down. Basically the whole bowl went up in 2 hits. 40 seconds later, BOOM I instantly fell into the &quot;I&#39;m way too high for this situation &quot; feeling. What followed was one of those high speed introspective trips were time slows down and my brain goes at light speed through emotional analyzation of every aspect of my life. This was very intense for about 20 mins and i was pretty uncomfortable so i took a huge hit of ACDC concentrate. The cbd brought me back to the front and then i felt more or less the way I was expecting to feel when I decided to hit this. I was feeling good but really having a hard time multitasking and felt like I was having a 45 min brain fart.  It&#39;s definitely a powerful strain and i think it would be a good choice for many. After that little freak out I am a bit hesitant now.

VThis deadhead is perfect for just focusing the dispensary that I get it had a 50/50 version of it and it gives me a lot more focus with just the right calm down for my crazy happy thoughts. Perfect for just concentrating and getting things done. I am starting to just get more of this for school it&#39;s getting my hw under control while still being chill. I love this version.

VSuch a vibrant and orange with medium leaves covering all the medium side of the bud the pistols are fine then uncover the tops middle and little bit of the bottom as well. The smell is grass clippings and a hint of citrus pungentness.  If you want to stay couch locked into your chair but still have a focus like a hawk deadhead can provide you with some of the most powerful concentration and focus.  If you&#39;re looking to get some things done I would highly suggest deadhead it provides me with clarity pain-free helps with my anxiety and anorexia and cures my ADHD.  Although the only drawback I&#39;ve had from this is I feel a little bit tired  and a very big cottonmouth so bring your water you&#39;ll need it.

VPicked this up as a last resort since my local shop the Holistic center in N. Phoenix. Good outer space high. If you&#39;re like me and prefer consuming cannabis in edible form but are looking for something new. This may be your strain  Helps tremendously with anxiety and depression episodes. If you&#39;re not a heavy smoker but like cannabis I bought an ounce and made my own canna butter. Saves money

VHHHmmmm I got an 1/8 of this from the fancy shop down in the Pearl dist in the PDX, I think this might have checked in @ $14 a gram but it&#39;s well worth it.  My lot of flower was about ping pong size and had a deep brown/green hue CBD ALERT! There was 0.5., THC 20%\u000a\u000aNot caked in crystals but a light dusting and ground down to the caviar style fluf in the grinder, but this has kush properties right?\u000a\u000aRipped a bong of this and the taste is earthy full on! Smooth as silk on the exhale. For me this came on slow after about 15 minutes I started to feel it.\u000a\u000aBeautiful CLEAR balanced head, perfect for daytime use. It might get a bit spacey but i&#39;d get this again despite it&#39;s taste.

VDeadhead is a wonderfully tasty strain with thick smoke that initially settles on the headier side.  The sativa edge comes through in both lemon &amp; pine undertones sometimes sneaking in gassy diesel.  Full bodied taste all around though with the overall flavor being of that yummy smooth OG laying heavy in the clouds.  Buds are dense &amp; a decent size, but breakdown pretty easy into joint material.\u000a\u000aTerpenes are very nice &amp; popping, but the buzz that comes with Deadhead OG is like the cherry on top of the sundae.  The high is mostly in the head and alert.  There is about a 30% indica feel to this flower which is just enough to keep it smooth &amp; mellow.  As with most cannabis this buzz comes to a nice smooth landing with head on pillow.\u000a\u000aFunctional pain reliever.  Pretty heavy on the munchies.  Nice party buzz.  Excellent flavor notes on palate.

Deadhead has a lot of dank,  spunky and compact leafs. deadhead always delivers the best consistently focused and stress-free anxiety medication that I could possibly have this is one of my most favorite strains in the entire world I could do would continuously until I die it is that going to try it for yourself.

It works instantly. The second I feel any type of headache begin , tension ,migraine , and or others , immediately take one nice pull and just moments after exhale my headaches are either gone or already dissipated to the point of knowing it will be gone in moments. Either way very reliable remedy and as for the care free bring on the day attitude makes great for an all day headache free smoke.  Enjoy

Dark green bud, bright orange hairs loose and fresh kind of like casey&#39;s dawg structure or tangerine dream.  Medium Vape more stoner and happy which is always a plus, euphoric a bit but able to concentrate Its a wake up call great for head  pains and lower back pains. Sweet and musky.

VOut of bud at a weeklong camp fest, down from trip, fresh evening, I met a beautiful woman who gave me the biggest nug for a shot of vodka. What a Bright dense rock hard big chunky nug with a profound deep skunkiness but this bright sweet side that(upon finding concentrate) almost resembles perfume but in flower is not overly sweet,also a downright earthiness just enough to smell like one of the most excellent pieces of cannabis genes out there no doubt. As the effects are an amazing relaxingly strong zonk to the head IE deadhead, also shout out to Jerry and any deadheads that grow this strain. You are doing god&#39;s work. It makes me happy, content and then I realize I&#39;ve been spacing out. Its an excellent pain relief strain. And for my campout 1 nug was like I just picked up a 30 sack, found some cured resin for my 420 because it was the one strain I wanted to find. And I prefer it in flower form actually, but it is a great strong strain.

VI scored a bag of Deadhead and was stoked to try it. The flavor was okay, the buds were discolored or burnt. It a okay wake-n-bake clear minded, can focus all day strain. Great, but not the greatest.

VI&#39;ve had this recently, reminds me of a Grateful Dead concert where you&#39;re kicked back and chilling. No matter what kind of music you&#39;re listening to you get into it, even if it is your worst nightmare kind of music you are suddenly humming along. Locked to the couch. I really liked it except on a first use of it and dosing pretty heavy, it had me very off balance and dizzy when standing up and walking. It heightened some of my TBI and core balance issues. In future I know to take it easy with this one unless I&#39;m ready to just rest and even sleep.

VThis version of deadhead is more sativa dominant the other deadhead I had was a 50/50.More concentration paower, I can feel my drowsyness fade away this is great if you feel tired from school such a great pick me up. Dark green bud, bright orange hairs loose and fresh kind of like casey&#39;s dawg structure or tangerine dream.  Medium Vape more stoner and happy which is always a plus, euphoric a bit but able to concentrate Its a wake up call great for head  pains and lower back pains. Sweet and musky.

VI had an indica-heavy strain of this I used at night. True to it&#39;s name, it deadened my head. Racing thoughts slow down, no more worries, just comfort and relaxation. Perfect when you need to just shut down, relax, and sleep.

VSolid four star strain. It gives you that classic stoney-bologna high you\u2019re looking for sometimes. An immediate body stone shortly followed by a cerebral high that\u2019ll make you enjoy audio and visual things more. Now personally I give it a 4/5 because of two reasons. 1) I\u2019ve had better strains for that \u201cstoney-bologna\u201d high and 2) the taste is straight gas, and not in the \u201cbro this is straight fire chronic\u201d way. It taste like literal gasoline, and believe me I got it from a very respected grower in my area of california (209). I got it in badder form, took a dab, and hesitated to take any more. Idk if I\u2019ll even use the rest... probably will, but man it taste worse than butt. And I\u2019d know.

Vit&#39;s a strain I stuck to for a couple of days and smoked it out of wrap and glass. to get the full effect or power of this strain glass was a better choice. blunts left me  with an awareness high. it was like I knew I was high but didn&#39;t feel much of the body effects. I felt a lot of the saliva affects of this strain. left me really relaxed and felt more like a day time type.

It only tested at 15% THC which is a little low but even still, better high than I&#39;ve had with oil cartridges testing at 85%. \u000a\u000aDefinitely get that smell of diesel/cheesy funk. The taste is piney. Nice crystals coating outside, very nice to look at. High is a little spacey with a nice calmness. Think &quot;upbeat blues club.&quot;

VI get all the Indica effects of this one. Total relaxation with a very heavy body buzz, don&#39;t put you to sleep but really kicks you back. It is cerebral enough to get the thoughts going which may be the only sativa effect I really notice. \u000a Definitely a &quot;put you in the zone&quot; type of strain. I was sitting on my back deck one beautiful morning enjoying nature and decided to spark a bowl of it. Minutes after sitting her down I felt an extreme uplifted feeling creep over my thoughts combing with a strong body relaxation that put me in a lock which was fine with me because the uplifted nature of my thoughts coupled with the relaxed body feel made we want to meditate which I did and booyy let me tell you was it a great meditation! The buzz seemed to elevate the meditation into a beautiful mindfulness of gratitude. An overall sense of well being accompanied by excellent pain relief was felt both with the mind and the body. I do not recommend this strain if you&#39;re trying to get anything constructive around the house done, definitely more of a wind down and read a book or a chill and get lost in thought type of strain.\u000a Flavor profile was quiet nice. Quiet pungent with a good amount of lemon wrapped into a light earthyness. Very smooth smoke with moderate lung expansion. Good for pain, cramping, stress and insomnia.

VDeadhead has very large structures and very dense bud structures done correctly I would say good bud treats anything done with mental and a little bit of pain and nervousness this is great if you feel like getting a lot of things done in one sitting without getting up every five seconds to check on something. This will dry out your mouth down your eyes but it&#39;s well worth it for the very focused and have the uplifting affects you will start to feel little bit relaxed as the Skokie at what are you textures take you to another horrible place I looked at hand and I don&#39;t think I would choose another strain ever to accompany Me on a desert island.

VHonestly, one of the better strains I&#39;ve come across in a while. It&#39;s kind of like taking an escalator. Very gradual on your way up and down but at the peak, it&#39;s highly euphoric. I enjoy the way it smokes as well. The high is a lasting one and when it&#39;s over with, you&#39;re just sort of zoned out and sleepy. Helps with insomnia for sure and the euphoric feeling it peaks with helps a lot with anxiety and stress. Excellent strain!

I sat down on the couch had a couple tokes, Out like a light. But I slept like a baby. And my back pain had subsided. So my recommendation  when smoking Deadhead OG I, Be out and about and DO NOT! I Repeat  DO NOT SIT DOWN!\u000a P.S. I gave it only 4 stars because, if your not careful you could sleep your whole day away. Unless your into that sort of thing.

V Absolutely one of the best stains I&#39;ve had the luxury of trying. Nugs are super dense and give off an underwhelming smell of skunk and lemon. Don&#39;t let that fool you, the high has a very quick and fully encompassing onset. After grinding the smell is more noticeable and lingers for longer. Even through the cut I received wasn&#39;t anything special in terms of looks it still had the ability to wreck me completely, high lasted for 8 hours and relaxed me enough to fall asleep. I would not recommend smoking this before work or right before you plan on sleeping.  The only regret I have about this strain is that I didn&#39;t have more of it &#128514;

It smells kinda dank &amp; earthy, but in a good way. The smoke is smooth. An early morning moring bowl of Deadhead with a strong cup of coffee is a great way to start the day! I&#39;ll get it again for sure!

VI get all the Indica effects of this one. Total relaxation with a very heavy body buzz, don&#39;t put you to sleep but really kicks you back. It is cerebral enough to get the thoughts going which may be the only sativa effect I really notice. \u000a Definitely a &quot;put you in the zone&quot; type of strain. I was sitting on my back deck one beautiful morning enjoying nature and decided to spark a bowl of it. Minutes after sitting her down I felt an extreme uplifted feeling creep over my thoughts combing with a strong body relaxation that put me in a lock which was fine with me because the uplifted nature of my thoughts coupled with the relaxed body feel made we want to meditate which I did and booyy let me tell you was it a great meditation! The buzz seemed to elevate the meditation into a beautiful mindfulness of gratitude. An overall sense of well being accompanied by excellent pain relief was felt both with the mind and the body. I do not recommend this strain if you&#39;re trying to get anything constructive around the house done, definitely more of a wind down and read a book or a chill and get lost in thought type of strain.\u000a Flavor profile was quiet nice. Quiet pungent with a good amount of lemon wrapped into a light earthyness. Very smooth smoke with moderate lung expansion. Good for pain, cramping, stress and insomnia.

VSolid four star strain. It gives you that classic stoney-bologna high you\u2019re looking for sometimes. An immediate body stone shortly followed by a cerebral high that\u2019ll make you enjoy audio and visual things more. Now personally I give it a 4/5 because of two reasons. 1) I\u2019ve had better strains for that \u201cstoney-bologna\u201d high and 2) the taste is straight gas, and not in the \u201cbro this is straight fire chronic\u201d way. It taste like literal gasoline, and believe me I got it from a very respected grower in my area of california (209). I got it in badder form, took a dab, and hesitated to take any more. Idk if I\u2019ll even use the rest... probably will, but man it taste worse than butt. And I\u2019d know.

All in all, the value was there as it wasn&#39;t top shelf pricing and made for a great transition strain when moving from GC early in the day to Bl Dream in the evening.

VA solid stress reliever nice dense buds from RX Really gave me a nice buzz definitely nice to create something new if your the creative type nice chill-out just makes you want to enjoy life more.\u000aThe taste is very musky with hints of dried herbs the kinds of herbs found in typically fruity textures as well. Kind of an interesting taste leaves your mouth dry so your going to need flax milk or water to chill you out. Plan out your week in a casual mood and go with the flow. I think If I can create nice meditation music there are some other interesting things I am sure you can come up with. \u000aAn overall B+ the taste is what killed it for me.

The high started as a good creative high then transitioned into a relaxing body high that nearly made me fall asleep.

VVery dense structure looks like a rounded edge about the size of jumbo tootsie rolls. Medium Light green leafs and rich orange hairs. The vape is very pungent and earthy tones with a skunky texture and taste. I adore deadhead for its concentration and focus great when you gotta final exam and need to concentrate. It&#39;s a hybrid so you&#39;re getting the both of the best worlds a body high and head high. For my effects cannabis has the opposing effects Indica&#39;s give me energy and sativa&#39;s make me tired and sleepy. If you have a hard time concentrating this great for that and pain.\u000aI got this batch from high desert relief here in ABQ, its some of THE most Dank Medicine and its treating me as if I were back to normal before those dark depressions and turmoil in high school, its my Elders who teach me how to heal. As well as adapt and not to be hard nosed medicine like this ganja is very potent and powerful.

VI admit, I&#39;m not well versed with Grateful Dead&#39;s music...but I imagine Bob and the late Jerry would really enjoy this strain!  I would say that the &quot;Chemdawg &#39;91&#39;s&quot; influence in the &quot;Deadhead&quot; is hella pronounced!  How can I put it?  When I initially hit it, I taste the Chem &#39;91 in a big way.  Then all of a sudden, the SFV OG&#39;s earthy, &quot;fuelly funk&quot; flavor creeps in on the exhale which comes with that expansion OGs are known for!  Chemdawg &#39;91, by itself, is no slouch...don&#39;t get me wrong.  But when the influence of an OG comes into play, look what it done did!  It just made cannabis even more &quot;awesomer!&quot; For stress/anxiety relief and minor pain relief, I feel &quot;Deadhead OG&quot; does that!  Cop yourself some

VLoved it, very deadhead like. Very earthy, and even a brownish green, like dirt. Smoked amazing, taste amazing. Very inspirational high, I found myself starring off out the window lost in thought much of the afternoon. So get all heady and support a local dispenceray!

VDead Head OG has a mixture flavor I&#39;ve never tried before, but like it. =) It helps me rest, as long as I take it at night without mixing with sativa, it helps relax my muscles, increases creativity thought, and helps me focus. I believe it would make good brownies.

Vonly reason i can&#39;t give it a 10, is because it was $20 a gram, and it made me a little paranoid at one point that i was going to have go to the hospital [combined with some other substances i had taken, i was just a wee bit concerned that night]... tastes and smells phenomenal &amp; is a great choice of hybrid when you want a heady effect with the body stone in tow.

VThe initial euphoric rush I received from a bowl of this strain was outstanding. It&#39;s sativa heavy heritage is clear after several minutes. Definitely worth a try.

VVery similar to diesel strains. Daytime med for the most part. Excellent pine taste. The bud I received looked a lot like AK-47, however the stone was energetic.

VI got my paws on this one time and have been wanting more ever since. Super potent. Very energetic and happy feelings came to life when I smoked this. If you can get some, you&#39;ll be a very happy camper.
