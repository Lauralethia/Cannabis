VOne of the few strains that carries no anxiety and no feeling of being unconnected/uncoordinated for me. Great for inward looking, a little energy, and for pleasant body feeling. Low doses are enjoyable that way, with higher doses leading to more sleepiness and more inward looking. Great for music or some videos.

VGrape Kush is definitely a good strain with dark buds that have a nice white frosty coating. this strain gets you heavy in the eyes and makes you just relax. Definitely good for a lazy day, but be ready with munchies because this strain will make you eat non stop. It smells amazing and has a great flavor. It takes a few moments to kick in, but when it does it&#39;s a hard hitter. definitely one of my go to strains.

I feel my stomach relax and finally take a chill pill &#128138; I feel my mind becoming a zen zone. Perfect explanation of this strain is ZEN. YOU WILL ACHIEVE IT! If not my bad but I sure have. Moxie has never let me down. Wether the carts or concentrates I have loved them all. They are potent and last a while. I\u2019ve tried the viper city og from moxie before but I like it even better this time somehow &#128541; wow its even 1% lower thc this time but I feel Grrreeeaaat (tony the tiger &#128047;) \u000a.\u000a.\u000aAmazing for anxiety and mental relaxation and slight to moderate mood elevation as well as heavy physical relaxation but it\u2019s a nice heavy \u2764\ufe0f I was only able to get two but I would have loved to get a lot more of the Viper City OG Shatter as it\u2019s a fun + medicating ride &#127906; Which is hard to find I usually have found it\u2019s one or the other for me.

VBeautiful  coloration on the leaves toward the end of the lifecycle. It has very long and reaching fan leaves that change position depending on the light source. Some of the flower grows in tight clusters along the stalks with lots of sugar leaf surrounding it.  Overall, it is relatively short in height when fully grown. The  density of the buds is very tight and lacks elasticity if squeezed.  The aroma is very pleasant. It has a somewhat pine or citrusy high note, but overall, almost smells like banana bread when cured. Very, very sticky, but not sure of the THC content. It does not take much to get a good high which is primarily a relaxing experience.  It is a mid, top-shelf strain in my opinion.

VHonest review, I had a headache after smoking this strain. Probably because of the amazing head rush I got from it. And as for the body high aspect of it, felt like my skin was made of feathers. Needless to say, I slept better than I have in a while. The headache might just be me, but I would most definitely recommend this strain to everyone I know battling depression or anxiety.

VDelicious tasting heavy indica body buzz with a very uplifting sativa accent. I prefer indicas but this hybrid ins unbelievable. I have GAD and this completely eliminates my anxiety and restlessness. The strains I vape regularly for my anxiety tend to relax me but put me straight to bed with a slow &quot;downer&quot; vibe. This however relaxes the body and mind but puts a warm smile on your face and keeps you uplifted so  you could enjoy some music and explore all your heightened senses. This may be my new &quot;feel good and chill out&quot; strain.

VThis oil is super dupper good!!! Awsome smell , the taste is soooo sweet and flavorful . Whatever you see in description , is what you will get . The high is great and uplift , last long enough . If you dont want the indica side to kick in , just dab another great hit when you feel it start to go down , otherwise once the indica is in , you feel quite lazy . For me , no red eyes . Only downside about this oil is the price , could be a bit cheaper I guess and the syringe , can&#39;t scoop out the rest of this sweet oil , had to cut it in half .... what?? My religion dont allow me to waste any drop of sweet oil like this ! Lol
