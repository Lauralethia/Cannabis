VIn the old days of clandestine growing, people found many strains to be unsuitable for stealthy indoor grows. Sativa strains were too large and took too long, while many indica strains smelled too strongly to go unnoticed. Enter the Pacific Northwest Hash Plant, a compact, quick-flowering, low-odor plant that still delivers large yields and tons of resin. Archive Seed Bank crossed this plant with their favorite male, the Face Off OG backcross, to create Hashbar OG, a 70% indica-dominant hybrid that generates THC levels between 20% and 24%. While the smell of this strain is light, it still delivers a nice OG flavor when smoked.

VIncredibly strong body high definitely keeps me up but on the couch. Highly recommend for people with anxiety or nausea. It\u2019s amazing in a Russian Cream Backwood!

It&#39;s definitely make my feel chilled out and relaxed, focused (clearly because I&#39;m actually using punctuation for once :P) I&#39;m feeling good peeps! I&#39;m thinking i&#39;ll finally fall asleep soon. I&#39;m picturing smoking this durgin the a nice summer night just chilling by the fire with my friends. I&#39;m about it!\u000aLater MyBuds,\u000a-S

VI was looking for something to help with insomnia, anxiety, and had painkilling properties, and this seems to fit the bill. The physical effects are pronounced - I can feel it behind my eyes and throughout my body, while remaining 100% lucid and clear-headed. It feels like being wrapped up in a warm blanket and having someone whispering to you that everything will be a-ok. It helps me fall asleep but doesn\u2019t keep me asleep, and I find that the effect diminishes after about two hours. Flavor and smell are great (through a vape at least).
