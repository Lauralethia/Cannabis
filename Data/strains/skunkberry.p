VThis strain is amazing for keeping you in that happy median, utilizing the terpenes for a nice relaxing high with the Blueberry and then that gasey undertone to raise your cognoscente being from Skunk, this hybrid will keep you from building too much of a tolerance. Hybrids are great for this effect as your body will become complacent with the effects from a straight indica or a straight sativa. Remember variety is the spice of life!

V&#129344;&#129472; Skunkberry is quite possibly the most appropriately named strain ever. It smells exactly like it&#39;s name. Perfect mix of &#39;skunk&#39; and &#39;berry&#39;. This delicious hybrid offers a very uplifting and relaxing effects. Smooth on the inhale, this strain is an all around treat. This strain will not ruin your day by any means, but will allow you to coast on cruise control all day with a smile on your face. I love this strain and as a massive fan of anything skunky or cheesy, this is quickly becoming on of my favorites! Greenway Medical did a fine job with this one.\u000a b-Caryophyllene: 1.264 mg/g, b-Myrcene: 4.679 mg/g, Limonene: 0.312 mg/g, Linalool: 0.872 mg/g.

VAMAZING SCENT AND TERP PROFILE. My review is based on the Skunkberry flower. The name matches the taste just as well as it does the pungent smell. Other fruit strands fall WAY short of Skunkberry, as it truely delivers the flavors and aroma suggested by the name, but in a potency unexpected by the user. I usually dont do reviews but this strain has inspired me and I am proud to call it my new favorite.

VSo my lovely wife and I made a recent trip to Vegas and one of our first stops was Essence Dispensary. We were looking for a couple indica leaning prerolls to sample during our week-long stay and Michelle recommended this as well as King Louis VIII.\u000aWe took her advise and went with her recommendations. Our King Louis VIII review will come at a later date.\u000aThe aroma from the Skunkberry was just as one would imagine...it was pretty stout and boasted of good things to come. It was loud but not as over-powering as the Lemon Skunk we&#39;ve sampled. You could tell it was going to be a bit sweet tasting just from inhaling the unlit preroll. True to form, when we lit up it had a distinct sweet taste. We both took 4 decent rips, which is all either of us really needed at over 20% thc level. Our Skunkberry was cured almost to perfection The draw was extremely smooth and the burn turned to a nice white ash. Shortly after our 4th hits, we both felt an immediate rush to the brain which had us a bit giggly. A little bit later a very chill body buzz snuck in and had us both floating. When we dropped off to sleep...neither of us hardly moved during the night...a definite winner for a great night&#39;s sleep. Skunkberry would be a solid choice if you find it on the shelves of your local dispensary.

VHands down, one of my favorite strains.  Every visit to Jardin includes an 1/8th of this as long as it is available.  NC makes the one I vape and the berry is strong with the force in this one.  Rare out of my volcano this one hits almost immediately at 375 and I just stick to that through 4-5 easy bags.  On the first bag you feel heavy body sensations, tingling and euphoric giddiness.  Heavy skunk background on the first couple bags but all the while and unnoticed the blueberry pheno is creeping up and then it lands.  I love everything with the berry pheno, I go for any originals and hybrids I can find and this is one of the best I have gone through even pure blueberry.  That skunk background is what adds the final awesomeness of this strain.

VThe fruity stank on this bud is one of the very first noticeable characteristics you will encounter, and may even be the reason for choosing this strain. Skunkberry is very inquisitive as it tends to bring out your inner astrologer with a creative head high that can be very enlightening. With that being said, I do believe this same head high can have opposite negative effects for those who may be depressed or just genuinely sad, as it does get your thoughts going. For the occasional smoker, the body high that follows may include a good relaxing nap. This is a good chill hybrid that is very enjoyable to smoke and experience, with a perfectly timed high that is truly satisfying. Berry never skunk so good!

The Blueberry makes you nice and calm and relaxed, as the Skunk gets you happy, slightly euphoric and uplifted! Great strain all around!! The best places to get it in Denver, Colorado is Mile High Green Cross =$40 1/8, Lightshade= $36 1/8, MHGC is slightly better, but slightly more expensive, this strain is worth the price though!!!
