VIt&#39;s been a few years since I grew this strain but I&#39;ll try and fill in the blanks from what I remember. Grew in 5 gallon pot with FoxFarms Happy Frog, Ocean Forest ,Budswell guano mix, added perlite and some of the FoxFarms beastie Bloom at the end. Was a breeze to grow this way(beginner friendly) I don&#39;t remember having to super crop or bend it so not a lot of room needed. The finished product was some really tropical melon to grape smelling dankness. I remember loving the smell n high a lot but didn&#39;t clone (stupid on my part) and had just 2 plants. only vegged 12-15 days so yields were modest( most likely my fault) I wanna say it was more Indica than Sativa but can&#39;t remember enough to give a accurate answer here. Breeder of this strain is Dr. Underground who uses some top notch genetics and makes some Dank feminized only &#128527; strains. I would grow it again it&#39;s in my journal of good strains feminized I&#39;d like to try again. The 2 pack of seeds I bought both pheno&#39;s weren&#39;t tall but not short either. Bud structure was very dense and the buds had good bag appeal if your into pretty looking flowers. Sorry I&#39;m all over the place with this review I&#39;m thinking back and remembering the characteristics as I&#39;m typing. Was a pretty strong medicine for pain and decent mood enhancer and a slight sleepy comedown also but not overpowering if not over indulged. The genetics I think are:  Ed Rosethal&#39;s Super bud by sense seeds and a bubblegum cut from serious seeds co. Don&#39;t quote me on that though look it up (probably on the strains lineage here) if you care which genetics were used. Can&#39;t give it more than 4 stars that&#39;s reserved for strains I don&#39;t need to think back to remember however this strain definitely deserves a 4/5 star. Oh also remember they were very uniform and really easy to trim lol that&#39;s about all I remember. If u see it try it u shouldn&#39;t be disappointed but some growers can disappoint the finest genetics trying to make a profit. I would try all strains a a few times from different dispensaries if not impressed at 1st. Hope this scattered long review helps someone. \u270c\ufe0f

VAn okay sativa strain, amazingly sweet taste, aromas of sweet citrus, burns well, smooth smoke. Has a mellow spacey head high with a light underwhelming body high. If you are looking for something that tastes good this is a good strain, other than that there are better more effective strains around.

VWow what a pleasant suprise is this weed!! Great smooth REAL melon flavour, as a flower and when smoked. Ideal for couchsurfing. Outstanding mix of every aspect good weed needs in my opinion; calming, relaxing, moodbooster, with a nice indica punch for the bodyrelaxation. I have to admit I&#39;m not even a bit of a Bubblegum-fan, most of the time it has a bit of a sharp and dry, unpleasant smoke is my experience, and trust me I tried a few . This is the twist Bubbles needed, makes it way smoother and with a much nicer indica twist!!

Vperfect strain for me in terms of everything. from the way it grows, to how it looks and smokes. grows like an indica plant with uniform branching from seed. fluffy but solid buds which are light green and give bag appeal. she smells like a strawberry I have but fruitier when opened up. the smoke is smooth and tastes like she smells. sweet and warm, earthy like, my cough still tastes like it. I get that warm feeling from the indica set in and become engulfed in relaxation as I sink into my seat. but don&#39;t get too relaxed as the saliva will kick in. hence this long essay. I love body and mind and this gets a 5star

VThe name of the strain I got was &quot;Naked Melons&quot; by Urban Farms, but the parents seem to be the same as Melon Gum. I love the scent of this strain, very fruity and pleasant. I vaped herb at 350F, took 4 long draws and held my breath each time. Got a very light tingle around the edges of my body, went to bed and saw some colors and patterns that I typically get with an indica dominant strain. Definitely cranked up the horny knob! Not much of a body high, or even really a head high, but loved what it did for libido. Would probably be similar to Blue Dream in a social environment, but maybe more toward the relaxed side.\u000a\u000aA week ago when I tried it, had a similar experience, but also got dry eyes and mouth. That didn&#39;t happen this time.

VI actually got a slight mix on this strain; I picked up some *Sour* Melon Gum but OH MY GOD this strain is everything I was hoping for. Gets you just good enough with a mellow body high but not enough to couch lock you. Then it comes in with a second wave but this time cerebral. This strain would be good for just about anything. Great for anything from watching a movie to cleaning your entire house. I would recommend this strain to just about anyone. Stay high!
