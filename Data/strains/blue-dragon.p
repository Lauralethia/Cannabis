VI have been searching hard, and fruitlessly, for something that will make me giggle like I used to when I first smoked, when I was about 15, and I am a loooooooong way past that, now! So I read reviews, combine them with what I know about me, and how strains affect me. I have the basics down for other desired effects and know which strains work for me, but not a thing was having the effect I wanted, in this one particular way. \u000a\u000aThe staff and I had a chat  as you do, and I said what I was looking for, and he said &quot;Let me know if you find it&quot;. So I&#39;ll be letting him know!\u000a\u000aTwo bong hits, and I watched some lifetime tv crap, and laughed like I used to when I was 15 and first smoked. I never knew how hilarious it is!\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s pretty heavy as far as a body hit, for me, and definitely, I would say, this is &quot;strong&quot;, but that&#39;s hard to gauge as people respond differently to things. \u000a\u000aIn the shop, the guy and I were chatting and he said that this is a smoke I should wait to try until after I have &quot;finished&quot; my day. So that&#39;s what I did. I made sure I had done the dishes, and all the things I know I will not do unless I am smoking one of my favorite &quot;busy&quot; strains. And that was the right thing to do. After smoking two pretty decent bong rips I can tell you, I am not going anywhere; I am not doing ANYTHING! There is zero chance that I will do anything that resembles physical exercise, smoking this. Definitely NOT a hit-the-gym, focused and energetic strain.\u000a\u000aI  am finding that there are a few effects that I don&#39;t like much, but will absolutely tolerate for the giggles value. It is causing my shoulder and neck and jaw muscles to tense, and I&#39;m feeling a bit cold. Some strains have this effect. It&#39;s not intolerable, an d if I&#39;m paying attention to something else I don&#39;t notice it much, but it is noticeable. I am not finding that it is a munchie-trigger, thankfully! It seems to help a little bit with pain. I have chronic pain and not a single strain I have ever smoked has made any difference. Nothing works. With this, the pain is there but I can test and I do find that the pain is decreased by one half-point. I&#39;ll take it! The pain relief, welcome as it is, will allow me to go to sleep, but not be relived of pain AND be awake and energetic or motivated enough to DO anything, pain-free, so I still need to find a &quot;day time, awake and working&quot; strain for me, that makes a difference to my pain. \u000a\u000aI intend to go back and get some more of this tomorrow! I definitely want to have some around. This effect was hard to find, and if it weren&#39;t for the tension effect, I&#39;d stop looking.

VA very happy high, great for depression. After a single bowl in one night, I felt the effects of its stress revealing poweress. For two days my depression seemed cured, and I spent those days sober.\u000a\u000aa much harsher than expected smoke, with a very subtle blueberry hint. It hits hard with an amazing head-rush which in turn creates a happy, talkative high.

People don&#39;t appreciate how wonderful average is. You don&#39;t always have to have the number one strain to be satisfied. This strain is solid and will always give you a guaranteed fun time.

I&#39;m always suspecting of staff recommendations, I take it as &quot;Hey we need to get rid of this strain, let&#39;s recommend it to the clients&quot;.\u000aAnyways, I find this didn&#39;t do much for me. I&#39;m a moderate smoker, usually every several times a week and even then  I only smoke 1/3 of a small joint, so tolerance isn&#39;t the issue. I wish I could write a more in-dept review, but honestly found nothing stuck out to me, good or bad. It&#39;s like being plain old high without any particular effects. Sure, I&#39;m relaxed, a bit more uplifted, but not much else. Maybe this would be good for beginner with anxety since the effects aren&#39;t too extreme.\u000aPerhaps the crossbred of these two strains conflicts with each other. Oh well. Disappointed.

VThe best high CBD strain I have tried.  I got some Blue Dragon Desert Frost CO2 cartridge from Electric Lettuce recently.  It kicked my depression, anxiety, and PMDD (PMS on steroids) in the arse.  \u000a\u000aI can have several vape sessions throughout the day and continue to have a clear head so I can work and function w/o it affecting my abilities.  You get an amazing body high from this strain!  Hard to beat that feeling.  I typically go for the pain reducing and/or sleep inducing strains.  The taste is ok... it isn\u2019t a favorite of mine.  The one thing I dislike is the trace scent it left behind after vaping it.  It honestly smells like urine to me.  Not sure why since it has a sweet fruity taste.\u000a\u000aDefinitely will be stocking up on this one and using it a lot medicinally throughout the day when I need it.

VThis strain taught me the difference between sativa and sativa-dominant hybrids. Also made no doubt that my chronic pain responds to sativas, not indicas. The body high is concentrated around behind my eyes and like a stone in my stomach (but my stomach is quiet, no upset stomach here). Good strain, but the Sour Diesel component doesn&#39;t do much for me, I guess (or should I try Sour Diesel directly?)

Not too heady for me and didn&#39;t make me feel tired, I felt relaxed, comfortable. Normally I go sativa to avoid the laziness that ensues, but I bet this would be a good kick-back Sunday strain with the fam. Quick cotton mouth but clear headed and enjoyable. This is my first time trying it and I think I might have to keep it on hand!

The way the high creeps up is insane hit me like a brick wall! Hardly had to smoke much to be completely faded out of my mind &#128514;!! Definitly recommend this strain 9/10

VVery solid. No body understands the meaning of average anymore. This strain is very average which is great. I wish I could rate 1-10 because this is a solid 7. People don&#39;t appreciate how wonderful average is. You don&#39;t always have to have the number one strain to be satisfied. This strain is solid and will always give you a guaranteed fun time. If you have any doubts about blue dragon then just go for it. I promise it will rock your socks off\u000a                                         -Doctor\u000a

VWell, not every strain can be a hit, unfortunately. I&#39;m always suspecting of staff recommendations, I take it as &quot;Hey we need to get rid of this strain, let&#39;s recommend it to the clients&quot;.\u000aAnyways, I find this didn&#39;t do much for me. I&#39;m a moderate smoker, usually every several times a week and even then  I only smoke 1/3 of a small joint, so tolerance isn&#39;t the issue. I wish I could write a more in-dept review, but honestly found nothing stuck out to me, good or bad. It&#39;s like being plain old high without any particular effects. Sure, I&#39;m relaxed, a bit more uplifted, but not much else. Maybe this would be good for beginner with anxety since the effects aren&#39;t too extreme.\u000aPerhaps the crossbred of these two strains conflicts with each other. Oh well. Disappointed.

VThe best high CBD strain I have tried.  I got some Blue Dragon Desert Frost CO2 cartridge from Electric Lettuce recently.  It kicked my depression, anxiety, and PMDD (PMS on steroids) in the arse.  \u000a\u000aI can have several vape sessions throughout the day and continue to have a clear head so I can work and function w/o it affecting my abilities.  You get an amazing body high from this strain!  Hard to beat that feeling.  I typically go for the pain reducing and/or sleep inducing strains.  The taste is ok... it isn\u2019t a favorite of mine.  The one thing I dislike is the trace scent it left behind after vaping it.  It honestly smells like urine to me.  Not sure why since it has a sweet fruity taste.\u000a\u000aDefinitely will be stocking up on this one and using it a lot medicinally throughout the day when I need it.  Highly recommend this strain if you struggle with depression, anxiety, PTSD, PMS/PMDD or pain anywhere throughout your body!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VWanted to give it 3 1/2 stars but wouldn&#39;t let me. Definitely great looking, but I have a pretty high tolerance so I obviously like the high potency strains. This is medium potency to me, but good high. It&#39;s indica dominant but it felt more like a sativa to me.

VBlue dragon was way too rough for me. However my friends who used the bong though was rough for them as well, they enjoyed the high.

VWell, not every strain can be a hit, unfortunately. I&#39;m always suspecting of &quot;staff recommendations&quot; -- I take that as a &quot;Hey we need to get rid of this strain, let&#39;s recommend it to our clients&quot;. \u000aAnyways, I didn&#39;t find the effects to be all that much. This is coming from someone who smokes in moderate amounts, maybe several times during the week, and only 1/3 of a small joint, so there certainly isn&#39;t a tolerance issue. I wish I could give a more in-dept review, but honestly, nothing stuck out to me, good or bad. It&#39;s like being plain old high without any particular effects. Just feeling a little more lighter, at ease, but not much else. Perhaps the two strains that were used to breed Blue Dragon conflict with each other. Oh well. Disappointed.

VGetting ready to try this for the first time. Hope it&#39;s tasty. I&#39;ll leave my review after I smoke a full joint and update rating

V4 seconds after inhaling on a vapor genie , it was as if I walked into a clouded doctors office with that overpowering alcohol and medicine smell, then 30-45 minutes later a medicated, numb, super relaxed, bored, difficult to focus feeling came over me that lasted six hours with the pain still persistent at  4/10 versus before inhaling a pain level of 6/10. \u000a\u000aOn the second day I let the flower dissolve under my tongue and ate the rest and experienced a much more balanced focus and refined result, with a much better pain relieving benefit.

Vthis is by far the best strain ive ever smoked, the last time i smoked it, was 2 years ago and wow has it made an impression on me. it was 100% t.h.c. wich at the time rocked my world completely. Highly recomended but when i got it,it was like 80 to 90 just for a blunt, but soooo worth it. by now its probably went down as well as the quality but if you ever find a weed that says 100% t.h.c.  COP THAT SHIT NIQQA
