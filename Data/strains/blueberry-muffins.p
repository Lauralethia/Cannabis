VMy new favorite Indica!! Freshly ground, this Afghani/Blueberry blend does indeed give off the warm aroma of blueberry muffins. I recommend vaping this treat to enjoy the full flavor. The effects are fantastic! I&#39;m feelin&#39; incredibly groovy and totally chill, pain gone, stress......what stress were we talking about???? This bad boy isn&#39;t too popular yet, but look out it will be!

VThis particular weed is exactly what you&#39;d  expect from a strain that&#39;s called &quot;blueberry muffins&quot;. It&#39;s extremely potent and flavorful. The batch I purchased was light green with little specks of dark green and bright orange hairs. Overall a beautiful herb to look at. The flavor borders on minty and sweet dark berries, with some hints of pine. The high is sedating but not too sleepy. It&#39;s a good after work strain due it&#39;s powerful effects.

VFirst impression, unbelievable aroma of vanilla-scented, lemon zested blueberry muffins.  Not a straight berry smell, but juicy, slightly earthy, and bright.  A sniff alone is uplifting, and I&#39;ve found myself opening the jar to take a snoot just because it smells so damn good.\u000a\u000aInitial cerebral pop before transitioning into focused, calm, still-lucid ease.  For me this is a great working strain, though as time goes by the eyelids get a little indica-heavy.  I feel more at ease socially with this one, and I feel laugh-out-loud giggly and cheerful by myself too.  Not excessively introspective - and I am very sensitive to that.  Not too much sleepiness or couchlock.  Very functional, not a heavy stone for me at all, especially vaped on lower temperatures and keeping in mind that a little goes a long way.\u000a\u000aGood for: deadline anxiety, depression, daytime, productivity at home.

VI had an amazingly happy head high and my body was of course, relaxed and not in much pain. It was really an experience that I&#39;ve never had with another strain before; I had no inhibitions and my thoughts REALLY slowed down--something I&#39;m unfamiliar with. I was able to take off my shirt without feeling any sort of self-conscience feelings I may have had before. It made me unafraid to speak about all subjects freely and made me feel lighter and emptier: a box that has finally been emptied after years of crap sitting in it and weighing it down. Very relaxing. VERY freeing.

VI got a half gram of the blueberry muffin live resin shatter on Sunday from the bud tender Adam, and my whole experience was great- Having lived in California and having my medicinal card out there- I have been in and out of numerous clubs and Desert Rose has a real professional appearance from the inside out- the staff was friendly as well as helpful, informative and professional. They informed me all their products have been tested free and clear of all the bad stuff and that gets an A+ in my book. Back to the shatter - a real blue fruity aroma from the first smell and a good clean taste. I&#39;m a real heavy indica consumer for arthritis pain and this was a real nice mellow onset, and a nice calm head high - functional and fairly long lasting high yet strong enough to help rid my pain and not have me couch locked -I&#39;ll be back for sure

It&#39;s delicioius, tastes exactly like blueberry muffins, it makes me want to eat, it makes the pain dissappear to that back burner and I can still think clearly. I wouldn&#39;t want to go anywhere on this strain but it&#39;s a delightful after work, after labor, strain.

Next your mind and body become relaxed and you just want to chill and listen to music, watch tv or even have a fun conversation with someone. this feeling lasts for awhile and I could have been fine with napping or doing something fun. it helps with pain but this one is one I would do with friends and have a great time just hanging out.

VI&#39;ve been trying to find the perfect Indica that also has a fruity sweet taste, and this one is it for me. To start of the coloring of Blueberry Muffin is fantastic and beautify. Next is the sweet smell from opening to smoking to exhaling. Lastly is the euphoric and energetic state mixed with complete relaxation. It&#39;s a great high and taste. Love it!
