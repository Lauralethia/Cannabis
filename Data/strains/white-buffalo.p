VA prized rarity among cannabis.  Grown in NorCal, it&#39;s named after the White Buffalo Calf Woman, the spirit who visited the Lakota Native Americans and gave their tribe the seven sacred ceremonies which helped them become prosperous. Considered a very spiritual high hence the name, kind of spells like sleeping awake, or possibly spirit walking.  100/100 so rare and hard to find.

VWhite Buffalo ( aka: Tatanka) cannabis strain. White Buffalo&#39;s genetics stem from the parents of Big Bud and White Widow. Having acquired the greatest traits of her parents make this strain fairly strong with a THC level of 15 to 20%.  I received this strain from my grower.   It is a nice smooth vape. Taste is perfume-like and sweet.  Smooth inhale/exhale. If you do just a little you will feel mellow but functional. A little more and you will be out!  Great for my pain as it brings on some good body buzz, but it does not last as long as I would like; maybe 1-2 hours.  Good night time medication, or for when you have a few things to do around the house, but do not need to have acute focus. Like doing laundry, or dishes, washing the car... I would not expect to do much heavy physical labor as my muscles are pretty relaxed.

VWow. NEW FAVORITE. I&#39;m so glad my local courier (mellow -- for Oakland and the east bay, along with cosmic courier) gave me a heads up on the rarity of this. As a sativa-loving gal, this one is ideal! I was kicking it with a homegirl yesterday and she would never have known I was even high unless she saw me micro-dose a few hits every now and then. \u000a\u000a(I&#39;m a careful weed-imbiber, and take smaller hits along with plenty of CBD and edibles in small doses.)\u000a\u000aThis sacred buffalo (a symbol too powerful to ever be appropriated by anyone) allowed me to puff lightly for hours, have productive, meaningful talks, get WORK DONE (oh HELL YES) and feel good in my body until I fell into a wonderful, nourishing and restful sleep. Made me feel social AND also happy when I&#39;m by myself. WIN-WIN.\u000a\u000aMind stays clear and body feels GREAT (excellent to get you in the mood, whether you are solo or enjoying the company of another/others!). \u000a;)

VWow, just wow! Took a 3 day sober break, I hit it once from the bong. Started to feel high in minutes. Watched two people play Castle Crashers. I was zoned in, watching them play, I\u2019m like \u201cfuuuck I\u2019m actually too high\u201d. This strain probably the one to play video games with. I was stressing that morning and that bong hit the spot. It was like a first time high, Amazing strain. You must try it. All I did was watch and sit, I was that high. It uplifted my mood.

VWhite Buffalo is a very sweet, very powerful sativa. Faintly tastes like sweet and sour lemon cookies. Powerfully euphoric. It&#39;s like a strong cup of black tea. \u000a\u000aThe high of White Buffalo lasts for a very long time and starts off by giving a surge of energy. You can expect an increased heart rate and facial buzz (which can be alarming for people sensitive to their heart rate). It&#39;s wonderful for creativity and problem solving. It&#39;s also very good for doing meditative or repetitive tasks. \u000a\u000aThe high will transition into a very calming body buzz. It becomes a very effective anti-inflammatory. Intense emotions are relieved; it&#39;s really good for mood swings. \u000a\u000aEventually it will taper into intense, insomnia-crushing sleepiness. Sleep becomes very deep. Continued use of this however can lead to a bit of grogginess. \u000a\u000aThe high THC level dries your eyes and mouth out a bit so you will need to make sure to drink lots of water and have eye drops on hand.\u000a\u000aFollow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.

VThis strain is perfect for anxiety relief. It stopped my panic attack after about 5 minutes. I can&#39;t even get that fast relief with my prescribed medication. It&#39;s also got a nice calming feel to the overall experience without much drowsiness to speak of. I would definitely recommend this as a great day time med option.

VI&#39;m a casual smoker at best, however, I am aware the effects of different strains. All said it had been a couple of months since I last smoked so I went for a strong sativa so I could stay alert. First time smoking this I knew ahead of time to take it easy so I only pulled a &#39;2 hitter quitter&#39; approach. Whoops! Fell asleep. Second time I only took a small pull from my pipe and then an additional one about 10 min later to make sure I didn&#39;t make the same mistake as the first time. Perfect! There aren&#39;t many (if hardly any) casual at best reviewers so I figured I&#39;d throw my info in for the benefit of others like me.

VWhite buffalo has the signature slap you in the face feel of a strong sativa. It increases energy and happiness quickly. I found myself going through my small stash quickly because the effects didn\u2019t seem to last long. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of sweet and earthy skunk but it could never be a go to daily because of the short effect. 4/5

VThis was one of the first buds i purchased after explaining to the bud tender I was just getting back into this from a long hiatus. I was looking for something mellow. The first few times I hit this I was so stoned right away I just started cleaning my house and doing laundry in order to keep myself busy....and then got the munchies so bad I ate everything not bolted down. Next time I went to the gym as I needed to get rid of some of the energy and heart racing vibes. This definitely makes u speedy and tingly, not to mention full on red eye half open eyelid stoned look... Definitely not what I was looking for as a &quot;newbie&quot;, however, I&#39;m not one to give up. Smoked this several times since and it is pretty fun and stony if you let it take you there. I just smoked some of this at a costume party where i knew no one (except my husband) and laughed so hard I peed a little. At one point I can see this could turn on you if you don&#39;t go with the tingly racy vibes, but if you ease into it and just toke a little with some good friends you might laugh all night...just don&#39;t let those munchies get you, at that party I consumed everything from the cheese plate ( i think I ate a whole block of St. Andres), to cookies (at least 5), to in and out burgers (2 double doubles)...Solid strain, but for me, I have to be in the right mind set or it might turn on me, not for anyone sensitive to anxiety or paranoia. Small doses.

Usually I go towards those strains that wake you, calm anxiety and focus you.

VWonderful. If you feel groggy or foggy smoke White Buffalo. It&#39;s a fog lifter, anxiety melting; peace of mind finder. The best Sativa I&#39;ve had in a while. Good for clarity of expression. I suffer from PTSD. An experience last night required me to take xanax for the first time in many months. I felt so hung over, groggy, and anxious this morning until I smoked White Buffalo. It took the fog away. It took the anxiety away. It lifted my thoughts and helped me get through the day. At one point I needed to express feelings and I was able to do so with utmost clarity and presence. I have immediate respect for this strain. I&#39;m fortunate my dispensary carries it. I have severe ADD/ADHD and this is excellent for focus. I give it a very high score of 8.5 on the helpful for ADD/ADHD scale. I think this is going into my top 20 of all time. A+++++

VI love the white buffalo wax!  oh my how I love this.  what I don&#39;t love is, it&#39;s hard to find.  usually buy it at VHHC, but they&#39;ve been out.  my fave, now they don&#39;t have it. grrrrr.   toss some wax in a glass dish, use a nectar collector and your off to a really intense dreamy state!

VI hadn&#39;t yet tried WB so I was excited to pick it up @ Swell the other day. Nice dense bud structure just frosted all over with a sweet and diesel smell which I like. It&#39;s a great day time strain. Uplifting and Eurphoric and takes away some anxiety actually. Great wake n bake!

VSo I have been waking and baking with this guy for a week or so and I just can&#39;t really do that anymore. \u000a\u000aThis is a great late night pick me up but not for daily use for me personally. \u000a\u000aI enjoy the pick me up with a slight haze but I realized as the days went on I forgot more and more about what happened when I was smoking. Usually I go towards those strains that wake you, calm anxiety and focus you. This one made me question if I did something or not earlier in the day. \u000a\u000aSo great for once in a while but not my daily delight.

Even though this strain is extremely hard to stumble upon I would still suggest this strain to veterans or newbie smokers. I was quite lucky in finding this strain and I hope I can find it again one day.

V very good for depression. Instant mood stabilizer. Heavy relaxation but perfect to socialize on. A higher review mentioned telling beginners to be careful with this strain and that is true. This is very close to hash but if youre experienced with marijuana its totally manageable. Do not head to dinner on this if youve never smoked oil,keef,resin or any other kind of hash.. It may make you feel wiped out. If I could get this all the time to treat daytime anxiety/crush depressive mood/thoughts I would, other sativas are similar but this one is something special.

Yep I was hammered and it did keep creeping to higher states for about 45 more minutes. I really recommended the white buffalo strain for pain relief with the benefiting high that comes it brings to the table..
