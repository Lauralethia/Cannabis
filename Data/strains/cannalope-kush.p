VI\u2019m new to Cannabis and this was my very first trial of herb. I\u2019d had some hard candies and a couple of gummies but this was my first time smoking. My friend (a horticulturist for a local dispensary) gave me a bowl worth as I\u2019d read the reviews on Leafly and thought this would be a great strain for me. I\u2019m NOT a fan of swirly highs, being couch locked or even being drunk. I do though have pretty bad PTSD and panic attacks. I\u2019m looking for something to help smooth those out so I can deal with being in public without hyperventilating in my car. \u000aCannelope Kush sounded perfect. It really WAS NOT.\u000a\u000aI had one really good hit and a second kind of weak one. I very quickly felt like I had warm molasses pour down my head, shoulders and arms and then up the inside of my legs to all meet in the middle. That was pleasant enough, then it wasn\u2019t. I got tunnel vision, my vision turned pink; I saw psychedelic colors and felt like I was not here. Like I was throwing my voice and I was actually somewhere else and so was everyone else. I felt like I could take off my glasses and show him how odd everything looked because it was like a film or tv show. \u000a\u000aI also felt like I&#39;d been shot but all over my face and shoulders. The concussion, stinging pain and gasping breaths all hit me. It felt like I had wet balloons pushed onto my body and popped or I had a MASSIVE, blistery sunburn and someone slapped me on it with all their might all over my skin. \u000a\u000aI felt like someone had hit me in the mouth with a baseball bat and broke out my teeth. I don&#39;t know if you know that sort of wet crunch when your teeth get broken but it&#39;s EXACTLY what it felt like.\u000a\u000aThere was also the sensation of an epidural albeit a really weird one. It didn\u2019t stop the use of my legs but it felt like I had slipped on a burning bikini all round my bits and that my bladder and bowels were filled with fire. Like I was scrubbing my bits inside and out with summer hot beach sand. \u000a\u000aI have to say all of this was definitely a novel experience but one I NEVER want to experience again. It put me off slightly to having more herb but being able to not have fear when I leave the house is much more stressful than having a super weird reaction to one strain. There are almost 3,000 more and I\u2019m sure I will find something to fit my needs.

I felt like I was in a dream during the whole afternoon, amazing. thank god I managed to control myself and got all that stuff done. every time I exhale this herb I fill itching in my lungs and in a moment I&#39;m high AF. \u000a\u000aActive, strong head high with little drowsiness at the end.

VJust cracked open a fresh eighth of this Blue Sky Growers Cannalope Kush. At 30.5% I can&#39;t help but stick my face into the bag. It gives off a strong &amp; pungent citrusy pine smell and is quite pleasant. Very heavy and good looking stuff as well. Dark purplish flower with orange hairs. After the first couple milky hits off the bong I had a great high starting with my head, then going down throughout my body making me feel relaxed and happy.

VA really good strain that is good for just getting high. I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend this strain for health benefits, just for getting a fun, happy feeling high. It did make me slightly paranoid though. But most weed makes me paranoid. But over all, I love it! :)

Vgot work to do? drink a cup of coffee smoke a bowl of this n you might as well taken 20mg of adderall. the description says a woody flavor, when I smelled it I thought I was smelling a melon. this strain would be VERY useful too with people who have add/adhd

VKind of a middle-of-the-road strain in terms of effects. More of a head high, makes your eyes &amp; jaw feel relaxed or even heavy if you smoke a lot of it. The buds are dense, pretty &amp; it has a good smell, although I wouldn&#39;t call it distinctive. I didn&#39;t regret trying it.

Vthe smell of this bud is very special - tropical and exotic with strong presence of ganja. the effect is mostly clear-headed and lasts for decent amount of time. This is the type of buzz that allows me to lose myself in certain activity and enjoy it thoroughly. sex was amazing. also tried playing Chip and Dale 2 on Dandy and the game was surprisingly fun. HUGE resin production, fast flowering, uplifting high, good concentration -pleasure to grow and smoke. not too strong but strong enough. for me this strain is solid!

VThis is one funny strain.  Less is more.  A bit of a creeper but taken during the day, very functional BUT this is a giggler.  Things are hella funny.  And you&#39;ll think you are a comedian, and so will your friends.  Very fun when taken in small doses but taken with what I would consider a normal &quot;bowl&quot; it tends to act like most sativas and work on pain and being heady.  Great for exercise.
