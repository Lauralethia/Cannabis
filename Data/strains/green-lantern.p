VThis strain is wondrous. It&#39;s energetic, happy and uplifting while still providing a pain-free body numbing. I&#39;m very mentally alert and I can think faster than my fingers can type right now. This is my fifth attempt at writing this review...I accidently keep erasing it. One great time.

VSabor terroso, olor a bosque. Coloca unos 10 minutos despu&#233;s del primer golpe. Te tranquiliza pero te da un tipo de energ&#237;a m&#225;s enfocado en pensar, platicar, leer.

VI love, love, love this strain. Definitely for an &quot;on-the-go&quot; person like me. I love that it eases stress, the body high is AMAZING and it makes me cocentrate!!! \u000a\u000aDefinitely recommended for both chilling at home or when your out and about. But a heads up... this strain made me &quot;want&quot; to do stuff or be creative. So if you like the &quot;couch lock&quot; strains. This one ain&#39;t for you. \u000a\u000aThe smell is strong, but the toke is smooth. Very piney and citrusy smell and taste.\u000a\u000aOther than that ENJOY and TOKE ON!!!
