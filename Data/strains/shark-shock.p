VThe shark shock from High Level Health has 20% THC along with 17% CBD making it a very fun high.  This strain addresses any complaints you might have as far as muscle tightness and spasms along with pain management.  Unlike other CBD strains this strain has a high THC count providing the best of both worlds in one indica dominant puff.  Reccomended for anyone using cannabis for medical purposes, or those looking for a unique body high to acompany the buzz they are accustomed to.

VI have the CBD strain Shark Shock and I must say... I have been battling PTSD and Anxiety for a very long time and I recently started smoking Medical MJ and this strain has woke me up out of a living nightmare.\u000aits 9% CBD and 7% THC and I now smoke this every morning to relax and get me in the mood of actually living. My anxiety has shot way down and my rapid uncomfortable thoughts and memories have faded away to the point where I can actually enjoy the moment. I haven&#39;t felt this way since I was about 17/18 years old. I&#39;m 25 now and I almost cried when I realized I was so relaxed and focused. I&#39;m still getting use to not over thinking and not having anxiety constantly but every day I smoked this strain, things get better for me.  This high CBD strain is not for really getting super baked and more for medical purposes but if you take 3 good puffs of this you will feel pleasantly stoned and happy. It has a very earthy herbal taste. I recommend this strain for people who suffer from chronic pain, PTSD and anxiety. Or anyone who finds them self overthinking life all the time. this will straighten you right out. :)

VAfter 7 years of growing different strains from seed, I&#39;ve finally found my &quot;Calming weed&quot;. Ahh, let the stress of the day just melt away and relax your mind. It takes care of anxiety on contact while leaving you with just the right amount of cognitive capabilities. I just realized I smoked some before this review. I wonder if everybody else that writes these reviews are stoned out of their mind when they write? Well anyways, the bag appeal, smell, stickyness are all about average, but the effect is where its at. This is not your average weed, you will feel awesome and happy. If you are ever able to try this strain, please do yourself a favor and smoke the shit out of it. It&#39;s a game changer!

VMost excellent at making pain more bearable!\u000a\u000aThis strain tastes ok, but the high is where it&#39;s at. It is high CBD, and therefor very relaxing. Mine measures consistently in the 12% - 14% range. This CBD makes you feel comfortable. It is calming and relaxing. That&#39;s the best feature of this good enough tasting weed, so be sure to take one hit of a Sativa strain. JUST ONE! This will make you more creative along with that relax, dude attitude. \u000a\u000aI like this one. I like a lot. This is how you say,&quot;body high&quot;, which is great for pain relief.

VVision becomes glowy and turns everything a bit soft, like your vision\u2019s slightly out of focus. Similar to that old film technique to soften women. Pleasurable, smile-inducing cheer that\u2019s somewhat too tempered by a streak of paranoia. The good is plentiful enough to mostly distract from it. Weighty on the head which lends to an extremely drifty headspace. Body is surprisingly normal and capable while head is floating in the fuzzed-out ether; serene and surprisingly clear headed for how wiped the brain feels. Hella mentally dissociated...swimming in lala-land while still remaining decently functional. Crazy psychadelia...every one of your senses zone the fuck out - to almost imperception. Trippy psychonaut stuff. Though, not very stable. Has an edge and best suited to more experienced adventurers. Things can get to be too much a little too easy. But fortunately, is so brain-wipey, it\u2019s rather easy to distract into a different train of thought.

VI have had shark shock in both flower and BHO recently and it has become my favorite strain. It does not have an amazing smell or taste, but the high is perfect for me and has excellent medical benefits. The BHO I had was 49.9% CBD and a THC contect of only 7%. The shark Shock really mellows me out, and I can puff tough w/ out ever having anxiety or paranoia. This is due to the CBD/THC properties obviously, but if you want a good strain that will do you rite w/out the negative effects, then this is for you. You can work, exercise, etc with this strain.

As someone who suffers from chronic bouts of optic neuritis, this is the one strain I can use where, with a little coffee to keep me from being too drowsy, I can function and go about my daily tasks without issue.

VJust picked this strain up from a local shop here in ashland Oregon ( House Of Leaves ) Never tried a cbd before. I packed a small bowl and only had two hits. Waited ten minutes to see exactly how the strain affects me and , as of now i feel very relaxed to the tee! No pain in my body what so ever!! I dont feel so high but i do feel kind of high like on a scale from 1-10 i&#39;d say im at a 2. But i do feel like if i laid down thats it!! Im knocked out. Needless to say it makes me feel really sleepy. But i would definitely buy this again especially for my long nights at work. This is a good strain from pain! Definitely worth the 30.00 an 8th

VYou&#39;ve read the description. This strain is perfect for those who hunt sharks during the day or night. These sharks may be depression, stress, panick attacks, and whatever it may be that keeps you underwater from feeling relaxed ready. This Great White devours all of them, making you feel a feeling you havent for awhile. Dont tell your friends if they feel stressed coz you&#39;re not. Hell, feeling relaxed at work is illegal right?

VI see some debate that claims one or another strain is or is not shark shock. I obtained some from Temescal Wellness in NH, as it was a suggested strain for my back pain and anxiety due to it&#39;s high CBD content.\u000a\u000aAppearance: nice compact, crystally buds with short hairs. Scent is more pine and earth, less skunk and lemon up front. Breaks down real nice into perfect consistency for tight packs and high surface area.\u000a\u000aSmoke: smoked out of Pax2 vape. Very smooth. Bright citrus and pine immediately upon exhaling. Does not get skunky or earthy as it lingers. Very pleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste which maintains the initial flavor.\u000a\u000aEffect: begins to take effect within 1-2 minutes. As it is CBD-rich, not stoney. Very subtle, mellow buzz comes on in a very friendly fashion, not too sudden. Excellent body buzz, left my muscles feeling free and easy. Not very heady but still some nice relaxing mood effects. Eyes felt very heavy and got me ready for bed. Back pain from herniated disc slowly eased into a much more comfortable place. Peak at about 1-1.5 hours, with lasting relaxation and pain relief well beyond that (I smoke it a couple/few hours before bed, so can&#39;t say exact length other than to say it lasts me into sleep and I fall asleep like a baby) \u000a\u000aOverall: this is an excellent choice for pain and anxiety. The bud itself and smoking experience are top notch in appearance, smell, flavor, and burn. I am considering using this strain pre-travel for airplane jitters and in a pinch if I&#39;m feeling particularly anxious, as the mental effect is a very calming and balancing one. Definitely excellent for pain relief. A great overall bud if you&#39;re looking to just mellow out and chill as opposed to get really stoned.

VI bought some from a strainwise dispensary, it looked and smelled grown correctly. I&#39;m a light eight with low tolerance, I suffer from severe anxiety and social anxiety(social phobia), and I smoke to try and relive that. \u000aThe CBD:THC RATIO was 8%CBD:4%THC. Even still the beginning high was too high and too intense for me after 20-30min when the high leveled out or bottomed out I was a very good and relaxing feeling. I will say compared to the 3-4 other HIGH CBD:LOW THC varieties I&#39;ve tried this gets a 5 on a scale of 1-10 from me but mostly kuz the begin of the high it too intense was agitates and worsens my already severe anxiety. I&#39;ll try it once more and if the effects are better I&#39;ll come back and update my review.\u000a\u000aP.s.- other CBD strains I tried were pennywise, Otto, ox, and halequin) Otto is my favorite so far

VMy favorite higher CBD strain so far.  The flower I picked up was %17 Cbd and %1 THC. It helps mellow out the THC effects in my higher THC strains. I get much better pain relief with this mixed with the higher THC strains. My favorite so far is 50/50 mix of this and Ace of Spades. This is also the best strain I have found to relieve inflammation. Well worth a try if you are looking for a higher Cbd strain.

VWhat a shocker. The berry scent from the white widow trumps any skunkieness or spice. Nice bud structure, super green &amp; frosty. When smoked traditionally I was hit with a fast acting head rush. This strain must be high in THC-V as well as CBD (1:2 cbd/thc). Very relaxed and calming effect. No couch lock, mildly sedating, pain &amp; stress killer. A very balanced cannabinoid profile with strong medisinal properties.  I cant wait to find this shark in a concentrated form.

VI adore the high I get from Shark Shock. It&#39;s so relaxing and is an easy-going experience in social settings. In small doses, I can still remain productive, but I would say it is best used in the evenings. The only downside, in my opinion, is massive munchies. But of course, this will be highly beneficial to those suffering from appetite loss.

VI picked some up to help me fight pain. I&#39;m always looking for the strains that give good pain relief. I toke a puff or two and got a nice cerebral high nothing too intense just nice, but what this strain did do was turn down the pain I deal with. I have stenosis in my neck and have several tears in my right shoulder rotator cuff and some epic bone spurs. I&#39;m feeling no pain, nice. I feel happy.  This strain does not act like an Indica for me. I taste a very earthy taste. The smell is of wood and earth.

VI originally wanted Mr. Nice Guy, but they were out and recommended this instead. Buds were big and beautiful with lots of frost and hairs. Really lushious consistency. The smell was awesome. Very blueberry and earthy and yummy! The smoke was thick and smooth, the taste somewhat mimicked the smell. The high was quick to hit and heavy on both the body and mind. I definitely got very stoned very quick. Not a great strain to be out in public on. Better for zoning out in an almost psychedelic state at home around animals. Really incredible body sensations if you can get yourself walking around. Spaced out &#128125;

VThe Shark Shock I got was exactly what the reviewer CaliforniaMedical wrote about.  It was a sativa not indica dominant hybrid.  It was nothing special to look at, nor was the faint lemon/pine taste all that great.  What makes Shark Shock so good is the intense psychedelic effects!  I&#39;ve never gotten a feeling from weed like that before.  The stairs to my apartment started to change shape right when I was peaking and happened to be walking upstairs, fun times.

Because I was in a social situation that frowned upon outright herbal inebriation, and because my shoulder was giving me a lot of trouble, I elected to go with the Shock. Nice flavor and smell. Not harsh at all. Forgot about the shoulder a couple hits in, and managed to watch a movie all the way through without bouncing up and down. NICE strain for time-to-relax time!

I was really looking for something that would help w my anxiety and not cause the panic and was put on to shark Shock! Man how pleased I am w this strain. I hit half a pre roll first and at first I felt like maybe a minor panic, racy heart was coming but then boom it went away just like that and I felt great after!! After the initial pre roll I smoked more with no issues at all and I could even hit some higher strains due to the CBD running through my body. I would def recommend to beginners or anyone coming back to pot!

Beautiful to smoke, vape or make oil with. I enjoy this on its own or mixed with a higher THC strain to get a little more of the cerebral high to compliment my body high.

VThis was my first ever cannabis and my first ever vape. I wanted something low THC because I was curious, but kind of nervous about how cannabis would affect me. I was also interested in having something around for occasional pain. A few inhales did not affect me at all, but about ten inhales (honestly, wimpy half-inhales) produced a numb feeling in my lips. That&#39;s it! No weird feelings. No negative side effects. I can definitely see how this would be helpful for pain, but it&#39;s pretty boring stuff. It was nice to get comfortable with the vape pen and just dip my toe in, so I&#39;m glad I tried it.

VI received this strain from my local cannabis delivery service, Lifted420 Health and Wellness in San Francisco. Very nice looking buds with a distinct W Widow aroma. Shark Shock has some W Widow in it&#39;s parentage , so we can see how the Widow bud aroma comes out in Shark Shock. Potency is outstanding and will ease your aches and pains in a very effective and safe manner. A day of stress at work or any situations which may bring on anxiety or social tension are all brought under control with Shark Shock. Good anytime smoke, though I do favor a late evening setting and before bedtime to get me the relaxed sleep the Shark provides.

VI used some of Shark Shock to stop some upset stomach issues.... it worked, but in an hour, my blood sugar dove, and I almost passed out. I had eaten just before smoking 1 puff of it. It took me all day to recoop from it. Don&#39;t think I will be using this strain anymore. (No, I don&#39;t have diabetes. I&#39;ve had my blood sugar drop before, but Never felt like I did after Shark Shock. Scared the Crapola out of me!)

VLooooooove this strain. The one that I picked up was 10% CBD and .1% THC. This is the first CBD heavy strain that I&#39;ve used. It was better than I thought. I didn&#39;t feel high at all, I just felt stress free, pain free, and happy. The flavor was very grapey, which was delightful. I&#39;m converted to cbd strains for daytime now. So, so great.
