Vits a sativa dominant hybrid (70% sativa/30% indica) strain that is a potent cross between the insanely popular Jack Herer X OG Kush strains. This insanely dank bud boasts a moderately high THC level ranging from 13-22% on average and a myriad of extremely potent sativa and indica effects. Jack OG has an aroma of sweet candy with a hint of pungent skunk and a taste of sweet vanilla candy with a floral skunk aftertaste upon exhale. Jack OG has small thick dense lime green and dark olive green nugs with reddish brown undertones and thick furry neon green hairs. These nugs are caked in a thick layer of crystal white trichomes and a fine layer of syrupy sweet resin. Jack OG is known for having two separate highs, one from its OG Kush parentage that leaves you feeling mellow and carefree, and the other from its Jack Herer parentage that leaves you clear-headed and productive. In addition, you&#39;ll be psychosomatically relieved and have an intense case of the munchies. Due to these effects, Jack OG is an ideal strain for treating anxiety disorders, depression, and chronic stress

VA rather pleasant high. Now that I&#39;ve smoked it a few times, I kinda like it&#39;s lazy effect - it&#39;s not enough to put me down, but it&#39;s enough to make me feel nice. Quite strong and very enjoyable, especially at night. If you can get your hands on this definitely try it.

VThis has better pain control with less of the high that he has experienced with all other high CBD flowers he&#39;s tried. \u000a\u000aHe had a headache at a 5, came down pretty quick to a 3 which is usual.  \u000a\u000aDoesn&#39;t seem anxious.  \u000aNot goofy like he&#39;s high.  \u000aSeems to be concentrating on movie. \u000a\u000aHe really likes it.

VYousa, hit it and it came on slowly, then pushed up and through to a higher state of a killer, but inventive buzz. Nosed dived into sleep at the tail end of the adventure. Very buzzy.

VVery good bud to smoke at the end of a hard day of work. Not very good for work, though.  You definitely feel a little bit lazier than usual. Visual high is amazing, and good for some last minute sketching before sleeping.

VJack Herer X OG Kush\u000a\u000aLove OG Jack.. Great golden-green flowers that smell like heaven and taste even better. I found this strain to be great for low budget smokers like myself. If I smoked alittle in the morning with coffee/tea, I got a great daytime boost that kept the pain at bay, but did not couchlock. At night, if I smoked a little bit more.. I&#39;d get relaxed and sleepy, sleeping the whole night. This strain, if used properly, I found, goes with what ever I need it to go. If I need to be awake it can allow that or if I need to sleep, it can do that for me as well.  I have a lot of trouble sleeping, more so now that I am weaning off opiates after 5 yrs, so I was very impressed with this strains ability to offer well deserved sleep as well as give me an appetite. Makes for a great &quot;Midnight Smoke&quot; as well, that always helps me fall back to sleep with its painkilling abilities. This is my ultimate favorite strain for its versatility, affordability, potency, opiate craving decrease, appetite stimulating and top notch cerebral and body affects. Just can&#39;t say enough, so happy I found this strain.. Did I mention this stuff smells and looks amazing as well? \u000a\u000a-Z

VThis was an alright hybrid (jack herrer x kush), but the high wasnt anything special. after smoking a blunt of this i had to sit down outside on my lawn, and i didnt realize until the end of the blunt i was sitting in a puddle of water as it had just rained. the high is more towards the indica end of the spectrum, yet the couch lock is not unbearable. being a sativa lover this did not appeal to me. jack kush is your average headies and nothing special. based on its parents and the iced out nugs i was expecting much more from this bud. im not sure if i would pick it up again if i ever came across it. maybe i&#39;ll have better luck with the lemon diesel im getting in a few hours.
