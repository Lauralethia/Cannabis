VThe first time i tried this strain out, i sampled a very mature, very amber hued collection of flowers. Very to extremely potent, being a veteran of more than 10 years, all i need is 1-3 pulls, and about the same if i vaporize, and i&#39;m quite heavily sedated. \u000a\u000aI now have a second batch, probably a good 2 weeks earlier, and much more vibrant looking, and far more piney smelling. Same characteristic heavily sedating smoke: this is not an herb you want to imbibe before doing something that requires the best or most energetic &quot;you&quot;, it&#39;s a hammerhead.\u000a\u000aThe nuggets are all very dense, and fill a vaporizor/bowl very quickly. The smoke is even more piney and pungent when smoked, and the high hits almost immediately, with a slight increase afterward. If i&#39;m not careful, i can easily get &quot;too high&quot; with this one. \u000a\u000aOne of my favorites so far, i wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s one of the best herbs i&#39;ve ever had, but it is extremely nice and i wouldn&#39;t shy away from it anyday.

VHonestly, I love a nice kush and since I hadn&#39;t had any recently, I decided I needed to pick some up and test it out!\u000a\u000a-Look: Nice light green and fuzzy buds.  From what I saw and received of the crop, I didn&#39;t notice any substantial amount of larf or small buds.\u000a\u000a-Smell: Earthy and citrusy with notes that remind me of a good diesel.  A light and upbeat scent with a hint of skunk.\u000a\u000a-Taste: A robust and woody front quickly dulls into a earthy and subtly woody after taste.  Mellow; definitely not intense.\u000a\u000a-Feeling: I definitely feel more creative.  I also feel more observant.  That being said, I would not recommend smoking this before getting completing tasks as it can be easy to become distracted.  On top of that, there is a mild euphoria in the background to keep everything positive.\u000a\u000a-Conclusion:  This would be some amazing bud if you have time to kill or if you are catching up with a loved one.  The smell and flavor are pleasant without being too overpowering.  While it isn&#39;t too potent, you can definitely feel it&#39;s effects.  I would recommend this if you have access to it!

VPungent Citrus a combo of many different citrus smells even grapefruit comes to mind small to medium buds about a bigger than a quarter. Light green on top...And dark green on the bottom never seen this before on a bud the hairs curl over every other leaf giving this a mountain look with all the different bumped up area&#39;s. Purple and black leaves cover a 1/3rd of this amazing bud. I am getting kind of a slowed down pace as I type this great relaxer. Smooth Vape and taste, getting kind of stonerish the eye&#39;s becoming dry and your mind wondering, do not recommend for any work this a great pain and relaxer. Any Pain and anxious symptoms knocks it a home run and everyone gets a free base. Love n peace take care y&#39;all!

VThe most effective flower I have ever found for headaches. I get terrible menstrual headaches that I have never been able to find any type of relief from. I have tried all the usual suspects, aspirin,tylenol,ibuprofen etc. I have even tried opiates like Percacet to no avail. Other cannabis strains have helped significantly,but not like Violator Kush. After smoking this flower, my headaches completely dissipated within about 2 minutes. I highly recommend this strain for patients who suffer from frequent headaches or body pain. A very numbing, relaxed high that will help you get a great night&#39;s sleep as well.

If I smoke the concentrate, I get too stoned, so I put it in capsules and swollow it. It takes longer to work, but the high is faaaabulous!

It is very hard to find a substitute and this crossing will cherish your liver like no any other strain. It&#39;s kind of pure protein MaryJane with the pungent earthy flavour you deserve.

VHonestly, I love a nice kush and since I hadn&#39;t had any recently, I decided I needed to pick some up and test it out!\u000a\u000a-Look: Nice light green and fuzzy buds.  From what I saw and received of the crop, I didn&#39;t notice any substantial amount of larf or small buds.\u000a\u000a-Smell: Earthy and citrusy with notes that remind me of a good diesel.  A light and upbeat scent with a hint of skunk.\u000a\u000a-Taste: A robust and woody front quickly dulls into a earthy and subtly woody after taste.  Mellow; definitely not intense.\u000a\u000a-Feeling: I definitely feel more creative.  I also feel more observant.  That being said, I would not recommend smoking this before getting completing tasks as it can be easy to become distracted.  On top of that, there is a mild euphoria in the background to keep everything positive.\u000a\u000a-Conclusion:  This would be some amazing bud if you have time to kill or if you are catching up with a loved one.  The smell and flavor are pleasant without being too overpowering.  While it isn&#39;t too potent, you can definitely feel it&#39;s effects.  I would recommend this if you have access to it!

I quite enjoyed couch sinking into a movie.  I also enjoyed the nice sleep I had after.  Munchies were there but not overly serious.\u000a\u000aThis is a great strain to pick up for chill activities.

VAbsolutely phenomenal. I usually prefer sativas/sativa hybrids but this is the best indica I have ever tried. It is very versatile, you can enjoy it for a deep sleep or a discussion with friends; it works wonders both during the day and during the night. Makes me super happy and curbs my anxiety. Depending on how much you smoke it could give you a nice light buzz or a very strong couch lock body high. Overall I recommend this for all types of smokers.

VHonestly, I love a nice kush and since I hadn&#39;t had any recently, I decided I needed to pick some up and test it out!\u000a\u000a-Look: Nice light green and fuzzy buds.  From what I saw and received of the crop, I didn&#39;t notice any substantial amount of larf or small buds.\u000a\u000a-Smell: Earthy and citrusy with notes that remind me of a good diesel.  A light and upbeat scent with a hint of skunk.\u000a\u000a-Taste: A robust and woody front quickly dulls into a earthy and subtly woody after taste.  Mellow; definitely not intense.\u000a\u000a-Feeling: I definitely feel more creative.  I also feel more observant.  That being said, I would not recommend smoking this before getting completing tasks as it can be easy to become distracted.  On top of that, there is a mild euphoria in the background to keep everything positive.\u000a\u000a-Conclusion:  This would be some amazing bud if you have time to kill or if you are catching up with a loved one.  The smell and flavor are pleasant without being too overpowering.  While it isn&#39;t too potent, you can definitely feel it&#39;s effects.  I would recommend this if you have access to it!

VVery immediate buzz and overwhleming at times - early on...After the first &quot;wave&quot; subsides, it&#39;s all good. But you might find this strain induces moments of paranoia / &quot;trippin&quot; aka as What a Rush!...I know it did with me but it&#39;s short-lived and manageable.\u000a\u000aWithout question, Violator is the best-smelling, best-tasting ganja out there. Pungent, spicy, full-bodied fragrance. And it tastes like it smells! Sooo good.\u000a\u000aDamn, if Hindu Kush and Malana (why no review of this strain on Leafly yet, by the way?) creates this powerful narcotic bouquet, I want to try some Malana too.\u000a\u000aTread carefully my friends, or you might feel violated LOL

VHad I been alone when I experienced the effects of this strain it would have been absolutely awesome. \u000aBut unfortunately I was with friends at the time and had things that had to be done. \u000aThis strain is very strong, especially for new users like myself. I was hypersensitive to everything going on in my body and had some intense muscle twitches that got worse when I moved. Everything felt slow and everything was interesting.\u000aAgain, would have been amazing had I not been with people and had shit to do. \u000aBut, I ended up moving too much and throwing up from all the sensations.\u000aSlept like a baby when I got home though.\u000aAll in all, don&#39;t move too much if youre hypersensitive and twitchy and dont expect to be able to talk properly or act normally. Then you&#39;ll be set.

VOne of the all-time GREATEST weed strains. I don\u2019t say this lightly, if you can get a hold of real, authentic Violator Kush then you absolutely owe it to yourself to purchase some of this truly god-like strain. Almost radioactive looking, the buds are a bright green with strongs hints of orange and yellow throughout. Definitely a hybrid and not a indica as listed here, the bud smells exactly like a true 50/50 with hints of forest and spices. One bowl or a couple tokes of the vape bag and you will be VIOLATED. 10/10. In my TOP 3.

I had surgery on my left knew years ago so I have metal in my knee . NO PRESCRIPTION  . BUT I picked this up through a bud and we&#39;ll this is some good bud!

I really enjoy that earthy, musty, heavy flavour that confirms you are smoking cannabis :) \u000a\u000aPungent in smell and smoke, with a powerful and relaxing buzz that I find manageable (no short-term rushes man). \u000a\u000aThe buds were fragrant, semi-sticky, the perfect density and a pleasure to prep &amp; smoke. \u000a\u000a(Purchased at Canada&#39;s Best Buds on Cavan St. in Nanaimo.

VA powerful indica ideal for night time use. This strain provides a great deal of relaxation and pain relief, as well as having mild appetite stimulating effects. It has a very pungent scent which fills the air with traces of pine and a mild sweet yet earthy scent. The taste consists of a sweet pine flavour, coupled with an underlying yet distinct earthy essence. A great choice for individuals looking for a reliable night time medication.

VLarge, medium-density buds. Light green and frosty throughout. Very sweet, spicy, earthy aroma. Tastes just like it smells but with a subtle citrus flavor. Great buzz. Alleviates pain and tension at the end of a long work day. Warning: you may not get up off the couch for a couple hours after smoking. This strain has a very pleasant, euphoric buzz for an indica, and leavers you fairly clear-headed.

From what I saw and received of the crop, I didn&#39;t notice any substantial amount of larf or small buds.\u000a\u000a-Smell: Earthy and citrusy with notes that remind me of a good diesel.  A light and upbeat scent with a hint of skunk.\u000a\u000a-Taste: A robust and woody front quickly dulls into a earthy and subtly woody after taste.

That being said, I would not recommend smoking this before getting completing tasks as it can be easy to become distracted.

VFantastic. Got an 1/8 from Canna Clinic on Broadview. $35 +tax. The CBD effects are strong, combined with a heady high that keeps elevating as time goes on. Feelings of euphoria to full body relaxation to couch lock and I&#39;m sure munchies will follow with a great sleep. I&#39;ve smoked 3 small bowls now and won&#39;t need anymore. Another thing should mention is had this for bout a week. Seems to get better with age/ a full cure. I would recommend to daily users. Novices beware.

Now. My rating is short.  And disappointing.  \u000a\u000aAppearance: beautiful. Coated in crystal. \u000a\u000a\u000aTaste description &quot;musty&quot;. Ok well if musty means moldy and horrible tasting, then it&#39;s bang on. It was the worst thing I&#39;ve ever tasted.  I couldn&#39;t even finish one bowl in my vape.  Made me gag.  Maybe I got crappy weed from the dispensary. Maybe it&#39;s just awful tasting.  But I can&#39;t judge the effects as I couldn&#39;t even finish one session. \u000a\u000aThe dispensary offered to take it back, and really provided great service, so I will not mention them here.  They did their job. \u000a\u000aHopefully it was bad choosing and not bad weed. \u000a

From what I saw and received of the crop, I didn&#39;t notice any substantial amount of larf or small buds.\u000a\u000a-Smell: Earthy and citrusy with notes that remind me of a good diesel.  A light and upbeat scent with a hint of skunk.\u000a\u000a-Taste: A robust and woody front quickly dulls into a earthy and subtly woody after taste.  Mellow; definitely not intense.\u000a\u000a-Feeling: I definitely feel more creative.  I also feel more observant.  That being said, I would not recommend smoking this before getting completing tasks as it can be easy to become distracted.  On top of that, there is a mild euphoria in the background to keep everything positive.\u000a\u000a-Conclusion:  This would be some amazing bud if you have time to kill or if you are catching up with a loved one.  The smell and flavor are pleasant without being too overpowering.  While it isn&#39;t too potent, you can definitely feel it&#39;s effects.  I would recommend this if you have access to it!
