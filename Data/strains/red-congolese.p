VThis strain is killer for morning smokes. I think it is more so if you&#39;re looking for a medical effect, like anxiety relief, nausea relief, etc. I find it really helpful for my anxiety in the mornings more than any other strain. It&#39;s really heady. Also, it makes you wanna munch out like crazy after. This strain is a must have for people fighting anxiety/ADHD in my opinion. :)

VI vaporized roughly 0.3 grams of Red Congo at 375 degrees in a DaVinci Ascent and I could not be more impressed by the all-star sativa. I found total relief of stress as clean euphoria and energy uplifted me. And the taste... perfect. I would even go as far as saying that Red C is one of the top sativa&#39;s I have tried in BC. Go pick some up and see what I&#39;m talking about. Medical grade smoke. 5/5

VMarijuana like any other medications can not make the physical or mental problems go away. Sometimes the best you can do is manage it as well as possible. I was in San Francisco and I grabbed some Marshmallows with this strain. These were small batch candies that were delicious. I don&#39;t like Sativas at all .. well I though this was an indica when I bought it. I was having a horrible time. I went to go make peace with a family member and it did not work. So I tried to enjoy the city for what is has. Walking, lifting, sitting, all that constant movement hurts!! \u000aI&#39;m on prescription fibromyalgia meds and they still did not help. I started eating the box of ten 5 MG edibles very quickly. I took a train to Berkley and came back. All though my body and mind were a mess I reached a point of medicated where for maybe an hour all was ok. No emotional disturbance, the physical pain was not an issue it just existed with me it was not in my space of being. After this I bought a few more boxes\u000a\u000aThe high is clear and clean. I was intoxicated for sure. I was in a frame of mind where stumbling and not walking a straight line was not the biggest deal. I could talk process thoughts and come off as a &quot;normal person&quot; it was not the most relaxed high. No heady tired indica at all. A mind invigorating and stimulating strain. Emotions came and went and were not the worst. The strain is certainly try for a long period as a daytime pain and physiological medication. I search for indica that help with muscle and calm the mind. So this was a great experience. Finding that maybe all the time do I need the smack in the head indica that I use. I need heavily sedating Indicas. So this was just a different strain from other sativas. NO PARANOIA! And sometimes sativas do that to me. I get all heady and start processing what I should probably just leave alone. \u000a-\u000a-\u000aMy reviews are not that typical but I hope they help someone because medical marijuana need to be taken seriously as a medication. And it&#39;s all so confusing sometimes if your really trying to find a real MEDICATION. It&#39;s wonderful sometimes and scary and bad other times. That&#39;s the way most psychological medication work they are not nice always the side effects suck. And lots of marijuanas side effects are not the most present but they certainly less than most nasty meds and I need to take those as well. \u000a\u000a

VCaptain&#39;s Log: 29 April 12:10P.M.\u000aAmount Consumed: 0.9g\u000aPhysical Description: The flower has many Indica like qualities, the most notable being small patches of bright purple bud to contrast the overall darker green hue, as well as her many thick orange hairs.\u000aTaste and Scent Profile: The taste--along with the scent--carries a spicy quality, very reminiscent of the famed &quot;Thai&quot; sativa.\u000aPros: For those of us who prefer a  cerebral high over a body high, this sativa is perfect: it not only makes any sort of couch lock nonexistent, it also promotes a &quot;get up and move around&quot; mentality. Ideal for creatives (or anyone who enjoys the following), Red Congo creates a clear headed high, giving a feeling of separation between ones mind and body.\u000aCons: For those who don&#39;t have the pleasure of living around the bay area, this landrace sativa is quite difficult to come by.\u000aConclusion: Even though seldom available to people outside of California, she shouldn&#39;t be underestimated; Red Congolese gives the user an incredibly compelling and cerebrally-focused high, while causing one to suffer few noticeably negative effects (for me, not even dry mouth), creating a pleasant, memorable experience, that will have even the most Indica-obsessed individual rushing to San Francisco to get more.

VThe flower looks as unique as it&#39;s smell.  I&#39;ve never smoked a sativa like this one before.  The euphoric high comes on fast and last longer than most sativas I&#39;ve tried before.  Alert and focused for hours.  Great day-time high that doesn&#39;t weigh you down.  Only LOVE the Congo!

VExcellent Sativa! I found the high reminded me of the brisk uplifting feeling of a double espresso combined with a comforting euphoria to be exceptionally pleasant and helpful. I found the high to come on pretty intensely and early, peaking in intensity within 45 min. before smoothing out into a nice and easy--and functional--high. I really wish I had more. I took a look at the menu just now and they are sold out. I need to remember to stock up on this next time!

VAn original atypical, different from the popular hybrids that hit you hard from both S and I sides, and can couch lock you ... into confusion. Red Congolese lets you get going and get stuff done. Vapes energetic, focused and bright. Senses tuned up, positive mood. Very easy to get deeply into tasks, that&#39;s as Couch-Locky as this one gets. Nothing catatonic about the Red Congolese. \u000a\u000aBut then I tried smoking it and it was heavier. If nothing else, the flower carries well over 20% THC, so it&#39;s a matter of correct dosing, and I kind of missed the mark. I had moments of anxiety and THC confusion before things settled down (so those S side-effects are there), but they passed, in about 5 minutes. Going back to my usual low-mid temp vaporizing, it&#39;s just right.

VFrom Sunrise Wellness in Vancouver and produced by Heavenly Daze. For me this product was outstanding, a top shelf sativa raised by accomplished growers. The flower had long red hairs and smelled like a combination of herbs, sweet fruit and citrus. The high is as described by others; euphoric, energetic, uplifting and focused (after the initial rush). Good for most activities except where a lot of computation is needed. I&#39;ve yet to do it but this strain would be incredible for hiking in a beautiful place.

VThe particular strain I  tried was called CONGOLESE, whether it was the red variety or not I am not to sure of.  However, that being said this is a 100% Sativa dominant and boy does it ever show.  The euphoric head high is amazing and very uplifting.   This particular is good for anxiety and depression.   It can also aid in nausea and motion sicknesses.   This particular strain has very tightly packed bids and and earthy pungency with a slight sweet after taste.  This is a strain that if you a newbie too can be too much.  They may end feeling very giddy and fidgety.  Those looking for excellent head and body uplifting experience should definitely try this particular strain

VThis African bush weed is the quintessential Espresso of Cannabis strains, ideal for a wake n&#39; bake paired with your morning coffee. The smooth Lime and Pine profile complimenting the Sweet Earthy undertones leave you breathing easy, with the utmost Functional and Clear-Headed high. The unique Appetite Suppressing qualities and productive stimulation are derived from its generous dose of the highly sought after Cannabinoid THCv, which is predominately found in strains with genetics stemming from Africa. At low doses the Congo gives an optimistic buzz without the munchies, keeping you from bumbling from one job to the next. This helps keep your head up and your nose to the grindstone to complete every task on the todo list

VRed Congolese is an excellent sativa that will satisfy even a heavy smoker. I felt extremely happy and energetic and it heightened my senses greatly. Inexperienced smokers should be cautioned this is a very intense head high. I did experience some minor paranoia which is not something that I&#39;ve experienced in a while but I attribute that to the potency of this weed. Other than that this was an excellent strain and I will definitely seek this strain out in the future.

VRed Congolese has everything I want in a daytime Sativa. Uplifting, positive and clear headed enough to stay productive. When you light it up you get a smooth earthy, woody taste and not an overly strong odor. You will be engulfed in a wonderful warm euphporic high that usually lasts about 1 hour and then settles into a nice positive warm glow that will last for hours.  Your senses are heighted and you can think clearly to be still be very productive.  This is by far my favourite daytime Sativa. I quite often use Jack Herer because you can find it almost everywhere, but my preference is Red Congo when I can track it down.  I can&#39;t recommend this strain enough.  A reliable and consistant strain that fits me like a well worn glove.  An added bonus is that I don&#39;t get the munchies either.

VImmediate europhoric headshot. Very large buzz like all of your receptor sites are all spinning at maximum rpm&#39;s possible. Only downfall to the strain is that the intensity is so much it&#39;s nearly impossible to your head in such a state that you return to a more recognizable state after just a few minutes. \u000aFlavors are yum yum. Potent, pungent, spicy and in your face like approach right after inhalation.  Very dense in aroma as well.\u000aI would definitely score it 9.1 outta 11. On my scale probably equating to a 4.4/4.5 stars, on clearly 5 star scale.

VOverall one of my favourite Sativas. The buds smell amazing. Notes of citrus and tropical fruit with a hint of pine. I really enjoy the effects as well. Very pure high; energetic, creative and euphoric. Some sativas make me a bit restless as well but Red Congolese feels focused and comfortable. Maybe a bit too potent for people new to Cannabis but I Would definitely recommend this strain to veteran or moderate consumers for daytime use. Great choice for treatment of ADHD/ADD.

VH\u000a\u000aHoly molly, this strain smells phenomenal. The cut I had was top notch and just endlessly sparkling with trichomes. An over powered berry, pungent, sweet, fruity and pepper/spice. The berry side really comes thru the smell. The taste is almost exactly the same. Didn\u2019t find it all that energetic altho. Very focused, but not motivated really. It\u2019s a bit more on the relaxing side than the productive side. I\u2019ve seen a lot of different qualities of this strain, but the AAAA stuff is a pretty tight and compact set of chunky nugs. The AA or AAA stuff I\u2019ve seen can be on the very leafy and bland side. This strain only shines when it\u2019s grown and flushed properly, so be ready to invest for a quality cut. You won\u2019t regret it!

VCongolese is the cleanest, most natural high I&#39;ve ever experienced. The taste is of grass, earth, and spicy pine. It is delicious. Rarely does a marijuana experience make me feel as though I&#39;ve &quot;turned on,&quot; but Congolese inspires this feeling, which I&#39;d describe as being in-tune with your environment. It is unique in this way so far as my experience goes. It has uplifting, euphoric and sensory enhancement, and also is relaxing and appetite inducing.

The taste is VERY unique for cannabis, is classify it as a dank umami flavor. Add in a bit of burnt blood red orange. Almost neutral tasting....\u000a\u000aJust know that you probably can tell this strange has me feeling extra creative. Definitely feel like I&#39;m floating in a cloud sort of euphoria. I feel as though the wind could whisk me away off the top of this parking garage.\u000a\u000aIm &#128308;____&#128308;high AF. 17/10.\u000a\u000aYee. Props to GOE.menu out of Hayward for this one.

VPossibly my favorite sativa. Has a very high THC content, and just one hit from a bubbler is enough to send me to the sky. The first time I smoked it, I became so aroused, I started having body orgasms. This happened several other times as well. I highly recommend smoking this with a romantic partner. Great for stress relief--uplifting, fun, and overall a very exciting high. However, it is a very brainy high...so headaches are an expected side-effect. Not ideal for use if you&#39;re trying to go to bed soon or if you&#39;re trying to get rid of a migraine.

VCongolese is the cleanest, most natural high I&#39;ve ever experienced. The taste is of grass, earth, and spicy pine. It is delicious. Rarely does a marijuana experience make me feel as though I&#39;ve &quot;turned on,&quot; but Congolese inspires this feeling, which I&#39;d describe as being in-tune with your environment. It is unique in this way so far as my experience goes. It has uplifting, euphoric and sensory enhancement, and also is relaxing and appetite inducing.

VH\u000a\u000aHoly molly, this strain smells phenomenal. The cut I had was top notch and just endlessly sparkling with trichomes. An over powered berry, pungent, sweet, fruity and pepper/spice. The berry side really comes thru the smell. The taste is almost exactly the same. Didn\u2019t find it all that energetic altho. Very focused, but not motivated really. It\u2019s a bit more on the relaxing side than the productive side. I\u2019ve seen a lot of different qualities of this strain, but the AAAA stuff is a pretty tight and compact set of chunky nugs. The AA or AAA stuff I\u2019ve seen can be on the very leafy and bland side. This strain only shines when it\u2019s grown and flushed properly, so be ready to invest for a quality cut. You won\u2019t regret it!

Beware of the munchies!\u000a\u000aAll in all everyone who hasn\u2019t had this strain yet is missing out and should check their local dispensary soon.\u000a\u000aShoutout to Elemental Wellness Center in San Jose, Ca for having it somewhat frequently in their menu.

The buds themselves look exotic with beautiful greens and red hairs. I scooped this up randomly on sale at a dispensary and have not been able to find it since. The perfect strain for social activities. Gives you lots of energy and keeps you focused and feeling good. I highly recommend taking a walk through the Congo, you will never want to leave.

The stems are thin and the bud covered in red hair to the point that my fingers were extremely sticky after handling, The smell of this strain is earthy and lemony with a herbal like undertone.  When smoking, I do not notice the earthy flavour as my mouth is full of a lemon and herb taste.  Overall, this is an amazing high that makes me focused and creative.

Idunno. They don&#39;t feel dry... I don&#39;t regularly use eyedrops, and I don&#39;t feel like I need to have some on hand for this strain. I would not recommend reading or doing anything with fine detail involved.  \u000aNot good for my focus visually or mentally.\u000a\u000aI prefer to use it in relaxed safe settings.

VFelt great. Focused. Went to take a shower - ended up scrubbing the toilet first! No \u201cderpy\u201d stoner effect, no fogginess, no munchies and no sleepiness. Was chatty, deep thinking with clarity - great for a walk, conversation, listening to music or getting into a movie. Felt creative and relaxed.

VIf I had to narrow a top 3 favorite strains, Red Congolese is definitely one of them. It has an earthy and almost cheesy aroma as flower, and should have a fluffiness as a bud or ground up.\u000a\u000aFavorite ways to medicate Rc: Bong or Vaped \u000a\u000aTypically in the mid 20\u2019s for THC %\u000a\u000aThe high is a very seamless transition too, giving the user energy, focus, happiness, and maybe even a case of the giggles; perfect daytime Sativa. Beware of the munchies!\u000a\u000aAll in all everyone who hasn\u2019t had this strain yet is missing out and should check their local dispensary soon.\u000a\u000aShoutout to Elemental Wellness Center in San Jose, Ca for having it somewhat frequently in their menu.

VTo us, the Red Congolese is the physical manifestation of love in the world. It is not a plant; it is a gift from Mother Earth and Father Sky. \u000a\u000aOur very best research currently suggests that the Red Congolese only grows at the intersection of Mother Earth&#39;s telluric currents. Love, as they say, is life... and each moment of our life that we can spend with the Red Congolese is a moment to be cherished.\u000a\u000a- J-Man Institute for Higher Consciousness -

You just have to inhale gently and after it&#39;s instantly in your muscles to be well and steady to do whatever you want for some hours with all your capacities and your clear mind. The taste is pretty earthy but you can find often flowery flavours and spicy undertones. Wish you the best with this one; sadly it is a tricky flower which gives you more confidence than you need.

VThe elusive &quot;Red Congo&quot;... by far my favourite strain to date. This strain hails from one of the most remote areas of the world, deep in the jungles of the Congo in Africa. The buds themselves look exotic with beautiful greens and red hairs. I scooped this up randomly on sale at a dispensary and have not been able to find it since. The perfect strain for social activities. Gives you lots of energy and keeps you focused and feeling good. I highly recommend taking a walk through the Congo, you will never want to leave.

I found the african sativa at the top of the menu ($320/ounce!!!!) of my go-to dispensary, and had to get it... definitely not the west coast version with the Afghan/Mexican genes, this strains smell and taste instantly reminded of Amsterdam... which is a sativa lovers paradise. Extremely covered in shiny trichomes, and a fruity taste combine to make this a treat for anyone who&#39;s into sativas... highly recommended for seasoned smokers.

Picked this up in San Francisco&#39;s Green Cross. Most favorite club in the city. This sativa got me so fucking hyped to do shit. I loved it. it was pretty tingly feeling at first along my hands arms and legs and feet making me only wanna do Shit otherwise I felt like my hands would just flop everywhere if I didn&#39;t do something. lol Just such an enjoyable high over all.

VCongolese is a heavy Sativa once you consume the flower it goes right to your brain. Congolese is potent makes you happy, gives you energy and the best part is focus.\u000a\u000aI recommend Congolese in the morning or late afternoon. It&#39;s a very good strain to pair up with coffee. Take it to keep you moving!

VGreat weightless euphoria which helps with day time pains and stress. Liked how it kept my mind clear and on task. I found it smooth on the lungs (rolled joint) and loved its immediate, relaxing effects. The only downside is that this strain gives me minor headaches. Over all, this makes for an awesome daytime, medical cannabis that encourages productivity!

VVery good sativa. Not so racy that you get lost in it but enough will give you the energy to do anything for hours. It&#39;s one of my favorite sativas and have added it to my active rotation. The one that I have is very lemony and the longer it cures, the better it smells. The terpenes are on another level if you like to smell your weed.

VHad bought some from Harborside Oakland. Definitely one if the most potent strains I have ever tried. I like to think of myself as a connoisseur rather than a stoner and thus I tend to look for flavor, smell, and high equally. The aroma was slightly pungent and the taste was very earthy but the high was overwhelming. Seasoned cannabis smokers would do great with this strain but for those with less experience, a little goes a long way.

VFirst time smoking this strain yesterday and let me tell you...  This is the meth of marijuana.  Total insanity, massive come up, tweaked out, paranoia and hearing things.  I usually smoke one bowl, daily and I&#39;m fine, this strain must be incredibly high in THC because I probably only need a quarter of a bowl.  Keep in mind I suffer from an anxiety disorder - So heed my warning if you have this condition as it sent me straight to tweaker hell.

VThis is definitely not a Sativa.  It is so much of an Indica that you&#39;ll likely fall asleep while smoking it, or shortly thereafter.  I personally need to get things done during the day, so if you are at all interested in being awake, or high, this is not the strain to buy.  For the potency of it, I almost am not getting high from it, so it should be a cheapie, shake type product.  So regret buying a quantity of it!
