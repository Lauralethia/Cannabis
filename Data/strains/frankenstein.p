VI recommend this strain for me. Frankenstein by the high point is sedative, extremely relaxed, slightly happy and euphoric. Smoke has near to no lung expansion. Very smooth taste of flowers with a hint of berries and honey. Buds are dense with good amount of trich. Deep purple to light beige nugs with massive amounts of stubby fat copper hairs. It\u2019s great for treating anxiety.\u000a\u000aI will get again.

VTried this strain on a whim because the local delivery service had a g for $20 (wax). I smoke from a YoCan Evolve Plus.  I&#39;m a daily medicator, and usually smoke Indicas. \u000a\u000aThis strain is definitely a hard hitting Indica.  You&#39;ll feel the couch lock almost immediately, but it&#39;s also a heady high. I experience a sharpness of focus, and find myself, for some reason,  interested in learning new things.  Hell, I just spent an hour on the internet learning the habits of successful people!  Yikes.  \u000a\u000aAll in all, probably one of my favorite strains for melting stress, anxiety, and muscle pain away.  Oh god and you will eat... a lot.\u000a\u000aIf you can get your hands on it, it&#39;s a great strain to have when you want to chill on the couch with your friends, if you want to relax after a long day, or on lazy weekend days.
