VEarthy citrus with a pine tinge was the flavor here, though it didn\u2019t last beyond the first 3 hits and got a bit woody towards the end.  Fairly smooth, yet expansive. Felt strongly right away in the eyes and sinuses, this one also has a very strong pulsing narcotic body effect that left our reviewers with big smiles and the desire to simply relax.  Couchlock, appetite stimulation, and a completely relaxed body are the hallmarks of any strong Indica, and this one fits the bill perfectly.

VThis strain&#39;s name doesn&#39;t dissapoint.\u000a\u000aDynamite is a pretty strong explosive, can and wil destroy you if you have enough and due to the short and primitive fuse will explode fast. The same goes for this strain. \u000a\u000aI wasn&#39;t expecting much and I&#39;ve smoked a lot of weed in my life but damn this loves up to its name. Smells extremely potent and tastes great! Very indica heavy body high which I expected but also has a great head high too. \u000a\u000aI usually prefer sativa&#39;s but this has definitely made me consider this preference again. This strain is gets very close to being my new favorite strain.\u000a\u000a5/5

VWOW! Dynamite from Pioneer Nuggets is beautiful and effective!\u000aI purchased a 3.5g can from Ocean Greens and as I poped the can scents of spicy thai grapefruit overwhelmed me and took me back to my days in Chang Rai strolling through the outlying succotash farms searching for enlightenment. The contrast of red hairs to sugar coated green leaf looked surreal by the reflection in the can.\u000aAlmost immediately my cheeks began to blush and brow became sweaty...and soon after I was transfered to a state of uplifting tranquility by the grapefruity and spicy southeast asian infleunce of the Bangkock style mad rush to &#39;get er done,&#39; balanced with creative indulgence and mindful application of the task at hand.

The first noticeable effects were calmness, a very very light pressure around my eye sockets / upper cheek bones.

VAmazing strain. Although the taste is subtle, it is very tasty, fruity and citrus.\u000aEffects start with a gentle but invigorating uplift cerebral spark. Mood improves and makes you feel very positive.\u000aAfter that, your body will melt easing all pain away.\u000aThe only reason i rate with 4 stars it&#39;s because the appetite increase and dry eyes are quite pronounced, meaning that if you have stuff to do it, those 2 effects might interfere.\u000aIf that doesn&#39;t bother you, then go ahead a enjoy a great, tasty and comforting nighttime medicine.

VFind a couch. Great for relaxing and maybe watching a movie. Starts with a nice head high and becomes a soothing body high you won&#39;t want to pass up. Like being wrapped in a heated comforter. Then you get very sleepy at the end. Took this, went to bed at a good time, and woke up refreshed. Great for a Sunday evening when you&#39;ll have to get up and go Monday morning. \u000aFlavor is great too, like a floral grapefruit tea. If you like indicas, this is a strain you have to try. Competes with GDP in my opinion.

VDidn&#39;t feel it it instantly, slowly hit and felt/feel very relaxed. I struggle with ADHD and it help me maintain my focus. Keep water close mouth was bone dry.

VDynamite made me fear indicas. I admit, this may be mostly my fault because 1) I&#39;m very sensitive and 2) this one is a SUPER CREEPER. Took a vape and felt nothing. 15 minutes later, took a vape and felt nothing. 15 minutes later, took a vape and felt nothing. Then about 40 minutes in, it hit, and it hit hardcore. Talk about couch lock. I want to feel relaxed, but I don&#39;t want to feel like I can&#39;t get up. It was like wearing a straitjacket. I hated it! I spent about two hours running around my neighborhood trying to walk it off, which was not easy. Think I&#39;m too keyed up? You would be right! But rather than help my anxiety, it made it way, way worse. Also, I got this one based on the budtender&#39;s advice because they didn&#39;t have what I initially came for. Mistake. If you&#39;ve done you&#39;re research, you&#39;ll probably have a better idea of what might work for you than someone who doesn&#39;t know you. Maybe that seems like a no-brainer, but when you&#39;re a relative newbie to cannabis like me, you can be too trusting/naive. I do my homework before I go to the shop and I know what I want.

VVery sweet and simple strain. I felt an immense euphoria all throughout my body while keeping my mind peaceful. I suggest it for anyone, because the soothing sensation is so relieving, you don&#39;t even feel high!
