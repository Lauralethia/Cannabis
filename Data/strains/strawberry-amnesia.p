VLovely lightly musky/spicy dried strawberry taste. Jumps right on ya when it hits, feels like its massaging my brain into forgetfulness. Not too race-y like hazes are at times for a sativa, so no anxiety with this one. If you&#39;re a noobie take it easy at first, high tolerance people will be very satisfied from small amount. Definitely made my tummy unclench and toes/face tingle.\u000a\u000aSleepy when you finally come down and pretty airheaded, but not aggressively.

VNot impressed with this strain, it just wasn&#39;t right, It looked good nice buds which were well trimmed but there was very little smell coming off the thing.\u000a\u000aI rolled a number hoping for better things, unfortunately things didn&#39;t get better there seemed to be little in the way of effects from this one, there was little or no tasted to it &amp; a hit that just left me feeling down.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t recommend this one &amp; would advise you to leave it well alone, I was also smoking some Lemon Haze at the same time which I will rate now in the right place.\u000a\u000acheers

VThe Strawberry Amnesia is one of the best strain i have ever smoked. Not only does she perform amazingly in the garden. She taste like a piece of heaven when used for cooking, Very sweet sugary smell.. This Sativa dominant hybrid is suitable for a nighttime smoke.

VThe first onset of high I felt a little more indica, after about 10-15 minutes this radically changed to a more uplifting, focused, energetic type of high. I felt like the HMH strain may have had a even higher CBD, or CBG content. The focused feeling and clear headed high lasted for hours and with no redness of eyes, and just a small amount of dry mouth. Overall this strain is a great daytime strain and quite fruity. I highly suggest cleaning out a glass pipe (if your using one) to get the full flavor.

VOne of my favorite strains. Provides a euphoric head high which is accompanied with happiness and an increase in appetite. Would definitely recommend it for depression. Perfect to keep you going during a party, but also good to enjoy alone before bed.
