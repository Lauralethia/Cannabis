VPandora&#39;s Box is quite the enjoyable sativa. It carries a delightful high with genuine euphoria. Tremendous case of the giggles, damn my face hurts. Eyes are slightly dry but I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys enormous head highs :)

VMany years ago the most powerful magic recipe was locked away to protect humanity from the devastating power, locked inside a combination of genetics that only a team of Uber-stoners would have the power to harness. This strain is very stable and we are very excited about the yields we have seen. The first plants I saw grown in a hydro hut grown by a newbie grower were literally sagging with huge glass like buds and the buzz is up, speedy, very shit eating grin and smiling like a Cheshire cat like high. It\u2019s a bit smoother than JTR and has a different feel in the head less haze influence. I can\u2019t tell where the ceiling is as every bowl I smoke I seem to get a bit higher until the point my vision blurs. Not for light weights. I can\u2019t stop grinning when I smoke this weed.\u000a\u000a* Phenotypes: Large Triangle shaped glass covered rock hard buds are all we see.\u000a* Height: Wide thick sweeping arms with weighted colas that need support after 50 days/medium\u000a* Yield: For a strain of this potency I think this thing yields like crazy.\u000a* Indoor has only been tested so far\u000a* Best way to grow: Topped and bound/Vegged to a large bush\u000a* Harvest Window: 9 weeks\u000a* Sativa/Indica: 60/40\u000a* Hybrid: Jack the Ripper X Space Queen\u000a* High type: Zooming, Happy, Grinning, anti depressant BIGTIME!\u000a* Smells: It taste like NL5 to me but its very industrial with a slight citrus taste and a undertone of spice and hash One female has been named Cherry Lethal lemonade.

VOne of the top strains I&#39;ve come across, fortunately it was grown very well and was much like the description with an insanely good citrus smell. I&#39;ve got a high tolerance but after smoking this I felt so great, it took me back to when I first started smoking and I felt giggly and jolly. To say the least, it was a very fun and uplifting experience, I would highly recommend this strain to just about anyone.

VGot a gram of this from local dispensary. &quot;Private Shelf&quot; which is their highest potency and quality level. Very light green almost white hued. Extremely caked in powder. The bud was crumbly and easy to grind. Smell of bud sweet floral citrus very tempting. No lemon, for those looking for a different taste and smell. Half a bowl from a 10 inch honeycomb to tree perc, ice and ash catcher rig setup blown. Beware potency is first noticed exhale. Sugary candy exhale. Like too much candy this strain will buzz you up. I typically lean toward indica due to my natural racy anxiety but this strain doesn&#39;t bother me TOO much. If you get greedy it can put you in the &quot;danger zone&quot; beware for those who fear anxiety. Know your limits and enjoy the undeniable quality of this strain. A+

VThis is a very strong sativa ,and I felt like I opened up pandora&#39;s box after smoking this thing.  It smelled and smoked very nice and had a nice minty taste when inhaled through a vaporizer. The high was very strong and great for stress and my anxiety type twitches. It remined me of the strain jack herer a tad bit. I give this strain a 9/10 and would recommend for jack herer lovers or sativa lovers in general.

VRight Now I notice like a similar feeling to headband, and this right now is killing my higher back pain near my shoulder blades and lower mid-back down the spine. Things are slowly getting more saturated I am beginning to see more depth. It&#39;s really eye opening for sure. Normally I have a hard time seeing depth when I medicate, but this is completely different. A little bit of the numbingness, but nothing I can&#39;t handle. I usually have a ton of paranoia, but I feel none of that its gone and...I can just sit and listen. Outdoors here I come.. I have the opposite effects of cannabis with sativa or indica. I have had high CBD strains and they make me worse; but I have clear voyence afterwards this is something else entirely . Its like trainwreck, but your mind controls how you want to feel, for me its a heavy chill dude feeling.

But seriously, don&#39;t open the box unless you&#39;re willing to loose your entire stash in one sitting. It&#39;s name is fitting. I got all artsy and thought I&#39;d created some type of Van Gogh masterpiece, I was so proud.

VAt last I am reunited. THE combination of true chill-out feelings I&#39;ve been chasing for almost a year now: uplifted, energetic, happy, giggly, social, psychoactive. The traditional cheese taste is very muffled in this particular batch of wax; such that it is dominated by a sweet, funky, overpoweringly-piney astringent. They call themselves &quot;Nector Sector&quot; Extracts, and it wasn&#39;t cheap! 30$ for half gram. Very sticky, very golden yellow like a yellow-orange dandelion. Highly recommend this out of a proper &#39;vapor rig&#39;... but smearing on papers still had me blasted.\u000a\u000aI feel sorry for the other posts recently before my post. They must&#39;ve had it grown improperly or cured or produced; I&#39;ve had a bad batch of Pandora&#39;s Box flowers in the past, and it was seriously lacking of its uplifting/giggly effects. I&#39;m glad I found a better product of Pandora&#39;s Box, and will be picking up more before they sell out. \u000a\u000aI must make a closing note about this very mysterious strain of cannabis: it is not a daily toker, but more of a ceremonial and occasional ritual. It is VERY draining, and you may also find that if you don&#39;t allow your body to replenish itself for more than a day after ingesting this plant, you will experience a sub-par &quot;typically stoned from weed&quot; feeling. I can never experience the full spectrum of enjoyable effects from this strain unless I take breaks, but it&#39;s damn worth taking the break in my opinion. I&#39;d rather keep this alone if I had to choose between Pandora&#39;s Box and the 10+ other strains in my stash.

VStrain: Pandora (Jack the Ripper / Space Queen cross -- Sativa)\u000aTHC: 25.51%\u000aCBD: 0.24%\u000aLocation found: KaLeafa \u000aDate purchased: 3.31.16\u000aPrice: $7.00/g\u000aWeight: 1.1g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: It is a citrus melody with a small amount of earthy pine trees in the distance. Strong but almost a sweet and mild smell.\u000aLook: A little loose to almost fall apart (dried too quickly? -- for the money it was still a good deal), light green nugs with orange hairs and coated in crystals. Needs a small trim.\u000aTaste: A citrus Jack blend. The sweet smell did not carry over but it was more of a pungent earthy taste hid in the background of a citrus mix. \u000aRecommendation for medicine: A slow day needed? Almost complete loss of focus for me nearly right away. A very relaxing Sativa that I would almost label a Hybrid. Good for PTSD and mind-race slowdown. Some pain relief.

VFirst time trying this particular strain. Big fan of it&#39;s genetics so this was an easy sell for me from my go to budtender at The Green Planet. So...after buying rec weed since it&#39;s legalization, I (like so many others) have had some amazing strains. This is one of the really rare and special ones. For me at least. I&#39;m typically a sativa guy and this is just so beautifully mellow and yet not couch locky. Super smooth citrus taste from the bong. Smells and looks incredible. Pretty potent, so best for a seasoned smoker or kinda funny to watch a newbie partake in. Just find some. Lots to love for both indica and sativa people.

VFirst time trying this strain and it was perfection. Smoked alongside tobacco and it gave off a nice taste and smell. Extremely potent with a nice earthy smell. Very sticky bud too, had to leave it out for a little while to dry. Not a problem of course! Would recommend to anyone who suffers from depression/negative thoughts.

VAwesome daytime strain. It&#39;s definitely a Sativa but still seems pretty mellow no anxiety or anything. The smell and flavor are very dank there&#39;s a sweet skunky lemony mixed in with alot of earthy flavor when you open the jar you can tell by smell alone it&#39;s gonna be good. The stuff I picked up was by Skyhigh Gardens, it&#39;s definitely topshelf and at 40$ an eighth it&#39;s a total steal. \u000a

VI&#39;m usually not a sativa girl... Anxiety issues and what not BUT anyhoot, I actually liked this. Not like &quot;this is doable&quot; but I actually enjoyed it. Honestly, I got this in a shake sack because I wanted something cheap to use as a filler so I didn&#39;t expect much.... But to my surprise, it was very potent. I mixed it with a couple diff indicas and was pleased with the cerebral, focusing affect. I felt like this $#&#161;% had layers to it! My mind was opening up all kinds of, well... Pandora&#39;s boxes. (Womp womp... I know, I know) But for real tho, it was like that... Not an everyday kinda deal for me, definitely for occasional use but mixed with an indica to tone it down a bit.

VThe triangle shaped lightly compacted buds reminds me of some of the early forms of the 1970&#39;s strains. The aroma was sweet smelling and kind of pungent to me. It has a disel taste to it and kind of tea like nature. It kills my depression, and leaves me dry eyed it&#39;s great for those days when you have a lot of stress; and will take the moody disorders away. It&#39;s a heavy hitter if you have a high tolerance, vaping this strain is one of the best ways to receive your medicine, it&#39;s worth the money and putting it all together, can last you a life time if you take care of your machine and clean it regularly.

VAfter several uses, at evenings and mornings I can do a proper review. \u000aAt first times I felt little bit giggly and happy, after the first times less giggly but still quite confident and stress-free so if something was bit funny, I would laugh with all my heart and enjoy. \u000a\u000aSo it is safe for me to say that this strain helped me to be stress-free and relaxed and by that gave me confidence at work etc.\u000a\u000aI felt energetic in all times. That&#39;s important and actually exactly as written in the strain.\u000aI can say I felt euphoric in a regular level, which is nice, not too much for not be focus for work, maybe again the reason for the stress-free feeling.\u000a\u000aNot feeling quite creative as I thought it will be. Maybe I need to try in different environments.\u000aFeel more talkative and smiley but again it is because the confidence I received like I wrote above.
