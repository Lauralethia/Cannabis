VGreat strain to grow and one of my favorites to smoke.  Choose mothers carefully when growing from seed.  The taller, more sativa pheno&#39;s are what you&#39;re looking for.  A few tokes and stress/anxiety melts away.

VThe batch I got was pretty decent for the price. A bit dopey and hazy. It was good for a while to switch it up to this. But got pretty bored with it on it&#39;s own for regular medicine. Nice for a change or a relaxing afternoon but not for all the time. Maybe I need to try another stronger batch? Reminded me of Skunk or Cheese a bit but lighter and more spacey.

VHands down the most powerful up and clear thinking strain I have ever experienced.  In terms of a Sativa dominant strain this is the one that is worth waiting for. With a bloom cycle that is finished and not done after 11 weeks this heat tolerant plant is the one to grow in the outside heat zone of the bulb. This strain can take the heat. This is a true connoisseurs delight and the most creative high energy buzz ever!

VI had been wanting this strain for a long time so I had built so much hype before trying it &amp; I was let down. I got Satori half gram shatter by Firebrand, it doesn&#39;t do anything for me. Some other reviewers commented on the lack of buzz Satori has.\u000aI did not experience this blissful feeling people kept describing, if anything I felt sad I&#39;ve been after this strain for almost a year &amp; it barely took care of my nausea. \u000aAn hour after smoking I&#39;d feel slight depression.\u000aI made sure to smoke all of it before reviewing this strain.

VI love this strain. Great potency. The taste is awesome. The aroma is pungent, sweet, and fruity with a hint of citrus. The high is definitely a creeper but that doesn&#39;t really detract from the experience in my opinion. It&#39;s sociable and functional, energetic and creative with a slight body effect. Definitely a great daytime smoke. The duration typically lasts 3-4 hours.

VThe Satori i had was visually very sativa, even leaning more towards a *larfy* appearance. It had dense coat of trichomes that left a fine dust along the walls of my grinder. It&#39;s aroma was very sweet and seemed specifically honey like to me.\u000a\u000aIt was a bit difficult to burn. It was like trying to burn a log with a match, and this is with it ground up. The initial effect is unremarkable. It took a few minutes for it to creep up on me with a real heady, brain filling high. Exciting and euphoric but not particularlyong lasting. It was a fun smoke, not sure I would seek it out though.

VI grew this strain a few years ago. Not to sound corny, but this is a very meditative strain. Its strong and it hits, but its smooth, its not too much of this not too much of that- but it gives all of itself as is. So its not like one of those easily forgettable strains. It isn&#39;t boring. But its just gives you what you need and nothing more. Both indica and sativa lovers will be satisfied. \u000a\u000aIf I had to paint a picture of this strain it would be like still crystal clear water gently moving on an overcast day. If you want to cover all bases, this is one of those strains. Good for people who have a tendency to trip out too much on some strains. This strain will treat you right. Has some interesting phenos.

VDisappointing, and it&#39;s the grower&#39;s fault. The pack was about 15% light -- not surprising because the buds were too dry. I&#39;m sure the weight was honest and true when originally prepared for retail but the packaging was just a thin, mini ziplock-style bag stapled to a business card. Even worse, there was too much stem with the bud. \u000a\u000aThe cannabis was unremarkable, but an accurate assessment is impossible with the poor quality of the product. I may try this strain again down the road but I will not purchase it if marked by the grower in question, who will remain nameless.

VThe very best high for me because of how spacey and meditative it gets. There are downsides to everything this good though, you get crazy hungry and crazy sleepy. Only babies get this sleepy I swear its impossible to be any sleepier. And the THC is so high and potent that it can lower your testosterone too much and also make your dick soft like an anti-depressant. The high may be worth it sometimes though I miss satori if I don&#39;t get any for a while the high is so different.
