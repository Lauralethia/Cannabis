VThis strain gave me a lot more of a head high, it was pretty intense. Thoughts were flowing like the Nile river my friends. Lemon OG haze will creep up on you like Brainy from &quot;hey Arnold&quot; (90&#39;s TV show Reference) so I suggest starting slow with this strain because she packs a punch!

VI bought the Reserve Oil Cartridge from Nevada Botanical Science Inc. and the first thing I had to recognize was the beautiful taste! It&#39;s really lemony and you can just taste the Haze hybrid. \u000a\u000aA beautiful strain that always gives me an energized high and makes me happy!

VFirst time reviewer here. Lemon OG haze has landed itself in my personal top three favorite MMJ Sativa strains that I&#39;ve had the pleasure of smoking.  If you keep your buds in mason jars, you&#39;re going to have to control yourself from opening the jar just to take a whiff of that semi sweet, citrusy smell that puts a smile on your face every time. You can even taste a hint of lemon every time you inhale.  \u000a\u000aUsually when people think of Sativa strains, they think of daytime medicating, but this strain is so good, I&#39;d recommend it anytime of the day.  Lemon OG Haze makes me feel wonderful, completely happy, and mentally sharp, allowing me to do my daily routines without hindering my performance like a strong Indica strain might do, and at night when I&#39;m tired, it gives me the tired silly high that makes me giggle and laugh until it&#39;s time to go to sleep. \u000a\u000aHalfway through medicating I find myself smiling and feeling overjoyed, and that alone makes the strain so amazing to me. Definitely a five star strain. If I could I&#39;d always have some of this around.

VI wasn&#39;t blown away by this one. It did everything it was supposed to do (took care of pain and nausea symptoms) but it seemed to hit super hard (causing some anxiety) and then wear off quickly. It would be good to get through something short-term I guess, like a stubbed toe lol...but not my fave choice for chronic medicinal purposes. If it lasted longer, it would get a much higher rating from me.

VGot me a mature Lemon og haze strain couple of weeks back one of the most potent dominant sativas hybrid I&#39;ve smoke. You get tons of energy for a long time if smoke all day it&#39;s great for insomnia and you get really hungry too.  Perfect strain to mix with kushy punch strawberry sativa. Every food taste delicious and you can&#39;t stop eating.

VThe best way I can explain this strain is, listen to Bump n\u2019 Grind by R. Kelly, and swap the words \u201cmind\u201d &amp; \u201cbody\u201d in first two lines of lyrics. LO.G.hZ had my mind racing and my body submersed into a state of immobility! Also, lost all the moister in my mouth and eyes! I almost bumped the star count up to 4 for this strains arousal effects, but the cotton mouth will leave you and your S.O. unable to do anything orally.
