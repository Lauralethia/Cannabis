VTahoe OG is one of those indica strains that when smoked you feel like Wow this is really potent stuff!  Love how it relaxes me, eases any stress from my day and eventually tucks me in bed.  Nice!

Vd recently gotten an 8th of this strain, never had tried it before. The first time i took a few puffs, I got an earthy aftertaste, really good, very mellow at first. \u000aWithin minutes, i was totally relaxed. This strain has a high thc count, 20%-25%. It definitely will cure you of insomnia, some of the best sleeo after coming home from work I&#39;ve had in a while.

VThis is my first written review so this should give you a clue.  I am compelled to share ;) First I will say I have a high tolerance, I have a chronic condition, fibromyalgia, and I use daily, through out the day. With that said these are my own personal experiences.\u000aTahoe OG is now in my top 5 Indicas.  I have tried phenom number 1, 2, 3, 5 with the next few coming in from our Colletive Garden soon.  I have tried the flower, BHO, and bubble hash.\u000aThe first thing you will notice is the smell.  As soon as you open the jar you get a sweet smell that is hard to mistake.  Next is the color, it has a slight purple to it.  Grind it and you will see more what I am talking about. \u000aThe flavor is my fav part!!!  The bubble hash made by our own Bret Maverick was some of the tastiest I have had so far.  Vapping really allows you to taste it as you exhale and get the full effects of the medicine.\u000aNow I am not sure about others but it DOES NOT put me to sleep....Not much does though.  BUT it makes me feel AMAZING!!  Tingles and happy.  Just plan in a good mood without being couch locked!  This is the end of the day pick me up!  \u000aLOVE LOVE LOVE \u000aWe are going to continue to grow this in our collective garden and will have some in very soon!!!  CANT WAIT~

VI concur with other reviewers in that this is definitely a sleepy weed.\u000a\u000aIt also has an intense body/mind numbing effect. Except for headaches.\u000a\u000aThis is not a weed you want to smoke outside. It&#39;s definately a sit-down weed, to the point that if you try to be active after smoking it you&#39;ll get a headache.\u000a\u000aThis strain also has an extremely rapid onset and come down.\u000a\u000aIt takes about 20 minutes before it comes on, but when it does it&#39;s like a light switch.\u000a\u000aSame for the come down: One bowl of this stuff will keep me buzzing for hours, but when I come down it&#39;s like being dropped off a cliff.  BAM! Sober.\u000a\u000aThen it&#39;s nap time.\u000a\u000aOn the come down I literally could not stay awake.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d call this a good nap weed if it wasn&#39;t for the euphoria of the high, which is a little too distracting for a good nap.\u000a\u000aThis would be a good strain to smoke up, watch a movie then take a long nap or turn in for the night.

VTake in a deep whiff of Tahoe OG and you&#39;ll be instantly transported to a scenic mountain paradise with it&#39;s earthy piney goodness. A classic at this point, Tahoe is known for it&#39;s full body high and strong indica effects with a lemon earthy flavor profile. Tahoe&#39;s effects are euphoric and happy with a little bit of the munchies thrown in for good measure- it takes the craveable aspects of indica flowers and adds just enough sativa to provide an unique and memorable high. Medicinally, this strain is perfect for those seeking stress relief, pain relief, help with depression or anxiety, insomnia, and those munchies make it perfect for those seeking an appetite stimulant or suffering from digestive issues.

Our awesome budtender at New Vansterdam confirmed that Tahoe will make tacos, Netflix, and chilling highly appealing. \u000a\u000aDid not disappoint.

VTahoe, my favorite strain. Hands down the best tasting strain I had at the time and now, still holds number one! Best body high, most relaxing, yet peaceful. And I had quite of a bit higher concentration level after smoking. I was in Lake Tahoe at the time, so this made the strain Twice as dank. :)

VOne of THE best strains I have tried recently.  I heard it has somewhere from 24-25% THC.  Very good indica. Doesn&#39;t completely knock you out, but gives you a ton of couch-lock.  It helps with pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and much much more. It&#39;s one of my new favorite Indicas.

VLocation:  Unknown\u000aTHC:  Unknown\u000aCBD:  Unknown\u000a\u000aAdditional Notes:  I just moved to Denver and as I make friends, I am trying strains that don\u2019t have all the background information.  Most people jar what they pick up from the dispensaries and do not track the details on the strain. \u000a\u000aAppearance Rating:  4.25\u000aAppearance Description:  These were very nicely done and you can see the grower knew what they were doing.  All the trichomes are fully developed and cover the flowers.  These have a lime green color with vibrant orange-red hairs.  The people who manicured this could have done a better job as there was more leaf left than I\u2019d like to see. \u000a\u000aTaste Rating:  5.00\u000aTaste Description:  The taste (and smell) is absolutely what I love most about this strain.  Of course you get the flavor you\u2019d expect from an OG strain, but this one really reminds me of lemon or lime skittles on the taste.  I also get a little pine and earth as well.  This strain truly is delicious and this alone will keep me coming back for more.\u000a\u000aEffects Rating:  4.75\u000aEffects Description:  I tend to gravitate toward Sativa strains because I\u2019m not a fan of the couch lock.  However, this is one fine Indica dominant hybrid.  I really love the effects, but wouldn\u2019t want to fraiche this during the day.  It is a very calming, relaxing, euphoric high that is great for alleviating pain and combating insomnia.  I did not experience any anxiety, but it did make me hungry.\u000a\u000aOverall Rating:  4.67 (Rounded to 5 stars) \u000aOverall Summary:  This strain makes me want to branch out and try more Indica and Indica dominant hybrids.  The taste is truly amazing and the high is perfect for the evening.  I was really pleased with this particular batch.  As stated, the manicuring could have been better, but I\u2019d encourage all to give this strain a few tries.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m Keith Von Fraichen \u2026 You Keep On Fraiching

VDate: 01/12/12\u000a\u2013 Strain \u2013 \u000aTahoe Kush\u000a\u2013 About \u2013 \u000aTahoe OG Kush is said to have been bred by The Cali Connection. It is a hybrid that is 60% Sativa and 40% Indica. It can be flowered both indoor and outdoor. Indoor takes about 10 weeks and yeilds 300+ grams/ m&#178;. You can read more \u201cofficial\u201d info about this strain at: http://en.seedfinder.eu/strain-info/Tahoe_OG_Kush/The_Cali_Connection/ \u000a\u2013 From \u2013 \u000aSacred Plant\u000a\u2013 Suggested Donation \u2013 \u000a$10/gram\u000a\u2013 Looks \u2013 \u000aThis particular bud didn\u2019t look the best. I have a feeling that it is outdoor stuff .  It is a pale grass green with a light trichromes dusting. This one is almost naked of hairs. The few hairs that it does have are a light orange fluff. \u000a\u2013 Aroma \u2013 \u000aOddly enough this earthy kush smells very fruity. It almost burns the nose with its deep lemon scent with a light orange zest.\u000a\u2013 Tastes \u2013\u000aThis kush tastes really earthy. It covers your mouth in a musky almost dusty taste. \u000a\u2013 Effects \u2013\u000aThis strain is a reliable friend that makes you LOL uncontrollably. This uplifting and sensual medicine will have you out of a funk in no time. It also gives you that \u201cmagic blanket\u201d feeling all over your body. This one is definitely good for restoring appetite! It is also one for those with anxiety or depression. This is an all-day strain that can be used before work, after work, or even before bed!\u000a\u2013 Duration \u2013\u000aWhen using 0.05 grams \u2013 30-40 mins medicinal-level potency; about 60-90 mins overall. \u000aThis strain lasts long enough to get to sleep and stay there or to relax after work. When writing a review I use this amount so that I will never be too medicated to write!\u000a\u2013 Medicinal Traits \u2013 \u000aRelief of pain (especially: neck, back, and joints), anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, insomnia, anger, and fatigue.\u000a\u2013 Overall \u2013 \u000aThis weed is not the best looking or tasting, but it is a great strain for pain and several other issues. I was very pleased at the positives and the negatives weren\u2019t bad enough to really complain. I was also pleased to find that this is one of few strains that truly gives me munchies. This one is GREAT for those with lack of appetite and depression.\u000a\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u000aThanks for reading!

VTahoe OG Kush is a 50/50 hybrid. It&#39;s effects start with sativa headiness and then transitions to Indica effects with the body melt and mind melt which is why it&#39;s good for sleep. The reason most of you think it&#39;s indica is due to superb potency when grown,trimmed, cured correctly.  Sativas can KO you just like an indica can depending on flower longevity, effects will vary from grower to grower...soil grown always tastes better as that is how the plant was intended to thrive on Earth for us aliens to enjoy

VI felt like the Tahoe went more immediately to help my physical symptoms than other og kush strains.  I&#39;ve also always felt that tahoe has a very &quot;clear-headed&quot; effect, unlike some other og&#39;s that have a strong, at times disorienting psychoactive effect but which are better for bouts of constant pain.  Tahoe is better for preventative medicating, or when you aren&#39;t in so much pain that you need a narcotic-type pain killing effect.  I&#39;ve found Tahoe Og to be consistently very pleasant smelling/tasting - not overpowering but just right.

VJust tried Tahoe OG right now... recommending this one for anyone who needs to instantly relax - mentally and physically.  It did more mental relaxation than physical (for me).  This is amazing, not as pungent tasting or strong smelling as I was anticipating.  Worked very fast for pain relief (Achilles&#39;s tendon. endometriosis, and fibromyalsia).  I&#39;m super giggly... like a kid when they hear the word vagina.  I&#39;m also pretty damn mellow and everything just feels so right, I&#39;m in my happy place.   I have this smile on my face I can&#39;t seem to wipe off... I literally didn&#39;t know I was smiling until someone asked why.  I am incapable of having mood swings with this strain - I love it.  All food tastes amazing with this strain too - so try not to surround yourself with too much food, you&#39;ll eat it all.\u000a\u000aMight be weird for me, but I&#39;m also super horny on this strain - might be because I&#39;m so damn happy.  Either way, I guess that&#39;s a plus for me.

VThis is a 5 Star strain, that is for sure! It seems that somehow that the Pacific Northwest gets embodied in a plant, in both the taste and high. Yet, the strain is given the namesake of Tahoe!? The taste? Well, it&#39;s the woods of Oregon&#39;s coastal mountain range. after a fresh rain in the either of the transitions between our two seasons.

VThis is a 5 Star strain, that is for sure! It seems that somehow that the Pacific Northwest gets embodied in a plant, in both the taste and high. Yet, the strain is given the namesake of Tahoe!? The taste? Well, it&#39;s the woods of Oregon&#39;s coastal mountain range. after a fresh rain in the either of the transitions between our two seasons. It&#39;s piney &amp; musty, yet still smells/tastes fresh and clean, thanks to lemon notes. The high? It&#39;s like a lazy Sunday during the colder, wetter &amp; more windy season.

VI tried the Tahoe OG for the first time after NOT smoking at all for 3 months.  I should have paced myself more and started with half of a bowl instead of an almost overflowing bowl. I was literally the highest i had ever been. The hit from my water pipe was smooth, but it took a little while to feel anything. Next thing I know, i feel tingles creeping up the back of my neck, through my throat into my head. I was stuck on Youtube for over an hour watching old Sesame Street clips. I went to bed and almost drunkenly I fell fast asleep. Worked wonders on my insomnia that night.

VThis one wasn&#39;t so bad.  I&#39;m not a big OG fan but this one surprised me.  The name OG Kush is ubiquitous.  It&#39;s been tacked onto all sorts of strains of varying potency and flavor.  Although listed as a hybrid, it has classically been a strong indica.  I&#39;m old school so my reviews of the classics are tainted by years of buying crap from the Guy... &#39;OG Kush, man!  No, really! I know the grower!&#39;  or &quot;Dude, this Headband is whack!  No, it&#39;s an indica Headband&quot;  Spurious claims from questionable sources.  However, we live in new times.  So, I find this strain of &#39;Ocean Grown&#39; to be refreshing and relaxing.  I love to vape a bit before I hit the sack.  It&#39;s also great as a decompressor from a hard day at the coal mine.  I recommend it as a means to take the edge off.

VTahoe OG is one of the greatest indica&#39;s of all time\u000a\u000aThis strain made me stop and think to myself, &quot;Damn im so fucking stoned rn&quot; Tahoe OG is the ideal indica. Narcotic, stoney effects hit the mind and body long and hard almost immediately upon inhalation. The high starts with a stimulating sativa head kick of happy, care-free euphoria. Couch lock and extreme relaxation soon hit the body. This strain is great for pain, insomnia, stress, and appetite stimulation. The buds smell skunky and kushy, typical of OG kush phenotypes. Dont expect to be very productive after smoking Tahoe OG. Trichomes abundantly cover the dense, green buds with dark orange hairs. Beginners beware with this strain due to its potency.

Very happy, warm, comforting strain. Good for pain, all muscles aches just disappear. Fun for watching basketball on tv. Would I go to a basketball game on this? Hell to the no.

VProbably one of my favorite strains. Tahoe OG has a nice, earthy pine smell and has very dense buds. This strain will leave you feeling really lazy after a decent sized bowl. But don&#39;t worry, the mind high this strain gives allows for enjoyable TV watching, intriguing conversation, and a major love of French fries. Overall Tahoe OG is great for relaxing on the couch and winding down.

VMy favorite to smoke. I love the taste, very piney and oak flavored, like a fine wine or cigar. Leaves you very relaxed, no body pain, it gives you a full body high without the strange head high. Great for sleep problems and is very easy to smoke. Stops any kind of body pain and puts you in a fully relaxed (almost couch lock) state. Not recommended for day time use, unless small amounts are smoked for nausea.

VHoly hell! This is by far one of the strongest strains I&#39;ve smoked. Before ordering it, I read not to smoke it, if you have plans to leave the house, and that&#39;s pretty much what happened. Now, of course you can go out and about, but this is perfect for bedtime. My boyfriend, whom suffers from insomnia, slept like a baby every night, and my anxiety was no more! The giggles were pretty intense, and the munchies were just right. This is now one of our favorites.

VDon&#39;t think my batch was finished right.  Most hybrids give you either one strain&#39;s effect initially, then the other later, or you get something that leans one way more than the other.  This batch of Tahoe i had was right down the middle of the road.  Little bit cerebral, little couch lock, little hungry, little &#39;up&#39;.  Nothing really stood out, other than the usual euphoria i get from a properly finished strain just really wasn&#39;t there.  I was high, and i was happy i was high, but you know that moment where you usually say to yourself &quot;wow, THIS is why i smoke, i feel *&amp;#% great&quot;.  I didn&#39;t get that with this batch.  Would need to be convinced before i tried this again.

VMethod: Brass Knuckles Vape Cartridge.\u000a\u000aAroma: Smells of lemon and pine, and a really sweet glass of lemonade. 1/1 Star!\u000aTaste: The first couple of hits came off a little pinesol-y. Like a strong cleaning agent then after time it mellow out to a tangy but sweet smell. It&#39;s refreshing and tastes fine after brushing you teeth. 2/2 Stars!\u000aFeel: My eyelids almost immediately get heavy as it&#39;s indica side hits me. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve lost any mental sharpness but I&#39;m ready to crawl into a hammock for a middsummer&#39;s nap. Truly a great strain for a rainy day or on a campground around a nighttime fire. Trust me. However, my favorite indicas are a bit more sensual. 1.5/2 Stars! \u000aRanking: This is my current second favorite OG phenotype and a top 5 favorite indica leaning hybrid.\u000a\u000aTotal: 4.5 stars.

VTried this for the first time last night and loved it, especially for pain relief. I had been suffering from a very painful cramp in my leg for two days that just would not release and go away, and after one bowl of Tahoe OG my cramp disappeared like magic. I felt relaxed and euphoric, and incredibly comfortable, like someone wrapped me in a warm blanket, tucked me into bed, and read me a bedtime story. I love indicas and this shot to the top of my list of faves, right after Afghani. Looking forward to smoking some more tonight.

VAn all-time favorite among hundreds of strains sampled. Consistently potent and medicating, it is very balanced, with a fast onslaught that slows way down to a humming these bes of buoyancy that melts time away at its peak effects. Psychedelic qualities with a highly heightened state of apperception that allows one abide in the present comfortably. It&#39;s creative, but not focused at all. Very dreamy, it opened other doors of consciousness that were similar to LSD. Invoked a state of enlightenment that I abided in until I fell asleep and woke up feeling very medicated still. Narcotic and highly medicinal, it felt very similar and just as potent as an opiate.

VTahoe OG Kush is a great strain. From it&#39;s citrus aroma to the smooth smoke. If you&#39;re looking for something that has a smooth taste and not to harsh, this is the strain for you. It&#39;s relaxing for a night in of watching movies. It eliminates pain, and relaxes muscle spasms. When you want to sleep you&#39;re able to do it with ease. I recommend this strain for one who wants to simply relax and enjoy an atmosphere.

VLove this strain. Beautiful bright green color with vivid orange hairs. Mellow taste but packs a massive punch. Small doses are EXTREMELY potent but long-lasting without leaving you over-medicated. This is a great anxiolytic strain with lovely anti-depressant effects. One of few strains that I get a nice afterglow the day after but don&#39;t feel medicated. Just... happy.

After a few bong hit, i laid back and became one with the Doritos, after realizingmy mouth was as dry as the Sahara Desert, i got up to get something to drink, after getting to the fridge for something i forgot why i was there.\u000aAll around great strain for relaxing, and unwinding after work.

VThe guys at Mt. Baker HG have got this indica on point. Opened the bag to a sweet smell of berries. The taste on the other hand was a light sweetness followed by a strong grass and dirt. Not bad if you like that sort of thing. \u000a\u000aThe aftertaste reminded me of working on my friends christmas tree farm. I tend to like the earthy tones on some flowers but it may be or sentimental reasons. \u000a\u000aAnyway, the onset, for me, took about three to five minutes. This turned out to be perfect for getting a shower in before the peak. The peak occurred just before getting into bed.\u000a\u000aThe high is mostly in the head but does give a strong &quot;locked&quot; body high. Tahoe OG is, as the description says, a &quot;rainy- day&quot; smoke.

VA whole lot more on the indica side with a heavy body effect, but haves a small sativa like cerebral high. I most definitely recommend night, but evening is fine.

You will feel sleepy on this, and find yourself sitting or lying down with a sedated/heavy body feeling. Will bring up your mood, and make you forget your troubles. Overall very relaxing. \u000aMedical use I highly recommend for insomnia and pain. It&#39;s very effective as well for anxiety with the sedative side of this strain. It did as well gave me a bit of the munchies, so you can turn to this as well for any low appetite problems. Along with any nausea troubles.

VLove this strain. Beautiful bright green color with vivid orange hairs. Mellow taste but packs a massive punch. Small doses are EXTREMELY potent but long-lasting without leaving you over-medicated. This is a great anxiolytic strain with lovely anti-depressant effects. One of few strains that I get a nice afterglow the day after but don&#39;t feel medicated. Just... happy.

VThe guys at Mt. Baker HG have got this indica on point. Opened the bag to a sweet smell of berries. The taste on the other hand was a light sweetness followed by a strong grass and dirt. Not bad if you like that sort of thing. \u000a\u000aThe aftertaste reminded me of working on my friends christmas tree farm. I tend to like the earthy tones on some flowers but it may be or sentimental reasons. \u000a\u000aAnyway, the onset, for me, took about three to five minutes. This turned out to be perfect for getting a shower in before the peak. The peak occurred just before getting into bed.\u000a\u000aThe high is mostly in the head but does give a strong &quot;locked&quot; body high.

VTahoe OG Kush is a great strain. From it&#39;s citrus aroma to the smooth smoke. If you&#39;re looking for something that has a smooth taste and not to harsh, this is the strain for you. It&#39;s relaxing for a night in of watching movies. It eliminates pain, and relaxes muscle spasms. When you want to sleep you&#39;re able to do it with ease. I recommend this strain for one who wants to simply relax and enjoy an atmosphere.

It&#39;s elevated CBD, and slight CBG loosens tight muscles, relaxes the shoulders and back, and bring blood pressure down slightly.\u000a\u000aFrom an effects standpoint, I felt uplifted, as a slow body high built in my upper back.

VA whole lot more on the indica side with a heavy body effect, but haves a small sativa like cerebral high. I most definitely recommend night, but evening is fine. You will feel sleepy on this, and find yourself sitting or lying down with a sedated/heavy body feeling. Will bring up your mood, and make you forget your troubles. Overall very relaxing. \u000aMedical use I highly recommend for insomnia and pain. It&#39;s very effective as well for anxiety with the sedative side of this strain. It did as well gave me a bit of the munchies, so you can turn to this as well for any low appetite problems. Along with any nausea troubles.

VA good friend and I smoked a decent amount of this before seeing a movie. We walked down to the theatre, stood and line and by the time I got to the front of the line I forgot which movie we came to see. I walked home and went to bed.
