VI smoked this strain when my local club had it at 24.8% thc and 50$ an 1/8th and this from experience is definately the best Sativa feeling that you just don&#39;t seem to get anymore or maybe its just how they grew it. Very dense hard chrystally rocks of bud.Very stoned, happy, even for pro&#39;s red glassy eyes and daze off into your own world seems forever. This is a must try if you can ever find it.

VThis strain lives up to its name. i don&#39;t know how to word this but This strain is the definition of herb. the smell the taste, and creative thinking, very calming, takes the edge off, kick back social high. what we all look for or at least i do. wish i had more.\u000a\u000athe flowers i received were very puffy soft, sticky and frosty. great for grinding, and always stayed cherried threw out the whole bowl.

VClassic wood incence charas aroma with a good deal of black pepper and orange peel. Smoke is a little less refined than some advanced genetics but I prefer classic landraces anyway. In my opinion, Nepalese genetics are grossly under represented on our dispensary shelves. High is quite uplifting experience with unexplained giggling and permagrin. First time smoked turned on the tv and clasic movie &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; was on- best movie ever watched!

VThe flavor of Willie Nelson is probably the only weak point for this strain. It isn&#39;t bad, but the only way to describe it is earthy. The flowers I received were large and semi-dense buds, unlike other sativas. This is very potent, this plant being ~19%. It is the most clear-headed stone I&#39;ve had in quite a while and is excellent for stress and anxiety. If you need something for physical discomfort I&#39;d add a bit of an indica to this, but otherwise I&#39;d say it is perfect for morning, afternoon, and night.

VGreat day time medicine before going out or playing music, hence the name I would assume. I found myself behind the piano for over an hour for the first time in forever. Nice social type of bud that&#39;s nice to pass around. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it if your trying to find something to really kick the dome though. Was not pleased with how dry it was and went up in flames as soon as i lit it. Not sure if it was an old batch or not. Over all I give it a 5 out of 10, at least with my experience with it this time around.

VOne of the very best I have used. Having RSD (similar condition to MS) I am on heavy pain meds. If I take what I am supposed to, I can, and do function, however, doing daily things (IE lawn care, household chores) the meds don&#39;t seem to relax the muscles so the meds can relieve the pain. Willie has alleviated this by relaxing the muscles. Plus I am still able to function! taking less pain meds because the strain relaxes is awesome---without the giggly, bleary eyed sides effects!

VWillie Nelson is a very motivating Sativa. It was one of many I snagged from a local collective yesterday. With a name like Willie Nelson I couldn&#39;t pass it up! Plus the buds looked incredible. Large dense dark nugs coated in light brown hairs. Frosted like flakes (That was awful). The smell and taste were average at best but the high was incredible! As soon as I sat and smoked a couple bowls of this I could feel it first behind my eyes than throughout my entire head. I was extremely motivated and ended up cleaning most of my room and getting a load of laundry done than enjoyed the rest of my high watching some Netflix. Overall I give Willie Nelson a 3.8/5. Medicinally it would be good for Stress, Depression, and Nausea.

VLove this strain. It&#39;s my all time favorite. \u000a\u000aI used to get several migraines a week before I started using pot. That number has gone down significantly because of certain strains that I&#39;ve found that help with migraines. (Other strains have actually made it worse during an attack.) For me, all the strains that work are sativas. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m always on the lookout for a new strain to use and this is great all around...happy, creative, relaxed and motivated at the same time. It has a really clear head high. A small amount gets rid of the start of a migraine and a larger amount gets rid of a full blown one. And, no munchies. In fact, because of the THCV, it&#39;s an appetite suppressant. \u000a\u000aThis may be a strong one for some people. I would start off slow if you don&#39;t smoke often. I&#39;ve had a couple of friends make comments about how hard it hit them. But, both of them have a preference for indicas and I prefer sativas.\u000a\u000aIf you like sativas or get migraines, I would definitely recommend this one.

NO anxiety or fog. Just makes you feel euphorically happy like nothing can go wrong and if it did you can easily manage. Once it hits its like all the stress just melts away, GREAT for social settings, also felt very motivated and began working on my business plan and wanted to workout. I can say this strain is not easy to find so if you do find it, I HIGHLY recommend you try it!!!

VWOW what a great strain and perfect for daytime use. Very clear headed, focused and energetic!!. This strains definitely delivers and more. My go is green crack and this is right up there with it. NO anxiety or fog. Just makes you feel euphorically happy like nothing can go wrong and if it did you can easily manage. Once it hits its like all the stress just melts away, GREAT for social settings, also felt very motivated and began working on my business plan and wanted to workout. I can say this strain is not easy to find so if you do find it, I HIGHLY recommend you try it!!!

They both are similar to me.. Salt and Pepper. More like Pepper and Salt.. Anyway 5 start&#39;s on that thing. Was a very nice grow, when I bought this stuff it was the best I ever smoked.. I made this badass track no one seems to enjoy but me.. It had electronic beat&#39;s I realized I was willie nelson on my computer..

V Nothing to complain about, but neither real uplifting or relaxing, just a general blah stone if that makes any sense. No real bad side effects, just nothing to write to Mom about. I vape for my asthma first, and this one irritated me a bit. For asthma, there are better strains. \u000a\u000aOf couse YMMV, everyone has a different brain/body chemistry. If I want something in between the two highs, I like Dream Queen still as well as Dutch Treat and Green Queen.

The high hit me right away and would help wake me up and ignore my anxiety. The taste isn&#39;t as intriguing as the smell but still good quality taste. I do recommend this for people with high anxiety or fellows looking just for fun nights with the pals (:

VThis strain was amazing for me, I smoke pretty heavily and it was able to give me a nice high that I don&#39;t really get that often anymore. I will say the only negative thing I experienced from this strain was one of the people I smoked with who I believe hasn&#39;t smoked before took one hit and about 30 minutes in started halucinating and screaming stop and quit and the top of her lungs for no reason at all. It took a a few minutes for her to calm down and come back to. Then it happened again about 15 minutes later. She says she saw something but couldn&#39;t explain what it was, I&#39;ve never seen any reaction like that to weed before. But for me it was an amazing high I&#39;d just take it easy on the beginners.
