VThis strain is one of the most amazing I have smoked after several years and 100&#39;s of strains sampled.  \u000a\u000aIf you want to get high and listen to music or get the munchies or play video games... this is not that strain.  This strain does one thing and does it well:  Motivates you to do something positive and takes away all stress.  Other than that, this strain leaves you with a clear head, a clear body and with only the negative side effect of being a bit more talkative.  \u000a\u000aI always keep some of this around for some of those tough days.  You know, those days everything sucks and you just need to feel motivated and positive about doing something?  This is the perfect strain for that.  Get out of bed feeling like you shouldn&#39;t have?  This strain will cover it.\u000a\u000aMy 2nd Favorite Strain (Kosher Kush is #1)\u000a\u000a10/10

VLike many of the other reviewers have been pointing out, The Void is a perfect blend of relaxed and inspiring. It&#39;s got the body mellow, to take yr aches and pains and cares away, but it sets yr mind into overdrive. Definitely promotes out of the box thinking and gives you the energy to follow those ideas up. \u000aAs an added bonus, The Void was the first strand my GF and i purchased, post-Prohibition. I had the experience i&#39;d been thinking of since i was a teenager, walking up to a lovely clean counter at Nectar on Mississippi, discussing strains with the friendly and knowledgeable bud-rista. Came in a tight, tightly sealed container with a slick logo, at a very affordable rate. This new world is so much better than the Marlboro packs full of schwaggy joints many of us were imagining.

VGot this top shelf smoke at Botanico in Denver. First off, GO THERE!! The staff is great, the place is nice, and their selection is outstanding. Stocking only the finest rec/med cannabis on the front range, coupled with a friendly staff makes for a great experience for both seasoned vets or nubes. Now... On to the smoke\u000a\u000aThe first impression for me was the purple. Undica all the way! Well, not all the way being that its a hybrid, but indicate dominant for sure. Heavy med uses make this great for pain, nausea and stress. The sativa isn&#39;t staying quiet in this strain, though.\u000aIt packs a warm and uplifting punch without making you a giggling schoolgirl or a slobbering zombie. I tend to stay away from pure or dominant sativas. Even after 15 years of smoking in the US and Nederland, I still get the heart pounding paranoia from a pure or sativa dominant strain. This strain is top notch, top shelf, and should be at the top of your list if you have not tried it. \u000a
