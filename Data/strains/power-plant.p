VDamn! This strain, is Amazing!!! Great head high, this Sativa is great for yoga and meditation. Buddy and I hiked up to s sick view and smoked this to a Beautiful view and the strain just enhanced everything. Vision is insane, and crazy closed eye visuals. Taste is really unique. Definitely be weary, this is not a strain for beginners. Heavy sense of euphoria.

VPower Plant from Kind Supply is wonderful!  A very powerful sativa, this strain has a very gentle onset (unlike many sativas) but a very potent and long lasting effect.  \u000a\u000aI found this strain very helpful for pain, inflammation and relaxation.  Sativa&#39;s tend to make me more anxious but Power Plant, for whatever reason, had the opposite effect leaving me feeling quite clear headed.\u000a\u000aGreat flavors, smell and burn.  Highly recommend!

VThis is an amazingly perfected strain, upon opening the package you&#39;re greeted with a strong citrus/berry scent with a pine undertone. In managing arthritic pain and migraine control this flower has it all. The taste that comes to mind is a lemon bubblegum when vaped. A very mellow and cerebral stone that lasted much longer then most sativas. Be careful and start with small doses as it&#39;s potency is reflected by its name. Cheers! Stay lifted

VLet me tell you; power is definitely in this plant. As I\u2018m a re-starter after 20 years, I\u2018m very careful with dosage. I vaped some CBD Weed, and mixed only like a small crumb of this strain into it! After vaping it took about 5-10mins to hit me. Following was a 30min head high with a bit of dizziness. Then, slowly my legs and body start to relax and the head high becomes like a very clear feeling i cant really describe. I guess i became very focused eccept my eyes seem to have a bit pf problems to focus... &#128517; Im sorry Im still high writing this. All i can say, very positive high, doesnt make you sleepy although I feel like I wont have problems going to sleep with this.\u000aBit of cotton mouth but no problem with a cup of nice tea in front of you. \u000aBe careful it really is powerful stuff, so go easy if youre a beginner like me.

VRelatively smooth smoke with a really nice euphoric head high. I use it personally for depression and anxiety and it works like a charm. If I&#39;m having an anxiety attack, I&#39;ll smoke a couple bowls and next thing you know, I&#39;m back to my same old talkative self. Definitely has helped a lot with my depression and I highly recommend it for anyone who is suffering through depression or anxiety. Just dont smoke this at night, you probably won&#39;t end up sleeping for a few hours haha

VThe name of this strain couldn&#39;t be more accurate, definately a powerful high. The bud was covered in crystals. A creeper, made me a little paranoid at the beginning but I could manage easily and after that enjoy the cerebral buzz. Very active high so it&#39;s really good for working out or playing some sports. Also could do a useful session of yoga and meditation. Great strain for pain relief without any couch-locking issues.

VNice, focused and relaxed buzz: my sensitiveness to the surroundings is usually significantly heightened. The latter characteristic makes for a strain that boost my spirits and energy while I do a wide variety of activities that vary from late-night video gaming to hikes through the forest. \u000aIf you&#39;re looking for it from a medical standpoint, I&#39;ve heard it is good alleviating muscular pains, but i won&#39;t vouch for it. What I WOULD vouch for is for its unique energy-giving buzz if you have fatigue or depression issues (no wonder it is named &quot;Power Plant&quot;, aye?)

VPower Plant is a great strain if you want a good strong head high that makes you feel euphoric, active and sociable like in a pub/club/party environment. Can make you motor-mouth a lot :)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA strong head high that is quite intense at first smoke, but which you quickly get used to.

VIntro: powerplant is one of the most grown strains here in the Netherlands. It&#39;s cheap and easy to produce. This was the first strain i ever bought myself and the one i smoked the most. \u000a\u000a1) smell:\u000aIt smells great but not like your traditional weed. It has a very sweet and light smell and i wouldn&#39;t immediately distinguish it as weed. I love it! \u000aTaste: i find this one tasting pretty nice actually. It&#39;s a bit sweet but it has a very peppery aftertaste :/ definitely not bad tho. Also good in combination with tobaco but i don&#39;t recommend tobacco (it&#39;s dangerous :P) \u000aLooks: sometimes with and sometimes without orange hairs. Not too dry most of the time so you&#39;re gonna need either scissors or a grinder to make this small\u000a\u000aNow to the less objective part, the feels:\u000aHits: i feel them but not too hard. Only if you take very long and deep bong (or extract) hits, then you feel it. It doesn&#39;t burn too much in your throat and you gradually go into a high. \u000aMultiple highs possible:\u000aThe high (1): &quot;the POWAH&quot;: it makes you feel very energetic. It can give you the need to randomly jump or things like throwing shit. You need to smoke around 0.5g per person  (different for everyone) to get this. \u000aThe high (2): the &quot;relaaax&quot; high. Sometimes this stuff gives you a great body&amp;mind high. The same feeling as when you are done surfing but stronger. Very happy, slightly euphoric and very relaxed feeling. My personal favorite. This one sometimes comes after 1, because you&#39;re giving so much energy.. \u000aHigh (3): the &quot;i got too much&quot;  high. Happened to me once: i mixed it with a bit of good ol&#39; amnesia, smoked about a gram (tolerance wasn&#39;t too high at that time) and totally spaced out. Felt asleep when i closed my eyes, literally while standing. Felt &quot;stars&quot;  tickling under my skin when i closed my eyes and was very paranoid. Don&#39;t do drugs kids ;). \u000a\u000aOverall a great strain for a good price (around 5-8 per gram here in the Netherlands, i get mine for 7) when you want to either get really high or do a lot of shit in 1 hour.

VI grew four plants of this strain in 2005 from seeds I got from an ounce of it purchased at CannaMed Care on Sutter in SF. This is a magnificent Sativa with a citrus and pepper aroma along with an energetic cerebral high.\u000a\u000aThe plant is compact but not too big. I grew four Jack Herer plants at the same time and they towered above. The branching with Power Plant is very even and there are not excessive calyxes at each node, which helps air out each flower to avoid mold.\u000a\u000aDespite the lack of energy at the nodes, Power Plant is a huge producer. I harvested more from the Power Plant then the Jack Herer, which had grown much bigger and taken up a lot of space. I also found myself giving away most of the Jack Herer and keeping the Power Plant to my greedy self.\u000a\u000aThe seeds are still available from Dutch Passion, and they are the smallest little pot seeds you have ever seen in your life. Half the size of all other seeds, I think the plants go way back with their genetics, surviving because of their unattractive oil content for bird life.\u000a\u000aAs for the name, Power Plant, well... it has growing power and big yields in small spaces. Dutch genetics were a big deal in the 90&#39;s and it&#39;s possible this was like a nostalgic &quot;Power Chord&quot; for the creators. I wish there were more of it around now.

VIntro: this is one of the best known and most used strains in the Netherlands because it is so easy to grow. \u000aSmell: PP has a, in my opinion, very nice smell. It has a nice sweet smell and it doesn&#39;t smell a lot like the &quot;traditional&quot; weed smell. When smoked it doesn&#39;t produce a whole lot of smell as well so it&#39;s great if you&#39;re Sharing the house! \u000aTaste: this one tastes great imo. It&#39;s a bit peppery but also sweet and pretty easy and nice to inhale. Not a big aftertaste \u000aPrice: i got 1gram for 7\u20ac so that&#39;s nice\u000aFirst stage high: different for everyone but from what I&#39;ve seen/felt with friends: giggly, energetic and happy\u000aLater high: great feeling. Sometimes a body high. Very happy\u000a\u000aOverall great strain, would recommend

VReally great early morning/day time strain. I wouldn&#39;t partake in this strain if you&#39;re prone to anxiety. Which is odd because of the slight pepper taste, if you&#39;re ever experiencing anxiety while stoned few specks of pepper on the tongues supposed to take it right away.\u000a\u000aTo the veteran smokers, grab this strain it&#39;ll give you enough energy to get thru the day.

VI&#39;ve only had this strain in shatter form, my first mmj concentrate, and it was a great experience.  The shatter was medium amber color and rather, well shatter-y, which led to some interesting attempts at dabbing. I was surprised by how robust the smell was, with woody, spicy, and for lack of a better term  &quot;frankincense-y&quot; notes. The flavor was equally surprising to a flower only toker, a  vibrant but crisp menthol mixed with a dank wood/moss   with none of the burnt plant flavor. The effects hit hard and fast, with a burst of alertness and engery along with a floating slo mo feel, and then i was introduced to &quot;dab sweats&quot; accompanied with a hot headed feeling.

VThis is arguably my favorite strain out there right now !!\u000aThis and Jack Herer are the only two sativas I&#39;ve seen with the nice, fluffy bud structure.\u000aThe batch I had was great- I&#39;ll post some pictures- and I loved it.\u000aIt&#39;s got a typical woody sativa smell, and some of the best sativa effects I&#39;ve smoked.\u000aIt hits you right behind the eyes right from the first puff, and slowly escalates from there to a really clear headed, energetic sativa high. There was no drowsiness, and the only body effects were a slight light feeling through your body like you just lost about 20 pounds haha.\u000aIt&#39;s the kind of sativa high where you&#39;ll get stuff done, and just get super into the zone- almost reminds me of addy, haha.\u000aI ended up cleaning my entire apartment and gamed through the whole Modern Warfare Remastered campaign in about 5 hours, haha.\u000a5/5 will go out of my way to buy more.\u000aIf you like sativas, don&#39;t hesitate to try this one.

VDark green buds and dangerous high levels of THC are the first impressions you get of this famous strain. Woody and earthy flavours and aromas are powerfull but also easy on the throat until the pepper kicks in  and gets this whole experience to another level. Not so energetic effects but an euphoric mood of self thought and exploration. Very nice for day time use, which can also be used at night due to the high THC.

VDefinitely a strong, invigorating head high. This strain wants you to be adventurous and ever-moving. I found that sitting still while enjoying this smoke was a difficult task; I was always fiddling, and felt itchy and uncomfortable and distracted. I will have to try this as a wake-and-bake or late-afternoon-adventure smoke. I&#39;m looking forward to enjoying the sunshine with this strain! Will re-rate soon, for sure!

VGood sativa, there are a lot of tricome and keef in theese buds (beautiful weed), you get high, stoned, but not sleepy, thats the good point in this strain, it&#39;s great to smoke during the day or night, you feel yourself relaxed and willing at the same time, it also relieves anxiety too much, one of my bests, not even a little bit of paranoid, it causes a little  bit of dry mouth but not dry eyes and probably you will fell hungry, but a good meal after smoking is one of the best things to do in the world, the food flavour looks magical lol!

VGood high. Lives up to it&#39;s name! Personally one of my favorites. I have ADD and this works great against it. Makes you focused on tasks, takes the edge of and certainly a good smoke for when you want to chill out a bit, but you&#39;re still active enough to go outdoors, take a hike or even when you plan on getting some groceries (a tip: make sure to eat &amp; drink before getting supplies/groceries, or you might end up buying a lot more than you planned on buying). I would recommend this to everyone (except maybe people who like to be a couch potato/want to sleep, I would recommend an Indica strain for them).\u000a\u000aEnjoy &amp; Cheers!\u000a\u000aLEGALIZE IT!

VI thought this was a great strain.  Great aroma, very interesting, almost like a strong indica.  Flavor didn&#39;t translate via vapor, but it wasn&#39;t bad.  The high was fantastic.  Clear headed, full of creativity, and energy and long lasting.  About an hour and a 1/2 to 2 hours you come down a bit and can feel a little sluggish.  Or you can just hit the vape again, and off you go once more.

VI&#39;ve had PowerPlant in my kit since the mid 90&#39;s, the Dutch  have crossed this African sativa with a local Indica, to make a plant that does not required such an extended flowering time\u000aThis I feel has  cuts it infamous THC% considerably al\u005cso the flowering time lol\u000aI&#39;ve grown it most years and I too have crossed it with many Indica&#39;s but is never the same as that famous African Sativa\u000athat can grow to an easy 15ft on many tropical gardens\u000a=One of my Classic Favorites 5/5

VTook a few bong hits. VERY potent. This comes onto you like a fright train. Then it turns into a trainwreck just like the strain itself. Very potent stuff. If you like Sativas you will like this one. One of the most potent strains I have had. The smell is quite citrusy and is almost identical to Jack Herer. The high comes on fast and is extremely powerful. Rush of euphoria with total relaxation. The munchies are strong with this one too. I have a donut, milk, but my gf was sweet to make steak so that will come first.

VThis is arguably my favorite strain out there right now !!\u000aThis and Jack Herer are the only two sativas I&#39;ve seen with the nice, fluffy bud structure.\u000aThe batch I had was great- I&#39;ll post some pictures- and I loved it.\u000aIt&#39;s got a typical woody sativa smell, and some of the best sativa effects I&#39;ve smoked.\u000aIt hits you right behind the eyes right from the first puff, and slowly escalates from there to a really clear headed, energetic sativa high. There was no drowsiness, and the only body effects were a slight light feeling through your body like you just lost about 20 pounds haha.\u000aIt&#39;s the kind of sativa high where you&#39;ll get stuff done, and just get super into the zone- almost reminds me of addy, haha.\u000aI ended up cleaning my entire apartment and gamed through the whole Modern Warfare Remastered campaign in about 5 hours, haha.\u000a5/5 will go out of my way to buy more.\u000aIf you like sativas, don&#39;t hesitate to try this one.

VI&#39;ve only had this strain in shatter form, my first mmj concentrate, and it was a great experience.  The shatter was medium amber color and rather, well shatter-y, which led to some interesting attempts at dabbing. I was surprised by how robust the smell was, with woody, spicy, and for lack of a better term  &quot;frankincense-y&quot; notes. The flavor was equally surprising to a flower only toker, a  vibrant but crisp menthol mixed with a dank wood/moss   with none of the burnt plant flavor. The effects hit hard and fast, with a burst of alertness and engery along with a floating slo mo feel, and then i was introduced to &quot;dab sweats&quot; accompanied with a hot headed feeling.

VI don&#39;t have a lot of experience with Sativas because I traditionally avoided them due to a tendency for them to cause slight paranoia and elevated heart rate with the strains I&#39;ve tried. The exceptions are Super Silver Haze and now Power Plant. I immediately fell in love with this strain. It&#39;s great at a party because while I was very obviously stoned I could easily think and speak clearly (not always the case on Indicas). I highly recommend giving this strain a try.

VDark green buds and dangerous high levels of THC are the first impressions you get of this famous strain. Woody and earthy flavours and aromas are powerfull but also easy on the throat until the pepper kicks in  and gets this whole experience to another level. Not so energetic effects but an euphoric mood of self thought and exploration. Very nice for day time use, which can also be used at night due to the high THC.

Great pain reliving quality&#39;s, and it&#39;s  high makes you feel like your covered in a warm fuzzy coat. The high also gives you a slight buzzing all over your body, and when siting or laying down it almost feels like I&#39;m being massaged. Awesome for daytime use, though it did make me function just a bit sloppy. Despite this being a sativa dominant strain I easily feel asleep while High in this when bedtime came. All around perfect 5 star rating for me!

This little naughty plant is tough on the lungs and you will cough like crazy.\u000a\u000aThe effect hits immediate and is clearly a sativa high. You will feel uplifted and overall haooy eith a clesr mind, but taking toi much may be a bit intoxicating. Despite the sariva traits of this strain it also has some calming properties. That way you can sit back and sort all the creative juices flowing through your brain.\u000a\u000aTo me it&#39;s not the strongest sativa, but it gets things done and as many say it&#39;s perfect for daytime use.

VVery motivational type of strain. Feels like I can do anything after smoking it. Gives me a really good feeling of happiness for hours. \u000a\u000aThe smell and taste is hard to explain but it&#39;s earthy, kind of peppery, kind of cheesy.

VThis strain is something special! It made me laugh and jump around hysterically for what felt like hours, only to be alternated with a very relaxed and stoned feeling I wouldn&#39;t have expected from a Sativa. Unfortunately, I soon fell asleep, but I attribute that to a long day after almost 4 hours of sports.

VIt is such a potent strain which just hits you like a truck but if you mix in some black afghan you are just gonna be so high that you literally think youre floating in my opinion best to smoke with power plant definetally is black afghan\u000a

VI inhaled this lovely strain with the aid of my Volcano Vaporizer.  Tastes great and smells awesome, gave me extreme pasties but nothing I&#39;m not used to and a cold beer can&#39;t handle.  I&#39;ve added a high resolution image of the Power Plant I was powering through.

VAnd absolutely incredible strain.\u000a\u000aDelicious taste, more on the rubber/diesel side, but very green and relatively clean. Easy to vape.\u000a\u000aThe high comes on a little later than usual and hits you with a very smooth yet intense high on the sativa scale of things.\u000a\u000aThe mind opens up to ideas and thoughts and image. It is a beautiful world in there.

VWOW! picked this up at my local dispensary as a bottom shelf, outdoor, grow. it doesn&#39;t look the prettiest, but I&#39;ll be damned! After two hits, a warm blanket of euphoria was draped over my shoulders, my stress melts away, and relaxation, in a beautiful way, set in.

VWas a very potent strain. I&#39;m not a heavy user so this one hit me like a truck after 10 minutes. Used waaaaayy too much and couldn&#39;t walk straight but it was very enjoyable! A little bit of paranoia when my bro came home but that went away when I went to my room. Me head was in Bora Bora and my body in my room. I usually use 50/50 hybrids and this was a totally new experience. Would recommend it, but don&#39;t do more than a bowl or two. You&#39;ll be a couch potato but won&#39;t fall asleep.
