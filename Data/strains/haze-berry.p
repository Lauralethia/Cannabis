VMostly very strong effects focused in the head. Makes me forgetful and unfocused and a little bit anxious/paranoid, but it&#39;s pretty good for my pain. It&#39;s not the first strain I&#39;d recommend. Mostly I feel this is a good strain just to get plain ruined on, but otherwise it&#39;s not my cup of tea.

VThis one is a pretty nice Sativa, just blasted this in the bong and definitely feeling more relaxed than beforehand. I also know I&#39;m mellowing a bit cause my muscle tension has decreased and my joints have started cracking and popping. For those with musculoskeletal issues try this one out. The high is uplifting and energizing mentally which is kinda cool to have yer brain wake up while yer bod gets more chill- probably good pain management weed for when you are going to a movie, play or concert, forum, lecture, etc. You have to sit for a long time but you don&#39;t wanna zone or drool lol I give this one a 3.5 but had to mark 4-  which is pretty good for me, I&#39;m stingy on the rating scale hehe enjoy!\u000a\u000a** I&#39;m amending my score to a proper 4.0 &amp; saying I found this to have a bit of a creeper effect for me in a good way lol I&#39;m a long time, high tolerance user so that was a nice surprise. Rock on!

VThis strain has a sweet berry scent and taste is great. Good for outdoor hiking even though the affect will ware out within 38 min and gives me cotton mouth. I give it a 3 1/2 \u2b50.
