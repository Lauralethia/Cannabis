VGot this from Seattle Cross, and it was supposedly a Sativa, and it certainly seems to be. Other sites have this strain as an indica, but there&#39;s no indica body buzz with this, it&#39;s a &quot;work&quot; strain. You will want to work, be busy, get stuff done. There&#39;s a good mental boost, but also energetic. Helps with anxiety as well.

VI am a total believer in this strain.  No couch lock with this strain.  I just harvested my first grow ever in hydro and it was recommended that I try this strain for what I was looking for and what I need.  Using the complete House &amp; Garden line my girls took off like wildfire.  Know knowing how important a good flush is I am glad I had expert advice from around the world in helping this grow come out amazing.  It burns clean, has a freaking amazing smell - more like mango, and tastes wonderful.  Using Boveda 62%&#39;s the buds are as light as a feather but they grind wonderfully and joints burn evenly.  And did I mention the smell!!!  \u000a\u000aI suffered a nasty motorcycle crash in 2004 breaking over 30 bones including a crushed rib cage, punctured lungs and a fractured skull. I get exquisite cramps in my chest as a result. Vaping this weed in my PAX I only need two puffs and the cramps go away. \u000a\u000aAlso, the yield from this weed is crazy.  A well done SCROG could easily net close to two pounds per plant.  It&#39;s a very forgiving strain and I highly recommend it for a first time grower.\u000a\u000aI will also note that until late flower, this weed has a freshly made coffee aroma.  I noticed this immediately and was convinced when a few friends also noted it.\u000a\u000a-This strain is not available anywhere near me here in Boston so it&#39;s a nice treat for my MMJ friends.

VGot a 8th from a buddy at Dope Magazine last night. Nice medium size dense nugs, light green with dark undertones and orange hairs, very kiefy. Break open a nug and your slapped by a powerful citrus fruity pine aroma and the sight of very light green with layers of tricombs. Tastes of citrus fruit with earthy background, maybe some diesel? Might just be dirty pipe I&#39;m getting at the very end, either way it tastes amazing. First bowl down and my effects are heavy eyes, dry mouth, very relaxed euphoria throughout my back. Deltron 3030 on the beat while trying to get some creative juices flowin in the wake n bake, but I&#39;m getting sleepy again.. Wouldn&#39;t recommend for morning use on a busy day. Over great relaxed high, happy and ready to go back to bed.

VA plus cannabis. No smell during production. Fast from start to finish. Dark Green foliage, light green flower. After curing the exotic smell is one of a kind. Definitely a sweet,tropical aspect to the smell, when pinched very unique honey, whiskey like stench detected. Stimulating at first, clear headed throughout and one of the most raging body highs on planet if you up the intake. 2-3 good hours effects wise...Can&#39;t express my affection for this strain enough.

VThere are two different papayas out there. If you have the one that smells like mango, this strain was originally titled Pez from Portland, OR. I absolutely loved the smell, taste and high and asked my friend to procure a cutting. After months I finally got it and we decided to change the name as we already had a Pez from Lopez Island which actually smelled just like Pez candy. One of the gals said our &quot;Oregon Pez&quot; smelled like papaya. It&#39;s more like a mango smell to me but Papaya stuck. Soon became a Seattle classic. I got the cutting in 1998. Love this strain.

Fruity and peppery, definitely makes me cough, however it&#39;s a cold night and I&#39;ve got some warm tea, and with my depression, anxiety, and insomnia really attacking me hardcore tonight, I&#39;m grateful my buddy grew some of this stuff. Perfect body buzz, great uplifting and smooth head change that has brought me to a chill, even-keeled mental clarity, with remarkable, almost anxiolytic effects that have made my sadness and sleeplessness a care of the past. Great strain when you&#39;re going through some tough times. B+ rating. Have a drink (makes you cough) - and enjoy the relaxing Papaya!

VI&#39;ve gotten papaya twice. the first time was kind of a while ago, I only got a gram and nothing really special stood out to me, I just remember not completely hating it which is why I got it a second time. got an 8th this time and it doesn&#39;t even seem like the same strain. sooo much better then the first batch. so either way, it&#39;s good shit. deff try it.

VThis was a dependable outdoor strain here in my 6a agriculture zone.  Came down with mites throughout the grow but I took care of them with Neem.  The taste is good and lives to its name and the high is pleasant and not overpowering.  I think this would be a good Indica for a new smoker/grower.  I took it around September 15th.\u000a\u000aI did not experience dry eye or cotton mouth, but it does cause the munchies.  I made cannabis coconut oil with some of this and accidentally ate way too much one night.  It did cause a bit of paranoia but it was transient and not overpowering. \u000a\u000aI use this strain for insomnia, tremors, arthritis in my neck and spine and headaches.  While I do smoke it, the cannabis coconut oil is EXCELLENT for insomnia and headaches and I don&#39;t know what I would do without it.

VWhen I first tried and tasted this particular strain I immediately fell in love with it. I never had been one for all the hype in assorted flavors and colors in the many forms that marijuana has taken throughout the years. I have always been a fan and still am; OG Kush. It will always be my number one go-to weed. However, Papaya, with its fruity smell as if I am standing in the fruit section at a farmer&#39;s market, not to mention the delicate taste of what it smells like, made this NOW a personal favorite of mine as well. Papaya allows me to full relax and remain medicated for quite some hours. It does not leave me lazy and zombie-liked and in addition to all what it doesn&#39;t do...it doesn&#39;t give me a headache afterwards if I take a nap after my session. I yet to vape Papaya, my method is pre-rolled x-tra large Cyclone Raw papers, why not, decades of hand rolling has left my finger and thumb hurting. I&#39;m on the hunt for an equal or better strain, if there are any recommendations, I would surely appreciate it.

The Papaya I got had a total THC at just over 18% most of the stuff I smoke these days is in the mid 20s% range but the high on the papaya was just strong it has a great full body high and gets very relaxing perfect for just after work (before dinner).

VI love the sweet/fruity strains for the most part and this one is now on my list of liked. Hits you in the head giving a euphoric cerebral rush but then it moves through the rest of the body providing stress and pain relief in very little time at all. If used moderately you could get away with medicating during the day but its better suited for night time use to the casual user because of the Indica properties. Tight, chunky buds covered in trichs, this strain won&#39;t leave you wanting.

VInitial impression: I was sold on this pre-roll from a different place than my usual watering hole, at The Green Solution LLC, in Aurora, CO. I went on the advice of a friend to check out the dispensary, I will write a review on them in a different section (so check it out). I got a decent wiff of the joint as it was the only Indica dominant strain they had in pre-rolls at the time. I digress, my initial impression was just okay.\u000a\u000aI use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.\u000a\u000aAroma: 5.0\u000aI did not have a gargantuan jar of finely clipped buds to shove my head into. However, I did get a good waft of this joint in the medical container they gave me with it. The aroma of Papaya was light and floral. Surprisingly more floral than the name lent itself, . I do disagree with some of the reviews written about this strain in particular in that my specific beef is with the actual &quot;Papaya&quot; scent. I thought it was more menthol / chemical than anything almost like a diesel (lite). There is a litany of different smells and tastes with this strain, I feel it is an average middle of the road aroma. Nothing special and nothing really that sets it apart; just meh&#39;.\u000a\u000aTaste: 6\u000aThe taste was different, this is the most vivid description I can give about the taste. If one is familiar with carpet De-odorizer product in the powder form, that scent of the is how this strain taste. I think that is a pretty accurate and vivid description. The taste of this strain is different, not unique, just different. There was a menthol and chemical overtone to this strain, while an earthy pungent undertone lingered on my taste buds. It was okay cannabis.\u000a\u000aPotency: 6.0\u000aThe strength of this euphoria was mellow and relaxing. Not overpowering, but a little underwhelming. I would of thought with a strain with Cannabis Cup winning genetics would be a little more powerful, I was sadly underwhelmed. It was nice, is a fair and accurate description I feel; again, nothing really special.\u000a\u000aFinal opinion: This is one of those strains that was just average. AS I stated in an earlier post, I would hit it if someone passed it around, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to purchase it. If I could rate this a 2.5 stars I would. It is just average.\u000a\u000aTotal points awarded:  17 out of 30, this was an okay pre-roll, done with Big Bamb&#250; papers. The joint did not run or fall apart; it was a really well crafted joint, but that is about all it was. My opinion is this, this a great middle of the road strain to try if you re a first timer, its not to intense, its no push over either, its smells nice, and tastes okay. Its the perfect example of middle of the road I think there is.
