VI love Bay 11. This is a great Bay Area strain, and a phenomenal smoke. I like the sweet Berry and skunky flavors.  It is a great high--active, yet relaxed; and potent yet mellow. Bay 11 is a good strain for most casual smokers and cannoisseurs.

VI wish there were more strains like this. It has a very different flavor it&#39;s earthy but sweet almost like a tea flavor. The high is great almost perfect for daytime work week use. You get incredibly stoned while still being able to focus on what needs to get done. The only negative I&#39;ve ever heard is that on occasion if you are prone to it there&#39;s a slight chance of a panic attack. But I have to say I&#39;ve never personally met anyone who has had any problems. Anyway awesome strain great Sativa 5 stars!
