VThe immediate scent you get from just having it near you is that of a fresh wintergreen aroma. Once you break it up, you do start to smell the citrus as well as the freshness of the strain itself. Some indicas, once lit, do not carry the scent into a taste, but with True OG, you can taste the citrus with the cool wintergreen tones as well. Definitely helps with chronic pain and very relaxing. It&#39;s also great because helping with depression, it doesn&#39;t create any anxiety or paranoia as some others may tend to do slightly. You feel the euphoria at first then it smooths into a relaxed chill state of mind and winds you down. very good for people with racing thoughts, depression, anxiety, any phobias, hypertension, ADD or ADHD, mental illnesses in general and of course most of all chronic pain/nerve pain/all pain.

VAbsolutely can not get enough of this face melting, pain and anxiety/all worries and cares go up like smoke when you smoke even small amounts all stress &amp; tension melts away, relieving musle tension, from my muscle spasms and can control my anxiety just as good as clonazapam but not the horrible addiction both physical and mental.  Has such a lovely Odor and a delicious candy like flavour to match. The smell is something somewhat hard to put a name or scent to but evergreen &#127794;, pine, sweet earthy undertones with candy like sweetness this stain has little to no ceiling as I medicate with this strain day after day for a while now only switching up my flower strain but not very often, this is my or one of my favorite strains of ALL TIMES, as it\u2019s an amazing pain killer and anti-insomniac so might not be everyone\u2019s daytime smoke as it will most likely put them to sleep &#128564; if not used to the potency of this magical herb!

VTrue OG is an alluring Ocean-Grown species from Southern California that carries a full indica phenotype. It has several medical benefits such as pain, headache, and stress relief. \u000a\u000aAlthough it doesn&#39;t look very special (at first you might think that you&#39;ve been ripped off) every other attribute is simply infatuating. The smell is pungent but has a strong citrus/pine scent, enough so to clear your sinuses. Its earthy components adds to its thick but smooth smoke that allows for big hits.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a constant award winning strain that guarantees long lasting effects allowing the mind to comfortably maintain focus while completely relaxing the body. Even though its looks are deluding, votes have proven that it&#39;s a high quality strain that will surely benefit those who are wise enough to give it a try.

V&#127794;&#127942; True OG is phenomenal. Polaris has grown a very beautiful specimen here. Delicious piney and citrusy smells and tastes. One of the heavier trichome coated OGs I have come across! Absolutely gorgeous. The high was very strong, with an immediate cerebral blast off followed by an intense body high. This strain kept me clear headed but at the same time I felt pretty blasted. For sure a must try for the OG lover! b-Myrcene: 8.054 mg/g,   Limonene: 5.365 mg/g, Linalool: 1.336 mg/g, b-Caryophyllene: 4.107 mg/g.

VProbably the best OG out there, IMO, most definitely my Favorite OG.. Well Tied I guess with a &quot;Blue OG&quot; with colas the size of your forearm and Blue blue blue. Done ranting, to the TRUE OG.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s very consistent with potency, bag appeal affects, just what you expect every time, one of the reasons I live this girl, she never disappoints.\u000a\u000aMusky, Skunky, OG funk that is just typical of any decently bred OG strain. It&#39;s very sedating, ir more of a dreamy high, it will put you to sleep if you smone enough but a cpl hits before you start your day and you have a smile ear to ear, nothing seems to bother you, 2hrs later the munchies kick in but you eat and don&#39;t get tired and cone down like you&#39;d think. This is where the focus comes in and it has longs legs on the high, good for people who work on they&#39;re feet 8 to 12hrs a day, arthristis, insomnia, any pain and depression. This True OG is just that, everything you here and read from legends is what you will find in thus very very High Quality Medication, jack of all trades if you will. Highest THC% out if the 3 bathches I&#39;ve has tested at 24% or higher and CBD was mostly consistent around 0.8 - 1.6 and CBG and CBN were traceable but still high. When cured right and stored right it will be as good as the day you purchased it mine kept almost a month. This is in my top three.

VThe PR True OG from Green Cross is no doubt (in my mind) is as good as it gets.  Upon opening the jar, my nostrils were filled with the pungent piney aroma of the flower.  I was suggested to try just one hit and wait to see how it would hit me.  I&#39;m glad I followed the suggestion, because one hit and I was in heaven.  A pretty heavy indica, this did not put me down for the count but if I went to bed to sleep, went right to sleep.  Smooth, somewhat lung-expanding, and a clean smooth smoke.  This is in my top 2.

I take prescriptions that affect my appetite to the point that I can have one meal a day and be fine.  I take a bong rip and I&#39;m able to down a whole meal and wanting to eat more.  I&#39;ve tried a lot of indicas, even the moonrocks, and I find myself coming back for more True OG.  I get it  through Almighty Meds in Torrance.  Southbay homies should check it out (great prices too).  Everyone else - hope you&#39;re able to get your hands on this stuff because it works wonders

VA+ strain in my opinion. Being a Indica strain I am impressed by how functional I was on this on. I actually smoked about a half gram over a few bowl sessions between 11pm and 430am last night. I was hanging with a friend on a mountain then we just walked around and talked all night. Smoking a bowl here and there and talking. We sat outside the entire time. We were not yawning or to relaxed and getting stuck. We were both very comfortable, talkative, mellow, happy, we went and had some dinner. We both had a very enjoyable evening/morning.\u000a\u000aThe buds are very dark green and have a glimmering coating of trichomes. The smell from the jar is very evergreen/pine and a hint of citrus. Just as the description stated it would be. Very pleasant and beautiful smelling. The taste on inhale was earthy and citrus like, and on exhale it was very pine like with almost a spice to it. Very calming effects from the smells and taste. \u000a\u000aThis strain is pure dankness and such a wonderful medicine. I struggle with anxiety and depression and pain. Though I used this strain recreational this time I would have to say for anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, stress, maybe even ADD too idk. This strain is wonderful though.

VThe real deal.  Great indica dominant hybrid, as soon as I popped open the container that classic OG Kush smell came pouring out.  Piney, earthy, and very STRONG aroma.  Smoked a &quot;regular&quot; sized bowl and within a few minutes the effects came on very strong.  Great euphoric and trippy high, with significant body sensations typical of an indica.  Its not overly heavy however, you&#39;re able to function if you want, but it will be hard to focus.  Smoke a lot of it and it will knock you out, however.  A little less &quot;earthy&quot; and wood tasting than OG Kush and instead adds a very pleasant citrus aftertaste,  overall a very enjoyable smoke.  I have a sentimental spot for OG Kush related strains, and this one definitely did not disappoint &#128563;

VIt does give me that tired,heavy body feel, like an indica should, but it also gives me an insane head high. Smoked a bowl and just sat and stared at the world around me thinking \u201cwow everything is so beautiful!\u201d However the dry mouth I experience with this strain is honestly far worse than any other strain. It seems like no amount of water makes it go away until the high wears off. And if you\u2019re not a fan of the munchies STAY AWAY. When I first started smoking I never understood the stereotype that weed makes you hungry, until I tried this stuff. I probably ate more in a 30 minutes than I did all day. \u000aOverall I\u2019d say this strain is for the loner stoner end of the day. I notice when I\u2019m with friends it\u2019s difficult to focus. However I love taking a few hits then snuggling up in a comfy bed and reading a good book or listening to music.

I feel like I can hear a baby snoring a mile away. a good high to have for a long ride. just body enough that you&#39;d be agreeable to a long couch ride. but the gears turn enough that you flip through movies of your past lives keeping you brain churning enough just to stay out of the murky waters. it&#39;s earthy. leaves a bitter aftertaste. it&#39;ll be the type of high you can&#39;t hide. feels like a well balanced hybrid.

VThis is one of my favorite strains I&#39;ve tried. The high comes on slowly, as other users have noted, and bring with it relaxation and tension relief, but without the couchlock and spaciness of your typical indica. I have ADHD, and I don&#39;t take medication for it yet; this flower gives a perfect balance of focus and relaxation for the mind going 500 miles an hour. \u000a\u000aI love this strain because it gives me all my favorite benefits of an indica while still being able to sit down and get stuff done. If you&#39;re looking for a sleepytime toke, i would recommend looking for a more classic indica strain. It only made me sleepy on the comedown, and even then it made me feel like I had taken some benadryl or something.\u000a\u000aOther than that, there&#39;s not many negative things to say about this one. &quot;True&quot;ly one of my all-time favs.

VWow, How do I start? I was asking a friend if they had an Idea on what could knock out a horse! ( I don&#39;t sleep at ALL since I&#39;ve had my gastric bypass, I go for DAYS without sleeping) We went and he (My friend) showed me what would be the best. True OG or another brand. I bought True OG.\u000aSo , I was getting ready for a great TV show or something on the T.V. and to try my new concentrated (Wax) strain. So I have my cup of tea (No I am not old lol) and my snacks in case I get the munchies like I do with a few other strains right before I go to sleep. \u000aSo I am getting ready an I am in bed and I took 3 big puffs like I do with another brand. \u000aBIG MISTAKE!\u000aI went into giggles , then talking off my husbands head to going to a OMG state to .... ZZZZ state. I think I was asleep in about 20 mins. \u000a**When I took my meds before I had a card several years ago this would of been great instead of 5 different kinds of meds to get me to sleep and then takes over 2 hrs, This was little under 20 mins!**\u000aNO JOKE! THIS STRAIN IS NOT FOR THE BEGINNERS! \u000aI don&#39;t know if you can call me a intermediate or just a beginner but lordy lordy.  Its a great strain if you need your sleep. A lil go along ways! \u000aIf you are need a great strain that just melts away your pain, thoughts, scared, Take a hit or two (experienced) and I am telling you...Be pre-paired to talk, laugh, and then CRASH!\u000aMy husband is going to buy stock in this cause he said this is the only strain that shuts me up quick! I guess I like to talk when I am high.. Hahahaha who doesn&#39;t!\u000aI give this strain a 2 thumbs up in Z -formation! SNAPS!

VTrue OG is a fabulous night time strain. It provides a nice relaxing, body stoning effect that eventually leads to sedation. I use this soon before bed and to top up in the wee hours. It helps to ease my chronic pain and facilitates sleep. It does not cause any anxiety as some Indicas do but it results in a very dry mouth, so keep lots of water handy. I would recommend this strain for anyone looking for pain and insomnia relief.

VIt was a sharp high, very fast acting and lasted quite a while. It took away my muscle and joint pain but left me with a headache. Citrus and sage smoke with a slighty harsh pull.

VI LOVE this strain! It&#39;s a 10/10.  Exactly what I needed to become balanced. Like the universe gave me a big hug and melted any worries away, and added in some good luck magic. It reminds me of the highs I had back-in-the 90&#39;s - the familiar smell and experience of being in my early 20&#39;s, laughing and feeling carefree. This medicine is Strong.  Gives an excellent body buzz and frame of mind. I feel sexy, confident, cooler, happy, content, encouraged, self-love, creative, philosophical, satisfied, like everything is right in my life. My sense of taste and touch has increased. I&#39;m horny, tingly and feel great, like my whole body is having an orgasm. Everthing tastes better (the Haagen Dazs Peanut-butter salted fudge) and my body is extra-aware of touch. Orgasms are better than usual. Good pain relief. Nerve pain is completely gone, but I still feel muscle and joint pain- but less than usual. Mentally clear thoughts, but they flow slower and can get side tracked on analyzing something or thinking creatively. Dry mouth was minimal and kicked-in an hour after starting. Would be a great strain to do with friends. Excellent for depression, stress, anxiety, nerve pain, low libido. Everybody needs to try this!

VA real indica indeed. This smells strong and earthy and definitely has a pungent kick to it. Got this at the local dispensary and asked for a good Indica so this was immediately recommended. Anyhow, packed my one-hitter for a few hits and immediately moved onto the bong for a fresh, crisp, bowl of this amazing Indica. The high is AH-MAZING! Absolutely mellow, focused, relaxed, and just f*cking happy. If you like indicas like I do, you MUST try this.

VSo before I give my review to you guys this definitely is top shelf. I was going to start the review but I took a bong toke and a few  rips out of my piece and forgot the name completely! Hahaha. Anyways this bud is one of the best OG KUSH phenotype around. Super chill and that danky evergreen taste of a true quality OG. I will be purchasing a large amount. Hope they aren&#39;t out at the dispensary I was at! Cheers

VPretty intense head high for an indica. The high is all over the entire body and very relaxing. The high is actually so strong, it&#39;s almost psychedelic. Music and visuals suddenly become very appealing and interesting. Legs turned to jello after an hour though and I had to find somewhere to sit and relax. Overall, a very interesting strain, and one of the first I ever tried about 4 years ago. The smell is STRONG. Very pungent skunky earthy straight up strong weed odor. Be careful with this one if you are trying to be stealthy. The taste is kind of bitter, but definitely tolerable.

VPurchased at Denver med dispensary. True OG live resin. If your going to try this strain in concentrate form go with Live if the option is available. Expensive but if ur looking for the best taste it&#39;s your choice. Best OG I&#39;ve ever had hands down. The piney woodsy earthy taste with a slight lemony citrus twist is unbelievably strong smoking it through my vap pen. Coats ur tastebuds for a good 30-60 seconds after exhale. The high is everything you imagine or Know an OG to be. High as Fuck. Highly recommend.

VKasmoss hit the nail on the head with this review. I had very similar experience to his  as it really did make me feel normal. The day I got some delivered, I was having a horrible day and this strain really just dissolved the HUGE amounts of stress and anxiety I was experiencing .Three puffs from my flower mate in I was still able to get my chores done! A very mellow, functional body high! And the flavor was amazing! very earthy with notes of orange on the exhale. Reeks so be careful&#128551;

VHoly shit. Knockout punch right here. From fully stressed from my day to brace for couch lick without a care in the world in 2 point bubbler hit. Big time sleepy with a deep, heavy full body relax. The chill is strong with this one. Straight up good night kiss. Definitely not a daytime smoke. Maybe a 1 hitter just to get a mellow on but the stone True packs hits like like a ton of bricks and leaves you locked in for hours. Stone lets off and leaves you in this perfect, long lasting mellow. Total melt away stress killer but hard not to nap.\u000a\u000aTasty as hell. Tastes lead off with a dirty, woody, smoky but smooth draw kinda like the air around a camp fire that someone threw someone threw some wet bark into smells but a taste instead. Little hint of skunky goodness on the exhale with a nice pine backer. \u000a\u000aMe and the wife agree, this is definitely the True....OG

VThis wasn&#39;t a strain I intended on buying so I got myself a nice 1/4 - despite it being on sale at the time on PotCargo. I find myself becoming a herb connoisseur; kinda like those wine tasters but instead preserving the effects. This is a really mellow, relaxing and calm/focused high. You become peaceful with yourself and can just enjoy the moment.\u000a\u000aI find myself not allowing myself become distracted or bothered by anything outside of my tasks or loss any ability to concentrate. It&#39;s a really smooth vape too.\u000a\u000aSome other strains make you feel stupid but this one actually helps me gather my thoughts.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ll definitely pick this one up again in the future. Side-note: this stain will help you be relaxed enough to fall asleep (not immediately but in due time).

VI&#39;ve tried many indicas and indica-dominate hybrids and this one works the best for me.  I have bad insomnia - two bowl rips and I drift off to sleep.  I take other meds for my bipolar and GAD that really curb my appetite.  Definitely no resistance to food after consuming some true og.  After one toke, I&#39;m immediately filled with euphoria, not the euphoria that makes you want to cry because you&#39;re so elated; but just a slight &quot;lift&quot; in my spirits from baseline.  My thoughts don&#39;t drift; I&#39;m focused.  In terms of anxiety, I&#39;d say it helps with it.  After a stressful, long day at work true og helps me unwind.  I don&#39;t forget about the day, rather I reason within myself of why certain things happened, and really come to a happy medium with feelings of &quot;everything is A okay.&quot;  I don&#39;t really have pain so can&#39;t say it helps with that... overall my favorite indica.  I get it delivered by Almighty Meds in the South Bay (excellent prices btw, cheapest flower around the Torrance area).

VFantastic ! ! ! \u000aThis one is really dense. Like green knobby golf balls covered in sugar.\u000aVery Dark Green with a White/Purple sheen. Small little calyx and short lil hairs, but bulky and chunky.\u000a\u000aThe smell is incredible when True Og expresses it&#39;s true charecteristics. A very winter green and fuel smell, not minty, but a fresh pine tree in the winter with a whif of gasoline. \u000a\u000aSmokes nice and slow with a melty quality to it. \u000aTastes like pine tree: a bit sappy with a sour citrus finish.  A touch harsh because of the leaves and taste...Probably better for a vape.

VMy favorite OG. It might be my favorite indica. This strain of original OG Kush was grown out for years by a dispensary in San Jose until it reached its full, perfected potential; hence the &quot;True OG&quot; name. She&#39;s powerful, go into it with a good mindset for relaxing bliss. Medical patients will forget their pain.

VIt&#39;s got a nice body high feeling to it. Your mind is overwhelmed because your box is so far out of the box, it&#39;s feels like I&#39;m wired while I&#39;m sitting completely still. But this sensation depends on how much you smoke. me and my wife have smoked an 8th in a matter of.hours... we are pretty baked. Definitely gets one horny, basically all day... especially if mixed with some J1. I give it a ten because my whole body is relaxed and I know for sure I&#39;m going to have a good night&#39;s rest. until next time!  Follow on instagram &gt;&gt;&gt;#StayBlazedBoi

You are the driver with True OG, you\u2019re not strapped to a rocket like i was with Deadhead OG or Candyland. \u000a\u000aAnd i agree with the others, while i am pleasantly relaxed, i can still have intelligent conversations and i feel more creative. \u000aThe flavor and aroma of this strain is incredible, like a forest smacked you and tasting like spearmint and citrus. \u000a\u000aIf you can, try True OG you wont regret it.

You can pick it up and it actually snaps when you break it. It&#39;s really light gold color and it&#39;s awesome. I&#39;ve never tried true Og flower but this is one of the better concentrates I&#39;ve tried and I&#39;m what you might call a dab connesueir or however u spell that lol.\u000aIt&#39;s hard to place the taste, but it really had me relaxed I felt good and somewhat of a head buzz goin on too but not too much it was mostly Indica.\u000aI am very picky which is why I only gave it 4 stars but I will tell u it was one of the better ones I&#39;ve tried.

Vthis strain is definitely in my top 10 list. true og has a deeply enjoyable taste with smooth earthy titles and noticeable zesty aromas. the head high is focused, relaxed but not too heavy to fall to bed after the first spliff. i used it after work to put me in the way of relaxing but still able to play around and be active of the rest of the day. noticeable that i didnt feel munchies after smoking it.

THC on mine was at 23.0% so you know it was the shit!  This reminds me a bit of Blue Dream, nice and even, relaxing, but with enough uplift so you don&#39;t knock out.

VI had this strain a few days ago. It smelled pretty lemony with a bit of pine, just like in the bud description. The smoke smelled sort of like chemicals. It is a heavy smoke and really expands the lungs. You feel the effects come on pretty quick. It makes your eyes start feeling heavy, and then BOOM, you know your baked. It&#39;s sort of a creeper. It is mostly a head high, with a very slight body high. You feel aroused, relaxed, and calm. When you are coming down, the tiredness begins to settle in pretty heavily. Very good strain for night time use and sleep trouble.

VI had my buddy pick up some for me at a local dispensary. I am a lightweight, and it usually takes about a bowl for me to be at a good high. I smoked roughly two and a half bowls of this and hardly felt a thing. I was high for about 30 minutes, and I smoked some more but it didn&#39;t increase the high. Maybe it was this strain in particular, I&#39;m not sure. But I didn&#39;t have the best experience with this strain.

VTrue OG review:\u000a\u000aUpon arrival home with my new Medical Marijuana (which was highly recommended), I began the anticipation with an oral ingestion via smoking apparatus of True OG. \u000aFirst few tastes, or &quot;greens,&quot; were harsh and unflavourable. I coughed for a solid two minutes.  It did, however, smell very pleasant. \u000a\u000aA half an hour into my journey, I \u000adiscovered I was completely immobile from my uncomfortable sitting position and experienced a short-tempered conversation with my significant other. I couldn&#39;t finish complete sentences and became side-tracked very easily. I decided to give up talking altogether and tried to enjoy the uncommonly nice weather in my state. \u000aI couldn&#39;t focus on just one thought at a time  though. Everything swarmed me in increments of highs and lows. It was nauseating. \u000a\u000aI lost track of time and noticed that my companion had left me a while ago. I decided to hoist myself up from my chair and attempt to make it to my bed. \u000aThis did not go well. \u000aI finally made it to my bedroom after taking a wrong turn in my own house and attempted to find a suitable sleeping position. \u000aMy partner appeared shortly after and offered to rub my back for me. I was quick with a snotty remark (uncommon in my demeanor) and ignored my agitation.\u000aI fell asleep quickly, but mind you, I did not stay asleep long. Three or four hours later, I woke up from back pain. My other trusted, reoccurring MMJ doses/flavours I use allow me to slumber for longer periods of time then True OG. \u000aI woke up the next morning groggy and stiff. It was not pleasant. \u000a\u000aAll in all, I would rate this sample of Marijuana a 1.5/5 stars. \u000a
