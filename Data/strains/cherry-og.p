VCertainly one of the best strains ever encountered, purchased some for recreational purposes and found this perfectly hybrid 50/50 to induce its relaxing effects on the body and mind at the beginning of the high and 20 minutes later finding myself on a scenic walk on the beach. Its effects lasts for a few hours and mellows both your body and mind out. Still motivated to exercise! Very smooth taste and burn, barely any harshness involved.

VCherry OG&#39;s feel-good balance amazes me. I find it to yield about a 60/40 head/body high. Dosing method is 0.5g AVITAS vape cartridge on med-high (yellow) setting on a LINX battery. She&#39;s strong enough to get me flying in two 6-8 second pulls. As other reviewers mentioned, the high lasts for several hours. Great mood lifter and worry chaser. Corporeal pain is reduced 50%, but feels like more thanks to happy, engaging cerebral activity. This and my standby sativa, Maui Wowie, are daily favorites.

VWell holy cow. Where do I begin?  Do I tell people how much I think about sex after using this product?   Or how much it makes me laugh?   This is indeed a nice blend of something that creates fun thoughts in the mind while not making the body feel heavy, but the body does feel pretty darn relaxed.  Smooth taste.  Nice to look at - colorful buds that feel nice. Music sounds better, I think. I&#39;m a big Blues fan and the guitar work seems to jump out at me, maybe because I look for it. I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d rate this but would surely put this in consideration for a top shelf experience any day of the week. Not bad at night but one must tolerate going through some fun thoughts on the way to a deeper relaxation. Not a bad way to drift off.....

VCherry OG is one of my favorite daytime strains. The price is very reasonable, I pay $15 for 3.5g. I am a heavy smoker, and this is a hard hitting strain. It hits smooth with minimal coughing, and eases my mind and body into a state of happy relaxation. It provides me with a positive state of mind and it is a fantastic way to start my day. The Cherry is a nice even hybrid that relaxes my anxiety without making me drowsy. With just a couple hits I get the sativa effects of wanting to get things done, and a few more puffs and I&#39;m ready to relax. For me it is a fabulous strain to use regularly for my symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, pain, and mood swings. 5 stars and I will continue to purchase.

Vthis specific batch was from Qualcan quality cannabis Las Vegas Nevada in 2017 purchased from CannaCopia on South Rainbow for $42.69 out the door, 35 before tax. at first I was a little disappointed because even though the display showed great colors of purple and red and smelled all right when I got it home the stuff wasn&#39;t as colorful as the display. but I was quickly and put to ease when I open the container and I smelled fresh cherries. It was a great smell and the first bowl was even better than expected. it&#39;s a great strain for relaxing after work or trying to help yourself go to sleep will definitely buy again

VThis is one of my all-time favorite strains. It gives a great high that starts from a little head high and relaxation, then midway enters euphoria, and lastly, you feel your cheeks are numb, and it&#39;s hysterical. I especially like the euphoria stage. I love its aroma. The flower I got was a teensy bit dry, so I&#39;m curious to see what differences there would be if the buds were fresher and more dense. It is quite smooth to smoke. Five stars!

VCherry where have you been my whole life!!! Talk about a perfect blend. Not couch locked but very head high. I think I might write a novel, or possibly stare at a wall for long periods of time. The taste is very sweet. Almost like a swisher sweet cigar. I get undertones of earthy flavors but more sweet then anything. This is a Must have if your looking for a great head high. On the medical side I can def feel pain relieving effects. I would have to say some must have places to be under the brain effect of this one:\u000a\u000aPlane - NO\u000a\u000aHiking or nature trails - YES\u000a\u000aConcerts, ballgames, or really any sports - YES\u000a\u000aMovies - YES\u000a\u000aDinner/Munchies/Buffet - Yes and No - Doesn\u2019t really bring on the munchies to sit and have a mellow dinner but I could see me eating a buffet worth of Soup dumplings or all you can eat crab legs. \u000a\u000aSitting by Fire - Most Def. \u000a\u000aI am a fan of being a home chef.

VBeing a light weight, I always get told to try some new strains by my friends. That is how I found cherry OG. When I opened that gram, I smelled it. The aroma was not very strong and it felt like it would crumble in my fingers. I put a piece in my bong and shotgunned it. Holy fuckin hell.. that THC hit me hard. It started in the back of my head, then slowly spread through my body. It was a fantastic strain to try and is definitely going to be bought by me again. I recommend this to any light weight that wants a nice and heavy head high that blossoms into a full body high! Only downside is the extreme cotton mouth and the hunger.

VThe first few bowls were okay. This 50/50 strain gave me a light euphoric high followed by relaxation. The flavor is light and pleasant. \u000a\u000aFor me the high wore off pretty quick and gave me the munchies right away.  \u000a\u000aNot the best strain in the world but it&#39;s almost decent.

VCherry where have you been my whole life!!! Talk about a perfect blend. Not couch locked but very head high. I think I might write a novel, or possibly stare at a wall for long periods of time. The taste is very sweet. Almost like a swisher sweet cigar. I get undertones of earthy flavors but more sweet then anything. This is a Must have if your looking for a great head high. On the medical side I can def feel pain relieving effects. I would have to say some must have places to be under the brain effect of this one:\u000a\u000aPlane - NO\u000a\u000aHiking or nature trails - YES\u000a\u000aConcerts, ballgames, or really any sports - YES\u000a\u000aMovies - YES\u000a\u000aDinner/Munchies/Buffet - Yes and No - Doesn\u2019t really bring on the munchies to sit and have a mellow dinner but I could see me eating a buffet worth of Soup dumplings or all you can eat crab legs. \u000a\u000aSitting by Fire - Most Def. \u000a\u000aI am a fan of being a home chef. I CANNOT WAIT to try some new inventive recipes after a RAW Cone of this.

VTried this via Avitas Pax Era cartridge. I\u2019m more of an indica kinda fella, so I just take tiny little hits of this. It\u2019s obviously strong, and it smells/tastes like, well... cherries. I can see how this would have the potential to make someone jittery, but properly dosed, it is a very nice, awake high.\u000a\u000aAvitas has several cartridges available for the Era. They\u2019re still a little hard to find in WA, but they\u2019re high quality and very convenient when you can\u2019t load a bowl. Stealth for sure.

VSmoked this in a flavored blunt wrap and really enjoyed it- although I know flavored wraps aren&#39;t everyone&#39;s jam, I think the berry flavor of the flower will go well with any plan or flavored wrap you choose. Buzz from the wrap definitely amped up the sativa effects of the flower, but without drowning out the relaxation and euphoria. This seems like a good hybrid to smoke during the day, without a doubt thanks to its OG lineage, and to top it off it smells woooonderful. Def a new favorite.
