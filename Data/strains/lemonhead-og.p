VLemonhead OG is definitely a good sativa dominate hybrid! It gives you this focused, uplifted and euphoric sativa high with a nice indica relaxed kick to it but not overwhelming that will get you couch locked. The flavor has this very fresh floral like taste to it that is very smooth with a pungent sweet lemon smell that taste exactly like a lemonhead with piney and earthy undertones. Perfect for daytime use

VFebruary is my least favorite winter month in Maryland. I\u2019ve usually exhausted my imagination of indoor projects (not an indoor kind of person). The challenge to stay motivated and keep my mood optimistic during this month is usually met w/defeat. Tried this incredible strain in its concentrated form. One dab and it was as if someone flipped the lights on in a dark room. I can\u2019t express how quickly my mood shifted from the blahs-of-February-blues to gratitude of just being alive to enjoy the day. Highly recommend for depression, motivation &amp; creativity based tasks.

VLemonhead OG was a nice strain, wonderful tastes, smells and effects make this a favorite for me. The smell is a very lemon peel like smell, with sweet floral accents to follow, tingling the nose and sinuses with its pungent fragrance. The tasted matched the smell (as expected) and amplified with a candy lemon taste reminiscent of the namesake candies. The effects were enlightenling, a nice euphoric feeling with a relaxing rollback that kept me up, but still relaxed and stress free. I will definitely try this strain again, and others definitely should as well

It&#39;s wonderful for depression, in aromatherapy lemon keeps the blues away making it an extra dose of anti depressant power!\u000aRight now I&#39;m using it to help me relax before bed.

VThis is by far my favorite strain. And trust me- I&#39;ve had some of the most rare strains known worldwide. Instantly became a top five off the smell alone. Straight Loud reeking of good vibes. Then I smoke it and I&#39;m blown away by the unique flavor profile. Think Lemon Haze but sweeter, stronger, &amp; smoother. This shit makes me happy asf... I&#39;m sure the supply is limited so I want to ration the smoke, but sheesh can&#39;t keep my hands off it. God Bless the hands that grew this amazing herbs and those alike. I&#39;m very impressed by this strain and it&#39;s effects. \u000a\u000a10 stars/5 \u000aCertified Must Try

VLooking for weed for migraines. Have tried a few and I am now registered in the state of Maryland for medical weed. Tried the Lemonhead OG cartridge. Thought I had taken a small dose with the vape but it was an immediate and very disturbing high. Migraine disappeared but I was dizzy, seeing things, off kilter, anxious for hours. 12 hours later and after sleeping I am still high. I know this can have an extremely high THC level and I know that I am reacting to that most probably. I loved the &quot;flavor&quot; but I don&#39;t think I will be trying this again.

Good even head/body high. The \u201cbud-tender\u201d recommended this strain and I\u2019m glad he did THC of 23% and very smooth smoke compared to some other lemony tasting flower out there.

It&#39;s taste is pretty great too. It reminds me of hard sugary candy. I didn&#39;t taste any lemon or citrus though. It has large dense buds and it hits HARD. By the end of a single joint I was in a different galaxy. It starts with pressure behind the eyes then a cerebral fog. That fog just keeps growing. Absolutely do not smoke if you have anything to do.

VThis very quickly became my favorite strain. It enhances whatever activity you&#39;re about to perform. Need to get work done? Great, Lemonhead OG will help you focus. Want to go for a walk in the woods? Great, it will make you really aware of your surroundings and help pass the time showing you interesting things.\u000a\u000aIn a bad mood? Lemonhead OG will get you out of it.\u000a\u000aHave social anxiety? Lemonhead OG will relax you and have you talking with folks right out of the gate.\u000a\u000aThis is definitely a hybrid, but for me had very sativa-like qualities without any hint of paranoia or anxiety, even if I take one-hit-too-many. That&#39;s a nice safety buffer to have.\u000a\u000aI got this in 510 Vape Cartridge form, Kiff branded. I share the brand (purchased Nevada area) because of the work they do on the flavors. Instead of just tasting like your normal vape cartridges MCT oil, this tastes truly like the candy Lemonheads. I didn&#39;t believe it at first, but it&#39;s there in spades. Really tasty!
