VWow... I really like this one more in the daytime, when I need a little chill time. I was amazed just how much I was able to power through and focus on, while I was still just chillin.

VThis Indica Hybrid starts off with a very Sweet Citrus with Turpentine smell and smokes very sweet. When ground up it gives off a bit of Dank Cheese and the smoke is very smooth. Great for people who smoking flowers makes them cough. The high is very heady at first but turns into a relaxed euphoria that makes you want to stretch out on the couch and chill. Overall a great smoke for unwinding at the end of the day.
