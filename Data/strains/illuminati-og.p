VVaped this OG, it&#39;s my #1 go to right now, whenever 3C has it. Totally mellows out the thought process. Turns thoughts into ideas, Resolves stress. Makes for great conversations. Eases the body into a relaxed state &amp; from there a I can settle in for some perfect zzzzzzz.

VHad really high hopes for this one because the scent was so interesting. But the vape wasn&#39;t dry and a bit too harsh.

VSo I had my first chance to sample this herb today. I really liked it. Illuminati gave me the body buzz of an indica with a light head high. I had a good burst of energy in the beginning but after about four hours I felt a little drowsy. I guess that&#39;s when you should smoke more, right?\u000a\u000aI&#39;d give it a try. Mine was only 8.5 THC and it was a great feeling buzz, and worked to take away my back and ankle pain.
