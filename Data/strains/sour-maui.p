Vby far the best strain I have had in a long time. a couple bong rips and I don&#39;t even know how I am typing thing. flavor is absolutely amazing and leaves a great aftertaste. I have already went to 711 4 times within 30 minutes so it definitely gives you an appetite. I suggest getting all your stuff before hand. not because it is couch locking, just because the high is so good you just want to focus on it and enjoy it.

VOne of my favorite Sativas; Sour Maui has a quick clean come-up and a breezy head high with a delicate lifted body. This is a thinker, a checklister, a spring cleaner; enjoy this high with a lightly-clouded 22C and a salty breeze on a 50cc motorbike.\u000a\u000aFour stars because the odor and flavor leave a lot to be desired. I&#39;d like to see the light-high qualities pushed a bit richer and then hybridize with something super with a citrusy blueberry or dark raspberry flavor.

VSo this strain is a fucking incredible. It has your typical Sativa effects but it&#39;s different. I will explain later. Now, the smell in this strain is very smooooooooooooth, sweet, and very &quot;tropical&quot; like. The buds looked good too. The taste is exactly how it smells and you can definitely taste the smoothness and the tropical like fruits from this strain. As for the high and how it differs? Well, a lot of Sativas give you this very &quot;tingly&quot; and &quot;muffins baking in the oven&quot; feeling in the head. Well, this one felt more of a &quot;Ocean waters majestically and calmly crashing against the shore, while you sit there, sipping your fruit cocktail laying on the beach, enjoying life. Yeah, you some energy to spare, but you don&#39;t want to. You just want to relax, enjoy life while you&#39;re high.&quot; type of high. This strain can be enjoyed by beginners, cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs alike. Highly recommend this strain!

VThis strain is absolutely beautiful! I had a stressful day at work, and Sour Maui just killed any stress or anxiety that I had! Not only did it clear my mind, but it made me SO happy. I also got a boost of energy and felt the need to dance around the house. I never felt sleepy, so I recommend this for morning up to late afternoon.

VI had half an ounce of this lovely flower from Trinidad, it was gone like magic! Major Sativa, gives you an extremely happy high lasting a little under 2 hours. The taste isn&#39;t my favorite but the train is a Top 3 in my favorite Sativas. Definitely pick up some of this strain if you get the chance

VThis is another great strain that is expanding my love of good sativas. Very smooth hitting head high that settles slowly into a chill body high. The euphoric head high persists, leading to giggles and talkativeness, although staying on a single topic was a challenge! Nicely long lasting, munchies , and a very slow come down. Another nice benefit was excellent pain relief. Good strain!
