VI used this strain for appetite and nausea. First off, the taste is strange. It is unremarkable at first, but a second after exhale there is a definite intense sweet flavor. I can see how this strain would be good for depression or anxiety because about 2 minutes after smoking I was embraced by a long lasting feeling of calm upbeat relaxation. Nausea was also soothed, with some appetite boost. I&#39;d say this is better as a nighttime strain. It&#39;s not exactly sedating but it definitely made a warm blanket on the couch seem delicious. I can&#39;t imagine attempting to be productive after using it

VEhhhh never been the biggest fan of the bubblegum strain. This was promised to be Stoney by a budtender in Oregon when I recently went. After opening the package it brought back memories of when I smoked in high school. Smelled like hay and tasted strong. I&#39;ll give it 3 stars for the first 15 minutes of being very high then it&#39;s done. But the quarter was only 20 bucks so yeah probably a lot better with another grower.

VFirst thing I noticed when I smelled it was the intense bubble gum scent.I tend to like strains that taste like foods,it definitely satisfied my craving for something sweet and yummy.Also has undertones of a funky pine tree forest.Highly recommended smoking this from a vape or paired with some Juicy Jays cotton candy papers(you&#39;ll thank me later for that last suggestion.)Great for just relaxing on the couch or a night around the fire pit.Truly a fun hybrid,you won&#39;t be disappointed with this strain.

VLast time I was in Amsterdam, I pretty much ate, smoke and vaped Bubblegum for 2 weeks.  It was pure heaven.  So after reading about this strain, I decided to give it a go.  Wow, I&#39;m glad I did.\u000a\u000aAfter a few hits, I was feeling that great buzz I remember from 5 years ago.  A great body buzz...not too intense, but just right.  No couch lock here.  But as well, a nice head buzz.  Overall, it&#39;s very very relaxing, but keeps you alert as well.  Love this stuff!  Perfect for a relaxing evening at home watching Netflix.

VBubblicious is essentially a highly-refined Bubble Gum, which automatically makes it a real treat as long as it was grown under optimal conditions as well as dried and cured properly. Grown correctly, Bubblicious has an incredibly sweet smell to it that really, truly smells and tastes of pink bubblegum. The high is also excellent for a mildly indica-dominant hybrid - great for videogames and hanging out with friends (this strain reliably gives me and my friends huge giggle-fits every time we smoke it). It has a warm body high as well but it&#39;s not couchlocking whatsoever so it&#39;s good as a daytime smoke though not a great choice for insomnia. Overall a great strain that lives up to its name more than any other.

VIt tastes and smells just like pink bubblegum, mostly on the exhale. A very heavy head stone, not one of my fav&#39;s as I like higher CBD nighttime for sleep and body pain. I would say it is closer to a 50/50 staying around the middle, at least the phenotype that I just grew. Nice heavy heavily sugared buds, a new fav of hubby&#39;s as he loves high THC as a regular all day user.

VReally enjoyed this strain.  Caught me off guard a little for several reasons the first being it was a $5 gram. Occasionally as the days get shorter my mood takes on a jaded, slightly pissy Debbie Downer grumpitude expecting things to suck or at least be as is.  And let&#39;s face it 5 bucks for a gram is about a 1/25 bet it isn&#39;t gonna be heady, but it will smoke.  Occasionally seeds. Puff the whole gram in one sitting to catch a lil buzz, maybe just light headed. \u000a\u000aIt is fun to try different strains and honestly it is primo compared to brown brick weed. The odds are way better in my neck of the woods anyway since a bad trim job on super heady flower will be priced as such.  That is cool with me especially when running across this Bubblicious.  So immediately placing it in the lower tier was my first mistake followed by comparing it to Bubble Gum.  Which is ok, neat taste, boring buzz, more like medicine to me for sleep, but usually available.\u000a\u000aThis Bubblicious was clearly the dominant bud much like a mutant advanced superhero cousin.  The smell pops right out strong &amp; bold reminding me of my childhood chewing those little pouches of Big League Gum.  Tasting is a much more complex experience with the candy flavor turning tropical with a musky, cinnamon-like exhale.  It is neat.  At first thought it was reminisce in pipe of previous strain smoked yet it stayed consistent through whole gram.  Plus eight I bought right after which is rare due to being easily bored plus high tolerance.\u000a\u000aWhich brings me to the high which is still very medicinal with a strong indica feel.  Yet this strains buzz takes it to the next level with a more bouncy, creative side.  Effects seemed to last longer also which kinda had a downside if there was something to do after resting.  There was a little foggy hangover sometimes which I considered a bonus in my youth.  As a more mature fella there are enough reasons to want to stay in bed all day.  Where are Yoko and John when you need them?\u000a\u000aAnyway like a proper stoner there was experimenting and wouldn&#39;t you know &quot;hair of the dog&quot;!!!  Just have a joint of this flower waiting on your bed stand for a nice wake n bake right back to bubbly.  Nice combo between recreational and medicinal with great tasting thick smoke.  Was lucky to grab some from Buds in Eugene which I must vouch this dispensary makes the odds much better at getting some decent affordable weed.  Very appreciated =)  Cheers

VThe WoW Weed&#39;s Bubblicious kief was a very poor overall experience. They obviously weren&#39;t concerned with quality at all as there appeared to be about equal parts of plant material to trichomes present! I think that if I got another chance to try some good Bubblicious product that I&#39;d like it. It&#39;s genetics seem like a winning pair crossing hybrid Bubblegum with Lavender a heavy Indica. Hopefully the next time will be better.
