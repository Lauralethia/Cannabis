VExcellent any time of the day strain. First of the bud structure was dense, large, pointy buds. So the Jack makes himself known even in appearance. DJ shorts Blueberry shows in the large roundness of the buds and the immediate smell &amp; taste. 2 great strains paired nicely. Essentially I&#39;m a Indica smoker but will try to always keep some of this around and make sure to grab it up when it&#39;s around. High thc &amp; cbd which is rare but awesome.

VFun, but intense with an overwhelming head high that completely disables your ability to think constructively. Absorbing stuff and engaging with people is constantly intriguing and fun! Power of the high is a bit challenging, but fun for those with experience. It\u2019s got a light, easy going view on life, but there is potential for edginess (thanks, Jack). Not much physical relaxation - in fact, the opposite - feel a bit awkward and unwieldy. It\u2019s upbeat and smiley with attention that jumps all over the place. Good degree of goneness, not too clear headed like Jacks are oft to be.

VBlueberry jack is unique because I feel like you get the best of both worlds with this one. You feel relaxed but productive at the same time. Subtle on both ends so it\u2019s an equal mix that blends almost perfectly. I only gave it 4 stars because it did make me feel spaced out off and on. Definitely recommend staying home and being productive there!

VBlueberry Jack is a Sativa Hybrid (80/20) cross of Blueberry X Jack Herer X Northern Lights #5. Really an amazing medicine considering it&#39;s long flower cycle. \u000aSmell: Candy sweet, piney.\u000aTaste: Just like blueberries! (Left resin on my lips!)\u000aFlowering: 60-70 Days\u000aYeild: Medium to High. \u000a\u000aIf you can find a Blueberry Jack clone, its a must have. Really high THC% &amp; CBD% strain.\u000a\u000aFound in the Bay Area.
