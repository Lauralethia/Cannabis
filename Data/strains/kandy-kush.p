VWow. Ran out of my chemdawg and wanted a good hybrid so I bought a quarter of this stuff a few days ago. We&#39;ll it&#39;s been an amazing few days. This stuff is very soft and spongy. VERY sticky, and moist it&#39;s covered in crystals and hairs. The taste is probably on my top 3 best tasting strains out there, I love it. Its sweet and smooth smoke, even when i really milk my bong up and take huge rips its always smooth and tasty. The high is a good happy and stoned high, even though, it does seem a little short. Top shelf. Buy this and you won&#39;t regret it.

Really made me super happy and uncontrollable laughter, extremely euphoric but a couch lock at the same time. Very sedating if and great for pain and relaxation.

First 20 minutes the train gets to your head and you&#39;re worthless and then it settles in a mellow, calming Kush high.

VI have a pretty high tolerance from medicating with high dosage edibles, so it&#39;s hard to find weed to get super high from with a small amount. The budtender told me that this batch had tested 26% THC so I went ahead and got a couple grams. A few bong hits later I was pleasantly very very high and feeling relaxed and not a worry in the world. Definitely recommend for nighttime, however the couch lock isn&#39;t overwhelming.

VFirst time smoking this strain, I did have initial coughs and roughness, but after a while it becomes smooth. It tastes like candy and then a sugary flavour in your mouth afterwards. I feel a nice euphoric feeling, especially a little stronger based on the music I listen to while high (chillstep).\u000a\u000aI have depression. It does help with it, well to me it does. I do feel relaxed, comfortable and happy.\u000a\u000aNoticeably it does give me a dry mouth, while giving me a little pressure and making me wanna eat, even though, I did eat before smoking more.\u000a\u000aIt doesn&#39;t seem to really last long, so I&#39;m having to smoke another bowl.\u000a\u000aIt doesn&#39;t take longer for me to feel the effects from a sober mood. Smoking more bowls makes it come up faster though.

VGot the most beautiful example of KK. How can you go wrong with the two parent strains. My gf had one pull of my jay and it wrecked her lol. This stuff is like a train to the brain for the first 15-20 min then settles into a nice Kush high. Smells like a sweet OG and considering how resin heavy this is it still unbelievably smooth to smoke. Pine on the inhale and sweet with a slight citrus on the exhale. I find this strain works wonders for my asthma but not great for anxiety.

I&#39;ve always heard there are some fire ass cuts around but this really has me excited . 9.7/10 straight beautiful .

VIt&#39;s a really good strain, most likely one I could use for sleep. I love it for its relaxing and sleep-inducing qualities. However, I use cannabis for severe pain from fibromyalgia, and this particular strain didn&#39;t do enough for my pain. It&#39;s great for probably mild to moderate pain, but for severe pain, I think it falls a little short. I get too much of a head-high before my body follows. It also gives you the munchies, and while that&#39;s great for people who don&#39;t need to worry about their diets, I have severe IBS/IBD, so eating certain things INCREASES the pain. The munchies always make it impossible to ignore all the foods that I have to avoid (I avoid a LOT of foods, most of them comfort foods). \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a good strain, overall, but for someone who wants high pain relief with a clear head for productivity, this isn&#39;t quite the strain I&#39;d like.

VThis 1/8 was curing (forgotten) since 2013 believe it or not. Comparing to my old notes, it was more tasty and psychedelic when it was fresh. That may explain how it got lost or forgotten ;-) I had noted before that it was excellent for pain and a bit stimulating.  It had been surprisingly good for $8gm so I had gone back for 1/4. \u000a\u000a     I drove to the park with this &quot;cured&quot; stuff, vaped a packed bowl, and took a sunny spring walk.  I paused or rested every once in a while and enjoyed looking at the water and the ducks, especially when they were splashing about in the light.  I had enhanced spatial awareness of birdsong, buzzing insects, rustling, and echoes off leaves as I walked around the paths. Good, brightening effect which lasted 1.5 hours. Still heady, but mellowed with a bit more body. Pain relief was short lived, had some more at home at the 3 hour mark, and apparently, I want to write! Time to change books...

VThis is one of my absolute favorite strains of all time for a variety of reasons. It has a sweet, appetizing taste. It takes away pain including headaches. it crushes anxiety without weighing you down physically or mentally. I find this to be great for nausea. \u000a\u000aAs far as a social strain, this is also the way to go morning or night for a relaxed, happy, euphoric buzz.

VReally nice indica-dominant hybrid. The smell of the buds was almost sickeningly sweet, and the taste was smooth and enjoyable. Smoking this stuff really helped with muscle soreness for me, so the pain relief was the most noticeable thing about this strain. Recommended for pain/stress, and also just having a good time.

Vthis strain comes on fast and hard! I experience a little paranoia for about 10 to 15 minutes once it starts to kick in. But once you settle in for the ride it&#39;s smooth sailing.... like drifting through the clouds on a magic carpet.\u000a\u000adon&#39;t let the numbers fool you with this one, mine is 13% THC but will wreck your face &#128521;

VRecently tried Kandy Kush and it is a great strain. Has a lemon like smell but tastes sweet like candy as the name suggests. Very enjoyable high making you feel good in general and is a prime stress reliever. Smoke is really smooth and dense. Nugs were a good size and looked super frosty, they also busted decently.

VWhen I first started smoking Kandy Kush I was a pretty big fan! It made my mind feel at peace and knocked me out for at least 2 hours. But after smoking about an eighth over a week time span, I became super paranoid about 25 mins in. And this has been a reparative thing for about 3 weeks now. It\u2019s definitely only something I\u2019d reach for if I was feening.

VThis is my first review. However, I cannot remain silent! Literally. This combines the best of all worlds.I generally avoid a sativa, because it elevates my anxiety. This is supposed to be Indica dominant. It comes on heavy, like Indica. However, no anxiety. Very uplifting. Energizing. I can feel it in my eyes and my cheeks.I feel positive and in control. Just perfect. I should be stingy, but I\u2019m sharing it with everyone. This is a must try.

VMethod: Hot Box Vaporizer \u000aMedium pack, 3 nice pulls.\u000aThe bud itself is beautiful, dense, and springy. Sticky to a tease.\u000aMy nose wants to live inside this bud forever. The bouquet is that good. \u000aAnd the high is powerful... deep. It smokes just like it smells.... intoxicating! Its dynamite in fact. \u000aIts just now creeping up at me full bore. Very floaty and tingly. The buzz runs in waves. Very nice. Not intense, as in high frequency.... this is more is like floating on a raft in the sun on the ocean. Loving it. \u000aMy last review was on Chemdawg. I prefer this weed. And I&#39;m pretty refined and picky about my high. Very uplifting! I&#39;m 45 minutes in... will finish review when buzz fades till 2nd vapor session. \u000aOK. Solid 1.5 hr buzz. Probably could have gone longer if I was doing something more energetic. At 45 min, I actually got couch locked. \u000a2nd round. High picks right back up. Deeper even. Couch lock eminent. I feel an episode of Star Trek Next Generation coming on. Yep! Pretty stoned. Nice. Some weeds don&#39;t pick back up well on the second go round, but not so with this strain, it exceeds expectations. This weed is nice. A very distinct ride. I just wanna vaporize more of it, even though I&#39;m stoned to the bejebiz. This weed would be great for watching movies. Chilling at the crib. Its heavy in the feet weed. Don&#39;t study or read, cause you wont remember shit! And if you do laundry high on Kandy Kush, you&#39;ll definitely forget the fabric softener.\u000a

Kandy Kush gently put me back to sleep. My mind always runs a mile a minute (which makes it hard to fall asleep) but this strain rested my mind. Makes it easy to laugh and be at peace. Ahhh I love this strain.

It&#39;s a great strain to ease my nerves and my pain, while allowing me to remain focused. I am also really motivated to be creative, which is a huge plus for me.

Very potent with a strong cottonheaded high, it&#39;s also sweetly flavourful... but somewhat harsh on the lungs. Very much medicinal, great for easing back pain and insomnia.

VPurchased from World of Weed in Tacoma grown by Pur. \u000a\u000aFlower: Wow.  Shimmers in the light, looks wet. It is covered in crystalline beauty. I broke up one nug with my fingers just because I was curious. It had a vein of crystals running through it. Flower is what you would expect from its parents. Tight smaller popcorn size nuggets with typical indica shape. Smell in bag is skunky and pungent with hints of lemon and berry. \u000a\u000aCrumble: grinds up finer than I expected.  Looks can be deceiving, I would&#39;ve guessed it would be fluffier and stickier. The growers did a great job of harvesting this flower in the peak of its ripe freshness. \u000a\u000aBurn: clean and even, due to the finer grind. \u000a\u000aTaste: as advertised. Very sweet lemony skunk. It reminds me of a combination of lemon OG and Allen wrench. \u000a\u000aHigh: I am biased towards indica strains, so take this with a grain of salt but this may be one of the most enjoyable, relaxing, mellow (but strong) highs ever. After a long day at work this will completely erase the stress and fatigue. \u000a\u000aOverall experience: 9/10\u000a

V Kandy is the one that I like to smoke during the day. It helps me clean the whole house in a shorter amount of time than usual and not to mention I clean it BETTER than when I&#39;m not on Kandy! lol. I like that it gives me a total body high (metal in my back) and that I can still stay focused on what I need to do and get done for the day. Helps a whole lot with my anxiety and stress! One of the best I&#39;ve used for stress relief. I wish the high on candy would last a little longer or that the body high would be a little more intense...not the strongest I have had but I would say this is good for someone that has to work and stay focused throughout the day. Doesn&#39;t mess you up but instead gives you that nice body high!

VNice OG hybrid. Im not a fan of trainwreck itself, not sure why i like alot of its characteristics its just too clean and functional where most of the time i prefer the narcotic, heavy eyed type medicine for an all out assault on whatever is ailing me. Skunk, citrus and pine with a hint of the familiar trainwreck pear spice. Very nice mix of both parents which ends up being a middle of the road effect wise, but still could cause some paranoia in sensitive individuals.

VI got this strain from a legitimate marijuana clinic, when I opened up the bag it had a very sweet and fruity smell to it, but it didn&#39;t smell very strong. it was very leafy too I don&#39;t like leafs lol. either way it was a very mild buzz and it didn&#39;t last very long, my 3.5 grams was gone in 2 days when it should have been about 3-4 days, very good when you smoke it but it doesn&#39;t get you intensely high. (I&#39;ve also been smoking for about 10 years now)

VI absolutely love Kandy Kush, it is hands down my favorite strain so far. I suffer from a painful medical condition that causes my joints to dislocate at random and this is the only strain I have found so far that not only helps a great deal with the pain, but doesn&#39;t cause me to have any drowsiness. It is the perfect daytime medication for me and it makes me able to be much more productive.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to relieve pain without also having couch lock.

VJust picked up an ounce of Kandy and GG#4 today. GG will always be my favorite for now but this Kandy Kush is amazing. The taste is easily #1 for me. Tastes exactly like fruity pebbles. My indoor grown is covered in deep green and purple buds and covered in brown hair. The high is very euphoric, (coming from the OG Kush)  would recommend this top shelf buy to anyone

VMe and one other person shared one kandy kush pre roll, and smoked the whole thing together. Wowza! Amazing! Both of us are beginners and started taking mmj for pain management. As we were smoking the effects started coming on... Feeling like we saw everything and felt everything in HD. After we came inside, I did laundry, and felt like I did laundry better? Weird to say but that normal dread that hits when u have to do house chores didn&#39;t hit me. I felt like okay! I&#39;m going to do house chores! And felt so much more aware and capable doing them. And I thought to myself A. My life is really mundane lol. B. This is definitely the weed talking.\u000aThe effects amazingly felt like it lasted for an hour or 2. At the height of the high, I felt less pain, more talkative, analyzing things, and just like a more efficient human if that makes sense? After those effects wore off, I still felt numbness/tingling in the places I normally have pain (heels, knees). I would touch my heel in the part that normally hurts and didn&#39;t feel the pain. Just the pressure from my finger. The pain really melted away. I would 100% do kandy kush again. I had so much fun using it. The person I did it with said they did get a lil paranoid, but that might just be them because I didn&#39;t feel that at all. The negative effects I felt were mostly dry eye and a little thirsty. The person I did it with said they didn&#39;t think it helped them with pain (they have back pain) but then they sat on the couch with me for 2 hours just fine when they normally can&#39;t sit for more than 20minutes. They were just fine sitting there and after a few hours as the pain relief started wearing off (around the same time mine was) THEN they started fidgeting and groaning and being in pain. Why weren&#39;t they acting like that before? So I told them &quot;see, it DID help your pain, even if you didn&#39;t realize it because look how much pain you are in now compared to the last 2 hours. You weren&#39;t fidgeting like this the last few hours!&quot; and they were like &quot;I guess so&quot; lol. Sometimes you have to point things out. Anyway I highly recommend. I can&#39;t wait to go buy some kandy kush bud now!

On the other hand the indica side really helps with anxiety and sleep in a way where I can do things during then have a nice sleepy body high.

Vtried out both indica and sativa versions of the kk, and usually I&#39;m quite biased (preferring sativas as indicas knock me out within 10-15 mins) Both had a very surgary sweet dank scent,like brown surgar.The indica ver. had nice head high that slowly eased me into a nice (and almost numbing) nap, has me out for a lil over 1&#189; hours. Sativa ver. had me buzzing round the house with a strong head high, felt like a bobblehead while walking around, and surprisingly didn&#39;t have any mind blanking while having a long conversation. lit af strain

Vcombination of a classic (OG Kush) and one of my all time favs (Headband) that I haven&#39;t been able to find for 8-9 years. Goes well with music, either listening or playing. Tastes great, less filling. YMMV.

VMe and my friends all agree this is the best strain for watching movies &amp; a great hybrid. It just easies the mind and body all at once. One thing i hate is that i come down way to fast and you go from stonned to sober and theres no buzz in the middle. I have a low tolerance but i could smoke this all night and maintain a good high. Great weed, but you have to keep packing bowls.

VKandy Kush is a favorite line that combines two California classics, OG Kush and Trainwreck, to make a tasty indica-dominant hybrid (although sativa phenotypes displaying more of the Trainwreck structure have been noted).  Like the name suggests, the flavor is sweet like candy with a strong lemon-Kush scent.  Very popular with medicinal growers, Kandy Kush provides a potent indica high with pronounced pain relief.

VKandy Kush, not a bad strain. Has characteristic sweet smell and taste, complemented by the classic danky weed smell and taste. Unfortunately, the taste and smell are better than the high. The high starts off euphoric and somewhat trippy, then after about an hour or so you get a heavy Indica-like body stone. The high is nice, but could be stronger and last longer. Maybe it was because my 2g sack came from my buddy&#39;s closet grow; the setup was pretty rudimentary. Not bad, though - still makes me enjoy my afternoon. Medically, I can see this being good treatment of insomnia and anxiety, as well as lack of appetite.

VHoly cow was a privilege to try out this strain. The buds were small, dense and very dry but, therefore it ground up to dust. Also easy to pick by hand and it reminded me of breaking up polystyrene.  Now onto the smoke... Probably the smoothest that I have ever smoked. Was like a dream and to boot the exquisite candy floss flavour it brings is unbelievable! The after effects are also spot on, leaving you with a very long lasting mellow high. Easily a candidate for my top 5 maybe even top 3 of my all time favourites.

VThis Strain is confusing as f*** to me, the first two times I smoked it, my body did all the thinking and acted like a mind of its own. On the third time smoking it, I lost myself in my thoughts like a few other strains I smoked, but it wasn&#39;t as intense. I wasn&#39;t as active like the first two times though. I smoked Kandy a few more times and realized that the amount you smoke DOES MATTER. I smoked it recently and after smoking it, I had the body over mind feel at first, but later after, I began to lose myself in my thoughts.\u000aI don&#39;t like how this strain makes me look away my insicurities - for example I hate brushing my teeth, after smoking Kandy, I purposely forgot to brush.\u000aThis strain also makes me very judgemental.\u000aI love how the music sounds, and I also like the buzz feeling, but I feel like this strain is a bit too complicating. I&#39;m not even sure if it&#39;s Kandy, my friend says it is...

VSuper kiefy, it seemed like it broke apart so perfectly in a grinder for every single nug. This strain seemed to have a longer lasting high, as it took me a week to kill an 8th of it(usually I buy almost twice as much as that a week). The High seemed to have a bit of a delayed onset, but it was all worth it when it kicks in. Your mouth is gonna be super dry though. All in all, it was notably good enough for me to wanna write a review on it, so it stands to say that this strain is easily on the superior side of our favourite kind of greens. If y&#39;all get the opprotunity to hit or get this anytime soon, I highly recomend it.

VBefore one is even lucky enough to touch one of these pristine buds the smell permeates through your nose. A strong Pink Kush smell with sweet flower like undertones are present with this strain. The taste transfers quite well from the smell of the flower. When vaporized the taste unfortunately is not as strong as one would hope; however when smoked the flavor comes through in full effect. The resin coated buds assure that this one is a slow burner! \u000a\u000aThe effects are overall calming with a slight head euphoria generally associated with Pink Kush. Unlike Pink Kush this strain offers very little come down making is amazing for morning mid day or even night use! 5/5 stars!!

VMe and one other person shared one kandy kush pre roll, and smoked the whole thing together. Wowza! Amazing! Both of us are beginners and started taking mmj for pain management. As we were smoking the effects started coming on... Feeling like we saw everything and felt everything in HD. After we came inside, I did laundry, and felt like I did laundry better? Weird to say but that normal dread that hits when u have to do house chores didn&#39;t hit me. I felt like okay! I&#39;m going to do house chores! And felt so much more aware and capable doing them. And I thought to myself A. My life is really mundane lol. B. This is definitely the weed talking.\u000aThe effects amazingly felt like it lasted for an hour or 2. At the height of the high, I felt less pain, more talkative, analyzing things, and just like a more efficient human if that makes sense? After those effects wore off, I still felt numbness/tingling in the places I normally have pain (heels, knees). I would touch my heel in the part that normally hurts and didn&#39;t feel the pain. Just the pressure from my finger. The pain really melted away. I would 100% do kandy kush again. I had so much fun using it. The person I did it with said they did get a lil paranoid, but that might just be them because I didn&#39;t feel that at all. The negative effects I felt were mostly dry eye and a little thirsty. The person I did it with said they didn&#39;t think it helped them with pain (they have back pain) but then they sat on the couch with me for 2 hours just fine when they normally can&#39;t sit for more than 20minutes. They were just fine sitting there and after a few hours as the pain relief started wearing off (around the same time mine was) THEN they started fidgeting and groaning and being in pain. Why weren&#39;t they acting like that before? So I told them &quot;see, it DID help your pain, even if you didn&#39;t realize it because look how much pain you are in now compared to the last 2 hours. You weren&#39;t fidgeting like this the last few hours!&quot; and they were like &quot;I guess so&quot; lol. Sometimes you have to point things out. Anyway I highly recommend. I can&#39;t wait to go buy some kandy kush bud now!

VOutstanding hybrid, love at first buzz. Take a couple of hits and get the sativa boost with a comforting blanket of worry-free wellbeing -- totally ideal for anxiety and depression issues. Take a few more hits and the indica heaviness starts to take over, enhancing and relaxing, great for pain management without totally locking you to the couch.  A few MORE hits and you&#39;ll be sliding happily toward the best night&#39;s sleep you&#39;ve had in a long time. I felt GREAT at work the next day, taking the usual stresses in stride. Along with my go-to Sour D and my super happy Chocolope, Kandy Kush has quickly become one of my three favorite strains.

V7/10 taste is like lemon tart candies kinda like those lemon head candys you would beg your mom to buy you while in line waiting to pay at a store, puts me a good mood but I can say the same as others say effects seem to not last quite as long as other strains or maybe it&#39;s that Kandy kush has her focus set on making you smile and not totally getting you ripped like a higher thc strain would. Purchase this for the taste alone it&#39;s very good to mix in a salad joint in my personal opinion. Happy tokes folks \u270c&#127995;\ufe0f&#128119;&#127995;

The high has a quick take-off but levels off into a nice relaxing state of mind with good focus.  Energy is sustained so it&#39;s great for daytime use and would be good for enjoying the outdoors.

V(KushTopia Grown)\u000a\u000aWe really do enjoy smoking this strain, it has been described like caffeine many times. It makes you very awake and cognizant of your surroundings. We have gone fishing, camping, hiking, and sight seeing with this strain with no issues with getting tired or feeling lethargic. \u000a\u000aThe taste of this strain is sweet depending on the plant that you get. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is a sativa dominant and has really airy buds, not very dense and because of that you need to have more of your garden dedicated to growing it to get similar results of other strains. \u000a\u000aThe plant also has a long grow cycle.

Smoke tasted good, mildly sweet and aromatic, with no harshness whatsoever.  Good for relief of anxiety and PMS.  Didn&#39;t make me especially sleepy, but YMMV.  Mixed well with light alcohol (beer or wine) in smaller quantities (two or three drinks max).  Dry eyes and cottonmouth were the only drawbacks for me.

VWhat happens when you combine two all-star strains like OG Kush and Trainwreck? You end up with a surprisingly sweet baby that has citrus notes rivaling Katy Perry\u2019s best melodies. Kandy Kush gained popularity with it\u2019s sugary earthy flavor profile and potency that provides superior indica hybrid relief. Expect a happy relaxed high with an uplifting euphoric side (thanks to mama trainwreck!) and a bit of the munchies, which makes this strain idle for those suffering from eating disorders, digestive issues or looking for appetite stimulation. Medicinally, this strain is also noted for stress relief, pain management, depression, anxiety, headaches and migraines.

VVery potent stuff! Smoked ONE blunt of this with 5 people, we were all baked for hours. Honestly, i cant remember that night too much, but this is the type of herb that leaves you satisfied. In terms of the effects, great balance of euphoric body high, with strong giggly mental effects, very good social weed. On the potent side, wouldnt recommend for lightweights, i lost my phone while off this and i couldnt remember for the life of me where i put it the next morning.

VThis weed put me on my ass! A few bong rips of this strain and I felt like my tolerance disappeared. \u000a\uff3c(^o^)\uff0f

VNever smoking this strain again.\u000aLanded in Amsterdam, went to bulldog and got me a gram of this, rolled me a fatty and smoked it (Notice that i haven&#39;t eaten anything in 10-12 hours)\u000aI started tripping balls, like the beginner bad trip, i just fell into depression and anxiety, it just hit me like a train, got totally f-ed up and couldn&#39;t find my way back to the hotel.
