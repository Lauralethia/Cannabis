VGot a 8th of this along with a halfz GG#4xWifiOG and some Gods Gift and some clone ECSD at a 420 event in philly.\u000aim not usually big on heavy indicas except b4 bed but Purple Bubba smells/tastes looks so beautiful i deal with the couchlock lol. worth it for that grape/berry-kushy exhale. beautiful barney purp/green nugs with bug kush leaves coated in trichs. definetly a knock out, but ifyou smoke a few huts and put it down, you can keep functioning. a true session will put you down though
