VThis one is so bomb. Even my mother loves it. It&#39;s chill, super relaxing, and doesn&#39;t gong-show your brain.  Easily function while being pleasantly pain free.

VThis is my first time smoking weed, so my review might be a little off. This hybrid is relatively sedative, smoked about 0.4 gram and fell asleep about 40 mins after smoking it. Woke up feeling nauseous and groggy for the first 3 -5 hrs, drastically improve my sleep quality though. \u000a\u000aAll in all, a good sleeping aid!

VBy far my favorite stain. Keeps you at a nice couchlock for a few hours. Def gets you that &quot;I&#39;m floating&quot; vibe. Really wish it was more popular bc i miss it.

VVery versatile strain. Well balanced. Can easily be used for an energetic day time high, or as a relaxing nightcap. If you smoke enough, you might get a little couch lock. Had me laughing quite a bit, just put me in an overall happy mood.

VI love this strain, first I ever had and I still do it now. The taste is great, the smell is nice (although when trying to hide it from roommates it is a bit of a strong smell.) The high for me isn\u2019t always amazing but the dreams I get from it is like heaven.
