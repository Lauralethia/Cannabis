VOne hit: chillin, just watching tv\u000aTwo hits: am I high yet? Can&#39;t tell..\u000aThree hits: can&#39;t feel my body\u000aFour: see you in the morning!\u000a\u000aThe reason this isn&#39;t a 5 star high for me is that it makes me do - or not do - things that Make my life harder, like not brush my teeth, sleep with lights on, go to bed with my hair a mess, forget to turn my alarm on, etc. I prefer a slightly more functional high with a little headspace between smoking and sleeping.

Vmellow smell almost like honey sweet with lavender overtones. first bowl gets you floaty nice mellow head buzz not too sleepy. second bowl is gonna couchlock you. the buzz creeps on you mellow than heavier. longer noticeable buzz. buds aren&#39;t too impressive looking soft light color light weight but nice density and tricomes.

VI smoked a bowl... walked up stairs said \u201cthis was shit weed\u201d... walked down stairs to get a drink and opened the fridge and it kicked... creeper weed...  The phenotype doesn\u2019t always make it purple so growers beware... but the  paralysis part lives up to its name... high af for an hr or 2 and then a smooth strong buzz for hrs after that

VStructurally it&#39;s very sativa like with long, thinner but still dense buds. It&#39;s flavor is very sweet and unlike any other strain I&#39;ve tried. Honey like is the closest flavor I could put it at. Effects wise it doesn&#39;t hit the same notes as other sativa dominant hybrids but rather behaves like an indica without the extra coma like symptoms. It&#39;s a very relaxed, not anxiety inducing kind of feeling. Most suitable for a nice evening toke post dinner (or pre if you like to eat after) because I became very hungry after.

VI&#39;ve been cloning this strain 4 years now and I can say it is one of my favorites. It does great outdoors when given room to stretch out, and indoors when u make sure to manage it or have the space.

VSmells like the grape flavoured lipgloss I used to buy as a kid.&#128523; \u000a\u000aSmooth smoke with a pleasant mocha like finish.  It&#39;s got this beautiful fruity &amp; spicy aroma to it. \u000a\u000aThis is one of those strains that makes your body and mind relax slowly.  Perfect strain for the end of a stressful day or week.  Would highly recommend this for PMS and PMDD in women!
