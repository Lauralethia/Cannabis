VOh my sweet Dosi! If I could keep one strain in my medicine cabinet, this would be it. Regardless of where my tolerance is, I find fantastic relief from pain (migraines, spine/disc, &amp; nerve pain), nausea and a variety of other chronic symptoms due to dysautonomia. With the best of its GSC/Face Off OG genetics, Dosi can be great for PTSD, anxiety, and aiding in the creative process. Probably not a strain for novice users, as a medical user, I highly recommend giving this versatile, indica-dominant strain a try.

VTasty strain that sends tasty waves all through, mind and body. I smoked PIM&#39;s (Sonoma County grow) version and it kicks ass. It&#39;s indoor, smooth, frosty, citrusy and earthy - and definitely has the GSC flavor to it.

VCame to California, for a work/vacation and was gifted an eighth of Do-Si-Dos. The canister from Tradecraft Farms was the first thing to catch my eye as I have yet to see a can of flower that paid a striking resemblance to a cat food can by Fancy Feast. Upon popping the lid and pulled back the tab, I was nose smashed with a very sweet pungent aroma that wasn&#39;t too overwhelming. Very nice, crystal covered flower. Dark with darker shades of green. And a Fancy feast it was!!!\u000a\u000aHippy picking/breaking it up by fingers was an easy task given the density. I like to smoke in all ways, including a tobacco laced spliff, which this proved to be incredibly flavorful and very intense. Just what I like. \u000a\u000aAffects were very much on the Indica train. Slightly dizzy, wobbly walk for the first few steps after ripping, which isn&#39;t very usual, even for me, being a fairly usual partaker. \u000a\u000aGreat strain through and through. I maybe wouldn&#39;t recommend for light smokers, and maybe even some who consider themselves a bit heavier. But still shouldn&#39;t go with out being sampled. If you&#39;re looking for something to knock your socks, cock, or whatever else off, then maybe giver a go! Very enjoyable! And thank you to whom ever that was! Cheers!\u000a\u000a

VGave this a 5 star review because it earned it!  Picked up an oz at 30.4pct, that looked and smelled out of this world.  Smoked half of a 98 special Raw cone.  Effects came on quickly and very powerful.  Not only is this a very strong body high like you would expect with a strong Indica, but it&#39;s a real heavy and long lasting head high that feels amazing.  I would advise caution for the new cannabis consumer with low tolerance.  (not me) Lol \u000a\u000aGreat for pain, depression, anxiety, appetite and overall sense of well being.  Will buy again!

VTo put it bluntly this shit is gnarly. Off the bat you notice it&#39;s got a really pungent sweet smell, but not overwhelmingly so. Absolutely covered in trichs&#39;, bright green with slight purple and orange tones. As far as the smoke, it tastes almost slightly diesel-y, then finishes very floral and almost fruity. The high lays in behind your eyes right out of the gate, like a smack in the face. Pretty soon after it starts to lay you out, particularly with repeated dosing. I was having terrible anxiety all afternoon today (likely from spreadsheets and too much caffeine today), it&#39;s gone. I feel very mellow. Did help some with relieving my back pain as well. This is a great nighttime smoke. Not recommended for the morning to get up and goin at all though, I bet you won&#39;t get shit done. I was looking for an insanely strong laid out indica and for sure found it in this strain. I literally can&#39;t not give it five stars. Some of the best I&#39;ve ever had.

VMethod of consumption - Flower, Smoking and Vape. \u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000aSmell \u2014 I will divvy this category up into three pieces. Full flower, grounded up flower, and smoke.\u000a\u000aFull \u2014 Pungent without any question but, I couldn\u2019t tell if it fit into a certain profile. Just yet, only until it\u2019s ground up. \u000a\u000a\u000aGround \u2014 Just wow. It\u2019s as if I ripped a tea bag open. It\u2019s earthy without any question, but I quickly picked up on floral and mint tones. Almost immediately after grinding it all up. \u000a\u000a\u000aSmoke \u2014 The flowery floral scent evolved into tree fruit and sweet pine profile. I didn\u2019t expect that. It was a nice treat.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aTaste \u2014 The flavor of bud is almost overpowering but there were sweet pine lingering in the after taste. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aEffect \u2014 This strain was a creeper for me. It hit me when I didn\u2019t expect it. (It isn\u2019t an attack, but it does hit when it do hit in.) And, wow, this strain is phenomenal. It uplifts and relaxes you at the same time. It reduced my pain to a low score of 2.5 ~3 out of 10. I was suffering from migraines and menstrual cramps at the same time and it made it go away. I also had a good night of sleep which is rare. (Even after smoking.) \u000a\u000aShorthand; Easily one of my top favorites! \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aNegatives \u2014 Dry mouth, dry eyes, and dizziness. \u000a\u000aDry mouth is easily solved with plenty of water. Dry eyes aren\u2019t but they weren\u2019t at the point where your eyes are so irritated that you can\u2019t sleep. \u000a\u000aDizziness is mild but it is there when I took one too many hits. It rolled in after feeling a good heady euphoria.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aMunchies \u2014 It is considerably high, but on the scale of 7 out of 10. However, if you force yourself to not eat, it will eventually go away. There were few times where I couldn\u2019t ignore it and devoured through (half bag of) Boulder Canyon\u2019s chips. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aExtra \u2014 Highly recommendable! I\u2019d recommend this to strain to my family members as well. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000aMy medical conditions are anxiety, Crohn\u2019s disease, insomnia, migraines, PTSD, and spinal injury (disc herniation).

VI asked my seller to get me something for the night, a indica dominant strain that would help me fall asleep. I didn\u2019t realize what I was getting into. As I received do-si-dos, the aroma was very pleasant, danky af, but it was pleasant. The bus was quite a lot of orange hairs and many trichrosomes on it. I rolled me a blunt with the 1/8 I had gotten, little did I know that God himself was about to smak the living shit out my soul with his one. After the thrid hit I was smacked, numb and in another fucking dimension. I was out, and by the one that blunt was finished I couldn\u2019t move, I felt my soul leaving the Body as if god was ready to take me. I never enjoyed a strain this much until I had do-so-dos. The munchies that kicked in later on were absurd I felt as if I hadn\u2019t eaten in years. This has become one of my favorite strains. Don\u2019t recommend for beginners as it is quite a very potent high.

My doctor retired a couple years back so I have been looking for a good strain to kill my shattered shoulder pain! Well I need not look any further. Do-si-doe is the shit. First dab half way down and I was already feeling it. Before I could even blow it out I had a nice warm feeling all over from head to toes. And kinda of euphoria all around! I would HIGHLY recommend this strain to anyone with major pain! You won&#39;t be doing the do-si-doe but you won&#39;t have any pain for about 4 hours!!!!

Don\u2019t even think about driving anywhere while you are using Do-Si-Dos as you will be so pie-eyed that you will be getting a ride to the cop shop should you get pulled over. I am experiencing pretty much what other reviewers have posted while using this strain. The only down side I can find is the dry eyes, but I still give it five stars.

VOUTSTANDING!!!!!!!! I got some of this flower as well as wax from Urban Wellness first things first, the cookies yeah the ones from the little drug dealer and her troop off minions, those are some of the best things to grace this planet. Anyway back to the flower, opon first sent I was greeted with a sweet muskie and a cake batter type of sent. Overly amazing smell with i could find it in a candle, the guy behind the counter said it has become on of his top favorites. So I got a few grams and some other flower as well and headed home. When i got home first things first BONG HITS!!! With my first rip I was hit with one of the smother hits ive had, me not having very good lungs due to prior Cigarette smoking, this was amazing to say the least, upon exhale came that cake batter from earlier, then a sweet berry type of flavor and my love came alive, hopped on to netflix and became one with the couch, the only thing that got me up was the unimaginable munchies!!!! After a while of staring at  the fridge I decided that Ramon would probably be best.......... UNFORTUNATELY I WAS SO HIGH I FORGOT WATER!!!!

VI found Do-Si-Do an odd name for a strain and the reviews seemed promising so I bought some. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST INDICA STRAIN I&#39;VE EVER TRIED BY FAR!!! My tolerance has been going up and other strains got me high, but THIS got me STONED. I only needed half the amount I&#39;d normally smoke. Gives a really strong and relaxed body high with lots of giggly head high too! I do have to caution though that I did experience some anxiety, but it subsides within 10 minutes. The buds are absolutely COVERED in kief/trichomes and fuzzy in texture. I just restocked and got 1/4 more of Do-Si-Do because its so great and I feel like I won&#39;t be seeing this rare specimen in my area again anytime soon! An absolute MUST-TRY.

V\u266b Swing your partner, there we go, let&#39;s go vape some do-si-dos!\u266c\u000a\u000aMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Uplifting, Relaxing and helps with mild pain. Slight euphoria, giggly.\u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth and minor dry eyes. \u000a\u000aTaste/Draw: Sweet Minty/Pine, hint of earthiness. Smooth draw and exhale.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Very relaxing, has creeper effect where it hits the head first, then body relaxation. Some couch lock/tiredness as time goes on. More of a stay at home strain. Pain relief is not immediate, but does happen, like a delayed effect  (body wise at least, for my Crohns Disease), not a bad thing, but keep that in mind depending on how severe your pain is.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain if you are looking to relax and transition from a mild euphoric and happy head high, to a body one.

VI&#39;ve seen this strain on Instagram a lot lately and picked up an eighth once I saw it at my local dispensary. It does not disappoint, and like others have noted, I can feel the GSC lineage for sure. I have been beyond stressed and this strain really helped me to relax. I highly recommend it for anyone that has anxiety/depression.

VThis is definitely not for beginners. Being well-seasoned, I have enjoyed a long career of smoking and have tried many strains. This is without a doubt the best flower I have tried yet. Don\u2019t even think about driving anywhere while you are using Do-Si-Dos as you will be so pie-eyed that you will be getting a ride to the cop shop should you get pulled over. I am experiencing pretty much what other reviewers have posted while using this strain. The only down side I can find is the dry eyes, but I still give it five stars.

VThe OG smell roars through this bad boy. A pungent and sensational flavour greets you as you spark up; the intensity is reminiscent of an earthy, Paris OG-like flavour (whilst shoving a cookie in your mouth). It is no surprise, with Face Off OG genetics that you instantly become aware that you cannot feel your face, which is bliss when you have a bad headache. The GSC genetics also lend to an instant anti-inflammatory sensation - enveloping the body and mind with a sense of peace and tranquility. A creative and relaxed high. Baby-soft smooth toking. Perfect for settling into a yoga or mindfulness session.

VAn indica for connoisseur seekers. I really wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from this one. The smell was pungent and earthy, with a bit of tropical fruit. Flowers were a nice light lime green with dark orange calyxes. The buds were sticky and fluffy. The taste was fuely and sweet. The effects were nicely balanced for an indica, not extremely heavy. They were euphoric and relaxing. Absolutely chill. A little bit of a creeper. Perfect strain for stress, anxiety, and ptsd.

VFlavor: Smooth, smelled like fruit roll ups, reminiscent of Grape Ape.\u000a\u000aHigh: Wow. I felt perfectly relaxed and numb - this would be a great strain for pain relief. I was a little giggly for awhile and then just felt sleepy and worry free. This strain gave me the biggest case of munchies I\u2019ve ever had and I ate my way through an entire bag of animal crackers before I realized what I was doing. \u000a\u000aDowner: I think I smoked too much - I was dizzy at first. After I came down I fell asleep fairly quickly but then woke up in the middle of the night with some pretty intense paranoia (I had to get up and check that all the windows in the house were locked).\u000a\u000aInteresting tidbit: this strain made me extremely....amorous...and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say\u000a\u000aNext day: Felt really groggy when I woke up - but motivated to get stuff done - felt psychologically numb for most of the day\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VWhat bad is there to say about this strain? The smell is very Pine with a tad of sweetness to it. Almost a lemon note but then cancelled out slightly by a vanilla undertone that made my mustache hairs curl.\u000a\u000aThe taste on inhale is similar to the smell with a sort of sweet almost berry/earth but then an almost fuel-like gasoline sour sort of punches on your taste buds repeatedly. And then begins the expansion cough. \u000a\u000aImmediately after, you\u2019re hit with a head high that seems to trickle from the back of your eyeballs down your entire body. For a few moments it feels like you have to hold your head because it\u2019s just too heavy. But not in a bad way. In a \u201ctoday was long and it\u2019s time to relax\u201d way. You\u2019re finding the seat you\u2019re in more comfortable, and you\u2019ll find yourself weakening your posture in order to handle this particular high.\u000a\u000aThe high isn\u2019t exactly one I would recommend achieving before any sort of work that requires concentration. This is more of a high that you want to visit when you\u2019ve put in your fair share of work for the day and you need to take a load off, with a powerful kick of couch lock, and heavy, onset euphoric high.

Loved it so much, took away my anxiety, made me somewhat care free throughout the high, and even took away these joint pains I&#39;ve been feeling in my lower back and knees. Had a very earthy sour taste somewhat to the taste of bitter coffee. The smell was great, had a pungent/tangy aroma to it. The high lasted me about 2 hours more or less. Smoked out of a brand new pipe. Dispensary said it was a 28% THC which after more than a few bowls I felt lit. Started off with slight head change now I feel the overall great body high. Creative thoughts flowing and I&#39;m currently jamming out. Feeling great &#128077;

VMy first review after trying 30+ flower strains over the past couple months. Do-si-dos is my all time favorite and go-to comparison I hold other strains to(pre bedtime). It hits pretty hard and fast with a euphoric calm relaxing cerebral and body high and while there\u2019s no lock you do settle in to a very relaxing state but can move about if needed. The SEX however is it\u2019s best quality imo. Every time me and the wife smoked and had sex it was absolutely incredible both me being able to perform and the finish......oh god the finish :)  it feels like you\u2019re finishing for 3x as long as normal.  Crazzzzy! There\u2019s are some other stains which are also great for me and those are GSC, Blue Dream, Jillybean, and GG#4, but Do-Si-Dos beats them hands down for me every time!

VI picked up a prefilled cartridge of this to vape on, Is about 78% THC, not sure the CBD but wow, this strain even in concentrate  form is a blast of cerebral and body high. I took about 3 big hits off the pen and watched The incredibles 2, not the best movie to watch stoned but it had me feel like floating across the theatre with some heavy munchies. Great high for clearing pain/nausea. Although Im gonna have to rate as a 4 because of intense couch lock and losing focus of things easily. The cerebral high is good with mild CEV&#39;s from the concentrate form.

VI picked up a prefilled cartridge of this to vape on, Is about 78% THC, not sure the CBD but wow, this strain even in concentrate  form is a blast of cerebral and body high. I took about 3 big hits off the pen and watched The incredibles 2, not the best movie to watch stoned but it had me feel like floating across the theatre with some heavy munchies. Great high for clearing pain/nausea. Although Im gonna have to rate as a 4 because of intense couch lock and losing focus of things easily. The cerebral high is good with mild CEV&#39;s from the concentrate form.

VAlright, I got an 8th of this the first time I smoked it and I was very disappointed. It took a long time for it to hit me and I felt like I needed a lot to get me going. I smoke almost every day so I just thought maybe it was too weak for me now, but then I tried it with my new bong and man... Oh man... I went back and got another 8th and I smoked that stuff in three days. Its so good. Great body/head high. I can feel free to get lost in giggles, a good movie or anything else. The moment you feel too high, just have a snack and you start to come down. Great strain if you worry about needing to be sober later. But great for an all night shesh too. Love this.

V&quot;Holy shitballs!&quot; This strain kicked. my. ass. I made the mistake of having to drive home (1/2 hr drive) after smoking a joint with 5 people. I&#39;d say I had maybe 6 hits. The drive was a challenge, to say the least. My guy said it was like a 50/50 hybrid, and that&#39;s how it manifested -- lofty, trippy, heady euphoria combined with total relaxation, though I think my worry about driving was due to some paranoia (maybe because my dose was too high, believe it or not), then coasting into sleepiness 2+ hours later. There was a point at which the road was shimmying and the lights were blurring. And mind you, I have an everyday-toke tolerance level. The best way to describe the high is &quot;soaring.&quot; I&#39;d have to call this a &quot;super strain&quot; at this point, because I don&#39;t even really have a point of reference. Downsides are major cotton mouth, very stony-looking red eyes, some paranoia, and it even had the feel that if you smoked too much it wouldn&#39;t be fun anymore, just too intense. Do not smoke this if you have any kind of responsibility to carry out.  :-)

Smoke too much of this and you might find yourself eating to the point of nausea.  Like when you were a little kid and ate soo much candy you would throw up.  Besides that, decent strain.  Def. powerful, won\u2019t couch lock you, but will certainly put you in a Stoney, dreamy world.  Probably good for insomnia, but one of those things where at first you feel so good you don\u2019t want to sleep, but hour or two later and you won\u2019t be able to keep your eyes open.

VDo-si-dos is a definite new favorite, was able to be gifted some of this by a good friend. Buts are nice and dense, laden with trichomes of an ambery-white color, with the leaves light green with small flecks of purple peeking around every other calyx. The smell wasnt as pungent as expected, but phenomenal nonetheless. An earthy, cotton candy-like sweetness with a slightly sour tinge that  nips the tongue on the exhale. The high was super relaxing, hitting behind the eyes and melting through the back of the head , and onto the rest of the body. Perfect for insomnia, pain, and lack of appetite. This strain is a must try for any seasoned cannabis enthusiast or medical patient, but novice smokers heed its potency!

VDo Si Dos did not lean very indica dominant with my body chemistry which turned out to be a positive.  This strain is very medicinal with a decent amount of pain relief which is displayed in a warm, numbing all over body.  Maybe that is where it can be confused with that awesome body high associated with some indicas.  Most other aspects of buzz were heady with a motivating coffee like vibe that progressed from the wave of muscle relaxing that initiates the high from first puff.\u000a\u000aA very functional strain with smooth smoke and the kind of hybrid buzz that #jimmyinspazzz really enjoys.  The flower itself was a treat to take pictures of being purple, green, orange in no particular pattern.  Very dense with funky little buds almost foxtail that smelled earthy, a little skunky, with a high that stays around for a long time.

Almost like a sedative, i smoke daily and was blown away by how stoned this stuff made me. I could hardly use the channel changer. Loved it so much though! Eliminated anxiety too.

You can really taste that specific pungent citrusy smell face off og tends to give off with a sweet earthy peanut butter like undertone. The stone is really balanced  for being a indica it gives you that uplifting fuzzy face feeling with a nice relaxed body stone. This is a good indica to use during the day for pain or at night if you want to use it as a sleep aid also helps with my nausea I have in the mornings. Definitely a A1 cookie strain

VFucking wow. Easily top 3 strains I&#39;ve ever tried. This has replaced Bubba Kush for me. It has the earthy/pine classic jet fuel kush aftertaste, but with the full on girl scout cookies flavor to begin. It smells like actual girl scout cookies dipped in pinesol. I dont even smoke flowers much anymore , as I have high dab tolerance, but this strain absolutely floored me after 3 .2 bong rips. One of the most powerful yet cerebral highs I&#39;ve ever had.  Just enough of the sativa effects from the Durban poison genetics  [girl scout cookies] get through to make it not necessarily a night only strain. Definitely not something beginners should overdo. If it&#39;s a good batch and smells dank, this is a must buy at any time.

I feel a mild tingling around my eyes that\u2019s helping with a headache and TMJ right now and my musculoskeletal pain is definitely easing. No paranoia or racing heart when I vaped a small bowl. \u000aThe sample I got from Blue Roots was a bit dry (their glass vials don\u2019t properly seal so their samples can dry out), but covered in trichomes and smelled like sweet berry, mild skunk, sweet tea and something else I can\u2019t place. I definitely recommend. \u000aGreat for medical patients that\u2019s like to get high.

Vwell 1st off I&#39;m am writing this review from 2 ppl point of view \u000a\u000a1st my self: I am a smoke at night only kind of guy, took my 1st hit at 28 years old, and was a bit scared to try this from reading reviews from ppl that say that smoke ALOT and this strain got them STONED, so I was super excited to try it, well it didn&#39;t go well for me, I had to almost finish a whole joint to get high and at that I wasn&#39;t that high. so for me this was a miss..\u000a\u000aNow my Wife: She has been around the corner when it comes to grass and she considers her self a pot head, the effect of this strain was the oppesit for her then me. She was up there chillen with God (as we say in my house) and she only hit it like 3 times, great body high with a nice strong head high, so for her it was 5 stars for sure. \u000a\u000aFor me I give it 3 stars but I will not rate it on here cuz again I&#39;m more like a beginner when it comes to this stuff.

VA good strain. Very pleasant smell and taste. The high creeps up on you but not overly powerful. A bit anxious when it first kicked in but that lasted only about 10 minutes. This high made me feel very slow but not in a bad way. Just longer to do things etc so definitely a strictly nighttime strain. Cons are the kick in anxiousness and a little dizzyness. First time timers stay away lol. A+ for pain and insomnia though just zaps the pain until it&#39;s just an afterthought in your head, just not as euphoric for me as I&#39;d like in my top shelf strains.

VI have just taken a dab of Do-si-do and i want to see how it does with my arthritis pain, specifically in my low back, hands, wrists and feet/ankles. I have a lot of pain, stiffness and swelling today.\u000aI&#39;m also under a lot of stress because life. What else really needs to be added to: I&#39;m just trying to do and be me and life shows up with some random $#@ stuff (keeping it pg heres) to mess with me, for reasons... creates...&#128559; fml.\u000aI&#39;m taking my second dab now...and it&#39;s been about 10 min. since my 2nd dab. Right after taking the 2nd one, I felt immediate pain relief in every area; some more than others, however any relief is a plus in my book. My back is still sore (40% improvement) but my hands/wrists and feet/ankles are feeling much better. I&#39;d say after 15 min, a solid 70% improvement.

This is unfortunate because I can feel it&#39;s potential to be uplifting and help smooth out the rough edges or help soothe frayed nerves, hurt feelings; but it seems out of reach. A 3rd dab may do the trick, but I would rather achieve this by the 2nd dab. I think I have to try this in flower to truly know it&#39;s full potential.\u000a At this time:\u000aDo-si-do &#128142;&#128150; SPARKLES &#128142;&#128150; for Pain &#128522;&#128526;\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u000aDo-si-do does not &#127787;\u26c7SUN SHINE \u26c7&#127787; for Stress, Anxiety, Sadness, or Irritability &#128559;&#128530;  \u2b50\u2b50

VI was looking for a good indica that I could smoke at night. As a cannabis user, the effects that I look for in a strain are: euphoria, relaxation, uplifted, happy, giggly, tingly, and something I like to call \u201cThe Kwan\u201d. The Kwan is that feeling you get with certain strains that just make you say, \u201cYeah, this is some GOOD shit\u201d. It is the word I use to describe that feeling you get when you want to get up and dance. The Kwan is when music sounds better, food tastes better, and all is right with the world. So, letting you know, that is what I\u2019m basing my review on. I got the herb, it smelled pungent and floraly to me. It was as sticky as a post-it note and looked pretty dank to me. Smoked it and almost immediately I started to feel the effects. As I continued to smoke, I noticed that I was becoming high. It felt good, tingly, a nice body high; I started to feel a bit of a head high as well. I waited for about 30 minutes to really make a judgement call on this one. Do-Si-Dos gives a nice high, but that\u2019s about it. It made me feel relaxed as f**k without a complete couch-lock feeling. I felt a little creative, a bit analytical, and a bit sleepy. It felt good, very good; but that\u2019s about all I can say for this strain. I didn\u2019t feel as euphoric as I\u2019d wanted to, I felt somewhat happy, I was a bit uplifted. I noticed that most of the qualities that I look for were there. However, the single greatest quality was not there; it didn\u2019t have The Kwan. I was a bit disappointed, but it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good weed, just not great weed. Not to me anyway. It\u2019ll definitely make you high as apple pie, but if you\u2019re looking for The Kwan, look elsewhere. I suggest Master Kush. Good, not great.
