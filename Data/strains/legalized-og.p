VI had this strain in terp wax and it was very flavorful (hints of pine and diesel)  and the high from one 0.15 dab lasted about 2 hours and the overall calmness lasted about 4. I have a tolerance of smoking about a gram a day of concentrate

VThis strain hits you straight away. It was a weird mix of a head high and a body high combined. This would be a perfect strain to smoke with your friends, chilling and having a laugh. It didn\u2019t make me feel anxious, only a little paranoid after I hit the pipe, the power of this bud went straight to my brain, it did pass however and the good vibe tide took me out on a wave.  \u000a\u000aTop Hybrid for me. \u000a\u000acouch&gt;
