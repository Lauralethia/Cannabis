VA very cerebral high with a mild stoning effect. Good for social situations with friends. This weed will have you laughing at any silly little thing.  Its not great but then its not bad either.

Vwow I have been a daily smoker for a while but this strain is simply amazing. I felt absolute euphoria for around 6 hours and I am nearly never high for that long. Surprised it is indica because I felt a big head high. Honey cocaine will put you on cloud nine.

VWhat a fun friend- to run in the sun, and play in the sand, who stays at your house, then steals your man. But the good times were better, and he was a prick, so her you don&#39;t envy, you flick your Bic.

VAbsolutely loved this strain! I picked in up in Colorado where I live and let me tell you, it hits hard. I&#39;m one whose prone to anxiety when I get too high or my heart races but this strain just doesn&#39;t allow me to be anxious about anything after I smoke it. Also worked wonders for my muscle spasms! \u000a

VWent and got more Hbb in a crumble this time, the shatter I had before was fantastic. the second go around as good as the first! Really fun strain happy energy for awhile, and love the sweetness. I&#39;d like to try this in flower form once.

VHoney Boo Boo is one of my all time favorite strains, although it&#39;s a little harsh on the lungs, the amazing euphoria makes it soooo worth it.   My girlfriend and I smoke it at night to help with aches and pains and to sleep like a champ but not before we have some mind blowing sex.

VThe honeycomb wax from Cannavative of this strain comes in at 80.9% THC and every bit of that will hit you right away. The implied honey taste doesn&#39;t come through in the flavor profile. In fact, not a lot does. But, I do like it for its potency and effect.
