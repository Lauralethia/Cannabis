VPerfrct indica. This strain will leave you happy, euphoric, and very heavily sedated. It is the perfect smoke after a long day or if youre feeling anxious.

VOne of the best indicas i&#39;ve ever had. Gave me a great body feeling as well and put me right to sleep. Very relaxing. The smell is amazing, like fruitness of grapes and cheese. I suggest you check this one out, it&#39;s one of my new favorite strains.

VPowerful.  After vape session I started having vertigo, which is one of my MS symptions.  I don&#39;t use sleep meds, because they often do this too.  Next time I will only use about 3 hits of this strain on the vaporizer.  Good strain for folks who want to get an old fashioned shit faced high.  At my age, I prefer to be a bit more functional.

VMy friend has been through many strains and has quite a refined weed pallet. I trust him and so should you. So when he says it\u2019s one of the best indica\u2019s he\u2019s ever had you best know it\u2019s true.  Don\u2019t miss out people.

Vonce again this strain is in a different league. Smell, Taste, Effects all outrageous. It helps when you grow your own Cannabis for over 15 years so it&#39;s Top Notch

VI would rate this strain of 4.5 or a five star I only smoked one bowl out of it and it put me on my ass. I was relaxed and all my pain in my back was gone. Definitely something to try if you have chronic pain.(Down Side) cotton mouth, munchies other then that one of the best strains I have had and I would definitely recommend.

VI&#39;m really jealous of you guys! I chose PC based on reviews, and what I got looked beautiful. But where it counts, it&#39;s taste and potency were disappointing. Not bad, but not special and not very potent. Oh well!

VI absolutely dig so much about this strain. The smell is delightful, the taste is deliciously cheesy with a hint of sweet, and a little of it went a hell of a long way. I felt so relaxed that I swear I time traveled, and it made dinner magical. I strongly recommend this one if you want a nice evening... emphasis on nice.
