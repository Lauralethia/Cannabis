VOV takes away any stressful situation you may have. It is very relaxing and very smooth. I&#39;ve learned that not too many people love the citrus flavor but, I can assure you smoking a blunt of this amazingly flavorful strain will knock you off your feet and leave you feeling like nothing really matters, at all. I miss you OV.\u000a

VThis says its a hybrid but on this pheno it foxtailed. So i think this batch has more sativa dominance over the indica. The smell is like pure orange citrus, beautiful, heavenly best smelling in a long time terpenes i have ever smelled!!! Its definitely genetic. I keep all my favorite buds in 1 big jar and no matter what this bud out smells them all, and never loses its smell. Like say for instance another bud will out loose it&#39;s smell in the jar because of all the other weeds with overpowering smells. So another bud will start to smell like  a mix of the strongest smelling bud in the jar and the smell of the that 1 bud. Like i threw this really good smelling bud in there then the next day it had no smell cause the orange overpowered it lol. Anyway to sum it up this is definitely a great bud and taste wise and smell wise its a special 1 of a kind. And to make it better it gives a great high and all the buds were huge foxtails with like no stem&#39;s or if there were any stems they were very very small like small dry sugar leaf stem size probably smaller. Sorry for the rant i just really love the terpenes in this strain.

VI know someone with this one and it&#39;s definitely a sativa. It&#39;s not a hybrid. It&#39;s very much a true breed. It foxtails easily with adequate light and has giant thin leaves with larger than usual internode space. Less like cones, more like golf balls and icicles, larger at the top rather than the base. Still smells orange creamy.

VI LOVED this bud!  And considering how fast my favorite shop sold out of it, apparently everyone else did, too!  I had strained muscles in my neck and shoulders and was in so much pain I was about to go to urgent care, but I didn&#39;t want to take pain pills without trying some herbal remedies.  I asked my bubtender what was best for pain and she recommended Orange Velvet.  It&#39;s lower in THC so it&#39;s not a super stony high, but it&#39;s near 14% for CBDs and after one bowl I hardly could notice my neck and shoulder pain!  It had a very unique taste, not quite as citrusy as I was expecting, but more of super piney taste almost like a super hoppy IPA.  I did some research on the strain and, thanks to Leafly, I learned that this strain is super rare, so if you see some don&#39;t hesitate!

VMore than a novelty strain. Yes, it tastes and smells like oranges but it is wonderful for many different applications. It kills pain better than the Leafly description gives it credit for. It produces wonderful euphoria and warm thoughts, and really does a number on depression. In fact, in my experience it alleviates depression better than any other strain. It just has a knack for getting your brain to secrete all the right chemicals. I feel happy and uplifted for days after use. It also seems to help my tinnitus. Sure, it rings a bit louder during the high, but seems to lower it considerably afterwards. In fact, after a month of OV I experienced some of the lowest levels in recent memory. The high is definitely more dreamy than clearheaded. And I should also mention that Orange Velvet is an extremely powerful aphrodisiac. The only negative that I can think of is that there is a small bit of anxiety when it starts to wear off but nothing major. I would say it is good for beginners. I know Leafly has it rated as a high anxiety strain but that has never been my experience. I do not understand why this strain is rare. Monster THC levels are not everything. Sorry to be long-winded but Orange velvet required a bit of explanation. BTW when you make edibles with OV the taste is horrible! pairs terribly with chocolate but mint extract solves the problem.

VA 50/50 hybrid that delivers the best of both worlds. Helps relive nausea and light pain with a slight slowing of the motor skills. But you keep a sharp head. Has a great citrus taste. I did not enjoy the flower but I loved the concentrate.

VYes, this strain does taste like oranges, especially in a vaporizer. This medicine worked best for me in small (1 to 2) doses. It can be relaxing without a drousy feeling. In higher doses, I found that my short term memory is impaired, while feeling (believing) that I am clearheaded. So, I do not prefer this strain over others. However, I know of at least one other person who doesn&#39;t have the side effect that I just mentioned.

VThe high is the most euphoric I&#39;ve had. Every girl I ever smoked this with, their skirts were visibly wet by the moment they smelt it, with their panties dropped 10 seconds after their first bowl. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. If a &quot;kush cologne&quot; could exist, I&#39;d make it out of this. Wow does it smell good. This strain is also the hardiest and hardest to detect by sniffing little narcs near you.
