VA recent ride  out to relief in southern md,  a buddtender  weighed out a 1/2  oz of logistics brand blueberry skunk,by the numbers the thc  level isn\u2019t very high but the fact that it\u2019s a indica it will relax you and give you a good nites rest.it a nice positive ,relaxing buzz  destresses  the shoulder and neck ,great product but a Very dry product but I put it in a crypto vault and now I can taste a hint of blueberry ,all respect to the state but underground it would cost  half the price =feeling like a real sucker at these prices,175 for 14 grams,but if you had a limited time it probably wouldn\u2019t matter ,have some compassion and lower the prices

V\u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605 Could have been a bit more potent, but it was a wonderful high and great smoke all together anyways! Taste and smell was vey potent and pleasant.  I smoked .5 and at about 40 minutes I got the gigles really bad and it was awesome because it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve experienced a strain that put me in that state. Very stress relieving session. Just wish it was as strong as it could be thc wise and what not but it was still great!

VBlueberry Skunk hits extremely hard and fast straight to the head like ten pounds of cannabis just landed on your head, feels like you&#39;re wearing a headband. Vape is tasty and blueberry tasting. High is a classic Indica stone but its not just &quot;I&#39;m stoned&quot; I also feel happy and pain free. Everything I&#39;ve gotten from Mother Mary&#39;s has been phenomenal. Any dispensary that lab tests everything they got is going to be the best.\u000a\u000aOne of the quickest onset weeds i&#39;ve ever vaped, it hits SO fast its rather surprising. You feel it as you inhale it. BTW, I vape using a digital volcano vaporizer.

VReally fun strain, tastes like blubbery through out and the high hits you after about 10 minutes.  At its start it is very upity and makes you very exited and giggly. Smoking more will only make this awesome feeling more awesome; but be careful because after those fun sativa effects wear off, you will crash out.  All in all a pretty good strain, little low in THC and causes mid day naps; but still very fun.

VFirst time trying an indica-dominant strain, and I have to say this better than some of the sativas I&#39;ve really enjoyed. Blueberry Skunk is giving me a nice high while not acting stupid, which is how I usually feel whenever I smoke a sativa strain, gives me a huge motivation boost and a creative state of mind. Now hears something that is interesting, when smoking this I noticed that it seemed like there was no flavor to this strain which was weird. Ok goodbye

VVery solid, relaxing effect that a lot of the blueberry strains seem to have. Its not sleep inducing but you can easily melt into whatever seat you&#39;re in and chill. Clarity without foggyness that you would find in say a heavy kush.  Flavor is very sweet in a joint, almost nauseating if I have too much. I find it much better for bong rips or concentrate form if you don&#39;t like that overly sweet taste for long periods.

VWonderful Strain.  It has a little CBD in it and you feel the difference especially in your body and behind your eyes.  Very relaxing.  The flavor is nice too, the Skunk doesn\u2019t dominate but does combine nicely with the blueberry.  Neither flavor overpower each other, which I like.

VThis strain smells awsome and tastes great. This strain gives you a nice head buzz. Plus you feel real nice once it sets in.

VThis review is of my 1st harvested plant which was a misfit. It expressed the classics of this plant. It was a early harvest (75% trichomes cloudy) for more of a head high. Very impressive strain and easy to grow. without the Blueberry sensativity to nutes.

VOutstanding Body High with a relativly good head high. Blueberry Skunk tastes Wondefull, and it leaves you at a relaxed Atmosphaire but it still hits you hard. The only reason im giving only a 4/5 is that the head high come slowly and leaves you fast too.

VThis flower was beautiful, the taste was outstanding. The high not so much. It was a weak body high with very dry eyes. Maybe I got a bad strain but I assure you I will never be smoking this again.
