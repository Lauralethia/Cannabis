VIt certainly has a fruity, cherry-like flavor and aroma when vaporized. It was pleasant to imbibe.  \u000a\u000aI generally like Indicas as they don&#39;t hype me up as much as the more Sativa dominant strains.  This provided good relief from a strong migraine and was quite relaxing (maybe too much).  But, it also seemed to &#39;numb&#39; me out which wasn&#39;t exactly what I wanted in that moment.  \u000a\u000aSo, IMHO experience good for pain management, relaxation and generally zoning out when needed.

VGotta say... this strain does the most for my insomnia thus far. The ONLY side effect that I experience from this (when smoked) is that I tend to want to be alone. Not depressingly or anything, just sorta want my own space to think or do something like write or paint. If I smoke this with people, I tend to get irritated. When vaped, I have that same side effect and I also get CRAZYYYYY dry mouth.

VHighly recommend this to any OG lovers out there. Very uplifiting high, while still retaining a relaxing indica effect. Buds were sticky with a nice lighter green and smelled like kush and black cherries... Always love when the name ain&#39;t a claim.... Flavor while smoking also stayed true to the name. Definitely a new favorite of mine and I&#39;m sure yours as well. Don&#39;t sleep on this one.

VThis Black Cherry OG from 420 gold in WA state was one very nice dense nug that was coated in crystals dark green flower with a lot of dark purple as well. It&#39;s hard to see but there&#39;s amber/orange hairs speckled throughout the dense nugget. Hit 1 tasted/smelt like a strong smoke/aroma. Hit 2 tasted like berries and my mouth started to water; hit 3 I felt stress relief and muscle relaxation as well as an appetite.
