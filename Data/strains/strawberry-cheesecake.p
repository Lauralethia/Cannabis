VThis 100% indica is amazing...my hip pain was flaring up and after I smoked some of this flower I was relaxed, happy, and calm...it felt like I had just gotten a full body massage. I&#39;m normally more of a sativa girl because I have an active lifestyle day to day, but this indica (in my opinion) and a lot of sativa properties I like while also easing my hip pain away, enabling me to continue being active without the day without needing to nap or anything. I think I found my new favorite indica strain!

VA lovely strain that has to this day yet to be matched for pain relief. At least for my sort of neuropathic burning skin pain. Dry mouth is annoying though, but it comes with sweet sweet blissful release from the horrid pain of a damaged spinal cord, so it&#39;s totally worth it! I love this lady for holding me tight and whisking away my pain and leaving me relaxed and happy!

Awesome nighttime weed, kinda stuff you&#39;re gonna wanna smoke after a long day of work. Amazing flavour too. Definitely pack some bowls in your vape and throw on Netflix, let the Strawberry Cheesecake do the rest.

VStrawberry cheesecake is a great option for people who suffer from anxiety. In my opinion it&#39;s similar to taking a benzodiazepine. If you over do it you will be sleepy after the high fades.

VI grow this strain every run, along with about 5 other strains that all finish about the same time. This strain usually produces hard crunchy nuggets that are as crystally as can be. Usually finish fast in the last week or so of flower rarely going over the 8 week mark.(56 days) the flavor is unlike any other strawberry strain i have had over the years. Very smooth strawberry-ish flavor with hints of its parent strains coming through here and there as you enjoy it. Patients love it. It makes for an excellent extraction strain, and is a must for all the &quot;flavor chasers&quot; out there. And thats just the flavor. Get to the effect and you are ready to chill out and relax deeply. But not forced to do so as with other mostly indica strains. I have debated on putting the strain on the back burner for a while but never seems to happen. The demand is up there for this strain. Clones well and grows fast in soil and soil-less mixes.

VI was worried that this strain could make me sleepy but it does not. I wasn&#39;t expecting a lot but this stuff was potent. The beautiful thing about it is that it makes you relax more than you thought was humanly possible and creates intense euphoric feelings and stimulates creativity. I smoke about 10 blunts a day and I usually smoke two at a time but one of these is so dank that it gets the job done. The bud I got was covered in crystals. It looked like it was rolled in salt.

VGrower: OCI THC: 31.5% CBD: 2.5% This is a really stoney and couch-locky indica. After opening the bag you are hit with a delicious and pungent aroma of strawberries and cheese. It also tastes great with an instant hit of berry and then on the exhale a skunky/spicy cheese. Its moderately euphoric compared to something like cherries jubilee or grapefruit but is much more of a stoney haze where you cant get up after eating everything you have. After about an hour and a half it gets more sedating until you pass out. It is very smooth with a proper flush/cure. The gram looked like 3 pebbles and a rock but each nug was insanely dense where it was hard to snap in half and would gunk up any grinder I have. Very pleased with this strain as its great for after a long day of work or staying in for the night watching netflix 10/10.

Let it take its time and only after 30 minutes make the decision for more.\u000a\u000aVery, very good for anxiety, stress or combating that grey slump feeling.

VI&#39;m quite active in various sports teams and like to do circuits. I picked some of this up after I had done a routine that left me already feeling superb. So, I rolled up and took a puff. White smoke. Perfect for focused micro activities like writing a case study, for example. I felt relaxed and like others have mentioned my back and injury pains from footie have dulled. Music and this strain can get you UP! \u000aSocially, I was smooth and fun. The strain I have been looking for!!

VI was worried that this strain could make me sleepy but it does not. I wasn&#39;t expecting a lot but this stuff was potent. The beautiful thing about it is that it makes you relax more than you thought was humanly possible and creates intense euphoric feelings and stimulates creativity. I smoke about 10 blunts a day and I usually smoke two at a time but one of these is so dank that it gets the job done. The bud I got was covered in crystals. It looked like it was rolled in salt.

VI grow this strain every run, along with about 5 other strains that all finish about the same time. This strain usually produces hard crunchy nuggets that are as crystally as can be. Usually finish fast in the last week or so of flower rarely going over the 8 week mark.(56 days) the flavor is unlike any other strawberry strain i have had over the years. Very smooth strawberry-ish flavor with hints of its parent strains coming through here and there as you enjoy it. Patients love it. It makes for an excellent extraction strain, and is a must for all the &quot;flavor chasers&quot; out there. And thats just the flavor. Get to the effect and you are ready to chill out and relax deeply. But not forced to do so as with other mostly indica strains. I have debated on putting the strain on the back burner for a while but never seems to happen. The demand is up there for this strain. Clones well and grows fast in soil and soil-less mixes.

VI personally like to grow this strain for its ability to be versatile in her effects, growth pattern/size, difficulty to grow, taste, potency &amp; yield.\u000a\u000aShe is an all round winner in my books. If you leave it to flower 1-2 weeks longer, and get those trichrome&#39;s nice and amber, this strain can easily put you to sleep without you even realising. Haha,\u000a\u000aBut I tend to grow her just till her trich&#39;s are 85-95% cloudy, this tends to be more of an all round high/stone. 1-2 bowls, and your appetite is raging, have another 1-2 more after a meal and you may struggle to keep your eyelids open. She has a very calming, full body relaxation, with a soothing spaciness. \u000a\u000aPerfect for pain relief, anxiety, hunger, insomnia.\u000a

VFirst impressions: It&#39;s definitely a soft sweet mild candy smell. I didn&#39;t get cheese, but its potent. \u000aYou can see it on the plant, but when you really get into the heart, the pistils are actually a nice purple/redish hue, adding a nice visual quality you don&#39;t see everyday.\u000aThe bud itself is packed tightly and had this almost incredible hulk green look to it; kinda surreal\u000a\u000aThe smoke: It&#39;s smooth. Coughing induces a slight fruity taste, but nothing lasting. You get an all over body buzz. I remember working out my back earlier in the day and by the time I smoked this, the areas where I had worked out, there was tingling as if I was getting a massage. There is a cerebral buzz, but not as hazy as some indica&#39;s can be. I find this strain can induce a giggle fit here if you&#39;re watching the right things. Beware! If you have munchies around, they will be gone by the time you&#39;ve smoked. Increase in appetite is a thing. \u000a\u000aVery little paranoia or anxiety once the smokes sets in. Very relaxing for the body, you might get a short creative/loose thought moments, but it fades away quicky as you couch lock and slowly get comfortable to daze away. \u000aCould put you to sleep, but I would recommend this strain more for body aches, stress and in general, a good time for relaxing.
