VI was pleasantly surprised with the amount of kief this strain has. The flower itself was very dense and light covered with crystals. The taste is VERY earthy, piney, skunky, diesely, etc., just an overall very robust flavor that I forget about every time I start a smoke sesh without preparing my throat/ lungs and regret it afterwards for a few minutes. The high itself starts off as a very intense cerebral buzz and then it mellows out into more of an indica. However, I will stay personally I experienced more sativa-like effects than indica with this strain. Overall, I really enjoyed this strain and the amount of kief that I was able to smoke by itself which most of the time I can&#39;t do because I&#39;m bad at saving kief for long periods of time.

VAmazing strain. Buds are dank and sticky with a rich, smooth earthy flavor. The effects are absolutely incredible... definitely Indica dominant, but also provides a peaceful, happy head high. It&#39;s the perfect strain for relaxing after a long day because it soothes all of your little aches and pains, as well as melting your stress away. In the hands of a good grower, Rudeboi definitely ranks up there among the most legendary strains available!

VThis is a great strain. Really well balanced head and body effects. The high is happy, silly, and spacey, with little to no couch lock. However, if you need to at lower doses you can push through the spaciness and think through complex things. After the head high spaces me out it makes my whole body tingle and loosen up (the pain killing isn&#39;t as strong as some though). A warning though -- even at the 22% my Gold Leaf batch was tested at it&#39;s a fairly heavy hitter.\u000a\u000aMy one complaint would be the taste and smell. As someone who likes sweeter/spicier stuff the strong funky earth smell of this strain wasn&#39;t anything I got excited about. However, I don&#39;t really use weed for the taste :P

I watched a documentary VERY interested.  It&#39;s almost like half bud, half opiate.  Strong headiness/cerebral, body high but with clarity.  Some giddiness.

VRudeboi is great for relieving pain and nausea together without making you too foggy headed to still be functional. Has pain relieving power of some traditional heavy Indicas without the \u201ccouch lock\u201d effect. Used it to make a green dragon tincture and some edibles and handles my symptoms that usually require multiple strains. Does make me very \u201cchatty\u201d and a little too willing to volunteer information leading my family to dub it an \u201chonesty\u201d strain. Overall very pleased, it has officially become one of my regular daily use strains.

VRude Boi is one of those special strains that leave the circuits of nerves in your nasal cavity, cilia of the lungs, through to your brain, and every sensory gland excited along the way baffled.  Trying to pinpoint every potent terpene that this strains packs in a punch of euphoric, body numbing, yet surprisingly manageable high.   By manageable I mean this could be a daytime buzz or used at nighttime for more of a sleepy effect.  Obviously depending on reaction with user and experience because this is a stony strain especially when used in larger doses.   \u000a\u000aIt is my personal preference to dose high so there is no shame in wanting to catch a legit buzz whether for medicinal or recreational purposes alike.  In a lot of respects and also cases recreation &amp; medicine are the same for who is to to say that being happy does not have medicinal value.  And with such a fine taste full of delectable morsels both earthy in nature with a zesty pachouli meets clove on inhale.  The exhale took me a little longer to detect, but after 3 or 4 hits the taste on the way out is gassy.  Almost chemical, but more a gas from the earth.  Much like this strange gas that seeped out of a hole in the ground along some path in the campgrounds around Saratoga Springs, NY.  \u000a\u000aRumor was that if you sucked on the gas coming out the person would get high like on N2O for 10 minutes.  Either smart or chickenshit, no comment needed this was over a decade ago yours truly decided against such activity only sniffing a bit around the hole.  Often times not a great practice, steer clear, but did give me a little insight into earthy gases, not of the sulfer kind, more of a quartz cave.  Great coming in &amp; going out this terpene profile is awesome with a pretty flexible buzz.  Head stays focused while body turns to fluff.

VA friend saved me some after telling me about how good it was. I&#39;m a heavy smoker and love my indicas. This strain did not disappoint. I love the loamy, earthy flavor of this. It tastes like the great outdoors, kinda like clean dirt to me.\u000aIt&#39;s sooo tasty with a slow freight train smash of a high into me. I love the high THC content.  I was fortunate enough to also try some shatter of this. I hope I can get more of this because I love the flavor and it&#39;s a perfect high for me even though it&#39;s deep to function daily.
