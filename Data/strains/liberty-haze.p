VHm well its not bad for beginners but its easy to build a tolerance to this as its really not the most potent bud out there. But overall a nice 60/40 indica leaning hybrid. Has a paradoxical energetic couchlock, so dont plan on actually doing anything for the next hour or so.. Makes ADD worse so not the greatest for medical although it is a relatively clear up high compared to some of the indica hybrids out there.. Hm. I just cant give this 5 stars I thought their LSD strain was better for medical use ironically.. Too ADDesc to watch a movie although It was pretty good for sitting around blasting club music and staring at the table in a haze of perplexing upbeat thoughts.. This isnt quite strong enough on the sativa side to be called a &quot;next level high&quot; but somewhat close if you have enough of it.. Just smoked a large bowl right now: It gives you that type of feeling after you just ran a marathon or something and your super exhausted yet stimulated and euphoric as you reach for that cold water bottle someone just handed you and gulp it down like its made out of refreshing liquid gold..But really you just want to sit around: its an exhausting kind of stimulation..

VLiberty Haze has a sweet, Juice Fruit, smell as the buds grow. The final product has large white crystals bursting out everywhere where the hairs turn into a dark brown with an almost a red hue that becomes abundant in the final week of flowing. The biggest bud wighted out at 3.2 grams with many others just coming in at just over 2 grams.  The smell is not overpowering when growing or after harvest, but the high was not lacking. It was a nice balanced high between both the body and mind.

VThis strain has satisfied the hype. My dispensary owner has been rumoring about its arrival, and I must say, it has lived up to the rumors. This strain provided a very &quot;heady&quot; high! Most of the effects that were strongly noticeable to me involved my mentality rather than my body. I am aware of the genetics of this 2011 Cannabis Cup Winner strain, but this strain had a very noticeable sativa feel to me. Now this is for me, and I am a regular indica user, therefore maybe I am unaccustomed to the sativa feel of a &quot;buzz&quot;. Nevertheless, this strain was very entertaining! I found myself thinking extremely odd things, and laughing at the simple things my wife did! My only complaint is the length of the high. Now this may be strange to the stoners out there, but as I said before, I prefer an indica high. That being said, I usually dose before I go to bed. Now that does not mean that I didn&#39;t enjoy the &quot;heady&quot; high that this strain gave, I just wish I was a bit shorter. Another point I promised to make regarded a new experience for me with marijuana. After I had come down fro  this &quot;heady&quot; high, I was able to solve a problem that my colleagues and I have been stumped on for weeks! Overall, great strain of marijuana, congratulation to Barney&#39;s Farm!

VMy first attempt growing MMJ for my wife. This is just a little sample piece I pulled to test before I cut and this is some Kill Ahh stuff!  Totally knocked her Pain &amp; Nausea out, but also provided her with a &quot;Super Uplifting Happy High&quot; that allowed her to do things she hadn&#39;t done in a year from Chemo.  \u000a\u000aThe only major drawback is the big-time dry mouth and it caused me to eat an entire box of chocolate-chip cookies (first time smoker).

VInteresting vibe. Typically I am an indica enthusiast as it helps with my anxiety. lately I&#39;ve been smoking Critical Mass which seems to give me a great all body high but keeps me on the couch. Liberty Haze however encouraged me to think positively and not hit me so hard. I feel less heavy, have a useful amount of energy and no signs of panic-anxiety. I feel &#39;pleased&#39; and relaxed, but fully functional and cognizant, and attentive. Great for any time of the day. Go easy on it. inexperienced smokers will green-out big time on this if they go too hard too quickly. Thick smoke that burns the throat slightly more, but a relieving smooth flavour. A must-smoke for socialites.

VPuffin\u2019 Liberty Haze made me think of Statue of Liberty surrounded by fog.  It was perfect for winter shoveling during the blizzard in ME . It slows me down with body sensations to gaze and appreciate the snow storm while shoveling, thus it reduces the risk for back-muscle strains and heart attacks. It liberates yourself in haze, all\u2019daze.

As soon as I finished my joint, I could already feel myself lifting off the ground. The effects quickly spring upon you and can leave you in a state of relaxation and happiness. I found that the strain has a sweet yet pungent taste and was incredibly smooth as I took back the potent haze from my joint. Not the best strain out there, but certainly worth a buy

Smells delightfully bright.\u000aTaste:\u000aTastes like its pine tree.&#160;&#160; \u000aStrategy: \u000aI used my &quot;Jaded Dragon&quot; pipe. Jade color dragon with its long intricate transparent jade dragon body wrapped around a stone black glass pipe body with grey smoke details. The head of the dragon is at the top of my pipe. \u000a1st hit: ( 5 min)\u000aI feel like Im pretty high already. My high is taking place in the head like I feel pretty focused, and also in my body. In my body i feel like i&#39;m chilling in a bowl of chocolate pudding. (Assuming you&#39;ve ever sat relaxing in a pool of chocolate pudding of course. \u000a2nd hit: ( 10 min)\u000aI feel a heavy stone in my head and a heavily lazed body. \u000a3rd hit:&#160; (&#160; 15 min) \u000aI feel highly focused with a heavy head high and a flat pancake body while on my laptop doing homework. I also successfully rapped Stainless by Logic. I did a really good, nearly perfect recite. \u000aTime check: (30 min) \u000aIm doing homework and im staying focused on it. I feel tired yet I also feel the willingness to carry on. \u000aTime check: (60 min)&#160; \u000aStill feel high. A cool high. Three hits hours a long way with this strain!&#160; I&#39;m impressed.

VOut of this world. The Feeling of floating, rocketing up, is intense. Lots of giggles. Nice citrus zing. Very potent, get a lot of mileage. Definite enhancement of the senses. This is your strain for Friday afternoon after work, and hanging out with friends or seeing nature. It will make you want ice cream though. Would buy again.

VThese go,den nuggets have the G13 long stranded buds with pistols dunked over this bud! Genetic structure of buds you&#39;d see in the late 80&#39;s.  Has a genetic structure of G 13 and will keep your couch locked in a dazed and unfocused way I&#39;ve never felt like partying so much on this strain.  Along time ago when I had liberty Hayes it was a really great focus but now when I had that I feel like doing absolutely nothing and not getting anything done however I will try to do a lot of new things thanks liberty is for opening my eyes and what I haven&#39;t been seeing. Great for relaxing into meditation and really great rest!\u000a Smells like grass clippings flowery and Sage like other than that I would say it has a small undertone of citrus and Pine.  Very wposy skunks textures along with pungent thick vape.

VInteresting vibe. Typically I am an indica enthusiast as it helps with my anxiety. lately I&#39;ve been smoking Critical Mass which seems to give me a great all body high but keeps me on the couch. Liberty Haze however encouraged me to think positively and not hit me so hard. I feel less heavy, have a useful amount of energy and no signs of panic-anxiety. I feel &#39;pleased&#39; and relaxed, but fully functional and cognizant, and attentive. Great for any time of the day. Go easy on it. inexperienced smokers will green-out big time on this if they go too hard too quickly. Thick smoke that burns the throat slightly more, but a relieving smooth flavour. A must-smoke for socialites.

VAll I would say is don&#39;t make this your first weed. This was the first weed I ever smoked, while with my girlfriend in Maastricht. I thought I was a gameshow host and kept feeling like I was slipping into a different dimension. Obviously different weeds, different effects, different people. I did bake them into edibles because I smoke like a puss. I had myself a fire cracker and sat around waiting for something to happen. One hour. Nothing. Two hour. Nothing. Two hours and a quarter fucking BAM. It was smooth, don&#39;t get me wrong but it was VERY quick hitting. I was giggling like a madman. I could still walk and talk but I was aware I was making no sense. And it was very funny. If you&#39;re going to bake these, bake them quite strong and eat them with your mates. You may not remember EVERYTHING that happens, but when people remind you it&#39;ll come back to you. Try have one sober person to record everything. Trust me.

VThis strain has been my favorite so far. When I smoke it I feel calm, uplifted, present, and happy. It mellows me out just enough to ease my anxiety. It uplifts my mood and helps me with my depression. I can think clearly, which helps me with adhd. When I smoke this at night, I&#39;m relaxed enough to go to bed and I wake up the next morning feeling energized and in a good mood(which is bizarre, because I am not a morning person). I can&#39;t really attest to how this strain  works for those suffering with chronic pain or other concerns, but it has definitely helped me with headaches/migraines and my mental health. This strain is the best all-around, in my opinion, without any ill effects. Definitely one you&#39;ll want to keep coming back to.

When I smoke this at night, I&#39;m relaxed enough to go to bed and I wake up the next morning feeling energized and in a good mood(which is bizarre, because I am not a morning person). I can&#39;t really attest to how this strain  works for those suffering with chronic pain or other concerns, but it has definitely helped me with headaches/migraines and my mental health. This strain is the best all-around, in my opinion, without any ill effects. Definitely one you&#39;ll want to keep coming back to.

VThe strain I tired grew like an indica but definitely has a nice balanced high. It hits pretty hard and fast. The taste is good. Realitivly light smoke. Bad dry mouth. If you smoke the right amount very easy to keep moving and doing things. Take too much and I get a bit jittery. overall 8 out 10.

VMethod: Wulf-LX Vaporizer\u000aFull Chamber.\u000a5 pulls.\u000a4.5 stars out of 5......\u000a\u000a\u000aOK. So I avoid reading reviews on anything, including pot, as to avoid the outside experience of others perceptions; initially...\u000a\u000a\u000aThe last review I did was on Gelato. And Liberty Haze... just a different creature altogether. It really adapts to &#39;honing in&#39; type activities... something a little more serious about this high. Not bad. Just... less playfully explosive than Gelato&#39;s exuberant high. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe upside to Liberty, I feel that I&#39;ve more options when it comes to choosing the gear and speed. Most certainly a very heady high... but I don&#39;t mean felt in the head only. Its effect on the nervous system is more my meaning. The buzziness seems to run deep, like live wires. \u000a\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s not the sunny warm surface body high like Gorilla Glue, or Blue Dream... Liberty is much more &#39;cerebral&#39;. Even the review I&#39;m writing is more straightforward and conservative. So it doesn&#39;t creatively let loose. Which is kinda nice... those strains that get me looped that way, only tend to lend to a certain activity. And that&#39;s potentially limiting...\u000a\u000a\u000aThere is a nice brightness to Liberty Haze. The high, is most certainly &#39;mind-warming&#39;, but, I don&#39;t think Liberty is a &#39;let&#39;s go to a dinner party stoned&#39; kinda weed... I&#39;d be all floating around like Major Tom up in the space between my ears. Id&#39;probably end up answering simply questions in very complicated ways. I&#39;d probably become overly focused on appropriate social cues; where do my hands go? am I blinking too much? have I lost connection with my facial expressions?  That kind of stuff.\u000aAnother words, might be work. \u000a\u000a\u000aLiberty is not &#39;Energy&#39; weed... so if you&#39;re tired, you&#39;ll be really stoned, and still tired. Some bud, like Sour D, will wake you up no matter what. Not with Liberty. It&#39;s not my &#39;lets stay up late weed&#39;... actually, sleep sounds &#39;cozy&#39;... So, a very relaxing vibe on this weed. A buzzy calm. Not an over-stimulus. I wonder if others preferred movies to the computer while high... I found movies preferable as background, while doing a favorite activity in the foreground... writing.  \u000a\u000a\u000aI get soft Lemon Pledge scents, with a little waxy pine, soft fumes, as of a magic marker that scented. It smells good. Flowery, heavy rose. not as sharp. Muted reds and oranges. \u000aAnd oh so &#39;frosty&#39;. It&#39;s like THC had a cold and sneezed on this plant. So at 26% thc... yeah, strong. \u000a\u000a\u000aI&#39;ll have to hit this again in the morning when I&#39;m fresh and rested... I need to see how it affects my experience and mindset. Will it be consistent... or very different?\u000a\u000a\u000aEnjoy.\u000a\u000aOccamsPhazer

Perfect for a zip of energy or taking the edge off a stressful day. I personally didn&#39;t experience much pain relief, but I did enjoy the heady high that eased me into my evening. I&#39;d definitely recommend this for a night out to the movies or a night home with friends. Cheers!

I really regret only buying a gram when I saw it in the shop since by the time I went back to buy more it was sold out.  I can guarantee I won&#39;t make that mistake again if I see Liberty Haze on the shelf.  If you see it, buy more than you think you&#39;ll need because you&#39;ll be crying when you go back and it&#39;s not there!!

VI am a fan of indicas but like to try different hybrids and the occasional sativa. Liberty Haze leans strongly to the sativa side. It made me impatient and on edge, not things I enjoy after smoking. It was decent for my arthritis but not worth it. For the indica leaning smokers I&#39;d recommend Buddha Tahoe instead.

VBuds that have a lot of smaller calyxes and small red pistols covered this but there is purple leaves and dark green covering this entire bud. It smells pungent first but if you break one open you can actually smell mango in this strain I&#39;m never really had a tropical smelling typing of bud. It&#39;s been a extremely long time since I had liberty Haze. But it is still one of the first times that got me medicated and stoned. So this new time that I&#39;m trying to liberty hands I will say that it&#39;s complete in giving you that nostalgic golden memory feeling. Helps with nausea depression ADHD fatigue and of course focus with cluster migraines.

Took 2 days off and just smoked a bowl of Liberty Haze at 27%. Not only am I 85% pain free but I am High as hell. Very strong and oh so good. Be careful if you get anxious. Initially it was very intense I mean I was sweating LOL but I wasn&#39;t nervous. It lasted about 5 min. Now about 35 min in very good head high and very focused with some body buzz.

VCannabis cup winner, so you know this shit is on another level. Wonderful buds that provide a glowing sort of ambience around you. Great for conversational stoners (like myself) without getting that monged out &#39;stoned&#39; feel, one to smoke when you&#39;re out with friends.

Pain free, very soothing. \u000a\u000aHeyyyoooo, even a little throbbing in the groin, and arousal--Save the day and get the girl, hell yes!!\u000a\u000aDon&#39;t forget the victory party! Seriously, I&#39;m ready for fun, and some really sensual experiences ;-)\u000a\u000aOh, and by the way, it&#39;s not paranoia that some of you are feeling a hint of. No my friends, that&#39;s you looking for any excuse to save the day. Ha!\u000a\u000aNo negative side effects here!\u000aLasted about 3-4 hours.\u000a\u000aWon&#39;t be forgetting this one anytime soon. Yeah, I need to experiment with this one a lot more :-D

V4.65 / 5 Great bloody strain. Ordered 7g of this having heard it&#39;s success in 2011 high times competition. anyways it lives up to all the hype. great cerebal high that comes on softly but with great final intensity.  One time i fell asleep after falling asleep to this fucking awesome soundtrack of Bladerunner. you will trip balls. highly reccomend. (my fav is the indian musical instrument used in this sci fi part of the track... very trippy time travel shit. closed my eyes and reflected hard. from 6mins on I think that part is). \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6qUTSZ5Zmk\u000a\u000aanyways apart from melting to this music and having a complete tour of my soul and the universe bahahaha, I&#39;ve also had it on a beautiful sunny day listening to the water fountain in the big lake and the birds chirping. very good for tranquil settings too. now gonna have a game or perhaps watch some old 007 movies. peace out. Is it the dopest dope i ever smoked? well its definitely top 3 worthy. I think it&#39;s in between Jack Herer and White Super Skunk in terms of the head high effects you get (one being skunk the other being a satvia haze) which makes it highly enjoyable and diverse in its application.  Also edit: Yukon Blonde - Choices another great (but uplifting) song. Remember to take every review with pinch of salt! #StayTuned #CGMurray

That being said, I would not recommend it near bed time. It gives me energy, but can also make me overthink situations and get a wee bit anxious/paranoid if I use this strain in the evening.

VLiberty allows my mind to think freely truly liberating my mind to command me to relax and taking my ADHD away, I love how care-free this strain leaves me. I feel like taking care of a lot of things in a goofy attitude. I would say it makes me party as well, great mood uplifter and great for working with your body like yoga. It tastes smooth but with pungent tones. Very nice buds look like late 80&#39;s afghan lineage no big bushy leaves mostly looking like baby corn nice rounded top and bottom but still cylinder shape like. Leaves you feeling happy and uplifted. Great for pain and not a lot to do except great for being on your feet while cooking takes care of the pain nicely, would love to do this everyday!
