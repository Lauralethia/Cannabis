VLooks: Chunky lime green buds with small orange hairs, covered in a light layer of trichomes with small glandular heads.  Smell:  Very tropical/ apple fruity/ limey like Jack Herer.  Taste:  Very much like the smell.  Like fresh green apples and lime, with a little pine on the finish.  Effects:  Very mellow, and cerebral without couchlock effects.  Great day time strain.

Vlove this strain,  might be my top sativa so far.  im a big fan of Jack Herer, and I feel Apple Jack hits your body just a little more, while giving me an enormous boost of positive vibes. my go to for a good wake n bake, clear headed, and even helps with my nausea (which I sometimes suffer from). great aroma and flavor to match, a must try, if you get a good batch.

VSurprisingly potent, felt kind of like a cup of coffee-- a little buzzy, almost verging on anxious at some points but never quite tipping there. Though, it made me feel laser focused on things at times, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it.

VI liked it the first time I smoked it. I felt happy, giggly, &amp; relaxed. The second time I felt super anxious and paranoid. I tossed and turned for 10 hours and was high for almost 12. It&#39;s different with everyone, but I wouldn&#39;t buy it again. I&#39;ll stick to indica instead.

Vthis is a truly amazing smoke the first time I got this strain I smoked a little skimpy bowl just so i can wait for my uber to come so i only got about 3 hits off of it and I was really stoned for a good hour or so off of 3 hits! I smoke a bunch or herbs all the time but this strain really stands out to me it smells like a jack cross strain i guess thats where the white widow comes out in it but anyways this stuff gets you a really good potent smoke that a lot of strains out here don&#39;t really have now a days the taste is smooth and piney this is a beautiful strain and if you ever come across it definitely make the donation at your dispensary

VWow. For starters, the scent is about as close to fresh cut apples as any cannabis has any business to be. The flavor is an earthy sweet apple flavor. And stays that way for a while using the vape. \u000a\u000aVery happy (and delicious) strain. Relaxing.

VI have found this strain to be great for daytime use, giving crisp mental elevation, and  what I describe as \u201ccleaning up the body feel\u201d without slowing my physical performance down. The effects seem to be long lasting and strong, and its taste is just as powerful with the Jack really coming through having an infused hint of green apple. It is fresh and tasty indeed. Keep your eye out for this one and get some when she comes.

VWhen nothing else seemed to do the trick, this strain got rid of the mild cognitive impairment and severe anxiety I faced during the week. It felt like being trapped in hell.\u000a\u000aThanks to Apple Jack, for freeing me from the cage. This will absolutely be my new medication of choice. \u000a\u000aIt made me really feel a sativa for the first time ever. Amazing worlds generate themselves. Portals tear open into time. You just become so diplomatic and kind and you&#39;re in old nostalgic memories. Physically living in those moments so vividly for a moment. \u000a\u000aAmazing. Mighty stuff.
