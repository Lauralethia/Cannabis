VOne memorable strain. made me unsociable but it gave me a great relaxed feeling where I sat in deep thought. Unique taste and very dense. Will buy again but it&#39;s not the best stuff I&#39;ve tried.

Vnot too intense..7 out of 10 mid range high. but killed my painful cramping in my legs and gave me a wry smile. it wont make you talk to yourself, but you may enjoy a quick chat. and a stale fruit loops smell with herbal notes.

Vsexy smell of berries and pine, with a little funk(cheese maybe), tiny hints of citrus or diesel? Top 5 scent wise, tasty.\u000aStoned without being too Spacey, definitely pain relief, all muscles and joints feel mellow. energy is laid back and controllable speed wise, just maybe lacking a steering wheel.

VGave me a lot of unfocused energy. This would be a great strain if you ever find yourself stuck in a swarm of flies armed only with a tongue depressor or on a game show where you had to slap a bunch of panels at once (Vanna White might be more fun on this). Probably won&#39;t smoke this again.

VRecommended by my local budtender, I imbibed via cartridge/vape. I felt social, talkative, lowered inhibitions. It hits me a lot like alcohol but without the depressant effect; higher energy. Interesting note: noticeably made food taste better.

VUsing it as I type. So far so good. I have not had the flower. I&#39;m using the vape cartridge with my Vuber pen. Taste is pleasant. Different, not earthy, pine or bitter in any way. Kinda sweet, but not fruity. Hits right away for sure.

VInteresting flavor profile, potent,  fun. \u000aThe taste is reminiscent of Cheetos and I gotta say,  pretty darn good! Loaded one bowl for a wake and bake, with three big tokes and BLAMMO! My tolerance is pretty high so it&#39;s nice to find bud that packs a wallop. The feeling is a pleasant, buzzy,happy, spacey, hopeful and contemplative. I&#39;m always ready for a nap due to fatigue so you can&#39;t trust my couchlock effect sensor on any kind of flower lol\u000aThis strain would be epic mixed with some noble farms cherry pie!

VBettie Page is the most balanced strain I have ever smoked. The taste was quite good with tones of nut and wood and a somewhat sweet finished on the exhale. The high started with an Indica driven relaxation that nearly put me in the couch. Within 10 minutes the couch lock did not take hold and gave way to a mild muscle retaliation. As the stronger indica effects faded, Bettie&#39;s sativa side kicked in big time. My mind began to wonder and tap into a deep ocean of creativity. However, it was not too strong and did not cause my thoughts to wonder and I found it was easy to get out of my head with intention. Great strain, with nice, but mild, long lasting effects that concludes with an easy let down.

VIt feels a lot like Purple Train Wreck- mental zing and spacy- but with a lot more energy and a lot less fun. This is one of those pointless strains that breeders create \u201cjust because\u201d and then slap a sexy name on them for marketing. Tinnitus sufferers should avoid this strain. I thought Bettie Page was supposed to be arousing and be great for inflammation? Not in my case. Didn\u2019t do anything for my Meniere\u2019s disease or Chrohn\u2019s disease. As you can see from the Leafly profile, it is an anxious strain, but it is a low-level thing in the background. To be fair to Bettie P. she does spark some creativity and she won\u2019t make you sad. As another reviewer said, the strain seems to enhance your sense of taste; good food is even better and bad food tastes worse. Ironically I made brownies with Bettie P. and she tastes just awful with chocolate. Had to use mint extract to get them down.
