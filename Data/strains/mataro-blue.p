Vi love this strain and it always seem to be AAAA everytime. and really help witm my sleeping disorders. one of the best sleeping pills ive tried, seeing as how ia m trying to ween myself  of a 10 year long benzodiazapenes perscribtion/  sevre addiction and dependency to them. i havent tried the og of this strain yet i could have yesterday,but i took Animal cookies instead . whivh i found would be another in fixing no sleep and racing hampsters. just like this blue strain and 90% of all the blues ive have. very good medicine all round...

VBlue mataro is a terpenes explosion. Super sweet, lowkey vanilla &amp; blueberry taste. The terpenes almost create somewhat of a cooling/numbing effect, especially through vaporization. Awesome genetic crossover, the flavour profile is excentric.

VOne of my absolute favorites. I suffer from bad depression and anxiety after a head injury and this strain relaxes me which is the indica effect and at the same time is an instant antidepressant for me. I can feel down and smoke Mataro Blue and feel happy again in an instant. Also is light and easy to vape on my Vilcano. I make a beeline for this brand when I see it! A good daytime happy pill !!!

VI&#39;m a new smoker as im from the UK.  Living here in Canada and not smoking is like going to Italy and never tasting Lasagne or pizza. I don&#39;t get high everyday...until now. \u000a\u000aThis strain suits me so well. I&#39;m working more efficiently as  it&#39;s silencing all my negativity and self doubt; I&#39;m currently flying through my workload as a result. I generally feel happier,it&#39;s not a strong head high no matter how often I smoke it during the work day. It relaxes my shoulders and arms (pains of being an animator sitting at a desk 10+hrs a day) I havnt noticed myself grinding my teeth as much either so stress releif is one of the best results of smoking this strain for me.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve smoked more potent strains like train wreck and God OG  and never felt like I wanted to go out in public high with those strains. But this one I can safely say is director and supervisor safe; no trailing off mid sentence and laughing my ass off.

VTbh this is probably more of a 4star strain, but I have to give it a 3 simply because it is hugly overrated. Often labeled backwards as \u201cBlue Mataro\u201d in dispensaries, this strain is often hyped for being super rare (yet I\u2019ve been seeing it everywhere for years) and really potent. Although the flower looks textbook, there\u2019s nothing special about it or the high.

VHas a nice blueberry scent. Smokes nicely, leaving you relaxed, and tingly in parts of your body. Great afternoon or nightime medicine. Would estimate my cut to be about 19-21% THC
