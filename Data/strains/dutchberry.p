VFirst thing that hit me when I opened the bag was the smell. OMG! Amazing! Budtender at Kushmart suggested this one to me and it is a hit. It smells as amazing as it tastes. Keeps the smell and taste after the grind and right through the vape. \u000a\u000aHigh is a creeper, but not quite as bad as straight Dutch Treat. It&#39;s a light high with a hint of euphoria. There is a lot of head high with some body high. For me, DT has always done my bidding, as in if I want to hang on the couch and stare at the TV, no problem. If I want to clean the bathroom on my hands and knees, go for it. This feels the same way. If I get up, I&#39;m motivated to stay working on whatever I get working on. If I sit down I feel super relaxed and chill.\u000a\u000aGreat strain and my brain pain is somewhere, but I don&#39;t know where right now so that&#39;s a nice benefit as well.

VI normally aim for high cbd strains, but this one is wonderful. It takes you to a happy, good place. It can make you a bit chatty and tastes quite good as far as smoking it, so it can be good to use with friends. I know it was awarded dope cup&#39;s people&#39;s choice and I can see why. Only setback is it does give you slight dry mouth and low eyes. I feel it&#39;s absolutely perfect for getting stuff done around the house-it keeps you happily in the zone. Pair some good music with it and you won&#39;t regret buying this strain.

VSpace-berries? These are them. Tasty as a J, and silly weed with bright colors. Not mutch of an appetite, but I could lick a few lids of mustard, or multi-decaduish tamari.

VI have an overall pleasant time with this strain, though I think its a touch too heavy for me. Some moments of anxiety during my high, I think it wants me to access my vulnerablities and is gentle when I access them\u2014which is good work, but not always what I\u2019m looking for in a high. Its relaxing after effects linger long and heavy making me feel very drowsy so I prefer smoking it before bedtime or when I\u2019m not hoping to feel productive later. Good for evening journaling and introspective work or full body rest and relaxation.

VTop-notch bud for getting things done. I was delightfully stoned, yet had loads of energy and focus to do work. As an anxiety sufferer, I highly recommend this strain for anxiety relief. Although the effects are more sativa-like in terms of being &quot;up&quot;, it relaxed my mind...it gives a happy high.  Great for pain relief as well. Not great for sleeping, though. Definitely a strain for earlier in the day. Highly recommend this clean-feeling, delicious berry tasting bud.

VThis is definitely in my top 5 strains. Dutchberry has the most unique smell of any weed I\u2019ve ever smelled. It doesn\u2019t even smell like traditional weed to me. It\u2019s very sweet smelling but it doesn\u2019t have the normal skunky smell that weed has. I normally hate sativas but this one doesn\u2019t make you anxious. The effects make me happy and relaxed without thinking too much and becoming couchlocked. I will always come back to this one.

I am a heavy user and have a high tolerance ESPECIALLY to flower and MAAAAAAN let me tell you that you WILL NOT find a better grower than Artizen in this entire state (in my personal opinion of course). Medical grade potency and flavor. All Artizen strains are absolutely top shelf. If you happen to come across this dutchberry DO NOT pass it up. Perfect for stress, depression, anxiety, and waking up for the day. A very nice stoney feeling but that&#39;s not to overwhelming so you can still have a clear head and start your day off right.

VI picked up an eighth of this, by Artizen, harvested 11/1/16, purchased and consumed on 12/9/16. It&#39;s the worst strain I&#39;ve ever consumed. The buds were very small (the largest in the package being almost big enough to cover half of a nickel), dry, \u000aand not at all resinous.\u000a\u000aIt has a pleasant berry aroma, until you grind it. Then it loses all of its sweet, berry smell, to be replaced entirely by a distinct skunky odor. The flavor is also distinctly skunky, a little piney, and - you know what? The flavor is just awful. And, when I ground this bud, one pass through my grinder made it almost as fine as the screen over my kief catcher - which is a lot more finely ground then I&#39;m used to. But - it is the perfect grind for an MLFB.\u000a\u000aSo, I tried it in mine, and it sucked. It tastes bad, it smells bad, and it doesn&#39;t get me high. In fact, about all it did was make me quite nauseous.\u000a\u000aNow, I&#39;ve also smoked cannabis from Artizen before. I picked up a quite nice gram of Dutch Hawaiian by them from Emerald Haze a week previous, and it was marvelous. I&#39;m hoping that this is just a bad experience from this package, or that possibly this dispensary buys it at such a low price that Artizen are unable to give them good product, but I definitely won&#39;t buy anymore of it.

VI really like how the strain is easy to smoke. It smells great, and looks pretty. When the high comes, it feels great, but too much smoked leads me to a bad trip. A long bad trip. I&#39;m too scared to smoke it again, the thc is too high on this one. Three good hits, and I&#39;m out. I originally rated this two stars, but I realized I just needed one. My girlfriend loves this strain though, so I say you should get it, if you&#39;re interested. I&#39;m going to give it one more shot later. My friend likes this strain as well.

VThis strain is a really good relaxing euphoric and uplifted high. It isn&#39;t a very intense strain and is very calming. It smells slightly skunky with some sweet berry. The taste was not amazing it tasted kinda earthy but with a hint of berry to it and the smoke was quite smooth and didn&#39;t leave you coughing your brains out. It looks really nice with pretty compact buds that are covered in trichomes. Artizen did a good job with this strain and how they grow it and properly flush it. This is a great strain for beginners as its not to potent  and is a good all around high.

It just makes everything more intense, and I love it. But it also is just good for having a little at a party or event. I have a tendency to get too in my head or paranoid with other strains, but this one allows me to feel chatty, energized and giddy without me getting too wound up about how high I am acting. I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, I have overdone it, but that&#39;s basically all mj for me. For the most part this has been my go-to for almost any time, from private times to public parties.

VSmells of gooey mixed berries. Small loose pine green nugs (no stickiness) with numerous orange hairs with decent amount of white trich. The taste is just like how it smells. I really enjoy Dutch treat and fruity tasting herb like blueberry. Aside from that, I don&#39;t like the high of dutchberry at all as the combination of strains seems to counter each other. I felt uplifted and energetic from the Dutch side but heavy from the blueberry. I couldn&#39;t stay focused. I felt like doing something but I was to couch locked, that feeling sucks. Bad, just a bad idea for a wake and bake. This strain really isn&#39;t for me.

VThis is a great strain if you want to focus and have great conversation. I am clear headed and feel confident and happy yet my body is very relaxed.\u000aI had a pain in my leg that it seems to be working quite nicely on and the pain is not bothering me at this moment. If I focus on it, I can&#39;t even feel any pain. So yaaaay! lol.\u000a\u000aI am not sleepy at all, my eyes feel wide open and I could go for a walk or a hike or just a stroll on the beach. It is motivating.\u000a\u000aBut on the same hand I feel like I can just melt into it and chat with my hubby all day long. This might be a good strain to go to the  movie on as well. I think I could really get into a movie and sit and talk about it afterwards for a while. I&#39;ll do that today and let you know how it goes. \u000a\u000aAll in all a great strain.

VIt\u2019s an obvious choice...\u000aAlmost too easy to select when you discover the lineage: DJ short blueberry and Dutch treat.  I mean what the hell? How do I resist that?\u000aI\u2019m usually an indica kind of guy, but Dutch berry hits my sativa craving without giving me the sativa anxiety thing.  Happy, cerebral, fun daytime smoke.  I slept like a rock with it, but for sleep there are much better strains in my opinion.

V10/10!!! Smoked this for the first time tonight and I\u2019ve never had such a chill clear headed high. Really worth the hype if you can get yours hands on it. Pungent aroma but when smoked it had a slightly sweet flavor. Nothing too stinky, really clean hits.

VThis is definitely in my top 5 strains. Dutchberry has the most unique smell of any weed I\u2019ve ever smelled. It doesn\u2019t even smell like traditional weed to me. It\u2019s very sweet smelling but it doesn\u2019t have the normal skunky smell that weed has. I normally hate sativas but this one doesn\u2019t make you anxious. The effects make me happy and relaxed without thinking too much and becoming couchlocked. I will always come back to this one.

VTop-notch bud for getting things done. I was delightfully stoned, yet had loads of energy and focus to do work. As an anxiety sufferer, I highly recommend this strain for anxiety relief. Although the effects are more sativa-like in terms of being &quot;up&quot;, it relaxed my mind...it gives a happy high.  Great for pain relief as well. Not great for sleeping, though. Definitely a strain for earlier in the day. Highly recommend this clean-feeling, delicious berry tasting bud.

VGot got this from my favorite place, Clear Choice in Tacoma WA. Artizen is a real solid brand, never disappointing, always dank. I&#39;m always more interested in the quality of the high over what it tastes like, but wow, this is really good tasting stuff, tastes like you&#39;re smoking a cherry pie. And the ground up herb smells like a basket full of freshly picked berries. Very nice uplifting high, not overwhelming, I could smoke this late in the evening and still go to sleep, but then all weed makes me sleepy. This would be a great strain to induce someone to the world of cannabis.

VI&#39;m am a current resident of Washington State (originally from Texas) and I am a constant consumer of Artizen cannabis. I am a heavy user and have a high tolerance ESPECIALLY to flower and MAAAAAAN let me tell you that you WILL NOT find a better grower than Artizen in this entire state (in my personal opinion of course). Medical grade potency and flavor. All Artizen strains are absolutely top shelf. If you happen to come across this dutchberry DO NOT pass it up. Perfect for stress, depression, anxiety, and waking up for the day. A very nice stoney feeling but that&#39;s not to overwhelming so you can still have a clear head and start your day off right. Guys just do yourself a flavor lol and go buy some Artizen (if you live in Washington State) right now.
