Vsurprizing amount of kick in this strain, enjoyable for heavier smokers. Much better than the similar but different strain &#39;white castle&#39;. Iced widow is more indica where white castle is more sativa dominant. Often mistakenly thought to be the same strain with two different nicknames. Try this one out !

VReally nice smoke. Smallish buds with pale orange hairs, covered in crystal. This strain has a serious smell to it. It&#39;s a sort of earthy sweetness with a kick of citrus at the end. Really great high. Feel very relaxed and content.  Would recommend.

VI&#39;m new to smoking so I am a &quot;light weight&quot; and get high very easily. This strain is my favorite Indica so far because it made my back pain disappear and I felt completely relaxed without feeling like I&#39;m meeting into the couch lol.

VThis strain make you super duper extreme mega ultra talkative. unlike other indica, it isn&#39;t so heavy but super relaxing so you coud feel that kinda dizzy and very dried mouth due to common effect of weed + talkative(from this strain). super enjoyable in any places but not at office work.

VThese buds are covered with a web of crystally orange hairs. When smoked from a pipe, the piney flavor was buttery smooth. Experienced a giggly, psychedelic high that felt more like a Hybrid than an Indica. Had the sensation of having a giant head. Make sure you bring some SNACKS.

VSold at my dispensary as White Castle. This is some very tasty bud, kinda has a strawberry jam flavor going on with some hints of vanilla. \u000a\u000aThe effects were fairly balanced and not really racy or sedating, just mellow and relaxing. More of an evening smoker if your not planning on going to bed right away, great for watching TV of a movie or just hanging with friends.

VTaste 2.5/2.5\u000aPhenomenal taste. I didn\u2019t get any strawberry, but definitely fruity and tropical. \u000aLooks 2.0/2.5\u000aFull of orange hair trichomes. The heart of the flower is white and frosty. \u000aSmell 2.0/2.5\u000aSuper fruity and pungent. Doesn\u2019t smell like the typical strain. More similar to a concentrate smell. \u000aEffects 2.0/2..5\u000aInstant body and stress relief. Small bit of paranoia, but if you\u2019re used to smoking it won\u2019t make you trip. Nice strain to smoke in the evening before doing chores. Can get what you need done and then relax &#128076;&#127996;

VWhite Castle! A strain is so nice I ordered it twice. This indica dominant lady has nice euphoric and sociable qualities. Awesome for a party because its strong but not debilitating. It put everyone in a great mood. Lots of laughter.

VI picked this up as white castle. Very dense and well trimmed. I found it to be an almost citrus aroma with a sweet, earthy taste. It was a medium smoke with a nice relaxing yet uplifting high. I did feel a bit &#39;hazy&#39;, but in a good way. Definitely a hybrid that I&#39;d use for mornings/days.

VThe batch I received was labeled White Castle but I think this name suits it more considering the parents. Crazy to think this strain is essentially the grandchild of 6 different strains as the father Ice strain comes from 4 parents itself, but that\u2019s what it feels like smoking this! You get hit left, right and centre in the brain and body with effects from all sides of this strains heritage coming through. Definitely more of a Hybrid than an Indica! Which is preferred by me and the bud looks absolutely gorgeous! Super orange and spongy with tons of crystal and it actually does smells of strawberries!!

VMore frequently labelled as \u201cWhite Castle\u201d this is actually a pretty balanced hybrid strain, (About 60-40 Indica dominant). Very euphoric strain with a medium body high. Good daytime smoke that simultaneously relaxes you, but also leaves you  fairly energetic and sociable. Not my absolute favourite but a good flower nonetheless.
