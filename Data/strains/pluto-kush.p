VWhoever said this strain is harsh is correct.  That&#39;s my only complaint.  Will get you lit up though. Sitting here blazed as I type this. Stick to other planetary strains such as Neptune Saturn or Mercury OG.  They are not as harsh and the nugs not as dense.  These nugs are a little too dense for my liking.  Peace and happy smoking.

VReally drowsy-sleepy high. Perfect for just hanging out watching movies, or a bedtime smoke. Hit almost instantly after exhale which is nice. Tastes fruity with a kushy brackground.

VAll hail Pluto, the God of Death!! Pluto Kush brings out that Pagan girl dancing in the woods at night with her eyes lined in charcoal. I LOVE this strain and it has become one of those by which I measure all other strains. It kicks pain in the ass, relaxes me enough to manage the intense anxiety that builds up in my whenever my body is at rest AND I am still able to function enough to enjoy my evening. My other half doesn&#39;t love it because it knocks him out cold, but that&#39;s fine- MORE FOR ME!

VThe stuff I had was kinda harsh. Not the worst strain but not the best. I wouldn&#39;t care to rush out and get this any time soon. I will stick to other strains such as Skwalker, Fire, and Kandy.
