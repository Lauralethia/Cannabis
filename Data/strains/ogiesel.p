VComing from a indica lover. I love the smell obviously but the taste with my volcano vap was a GREAT tasting very similar to (Sour) Diesel but the BODY high,indica part,was not super strong in da couch such has GDP or other grape and Indicas but just enough to still be mobile and up like sativas tend to do versus Indicas

VSuper Dank buds. This is an uplifting hybrid a bit similar to sour og but stronger. If you cross the line and puff too much, I find it can lead to mild anxiety that lasts about an hour followed by a semi-couch lock indica type high. Just the right amount however, leaves me feeling happy, social and energetic (in a good way, not a speedy sativa type way). Overall, its a quality medicine.

VHillside Medical. 1/8th for $60. This bud grew on me. It smells just like the name - faint hints of OG, but you can tell it&#39;s not pure OG. Color is slightly slighter and fewer orange hairs than OG Kush. \u000a\u000aThe effect is a creeper, but not BAM like other sativas. Imagine a muted version of Sour Diesel with the body high of a decent OG Kush. That&#39;s would this would be.\u000a\u000aNot the best bud, but it&#39;s very appropriate for clubbin, parties, or taking a walk.

VOGiesel! I picked up an ounce of this to play with. It is a true hybrid. Very piney and earthy. It hits with a body relaxation. My muscles feel like they&#39;re less tense but my mind is awake. I&#39;m more focused, feel creative, and like I could do a light yoga sesh or walk the dog. This strain gives me munchies if I haven&#39;t eaten recently. I feel happy but not super giggly. Good solo strain in my opinion.

VVery strong strain, reminded me of my first time smoking weed. Felt very relaxed but still fairly focussed. I was able to play games pretty easily. Perfect for in the evening after a long day at work or during a nice summer day. Smells very strong even when it&#39;s bagged up. I had it in 2 plastic sealed bags and in a metal tin and could still smell it.

VBeautiful trichomes on this! I agree that it&#39;s a creeper, it usually takes a few minutes before I start to get a euphoric feeling. It makes time seem like it&#39;s going by slower, which is actually nice. A really chill high that I personally think is best for evening use. It is good for doing moderate activities with but after a few hours I&#39;m ready to hit the hay....hard.
