VBest strain I&#39;ve had in awhile. Nothing but good vibes and good thoughts from me when I&#39;m smoking this. Listening to music is a whole &#39;nother level. I was able to focus too. Really wakes you up and gets you going.. Whatever it is you&#39;re doing. The come down is super subtle too, just how I like it. I stopped smoking for some months now but wanted to buy my last batch of weed before my recommendation expires and I&#39;m so glad I was able to get my hands on Hawaiian Fire. Looks like I might have to renew. This brought me back. Yay!

VI loved the spicy flavor. The high just had me absolutely energetic and fuckin roaring, then it calmed down slow and I felt calm and mellow and focused.Definitelt not for those with anxiety. The strain switches from being indica dominant high to mostly sativa, then switches back to indica in time. At first I was not that impressed cuz the high was most certainly a creeper. After two packs of a freshly bought bowl, I was set. It&#39;d be possible for me to get more high, but that would personally be way beyond my comfort zone. I&#39;m loving sitting in my nice comfy chair, watching some TV, a pizza box in my lap, burning the Hawaiian Fire.

VI found this to put me in a very good mood. Flavor is fairly smooth but nothing like the specialty strains like grape/graple etc. Its a slight chemical taste but its not bad at all. It is not super strong but it does a good job with what it has, potency-wise. Effects last a couple hours, perhaps less. It vaporizes fairly well.

VVery nice head buzz. This would be a good one to go outside and take your dog for a walk or exercise or just get out and do something active. EXTREME munchies with this weed-but that&#39;s OK, because this strain makes everything taste amazing.\u000aDefinitely not for someone looking for a strain for body pain or a giggly euphoric high.
