VI am most surprised by the effect! I have a brutal ride of creativity at work. When I have a lot of luck, euphoria and empathy for me. From this grass I have never been devastated. Dry eyes, dry mouth, this is the only downside but it belongs to it. : D I used 2 LEDs 65W with cold white light. Duration of about 3 months and one week. I smoked it through the bong, through the joint, through the Vaporize, anyhow ...: D It&#39;s getting better and better still: D

VI hate hospitals but my dad just had an operation and was stuck there for a while. So I decided to do some one-hitters of this flower before visiting. I just couldn&#39;t stop laughing, smiling and coming up with wild ideas. This strain hits fast and hard. I had my dad laughing to the point that I had to leave the room. His sutures were beginning to hurt. Even the extremely serious doctors were having a hard time not cracking a smile. This shit will make the funniest person on earth. Maybe it wasn&#39;t the best environment for the effects but for once I didn&#39;t mind the hospital. Enjoy nature&#39;s medicine!
