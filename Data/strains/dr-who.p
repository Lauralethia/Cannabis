VI purchased more of this before it sold out. It&#39;s my go to for daytime medicating, especially when mixed with Sweet Island Skunk or another Sativa dominant strain. This combination relaxes neck/shoulder muscles and gives energy to get things done. Easy to socialize on in public and not appear buzzed.

VDr. Who has quickly become one of my top picks. I&#39;m the middle of the road type of gaI when I go out, I don&#39;t like to have a super head high or super couch locked high. Dr. Who is a perfect combination of both! I feel super energized and pumped, but not anxious or paranoid.  I feel super relaxed and at ease, but not zoned out. Great middle ground or good way to start the day off.

VThis is the perfect &quot;weed&quot; weed. For me it is the best combo of indica and sativa. If I just want to chill and relax I can, or I can get up and go walk a few miles. Great for any time of day! I have crohns disease and it fully takes away my stomach pain allowing me to relax and calm down. I have an appetite and am able to eat after having smoked this.

VNice Hybrid, mellow and not one to cause anxiety. Will bring you full-body relaxation, pain relief, laziness, and concentrated on whatever you&#39;re doing.. so long as that thing you&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t require you to get up. I am very prone to anxiety and have never felt a hint of it from this strain (by vaping shatter). This strain is much more so in the body, it is not too heady in the least and doesn&#39;t bring on the racing thoughts whatsoever like some sativas tend to do, the sativa portion of this Hybrid is one that brings you to feel as if you&#39;re being caressed and held by god himself in his arms. Not quite in the euphoric sense, but in the sense of feeling safe and relaxed.

VPerfect daytime med for my body! Made me hungry for the 1st time today (chronic pancreatitis w/out drinking alcohol &amp; eating healthy!!!), I almost always have high anxiety (HB avg is 120, no idea why), panic attacks, fibro, adult ADD, spinal degeneration &amp; arthritis from C2-C7 &amp; L4-L5, had bad effects from a TBI in 2011...you get it. Lotsa pain &amp; anxiety from it.\u000aAll changed when I found MMJ! Went from 8 ER visits a year dow to 1 every 3 years (that was appendicitis).  Unfortunately most sativas don&#39;t do anything for me. Daytime medicating has been difficult. But, I have a life again, especially due to indicas! But hard to get motivated after. This is that fix!! Also really loved Future, BTW. Great mix.\u000a\u000aSlowed down time for my ADD brain just like Aderall!! Didn&#39;t make my heart race. Can mix with others to help stay awake without the pain. Or to sleep.  Even laundry is fun!! \u000a\u000aShout out to Green Pharms in Mesa for a killer shatter!  Love when places sell halfgrams of concentrate so I can try new meds.  I come across a keeper like this!!!

VMy absolutely favourite strain for psychological relief. At a 60-40 Sativa dominant, this strain is a little bit energizing, so be wary about taking it close to bedtime if you have trouble getting to sleep. (I usually mix Dr. Who with Canna-Tsu in the evenings so I&#39;m not too wired.)\u000a\u000aThis strain really works wonders for my depression and I always make sure to try and have some on hand in case I fall into a funk. It might not always fix my problems, but it certainly makes me feel a lot better about them! It&#39;s great for people who are sad, down, or otherwise grappling with depression symptoms, but doesn&#39;t help much for physical aches and pains. It&#39;s a good strain for psychological troubles (especially depression and related conditions), but I wouldn&#39;t advise it for physical (unless you&#39;re pairing it with something like Canna-Tsu, which I definitely recommend for chronic pain sufferers!)\u000a\u000aThe vapor smoke is fairly mild, and it&#39;s kind on this asthmatic&#39;s lungs, so I&#39;d encourage anyone with breathing troubles to try this strain if they have a vaporizer (since I don&#39;t truly smoke it, I can&#39;t make a recommendation for non-vaporizing.)\u000a\u000aDo be warned: There is a reason they call this Dr. Who! I generally feel remarkably &quot;Timey-Wimey&quot; within three to eight minutes of vaporizing. You might feel a little dizzy, or otherwise &#39;loose&#39; and time dilation is a definite possibility, especially if you&#39;re more sensitive to highs.

VThis was a recommended strain from a bud tender at Health for Life East Mesa.  It does not miss the spot.  I have sat down to write this review many times with some Dr. Who and ended up smoking too much and end up being productive around the house instead.  This is a pain killer for sure, the 24x7 burning in my legs turns off for a few minutes.  Great for helping off to sleep, but not a harsh high.  I took a good rip of this before starting the review and the effects are starting.  Problems that fly around the head all day slow down to be figured out, which tends to lead to a removed roadblock to some project that i can then finish off.  But after a gram of flower (for me) it kills all the pains, allows me to focus more, be more creative, but it does have a negative side effect.  My &quot;know it all&quot; traits increase.

VI vaped some Dr. Who and ended up on a Facebook group for fans of geeky things, ranting about how I was becoming a Time Lord.\u000a\u000aAside from this strain being wonderfully geeky (you have to love the result of mixing Timewreck with Mad Scientist), it also provided me with a very fun and upbeat high. I was mischievous, funny, and still perfectly able to get out and do stuff. It&#39;s definitely going to be a permanent addition to our weed lockbox.

VI&#39;m officially rewriting my DR. WHO review!  Yes as previously stated the DR.  Is in the house!  What I didn&#39;t know when I wrote my first review is just how head trippy this stuff is. NO joke the second I finished my previous review it was like awhole new level kicked it. I slowly began to notice how high I actually was.... It&#39;s really hard to describe.  And I&#39;m tripping out right now cuz my tolerance has been so high lately I was beginning to think I would Have no choice but to take a tolerance break or something... But now I&#39;m like OMG I am super high!  A very heady high for me very weird feeling but a good feeling... All good feelings &#128513;.  But ya I had to amend my previous review cuz like I said I didn&#39;t fully understand exactly how crazy this stuff is it&#39;s effecting me like nothing Ive tried lately and ive been trying everything lstely.. Shatter, wax, BHO, Co2,crumble, rosin... I just got 4diff strains in 4 diff concentrates. And this Dr.  Who wax from black label buds 83% THC is the best out of the GG#4,sherbet, vanilla cookies-jvranch, sour purpD this DR. WHO is straight up amazing brain stimulating time slowing stuff. 4real. It crept up on me. Im loving it. I&#39;m about to do a widow maker dab of the other  4 strains I have plus the DR.  So 5 strains total!!! _ I may need some assistance afterward. .. Luckily the DR. Will be here to help me &#128521; my new rating is 10+++ I really love  what this stuff has done to my brain/head... My GD dome piece... &#128516; I love it!!! &#128535; Dr. Who I love yooooouuuu!!!!

And I&#39;m tripping out right now cuz my tolerance has been so high lately I was beginning to think I would Have no choice but to take a tolerance break or something... But now I&#39;m like OMG I am super high!  A very heady high for me very weird feeling but a good feeling... All good feelings &#128513;.  But ya I had to amend my previous review cuz like I said I didn&#39;t fully understand exactly how crazy this stuff is it&#39;s effecting me like nothing Ive tried lately and ive been trying everything lstely.. Shatter, wax, BHO, Co2,crumble, rosin... I just got 4diff strains in 4 diff concentrates. And this Dr.  Who wax from black label buds 83% THC is the best out of the GG#4,sherbet, vanilla cookies-jvranch, sour purpD this DR. WHO is straight up amazing brain stimulating time slowing stuff. 4real. It crept up on me. Im loving it. I&#39;m about to do a widow maker dab of the other  4 strains I have plus the DR.  So 5 strains total!!! _ I may need some assistance afterward. .. Luckily the DR. Will be here to help me &#128521; my new rating is 10+++ I really love  what this stuff has done to my brain/head... My GD dome piece... &#128516; I love it!!! &#128535; Dr. Who I love yooooouuuu!!!!

I have a broken neck and took 60mg of pain meds daily but I&#39;m off them thanks to MMJ.  This gave me pain relief within 15 minutes and a mind/body experience within 30.  lasted about 2 hours which was just enough to enjoy and fall asleep on.  my top 2-3 for sure!!!\u000a\u000aplz keep in stock Bloom in Arizona!!!

I\u2019m already kind of tired but my eyes are closing more and I\u2019m chillin now. But not overly Stoney or couch lock. I\u2019m relaxed too.

VOh my gawd! I thought I was losing my marbles. I had to ride public transportation to get home from class at my college downtown. But first I smoked about a 1/4 of a joint of Dr. Who. There should be warning labels on this stuff, ha ha. It was a ton more fun tripping like I was on the bus though. And the label did note 26.5% thc. So I was careful to have the next few hours free. It all worked out and made my usual 30 min trip home into a psychedelic exploration through space and time. on the down side, It also made me painfully thirsty and paranoid at times

VI first found this after a first time visit to a dispensary that was kinda out of my way. I chose it solely on the name. It did not disappoint whatsoever. Effects are fully felt within less than 10 min and last a good couple hours!! Of course when I went back looking for another cartridge the dispense was out. One of those thing where if you are new to it like me you don&#39;t know. This definitely carries Sativa characteristics but has subtle indica traits. Calmed me down one day at work but my slight paranoia would have me not doing it on the clock again. This is a great starter for anyone seeking a happy and calm daily effect. If taken at night prepare for some muted dreams.

VThis strain is HIGHLY OVERRATED. Like Zkittles. \u000aI have had Dr. Who &amp; Tardis strains neither one pay proper homage to the doctor.\u000aTbh I hate the time wreck strain which is one of the parents. It never gets me high or even medicated. Now I&#39;d LOVE to get my hands on the other parent to try it out on it&#39;s own-mad scientist. \u000aThis is a very functional hybrid, no couch lock not even a stony feeling.\u000a

VDr. Who is a shower AND a grower! Easy to grow. In fact, I had her in too small a container, so I know better for next time. Yield would have been even higher! Even with mistakes I was very pleased with the quality compared to what I have purchased in the shops. \u000a\u000aIt quickly relieves the pain in my brain and makes me feel relaxed without making me want to take a nap. I can take a nap if I want to, however. But I can just as likely tackle a chore I&#39;ve been putting off or binge watch a Hulu Original.

VTasty, fruity, smooth inhale-- leaves you relaxed but not couch locked- can enjoy either day or night but probably more recommended for relaxing and/ or social purposes more so than productive- although with that said not a couch lock strain - can definitely remain relatively active and does not decrease mental capabilities .. Infact I&#39;d say  increases focus and maybe  even helps induce  creativity to some degree

VFantastic strain.  It&#39;s listed on Leafly.com as being 60-40 indica/sativa, but based on the head heavy effects and the lack of sedation, I think they have it backwards.  This strain gave me insomnia and kept me up 4.5 hours past my bedtime;  I will reserve it for day time use in the future.  Euphoric and relaxing high, yet very energetic at the same time.  Good for going out or lounging on the couch.  My new favorite strain!

It definitely calmed me down for a few hours. Two puffs couch locked me into watching an entire season of Rick and Morty as I drifted into a crazy dream filled sleep. It tones down the discomfort and jitters I experience in my legs and makes it possible to go for walks around my neighborhood. I&#39;d recommend this one for sure.

VDr. Who is a great strain for relaxation. It is named appropriately as everyone I know get&#39;s fairly spacy on it. However the relaxation is choice. I would have to say it almost has an unwinding, unfolding effect on your body.  Do not be surprised if you lose time on this one though.

VGet ready to be whipped through the time stream cause this strain gets wacky. I got a decent concentrate of this stuff and every time I burn through some I begin to forget basic things and get carried away on weird tirades, like the Doctor himself. For an indica leaning hybrid there was a surprisingly cerebral kick to it. It also has the benefit of putting me and my pain down. Good relief and excellent relaxation to aid with sleep and anxiety. Good strain all considered, just a little too wonky and cloudy for my taste.

Has a relaxing mental buzz that hits quickly and gives way to happiness, creativity, and wonderful calming effects sending you through space time.

Vwell after trying 20+ strains I think I found my current favorite! dr. who which I picked up by mistake is definitely my go-to every situation strain.  you can hit it in the morning and rock on or at night an chill out. tastes good hits smooth and doesn&#39;t come on too strong. I like how you can do anything with it and have no fear of parenoia. mild head effects with a nice body buzz that&#39;s mellows out over few hours. not a sleep aid,to me more sativa dominant then indica. very clear headed focused type of translucency that I find rare in weed these days,similar to cinex. euphoric in large doses and will definitely relax the shit out of you if you want. great stuff here and I had a damn preroll!!

VI am not an Indica fan at all so my apology for the early judgement. I would sat the smell is out of this world, a sweet and pungent smell of what I think is a mild bubble gum and a heavy aroma of fruit. Very indica dominant and heavy, but also I have a mild focus and productivity high. Overall wouldn&#39;t say its the best but I will say 4.25 for the indica, many other fantastic one&#39;s than this one but on the journey to find them all.

VVery good, I tend to prefer indica normally but lately I&#39;m branching out from my comfort zone which has been mostly blackberry or blueberry pheno&#39;s but lately I switched to dabbing instead of cartridges and I&#39;m finding that I need to branch out and try all the other wonderful strains that I had amazingly never tried even staples like GG#4 and newbies like Bruce banner... Etc. So wen I went to main st mj for some good ol&#39; boring blueberry but when they didn&#39;t have it I found my eyes gravitating to a certain new strain id never heard of before- Dr. Who? So I decided to be bold and try it. I was first amazed at the awesome smell this wax had-fruity and pleasant which I being a lover all fruity tasting strains was in-love with I just kept smelling it over and over slight grape with hints of something nice... Maybe pineapple?  Or mango or pear..?  Something very nice tho. And the high is very different than a 80% indica at least for me... Everyone is different when it comes to expieranceing weed... This DR WHO is defiantly a hybrid with effects not leaning particularly to either side.  A nice balance. The description says 60In/40sat about right. I still prefer a good knock out purple labeled strain any day of the week and twice on Sundays. But if your like me and try to stay away from pure sativas due to anxiety the next best thing is a good balanced hybrid. Especially if u got stuff u gotta get done that day. So ya in short DR. wHO is a very nice balabced hybrid with a pleasant fruity taste and smell that is sure to entice many more smokers in it&#39;s bright and glorious future or should I say bright and glorious - time jumping past-present&amp;future journey across time and space in a mind melting journey to self discovery and enlighteness!..... Just kidding idk what I&#39;m saying ive never seen the show but will have to give it a try now. As a matter of fact.. I&#39;m going to take another monster dab of tha DR. And go watch Dr. Who....... Tha Doctor is in da HIZZnouse!!!!

VI would put this with Blue Dream of I were to put strains together for uses. I deal worth ADHD, and find that both do well for that and stress. 10 years as a medic, I have stress. The high ous more chilled than Blue Dream, so I find it better for days that aren&#39;t as demanding, but still require the stress relief, and allow me to focus.

VEvery now and then you come across a strain that just delivers everything your looking for. Dr. Who is one of those. Very relaxed and euphoric high. This strain seems to make the worries of the world go away. Almost like your in high school again smoking for the first time. Lights seem brighter and there&#39;s a significant sensation in the eyes. They say this is more indica but I don&#39;t feel many indica effects other than my muscles are relaxed like I just received a full body massage. It&#39;s a pretty bright purple and lime green color covered with whiteness and neon orange hairs. The strain I got from here in AZ smelled like straight grape juice when I ground it up, and has a pleasant sweet aroma when smoked that even your neighbors will love.

I\u2019m already kind of tired but my eyes are closing more and I\u2019m chillin now. But not overly Stoney or couch lock. I\u2019m relaxed too. So overall I\u2019d recommend for moon enhanced, help with stress, and pain/relaxation.

VTasty, fruity, smooth inhale-- leaves you relaxed but not couch locked- can enjoy either day or night but probably more recommended for relaxing and/ or social purposes more so than productive- although with that said not a couch lock strain - can definitely remain relatively active and does not decrease mental capabilities ..

VI first found this after a first time visit to a dispensary that was kinda out of my way. I chose it solely on the name. It did not disappoint whatsoever. Effects are fully felt within less than 10 min and last a good couple hours!! Of course when I went back looking for another cartridge the dispense was out. One of those thing where if you are new to it like me you don&#39;t know. This definitely carries Sativa characteristics but has subtle indica traits. Calmed me down one day at work but my slight paranoia would have me not doing it on the clock again. This is a great starter for anyone seeking a happy and calm daily effect. If taken at night prepare for some muted dreams.

VOh my gawd! I thought I was losing my marbles. I had to ride public transportation to get home from class at my college downtown. But first I smoked about a 1/4 of a joint of Dr. Who. There should be warning labels on this stuff, ha ha. It was a ton more fun tripping like I was on the bus though. And the label did note 26.5% thc. So I was careful to have the next few hours free. It all worked out and made my usual 30 min trip home into a psychedelic exploration through space and time. on the down side, It also made me painfully thirsty and paranoid at times

VVery nice strain, but wasn&#39;t enough to alleviate body pain completely. It is a nice for daytime smoking provided you&#39;re staying or having a low activity day. Helps with nausea, as well, but not as well as Cinex.

VDr. Who is an indecisive hybrid, torn between acting like a sativa or an indica.  The Dr. delivers both energy and mild sedation/pain relief, and is a good choice for daytime activity when you need a calming influence that still lets you function at your best.

VMy all-purpose pot. Smoke it all day and get whatever high you need to get from it. I honestly have never come across a more well-rounded strain. \u000a\u000aYou&#39;re relaxed, but not couch-locked. Energetic, but not manic. Giggly, but not idiotic.\u000a\u000aIf you lean more toward indicas like me, but want the kind that makes dancing or bar-hopping throughout the night fun and carefree, this is the strain. And it&#39;s surprisingly arousing. Caught me off guard the first time.\u000a\u000aBut be warned: too much of this won&#39;t knock you out immediately, but excessive amounts after a certain hour will creep up on you and take you out.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve had better cerebral highs, better body highs, and longer-lasting highs from other strains. It&#39;s not &quot;the best&quot; at anything. \u000a\u000aWhat it&#39;s best at is being the ideal hybrid that gets the blood flowing to all the right places and in all the right ways before gently tucking you into bed when you&#39;re ready to call it a night.\u000a\u000aMake an evening of this one. Or a morning. Or an afternoon. It&#39;s the perfect fit either way.

VSmells a little like cocoa, apricot. A hint of skunk. Has a bit of a chemical taste with a hint of basil, suede. Nice, tight buds. Quick cerebral high, followed by some body buzz and pain relief. Was still able to function. Very surprised and pleased by this strain. Nice balance of Indica/sativa. Would definitely recommend for pain, and will definitely buy again.

VI had some of this that I had not yet tried sitting around and I had read the reviews of others here so, I thought that today would be a good day to give this a try.  I was/am not disappointed.  I felt very relaxed.  I did get a little sleepy so the Indica is definitely in the 60% range as stated.  I was mellow and watched Sunday NFL games very intently.  LOL.  I am on the back side of the high and feel extremely good. very chill.

It&#39;s dense and chunky covered in trichomes it&#39;s so crystal covered the whole bud is frosty white, the flavor is the only area where this strain doesn&#39;t jump out at me it&#39;s nice very earthy and pungent but not amazing the smoke was very dense and very smooth and of course the best part the high is awesome very very relaxing but no sleepy feelings at all great hybrid perfect Indica to Sativa percentage this could definitely become a permanent resident in my bud box.

VI LOVE this strain.  I&#39;m a smoker, choker, and midnight toker (when I&#39;m not asleep by 8pm) and sometimes my tolerance is just too high!  Dr. Who is an extremely well-balanced strain that takes the edge right off and will have you laughing at the Horton following you around as you go about your day.  I highly suggest some Dr. Who if you suffer from anxiety or depression or just need a real pick me up.
