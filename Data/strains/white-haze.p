VOne of the best sativas I&#39;ve had the chance to inhale! I had me dancing and laughing hours and hours! Kinda rough when smoked, but excellent taste when vaped. One of the most thc-full bud I&#39;ve had in a while.

VGood but not as good as say Green Cracker Jack.\u000aThen again i do prefer Indicas anyway.\u000aStill a good strain, just not as good as for the $18.00 a gram price tag.

VDelicious fresh pine and lemon taste, like the best of PineSol and Mr. Clean rolled up into one.\u000a\u000aBuzz is light and update. Very sativa-like. Like others have said, it is not overwhelmingly powerful, but I actually kind of like that. A nice, clean daytime-friendly buzz that goes well with pretty much any activity. Personally, I found the burnout to be a bit much, but this seems to be common with me and sativas.

VI absolutely love this strain!!! It&#39;s a nice uplifting buzz. Also very relaxing. I would most definitely use it again and recommend it to others! \u000a\u000a

VI personally am not a fan of this strain. It&#39;s just not enough bang for the buck you put in. At $20 a gram it&#39;s definitely not worth it. It&#39;s a mediocre head buzz for such an expensive Sativa. The high is pretty weak, and the you&#39;re back to earth in a quick hour or two. I don&#39;t recommend it unless you got some cash to spend. It helped my focusing issues of my ADHD, but wore off too quickly. It made me sleepy, which I hate.

VAs a lover of anything haze crossed, I was excited to try this white haze. This bud has a lemon yet piney flavour and gives off a light buzz that relaxed my whole body, melting away my stiffness and muscle spasms.   I loved the body and mind high that comes with this strain, but did find the come down rather difficult 2 hours after smoking it.   Not a morning strain for me, but great for daytime use if you dont have to function.

VThis is a bad-ass strain that is perfect work lighting up on the way to work! Incredibly focused, and clear. I have on many occasions lit up, and helped customers with ease, and focus, and a sense of happiness. Perfect daytime medication, and perfect for depression.

VOne of my favorite sativas too. Tastes super well giving you a great feeling while smoking. On the other hand, it is not as strong as a imagined.
