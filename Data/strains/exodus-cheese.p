VKind of strange smelling, and tastes terrible.  I tasted like I was smoking straight resin. But this stuff made me so lazy, that I didn&#39;t want to do anything. I felt completely energized at the same time though, and wanted to do more than I was.  It lasted a few hours, and comes with some serious couch-lock.  I would suggest smoking this before you go to bed, or if you need an excuse not to do anything.

VExodus Cheese brings a very relaxing body feel and vanishes all the stress so you&#39;re lightly stoned. It&#39;ll make you curl up on your couch and watch TV or a movie.

Vthe strain does have a very strong smell, but with a good taste.  This time for me with an indica feel to it, or I&#39;m just a bit tired today, the high is not what you would expect from a cheese, but still strong in its own way. This is not a daily strain for me, but I&#39;m alway happy to smoke it. \u000a\u000aalways keep in mind that every body reacts different to say that you will experience the same as I did

VFavorite strain for Mother plants in my area of England. The strain is always passed as a cutting and Green House Seeds fake doesn&#39;t seem to be very dominant in my area even though it does pop up. Exodus  can grow very stocky its brilliant for an outside cultivator trying to ninja the Cops but does tend to stink to high heaven nearing the end of flowering. Pungent smell which is more sickly with a heavy damp sweetness that follows. Buds are high in resin helping the trichome&#39;s stick to this toxic green buds. Perfect for oil production, sleep, pain relief and depression. Not good for anxiety or other forms of mental health. This is due to it being contrived from skunk number #1 making it and extremely heavy stoned.

VThis is another Greenhouse Seeds strain I have personally grown and   even though it is far from being a weak strain, It was never a very memorable or valued item for the heavy users within my circle. The increasingly more common &quot;cheese&quot; odored phenotype is a hallmark of the Skunk lineage along with the skunk and cat urine odors that are less desirable due to their off putting aroma. A long time personal friend is always commenting on the &quot;cheese&quot; smell of strains these days, most likely due to the ubiquitous presence of the Skunk family in Cannabis breeding. The yield was very decent and the high was the usual sedating, low energy stone that feels very bland compared to the more intense Skunk and Skunk crosses that are part of this line. The bottomline for me is the Greenhouse version lacks allot of the character I&#39;ve come to expect from the Skunk family and I would recommend others from them instead.\u000a(Greenhouse Seeds/Feminzed/8 weeks-56 days flower time)\u000a

VI have Luton Cheese which is what this is apparently. It definitely matches the smell to \u2018exodus cheese\u2019 so I assume it\u2019s the same strain. I am in the U.K. so proper cheese ere lads.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m easily anxious or paranoid whilst high. So for anyone similar to me this review is for you. \u000a\u000aThe smell from this strain is very pungent (50% ) with an equal mix (25%&amp;25%) of cheese and blueberry? I can\u2019t pin it but I think that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s very very pungent. \u000a\u000aThe high is nice. Definitely leans more to the sativa side. Although there is a noticeable relaxation aspect to it alongside the pretty heavy sativa head high. Pretty easy to concentrate on this too. Mind doesn\u2019t wonder much.\u000a\u000aALTHOUGH. If I\u2019m not doing something to take my mind from wondering I do begin to feel some anxiety. But to stop that all I have to do is watch something or play a game. Even scroll through social media. \u000a\u000aPersonally I don\u2019t mong-out as much on this as long as I stay within my comfort zone. \u000a\u000aThis strain has the potential to be a very very strong heady strain if you smoke enough. But that\u2019s the same with most cheese\u2019s. \u000a\u000a

VThis one provides an interesting experience. As far as smell goes, the &quot;cheese&quot; scent is definitely present as well as a bit of a mint and citrus edge. The flavor of the smoke is not exceedingly pleasant, but bearable. It has a peppery taste with a strange tinge of sweetness, but overall it tastes very similar to smoked resin. Very dark and &quot;ashy&quot; flavor.\u000a\u000aFor me, this one is definitely best suited for night time, when you have done all the things you needed to do. Very heavy feeling of couchlock, relaxation, and sedation. My mind remains very active, creative, and introspective...but physically it is a very heavy relaxation. I&#39;ve smoked/vaped it a few times during the day, and it was just too much to be able to get things done.\u000a\u000aIn summary, it&#39;s a great solo night-burn. Melts my anxieties away, kills physical pain, while also giving me a nice mood-boost. It just doesn&#39;t taste all that great and is not suited for day-time use.

VThis is another Greenhouse Seeds strain I have personally grown and   even though it is far from being a weak strain, It was never a very memorable or valued item for the heavy users within my circle. The increasingly more common &quot;cheese&quot; odored phenotype is a hallmark of the Skunk lineage along with the skunk and cat urine odors that are less desirable due to their off putting aroma. A long time personal friend is always commenting on the &quot;cheese&quot; smell of strains these days, most likely due to the ubiquitous presence of the Skunk family in Cannabis breeding. The yield was very decent and the high was the usual sedating, low energy stone that feels very bland compared to the more intense Skunk and Skunk crosses that are part of this line. The bottomline for me is the Greenhouse version lacks allot of the character I&#39;ve come to expect from the Skunk family and I would recommend others from them instead.\u000a(Greenhouse Seeds/Feminzed/8 weeks-56 days flower time)\u000a

VHad just &quot;Exodus&quot; rather than &quot;Exodus Cheese,&quot; but this is the only strain on Leafly with &quot;Exodus&quot; in the name. (Actually, just noticed this: Leafly, you guys need to tweak the spellchecker here so that the name of your own company doesn&#39;t get that annoying red underline, and I suppose I&#39;m including that in my review as an example of how detail-oriented this stuff makes you!). So anyway, this strain does give you good focus; very clear-headed all around, I&#39;d say. Great for playing music or studying languages!

VLeafly should update their info on this strain as it&#39;s not the original Cheese, but it&#39;s definitely one of the best and if you love Cheese strains like I do, you&#39;ll love this as its one of my favorite Cheese strains, second only to Blue Cheese. The smell is sweet, dark, pungent, and extremely attractive in general, resembling but not quite equaling that of the holy Blue Cheese. Aside from that, this is pretty much Cheese and if you know that strain, you know this one. Pick it up if you can.

VI bought about 2.5 grams from The Hulp coffee shop in Amsterdam that cures it for about 9 months before selling. I vaped 0.5 gr and it slowly hit me. It kind of resembles the Kosher Kush high in the sense that you feel very uplifted. Excellent variety. Probably one of the best I had in A&#39;dam. It may worth invest in some seeds and choose a mother for your perennial garden... I don&#39;t remember the taste texture but it was good. Definitely recommended

VExodus Cheese will always remind me of the UK when I was there quite a while ago now it was all anyone wanted to smoke and it was everywhere. It&#39;s an extremely stinky strain that when you smell it you&#39;ll instantly understand why it&#39;s called cheese. The buds are a dark green with small spots of bright green the hairs are almost a dark tan color and the buds are completely triched out. They are very chunky and when cured well can take on that awesome sticky Styrofoam feel. There&#39;s a couple different phenotypes but it&#39;s usually indica dominant and even when it&#39;s not you  still get a very stoney narcotic like high that starts off uplifting but kinda slowly fades as the more relaxed feelings slowly creep in. I absolutely love the smell and flavor of this strain it&#39;s sweet and earthy cheesy skunky goodness. Growing not for beginners takes about 8 weeks up to maybe 800gr it&#39;s very branchy can grow tall might want to support branches during flowering. Anyway I really love this strain in Washington State Phat Panda has an amazing crop, smell, flavor and, looks are on point.

The cheesiness is def present, more along the lines of camembert (French white &quot;blue&quot; cheese) than edam.\u000a\u000aNo noticefable negative side effects, body seems relaxed but responsive, it&#39;s easy to talk and be affective. More relaxing with close friends rather than a crazy night out. 0514
