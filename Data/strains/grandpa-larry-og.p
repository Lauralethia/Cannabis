VThis strain is amazing. It helps with my severe digestive issues, joint pain and anxiety without being stuck to the couch.  It is relaxing but you can still get things done and if you don&#39;t you don&#39;t really care.  I wish more dispensaries carried this.  I waited over a year to find it and try it and it is not available in my area again.  Don&#39;t hesitated to give this a try you will not be sorry.

VGrandpa Larry is my favorite strain, super nice, does exactly what you&#39;d want an indica to do. Super relaxing but not in a couch lock way. I can be active, exercise, do chores, art or just chill watching tv. Anything you might want to do this strain gets you hyper focused on, including if you wanna sleep you can drop off immediately.

VSo I got this strain by accident thinking that it was the normal Larry OG but advertised as an indica(silly me). However, when I puffed on this strain I felt instant relief and it almost feels like everything just melted away. A nice body high but I\u2019m still attentive.

VI&#39;m really not about Indicas in general and this strain is a good example of why. The body effects are great, no headaches, great relaxation, but just couch-locks me to no end. While potent, this one was just brutally harsh on the smoke and basically put me to sleep. Would not recommend.

VI&#39;ll preface this by saying I don&#39;t normally go for indicas but either way, I strongly disliked this strain. I didn&#39;t get much from it except the strong desire to sleep. It can completely ruin a good time if that&#39;s what your looking, if not, I&#39;d stay away.

VThese medium sized, dank green buds with a few pale brown hairs, are dusted in trichromes that are sticky especially when broken apart. It has the aroma of sweet pine, lemon and menthol, very candy like, but dank. The taste is a pleasant and refreshing citrus flavor. The effects are&#160; strong, but functional. A typical cerebral buzz, with nice upbeat qualities. Provides all day relief without worrying about falling asleep. Great for a day when you have quite a bit to do, but really need the uplift from stress/depression, enabling you to slow down and chill out. \u000a&#160;\u000aGenetics: Granddaddy Blueberry\u2642 x Larry OG\u2640 Strain: Mostly Indica Plant Height: Medium Flowering Time: Indoors: 8-9 weeks Outdoors: Early October Yield: Good\u000a
