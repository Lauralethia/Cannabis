VThe Himalayan blackberry i got  (soulshine cannabis) was grown pretty well. covered in small frosty Crystal&#39;s with almost a purple hue and weighing in at 23.02% THC, CBD(.23%) Not the strongest smelling but had a nice long lasting taste. Definitely an amazing slightly euphoric Indica dominint strain. Definitely one of my favorites and close to five stars.

VPerfect for unwinding before bed. Blissfully relaxing, both mentally and physically, yet I can stay awake and read in bed for awhile before drifting off to sleep if I want. Makes me quite sleepy, but not in a druggy, unpleasant way, just a chill &quot;It&#39;s time to close my eyes and drift off&quot; way. Hasn&#39;t made me anxious or paranoid at all.

VThis has a nice sweet taste and I personally a slight slight earthy aftertaste. But that&#39;s I interpret it, so please don&#39;t sue if you didn&#39;t taste that same aftertaste. \u000a\u000aI taste and smell are good, but I adore the relaxed state I&#39;m in. Makes me wanna go take a mini hibernation.

VI would give this strain 10+ stars if they were there.  I love the high I get when I smoke this lovely little morsel of happiness.  This is the high I&#39;ve been looking for for the past 6 months or so. I can now rest easy and know exactly what I need to buy. I love the kick back feeling I get when smoking it. The box says it all......&quot;Cannabis for a Higher Purpose&quot;......couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.

VVeryyyyy thingy &amp;a soothing. I feel like I&#39;m slowly moving up &amp; down with the ocean waves below me. Tingling in my feet &amp; um, way tingly in the vagine.
