VI didn&#39;t know this was a CBD strain when I got it I just used my first time patient deal buy a gram get a gram concentrate free. I got four different strain skunk Haze was one of them.\u000aI got it in shatter form testing at 29% THC and 64% CBD.\u000aI never usually try CBD strains but it&#39;s helping my nausea incredibly and there&#39;s enough THC to give me a nice Mellow High

VIt had some good clear headed energy from the sativa side but didn&#39;t have that sativa Euphoric head high that people want. Had some pain relief from the front right cerebral cortex overide switch but seriously no heavy handed pleasure whatsoever as the ratio of multiple cannabiniods wasn&#39;t precise enough to stimulate the top middle brain area involved in pleasure/pain sensory input (no body buzz here whatsoever which was disappointing). Definitely need to add ibuprophen if your a pain patient. Not the most relaxing strain or the most Euphoric so really more of a purely medicinal strain for beginners that are still afraid to actually get super high lol I gave it 4 stars because it will do for medical in a pinch if you have enough of it but no where near top shelf euphoric strains like death star or El dorado..

VThis was my first time trying weed so it was a very odd experience! The effects for me were almost entirely physical - very weird time-slowing like my sense of touch was on a slight delay. It didn&#39;t exactly make me feel sleepy but it did lock me into place; I found myself able to stay in place doing one thing for longer than I often am, simply because it was so comfortable just to stay sitting there. No euphoria or sense of calm; just a lot of weird foggy-bodiedness. It&#39;s hard to rate this with stars because I have nothing to compare it to. I didn&#39;t love it but it was certainly interesting!

VIt is dense, spicy and skunky. It has a sort of anise-y kick to it that I love, as far as flavor/scent goes. The strain I bought is a beautiful CBD grow. It&#39;s very functional and mild. This would be fantastic for new smokers because there&#39;s a minimal euphoric high, but it tackles the important stuff (mood, pain, stress, etc) and is fairly long-lasting in that regard. I like how it makes me feel. I&#39;ve been smoking this daily for the past six weeks or so. It helps with day to day functionality. The burn on this plant is just beautiful, with mild smoke.

VThe first thing I felt was the body high. Made me feel relaxed, slow as molasses unable to command my body. Certain areas in my body started pulsating with waves of sensation and numbness. Some of these pulses actually hurt like my muscles are sore. \u000a\u000aMade me have that stomach is sinking after hearing bad news feeling. Made me focus on certain sounds and get startled and creeped out easily by the same sound.\u000a\u000aAn uplifting wave of brightness hit me and I felt uplifted. My body tingled and got warmer. I felt  like I&#39;m on a cloud and in front of a warm fire at the same time!\u000a\u000aIt does dull pain but made my whole body numb. I can&#39;t feel my face half the time. My whole body felt like sinking lead! I was forced to just lay there and feel the sensations around me minus pain. \u000a\u000aThe worst part about this strain is its taste. It taste like moss, smelly socks, and boogers.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a fun and relaxing strain but I just can&#39;t get over the taste and the total body lockdown.

I can always count on this strain to bring me back to life. i struggle with PTSD and anxiety and this strain helps like no other. when your feelin blue, Skunk Haze is the perfect choice.

VMild, slightly stimulating buzz, but worth the bargain price for functional daytime moderate pain relief. What is really outstanding about this strain is the insatiable appetite for food that I had. After too much supper I was looking for desert! Doesn&#39;t help that my wife likes to make nice  dinners on her day off. For patients needing to manage pain or get an appetite for breakfast and still be able to go about their day, this  stuff is good. The buds looked small and premature, not much odor or taste, but vapour was still mild at higher temperatures.

VMy first high-cbd/low thc strain, and honestly, I am really digging it! Incredibly relaxing. So relaxing in fact, that I forget to smoke weed. That&#39;s HUGE. I suffer from high anxiety and stress - It&#39;s a process, dealing with stress and anxiety - cannabis helps SO much, but it&#39;s not a &quot;cure&quot;. There is no cure - you gotta deal! Diet, exercise, I do yoga too - that helps enormously if I practice regularly - mellow, baby yoga, nothing fancy, trust me. With the SKH,   I get &quot;high&quot;, sure, but the striking thing is the deep, non-drowsy relaxation - but not a &#39;couch-lock indica-style relaxation. It doesn&#39;t knock you out, it chills you out. Go, CBD! Can ya say a hallelujah can ya say thank ya! Long days and pleasant nights! \u2764

VMy reviews on the Skunk Haze which was super dense and sticky. A great smoke. I wanted to shout out K.Cee my fine a$$ bud tender hooked it up when i just stopped by on Fri. Picked up a couple house pre-rolls and she threw in a top-shelf pre-roll. Soooo much love at this place and i love the view. Sorry. Just being honest.      Kevin-
