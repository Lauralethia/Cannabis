VLike other reviews...African Strain is a blanket term here.  I am born and raised in South Africa and at 33y/o i have smoked some of my countries best.\u000aSwazi Gold like someone else mentioned was actually used to refer to the Hash we used to get, and there used to be a gold or red stamp burned into the hash brick to indicate red = medium and gold = premium.   Swazi Gold or Swazi Red.\u000aI actually still have original Swazi Seeds from the early 90&#39;s(1990 - 1993), and grew 2 trees outdoor this past season.  One tree gave me about 1300g.  Some of the best crystals you have ever seen on marijuana.  Today, the best Swazi weed is grown near Piggs Peak Casino.  It is the highest point in Swaziland and a match box full of heads cost about R 35/ $ 2.50. \u000a\u000aBut i have smoked, Durban Poison from intensive African farms in KZN (Tongaat, right next to the river).  Not a lot of people know this but Northern Lights Strain is also from KZN/Durban, a vivid upper high.  That was years ago....\u000a\u000aThen there is Malawi Cob which was &quot;Malwai Sativa&quot; and the farmers in Malawi used to grow the whole plant under ground wrapped up in a Mellie/Corn husk and leaves (Google it, its hard to explain if you don&#39;t know what i mean).  The weed is very very compact and very dark, almost black and tastes a lot like dirt....Obviously.\u000a\u000aThen we have Congo Black, which comes from the DRC(Congo), also very dark...actually black and smokes very harsh on the throat, but a very enjoyable long lasting high.\u000aThe Kilimanjaro strain that you know of was refereed to as Tanzanian.  Not from Kenya, but just next door.  Very chilled normal all day smoke. (2100miles from South Africa Boarders)\u000a\u000aThen there is a strain that only a true South African will know and understand and that is Rooibaard.  who remembers Rooibaard?  Anyone who has NEVER heard of this strain, which is almost impossible to find now days, go and google Bottle Brush trees and look what the flowers of THAT tree look like. The buds have the same colour intensity and hairs just as long as those red hairs.  A strain that will make you laugh at literally everything and anything, i cant stress this enough, super relaxed and very very very funny.  No matter how long you have been smoking for.\u000a\u000aAnd one lost note before i sign off... I have my suspicions that Original Skunk #1 was cross breed with Swazi to stabilize the strain.  And still today Skunk is used to harden a plants resistance and stabilize any cross pollinated strain, today.\u000a\u000aWe are in mid winter right now, and i am waiting for our grow season which starts end August begin of September, and then budding starts end March Beginning of April.  And i will be planting some Rooibaard of which i have kept the best seeds for 15 years.  Come back and have a look at my posted pics next year to see.\u000a\u000aHere is Sunny South Africa we hardly ever grow under artificial light, I normally extend my grow season by starting my seeds in a cupboard or tent at the end of July.  So by September they go straight into the ground at about knee height, but knee high at the very beginning of the grow season  - (6 - 7 month Veg Growth) - 8-10 Hr Direct Sun Light daily :)   Lucky Luck me.

VThe most impressive part of a Kenyan strain was the amount of crystals on the flower. It actually looked like a geode in the random crevices of the bud. I concentrated some BHO from it, and the crystals were sparkling in the wax, after the butane evaporated, and it was chilling in my silicon tray.\u000aThe concentrate is awesome, and it has a strong flavor of garlic to me, and a hint of a black pepper taste. It gives me a long, fairly energetic high, but as a concentrate, it&#39;s a little harsh on my lungs, not my throat though. It&#39;s an excellent strain.\u000aThe only reason I know it&#39;s a Kenyan strain (African on Leafly), is because I tested it with a cannabloic fingerprint test kit. It was pretty much an exact match for the fingerprint provided in the manual for a Kenyan strain. Only after reading on Leafly did I learn the &quot;African&quot; strains have the highest levels of THCV, which was confirmed on the fingerprint test I did.

VI&#39;m on a trip in Togo at the moment and this is the only strain I found so far.\u000aAfter a few minutes I started to feel the high slowly kicking in and its a quite nice feeling nit overwhelming.\u000aI would say that it smells and tastes like Africa, a but earthy, its really nice.\u000aI picked up different times and the colour changed a bit but it was always quite brown and dry but not harsh for the throat, its really smooth.\u000aAfter two joints the high is amazing, probably one of the best in my life, everything becomes so happy and beautiful and I&#39;d say its really good for people who feels quite low as it is really euphoric.\u000aI have never seen this strain in Europe yet but who ever finds some I highly recommend them to try it !

VAlthough it is unfair to lump all African strains together under one category, most of them when cured and aged using traditional indigenous methods appear dark greenish brown and are often seeded. Commercial varieties which are also exported are pressed into bricks. Even though Malawi, Swaziland and various other varieties have become known in the West over the years, there are still many other strains all over Africa. I have been using mainly Ghanaian and Congolese varieties which have at least two sub types, one which has dense dark buds and the other which is a lighter and is leafier than the other variety. Both are seeded although the lighter one has less seeds which are mostly pale and non-viable. The darker variety has a spicy, musky, earthy aroma while the lighter one is fruitier. The taste of the dark one is also spicier and its aroma is stronger. The lighter grade had a smooth taste and a fresher, leafier smell. The effects of both are immediate but intensify and last about 1-2 hours. Although these are supposed to be pure Sativas, they do sometimes exhibit Indica like traits and over indulgence can cause drowsiness. Also great for those suffering from a lack of appetite. Perfect for day time use. I prefer landraces and have an interest in preserving traditional curing techniques from various parts of the world. The African varieties which I have smoked are truly some of the best strains I&#39;ve sampled and should not be underestimated based on their appearance - this is not &quot;schwag&quot;

VI&#39;m more of an edible/vapor partaker than a smoking  connoisseur. But I do lk trying the different strains n seeing what lives up 2 the hype. I tried African Skunk which has a strong pine n earthy smell. Take a deep whiff of this 1 u will definitely feel a lil sumpin&#39; sumpin&#39; on the inhale. This strain has a dull green color w numerous crystals n seeds thru the dried leaves. This would b great 2 make a concentrate o dab of some sort. When I crushed the leaves w my fingers it left tons of resin on my fingers. Another pos was the numbing tingle on my tongue, i did feel just a lil spurt of energy w a tiny bit of relaxation from this sativa. However when I smoked it n my pipe there was no euphoria, creative o hungry vibes.  Just a bit of a headache n stomach ache  10-15 min after smoking it. Smoked a B n felt a lil more of the relaxation n bit of a tingle n the frt of my brain. Almost lk it wanted 2 take me there but not quite the screaming O I was expecting. Next I will try steeping as a tea n c what it do.  Again I think this would b a great choice 4 concentrates o some sort but I wouldn&#39;t recommend this 4 the smoke. I wouldn&#39;t even use this 4 my canna sugar I make.  The aroma n resin was the only reason this strain got 3 stars. Mayb that&#39;s y ppl r mixing African Skunk w chemicals 2 intensify its effects.  Just remember if u mixing your weed w chems then its no longer natural. N it can give u the same side effects o worse as taking the junk the drs give us.
