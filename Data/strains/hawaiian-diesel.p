VA strong fruity sativa with a diesel taste. Great for mornings but not the best sleep aid.

VNice high, not intense at all. Makes me sleepy within 10 minutes and gives me a good sleep for the night. Not super social though for me, keeps me in my head which I like.

VTrue to the Diesel name. Also called &quot;Sour Hawaiian&quot; depending on where you pick it up. \u000a\u000aThis sativa strain has a sweet earthy smell with a hint of diesel fuel scent. The taste is sweet and pungent like most other diesels. \u000a\u000aThe high onset is quick and energizing. You get a quick jolt of creative energy and the instant need to get up and do something. \u000a\u000aHawaiian Diesel is great for daytime use. The high last about 2 hours with a very light come down.

VReally nice energy high from this strain. Definitely more sociable when smoking this. Being a card carrying misanthropist that says a lot. For me this also leant a creative edge that I would expect from a sativa but it\u2019s much more with this particular strain.
