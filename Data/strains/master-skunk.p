VSuch a relaxing high. I first indulged in some Master Skunk recently. I noticed it had great consistency as well as this pungent skunky smell with a berry hint to it. I&#39;ve smoked this out of every piece one can imagine and it is an enjoyable experience no matter what the glass or paper. But I truly enjoy grasping this buds taste through a nice bowl. Although I like to smoke grass any given day, this bud seems to keep me lifted no matter what day it is. What day is it anyway? ;) great bud\u000a

VMakes you extremely relaxed and sleepy. You are unable to focus. May also make you feel paranoid and defenceless. Comes with the munches :P

VI don&#39;t know what it is about Master Kush, but I&#39;ve always found it to be ineffective for my anxiety. This hybrid, however, was  the contrary: uplifting and relaxing, also a bit on psychedelic/creative side. I experienced a tiny but of paranoia, but no where NEAR as serious as my  &quot;regular Master K&quot;. sessions. Love love LOVE that stinky, skunky flavor.

VJust sittin here with a few buddies indulging into some MASTER SKUNK.  Joints are medium size and we did 3 HUGE buckets each.  I will tell you right now, I am a seasoned vet.  This by far is the best weed I smoke.. Dont smoke it on the regular, as you WILL get amune.  However in my opinion this is the HEAVIEST strain available.

VShockingly high at first. Hit me hard after 4 hits of a vape. Very heady and tingly over entire body. Totally useless on this bud so don&#39;t make plans. Little paranoid at first. Had to remind myself to calm down and enjoy. Then it was fun. Couldn&#39;t stop laughing at times and other times just zoned out watching TV. Slept like a baby and woke up energized and happy productive. Not sure if feeling awesome the next morning was due to a goods night sleep or if I still had effects from the bud? Highly recommend.

VAll i can say is wow.This is a great strain that was with me for about 4 hours.At first toke it didn&#39;t strike right away.After about 15 minutes i was on my way for a 4 hour ride.It was very exciting and filled me with energy for about 45 minutes and then brought me down to a comfortable couch lock where all i wanted to do was either eat or sleep.Did it help with my ocd and anxiety?Anything that draws my mind away from the compulsive thoughts of weather or not i washed my hands before i ate that taco or if the guy making it had gloves on when making it is a help.My ocd really works with my anxiety hard to make my life miserable.This is the only medicine that helps me.This strain was wonderful and i hope i see it more often.

VMy favourite strain, it makes me feel amazing. This strain is definitely a couch lock for me. A good strain for before bed or before a funny movie. Wouldn&#39;t suggest beginners to smoke this strain, it will get you super stoned. But if you are a veteran smoker by all means dive in on a rip. This shit is fire
