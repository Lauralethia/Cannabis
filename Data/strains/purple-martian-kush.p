VThe particular strain that I got was tested at 22%, but the high didn&#39;t quite feel as powerful as that sounds. It really takes the edge off after a long day at work or school or anything really but it isn&#39;t too overwhelming. I just felt relaxed and could finally breath a sigh of relief. If you smoke more than your fair share, you will fall asleep fairly quick if you lay down. I wouldn&#39;t recommend to use during the day because it makes me lazy and I end up just couch surfing instead of doing much with my day. It has a wood/pine smell to it but it isn&#39;t devastating to the senses.
