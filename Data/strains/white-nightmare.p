VThis one is a VERY interesting strain to say the least. The budtender recommended it so I gave it a whirl and I&#39;m glad I did. It smells extremely sweet but the taste is actually quite spicy (which I found to be odd.) The high is way different from what I&#39;ve been getting lately (in a good way.) The high is a really heavy one, bringing you down (it felt almost narcotic) while simultaneously giving you massive amounts of energy. Mentally my thoughts speed up slightly and I become more introspective (in a poative manner.) Unfortunately I did smoke this one late at night and while I felt stoned enough to fall asleep I couldn&#39;t due to the massive mental energy I was experiencing thanks to the Sativa side of the strain. So be warned: this is a morning/daytime strain! Do not use at night!\u000aOverall I&#39;d give this strain an 8/10 in my book. I would give it a 9 or 10 but I wasn&#39;t too fond of it&#39;s taste (which wasn&#39;t bad, just not my cup of tea so to speak.)

VThis is my #1!  This is the best. No anxiety, no paranoia, not as much hunger as with other strains I have tried. Made me feel happy and energized yet relaxed.

When did the trick. I had literally given up but would occasionally ask and by pure accident a budtender said &quot;Wait, I forgot we have this.&quot; The rest is history. All over great buzz, body and mind. Laugh? Until I cried.

VGrown and sold at Urban Greenhouse Dispensary. This is one of my favorite strains. It has a harsh smoke and taste terrible; and unfortunately the therapeutic benefits feel very short lived, barely reaching the hour mark. But the immediate, strong, and uplifting effects are vital for me when I&#39;m deep in a depressive episode. The strong onset high is followed by a more mellow, euphoric feeling that can lead to talkativeness and light giggles.

VI am a big fan of Sativas and this hybrid feels as upligting as a full Sativa.  I haven&#39;t gotten to the second part which is supposed to be nightmarish in the sense that you will begin to experience intense introspection....

VWow! So this was a pre roll at my fave shop, The Stash Box in Auburn. Three hits and I am immediately euphoric and relaxed in the body, and this is great stuff. I didn&#39;t sleep last night, because it was New Year&#39;s Eve, and my band totally rocked a gig - so that alone was a high like no other, LOL... before I smoked those three hits, I thought I was going to end up being in bed most of the day finally getting some sleep, but this actually is a relaxing enjoyable stone. i&#39;m really loving this so far I give it 4  thumbs up and it&#39;s probably going to end up being five stars!

VAwesome strain, absolutely covered in crystals..white as snow! It was a while back now but I remember it being similar in taste to White Fire OG only a bit sweeter and less skunky. Personally find it a nice hybrid but would look elsewhere for that full Sativa high (if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after) a mad strain and definitely worth a try if you see this at your local dispensary!
