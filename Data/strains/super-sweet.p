VVery nice to find this one at Capital Dank in Lansing, MI. Bud tender made the recommendation because I was feeding down. It made me happy &amp; good. Plus, I guess it is a Michigan strand which makes me proud to support this from our wonderful State!  It tastes yummy too!!

VThis is a real pretty flower, crystal covered, &amp; dense, but the first thing we both noticed was the strong honey, candy like smell of it before I even broke her up! But, after I did, WOW, I new I was in for something special.  The taste was, well? Yummy, sweet, floral &amp; gently smooth to the palate, I thought I was smoking sugar! Ha! The effects come slowly, &amp; you begin to think she may be all show &amp; no go, like so many good tasting strains out there! Then BAM, your really calm, relaxed &amp; pain free! A very well-rounded happy type of medication experience!!! It lasts for a good while too! :)  I like!\u000aThis is definitely my new favorite strain!! Hats off to the chef!! Lol. We got this from The Herbal Centre in Flint, Michigan!!

VVery intense candy-flower aroma &amp; taste, nice bag appeal &amp; pretty. The effects were gentle &amp; long lasting. Great for the morning &amp; day time medicating. A well balanced hybrid we all enjoyed very much. Weird, but also nice to see different strains out here on the West Coast to try from other parts of the Country, something besides a OG cross or what is the trend at the time here

VMy girlfriend brought this home &amp; said it was recommended by the Bud Tender at Cedar St. MMMP in Lansing. Nice bag appeal, I could smell it through that bag, it was hard &amp; very crystal covered. When I ground it up the terpenoids really let loose &amp; the whole room smelled of sweet, flowers! It was sticky &amp; difficult to roll, it tasted like it smelled &amp; the effects were gradual, almost creepy &amp; before you knew it we were laughing, talking &amp; feeling great! We watched Netflix &amp; enjoyed ourselves. What a wonderful way to spend the weekend before school starts back up. Highly recommended, not too strong, definitely not weak, but just about perfect for chilling inside on a cold winter day&#129305;

VMy buddies girlfriend turned me onto this. I really like it, wasn&#39;t over powering which is a bonus to me because not everyone wants to be killed. Just a nice mellow, relaxing herb with it&#39;s calming, anti anxiety, lowering my stress &amp; that last most of the afternoon. It was well cured, smelling that like it should. The popcorn nuggets were hard &amp; breaking it up released a nice flowery, fruity smell. Smoking it was easy on the lungs too. The taste was fruity with under town of sweet.\u000aOverall, it was scrumptious

VSuper sweet by lucky devil is super weak. The look and density is nice. Compact tight beige nugs with tints of blue are caked in trich. Hairs are scarce, small, and reddish orange. Smell is weak of sweet sugar and wood. Smoke is light and had little cough to it. Great for a social setting as it didn\u2019t give me anxiety while enjoying a deep conversation. Somewhat happy but not overwhelming. Felt it in the back of my neck mostly. After 10-15 minutes of letting super sweet set in, I was reaching for a different strain to wash the bad effect out. Excellent for beginners or those with a low tolerance that wish to remain on earth.\u000a\u000aI didn\u2019t like super sweet.\u000aI wouldn\u2019t get again.
