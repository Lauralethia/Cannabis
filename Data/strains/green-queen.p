VNice, Fun, Quick Buzz. Gotta pack a few bowls to get a long buzz other than that you come down pretty quick. Tingly feeling is a sure thing and no Paranoia. Leaves a crappy taste in your mouth but Arizona Green Tea always fixes that. I suggest you always have a glass when u smoke this one. \u000aLastly, IDK if this was due to a perfect grind and pack but one bowl just would not end.!!

VGreen Queen is dope. I&#39;ve gotten a tolerance over the years so I always look for indicas. Usually because of its ability to knock out anxiety. But this Green Queen though is good. Good for energy,video games, school work. Definitely focused right now.

VI&#39;m thinking maybe I got a &quot;not so green&quot; Green Queen. I experienced a more calm effect than most seem to report. It was uplifting and creative, but alternately mellow? I expected a more energetic effect. This may be a useless review seeing how it differs from most commonly reported effects, but just wanted to throw my $.02 in.

VWoke up early in considerable pain from muscle spasms and arthritis, to the point of feeling nauseous (tried to have a bite of plain bread and had to spit it out).  After an hour and a half of stretches and trigger point therapy I was mobile, but barely.  My partner suggested I have a smoke and a long hot shower, which I did, and I feel at least 75% better.  Feeling the smoke of 0.03mg Green Queen taking effect was like the Tin Man getting oil -- by the time I got into the shower and had finished lathering my hair, my neck had popped in four different places, and within ten minutes I had nearly complete range of motion again.  Now, a bit more than three hours later, I can feel some of the tension trying to creep back in, and there&#39;s a hint of a headache like a distant thundercloud on the horizon, but I&#39;m going to just keep at it (don&#39;t have to go anyplace today anyway).

VGreen Queen taste like a jolly rancher or cotton candy, wow this is SO delicious I love it. I&#39;ve had it about four different times now and I always pick it over anything else. It&#39;s so damn tasty I can&#39;t repeat it enough. It even smells great when someone else exhales. The high is strong at first and then it creeps down your toes like a flood of warm water and then your riding a surf board out of a wave tunnel, you&#39;ll be high for a long time-couch lock style. The high last for about 2 hours then fades down in the 3rd hour. Smoke it again and your right back in the candy store.

VChanged delivery method and was quite surprised at how differently this strain affected me, even though I&#39;ve been using Green Queen regularly for some time.  Instead of putting a tiny 30mg nugget into my cheap little folding one-hit pipe, I used a shredder and put 30mg of the resulting fluff into a VaporGenie pipe.  The onset of effect was noticeably faster (I was completely in it after two minutes), and after a brief initial period of not being able to sit still for very long -- and after eating a rather large dinner in a rather short amount of time -- I&#39;ve been writing and composing good-quality work for over two hours.  I experienced a sort of &quot;heavy hat&quot; headache for a while, but that has mostly subsided; my overall pain and spasm levels went down considerably.  It&#39;s just been a stronger, and longer, ride than I expected, and the effects also seemed to dissipate all at once.  I&#39;m glad I tried this shred-and-vape method with a familiar strain, so I know more what to expect when I try something new.

VI&#39;ve only tried half a dozen or so strains in the past couple of months (since I started using again, authorized by my naturopath) but this is by far my hands-down best choice for muscle spasms and chronic pain.  I love this stuff: it&#39;s strong but not overwhelming, deeply relaxing without making me feel comatose, and still leaves me feeling functional for everyday tasks (though I wouldn&#39;t want to drive or operating any other heavy machinery for two hours or so).  The only downside, for me, is eye discomfort after a while but that&#39;s easily managed with some good-quality drops.  Besides the excellent balance of effects, Green Queen smoke has a lovely kind of citrusy flavor and doesn&#39;t make my home smell like a head shop.

VQuite a unique strain. Woody, earthy, somewhat floral notes are pleasant but cause quite a ruckus. Surprisingly sweet, and fruity notes come out once the bud has had a chance to breathe. Apricots, and plum.\u000a\u000aFrom afar this strain might appear dullish, but closer inspection reveals an attractive olive green, with an even carpet of orange hairs. \u000a\u000aThe interesting linage of this plant leads to some equally interesting results that, all together, is rather unrelatable to other strains I&#39;ve tried. While sociable, high seems to locate just behind the face/skull. Though I did not run into this problem, those prone to tension headaches, and migraines should be wary. There&#39;s an odd, but not unpleasant, pressure that tends to build the more you inhale.  It&#39;s a trippy feeling that&#39;s maybe not for every one.\u000a\u000aBest with long conversations, binge watching shows, Chinese food, or some combination of the three.

VI love this strain because of the energy and concentration it give me after smoking it.  Listed as a hybrid, this is a big-boy sativa in my opinion.  Green Queen has become part of my gym workout routine. Smoke, drive to the gym and ready to go.  Mind and body both dialed in with an energized buzz.  Music sounds 3-D and hits my mind deep as my body feels every rep and my muscles can literally feel the energy the Green Queen has delivered.  Green Queen will make your head and body activate at the same time.  Be prepared.

VVery strong and nearly immediate high. Asked for the highest THC they had and was given this and Romulan, and they&#39;re both right on the money. Green Queen seems to hit me in waves - regular spacey high, then bored/restless, then too sleepy to keep eyes open but unable to sleep, then starving. A very small amount goes a long way, especially compared to some of the recent strains I&#39;ve tried.  This is definitely a new favorite, and even has a slightly sweet taste.

VGreen Queen is a tasty and powerful plant. While growing the flowers had a smell of ripe melons, which matured into a sweet grapefruit/citrus(wife says cat-piss) smell after cure.  The high is functional and stimulating, and yet has a relaxing nature without being tiring, perfect for all day and into a active evening. She was ready outdoors here in Southern Oregon @ October 5-10, so she beat the mold season. She was an aggressive grower, and insisted on blowing up in quick time, then yielding large numbers of long  sticky colas. This strain isn&#39;t well know outside of Oregon, but give her a try if she comes your way!

VDefinitely what you want in a hybrid, as it seems to have aspects of both a sativa and an indica. the different aspects of the high seem to come in waves. Starts with an uplifted feeling, and a head buzz. Very mild body buzz that only seems noticeable when youre not being active. Then come the giggles, and the munchies. Damn this strain makes me eat. Great for listening to music, or dancing. On the comedown i got pretty tired and crashed hard, felt pretty groggy next day as well. Favorite strain ive tried so far

VI picked up the last cartridge of Green Queen by Select Strains at my dispensary today. It was a bit leaky, and now the vape pen keeps blinking even though it&#39;s charged. Grrr.  Luckily my other herb vape pen base is working, so I did get high on this today, and it is a really good one.  It tastes like citrussy pine and it kicked me in the pants!  I felt like I had kissed a Douglas Fir tree!  Mine tested at 75.49%  THC  and .41%  CBD.\u000a\u000aIn true hybrid fashion, Green Queen both cleared my head and made me sleepy at the same time. I would totally buy this one again, and am now interested in her parent, Space Queen, as a future indica purchase. This one is strong, so test at home first before going out in public!

Green Queen has been the only strain in my stash for weeks.  I had my usual small pipe bowl of this at around 7 pm; by 8:00 I&#39;d eaten twice as much dinner as I&#39;d planned, and have spent the rest of the evening quite contentedly sitting on the couch by candlelight reminscing with a friend (who was not altered in any way)... except I&#39;m going to have to buy another bag of Halloween candy.

Strong affect; fairly chill without difficulty focusing.  Not feeling super motivated and... (giggle) definitely looking forward... (giggle) to dinner.\u000a\u000aBecoming one of my favorites...

VIts very green &amp; tasty. I thought the high would be stronger.  I smoked more than my usual amount trying to achieve a high that I didnt really come across.  I was surprized to see its parent strains which both are 2 of my favorites.  I had to review Green Queen because I love it&#39;s name &#128154;

VMigraine pain comin back; nausea 6 when I medicated round 1900 or 1930. Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. Head high strong but nice. No anxiety/paranoia (a must for me). Body high what I needed. Seemed to lose track of time tho. I wanted to get so much done today &amp; now it&#39;s time to go to bed. I think that&#39;s a natural side effect of medicating. ;-) Slowed down a lil bit which is not what I wanted. But highly recommend for after work/evening use for pain /nausea.

VGreen queen is the fucking fire. Strongest stench when u open the bag of a sour, pungent, diesely, cheesey type smell. The nugs are light greenish-gold, sparkling with what looks like little  droplets of thc crystals. Sorta fluffy buds but tight buds, compacted together and sticky as fuckkk. Looks to good to even smoke. Now the taste is a high of its own, it&#39;s got. Really pungent diesely sour diesel kinda taste. With a hint of some cheese. Absolutely delicious. The high is very euphoric and uplifting. Almost like a pure sativa. But nice and calming as well, good energetic high and is perfect if. You got a busy day ahead of you . 5 outta 5 , no doubt

Green Queen is my med of choice if I need physical help and still want/need to be able to interact with the rest of the world.
