VStrain: Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies (Durban Poison / OG Kush cross -- Indica leaning Hybrid)\u000aTHC: 22.84%\u000aCBD: 0.84%\u000aLocation found: KaLeafa\u000aDate purchased: 3.29.16\u000aPrice: $8.00/g\u000aWeight: 1.3g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: Earthy mint with some sweet OG lingerings. Unique to its own. Durban Poison is its own smell, animal and thing that is definitely present here. The cross is beautiful.\u000aLook: Dense whitish green nugs with orange hairs swirling about. Small touch up trim needed before consumption.\u000aTaste: The taste is stronger than the smell. The earthy flavor overshadows any hope of any Kush shining here. Long live all strains with Durban Poison within them!\u000aRecommendation for medicine: Slow it down and relax, from behind your eyes but not all the way there. It is debilitating strain and can be quite high in THC content. Could be a sleep aid at night but it did make my mind go rather fast in the morning. Another flavor that I would consume just for taste, besides the uplifting good feeling accompanied with this strain.

VTook some of this to relax and ended up in a 30 minute debate with my wife about the political ramifications of sci-fi levels of discoveries, like cold fusion or first contact. Great if you want to wax philosophical, probably not what you want just before bed. If taking for insomnia, you&#39;ll want to time the tail end of the mental effects for when you want to go to sleep (has an average duration).

I heard from an article that GSC was one of the best strains for anxiety....I went to work calm and positive, feeling very secure and happy. not euphoric, even better just simply calm and happy. That&#39;s how I always want to feel. It tastes pretty nice as well. This strain is really all that I need for everyday use. Honestly it helped me to feel better than any pill I&#39;ve been handed for the last 28 years!! I highly recommend this for anyone who suffers from anxiety or PTSD.

Vhonestly, I just got out of urgent care this morning from having a fever to throwing up uncontrollably and not having an appetite only come to find out it was a stomach bug. I havent smoked for the last 5 days decided to pick up this bud and see if it helps. After taking 2.5 hits out of my zong, my heads not spinning, my body tingles with greatness, I&#39;m smiling, the nausea went away, and I have a slight appetite again. CRAZY!  I should&#39;ve smoked this the day I got sick.

VUnique-\u000a\u000aInteresting to read some of these other reviews.  I enjoy smoking out of a bong so its important to me that my cannabis burns well in my device.  My source of Tm provided me with some flowers that burned well, but produced an incredible amount of smoke that just crawled through my sinuses and cleared them out like I had eaten a giant chunk of wasabi. WHAT? That is exactly what I said afterwards.  It was a bit too intense for my upper respiratory tract, hence the 4.  I also noticed an effect on my airways that was similar to the effects produced by a short acting asthma rescue inhaler I have used.   What a trip.

VThis strain in my opinion and my experience is absolutely amazing for anxiety and panic attacks. It is not an intense high, and it tastes amazing. It also gave me that narcotic pain medication feeling, and works great for skeletal pain. I wish the high lasted longer than two hours, but it&#39;s definitely worth $50 an eighth! Very happy with this strain...\u000a

VAfter researching what strains to try I stumbled upon thin mints. There was a lot of hype surrounding this strain so my expectations were pretty high. Started off with a nice sativa high. The cerebral tingles didn&#39;t hit me too hard but I did find bobs burgers to be way funnier than usual. I also found myself dancing a lot. After about an hour I started feeling the indica effects. The couch lock wasn&#39;t too bad but I wasn&#39;t motivated to do anything else but watch one piece. The body high was nice and relaxing and I got a bit of mental haziness. Also, killer munchies. Not much of a social strain. I&#39;d smoke this after a long day at work or if I had nothing going on that day. Nice mix of both sativa and indica, not too dominant on either spectrum.

VNot my favorite flavor of cookies, but it&#39;s great weed regardless.  The Durban genetics are dominant - mental and trippy with strong waves of pain relief.  The effects are great but the taste and smell aren&#39;t comparable to some of the other GSC cuts.  In general, it also seems less purple and not as dense.  Overall pretty good to great.

Vshort story...this one is an immediate must try for everyone\u000a\u000along story\u000aso i found this super cheap at my dispensary and it was thinned out wax...so i took some cheap but strong Krazy Glue which is good on its own...took a small nug maybe  0.1 gram nug that had been dusting in some super cheap Tahoe OG kief to full saturation and i tossed it in my normal 24&quot; bong with ice but NO WATER (important)\u000a\u000ai cut a thin strip that was maybe 1/4&quot; x 1/8&quot; and i laid it over the bud and i did a strong fast hard fire through the wax and into the flower...melting the wax down and into the bud\u000a\u000afirst hit was just strong enough to melt the wax down fast without igniting it and not burn much of the green and good airflow on the bowl helps here\u000a\u000aafter that i hit it any way i wanted about 4 or 5 times and snapped it\u000a\u000aLet Me Be Clear the star in this show was the Thin Mint wax...it elevated that little half bowl of cheap stuff that costs $5 a gram to the level of some really fantastic medication on every level\u000a\u000athe amount of wax i used was about a dollar\u000a\u000athe wax gram was $25 so....\u000a\u000ai&#39;d say that session cost about $1.50 and fits nicely in my daily budget for meds and could be replicated in anything from a $5 pipe to a fully loaded Studio Rig

VBeen vaping the Thin Mints strain produced by Gold Coast. The effects are typically uplifting bordering on euphoric depending on quantity consumed. I&#39;m not as focused as other sativa hybrids, but it&#39;s far from a dopey feeling. Motor skills are not as sharp when the high is in full swing. \u000a\u000aWhat I really love though is that the high is very pleasant and I feel very social and at ease. I did not experience any paranoia (the ol&#39; I-wonder-if-I&#39;m-anyone-knows-I&#39;m-high thought stream). Come down is smooth and I usually just stop feeling high after a couple of hours.

VPurchased from Kaleafa in Oak Harbor by Seattle&#39;s Private Reserve. Got home and twisted off the lid. I immediately noticed the dark leaves coated with a generous distribution of crystals. The aroma lifted out of the jar. The scent was sweet and familiar of a flower that has undergone a special change. The purplish mutation offers interesting experiences upon inhalation as well. Sweet hints of grape and pine filled my nostrils. Almost instantly I felt the ghost of the flower cascading through in pulses starting in my head and residing down in my feet. I was driving at the time but had I been in a bed this morning then I would have wanted to stay still and drift away. I was driving, as I said, and still stimulated by the magical puzzle pieces attaching themselves to the microbiological surfaces in my body. I felt happy and not cloudy-headed. I think I&#39;m in love with this strain.

The aroma lifted out of the jar. The scent was sweet and familiar of a flower that has undergone a special change. The purplish mutation offers interesting experiences upon inhalation as well. Sweet hints of grape and pine filled my nostrils. Almost instantly I felt the ghost of the flower cascading through in pulses starting in my head and residing down in my feet. I was driving at the time but had I been in a bed this morning then I would have wanted to stay still and drift away. I was driving, as I said, and still stimulated by the magical puzzle pieces attaching themselves to the microbiological surfaces in my body. I felt happy and not cloudy-headed. I think I&#39;m in love with this strain.

Vgotta free preroll from Our life Inc. in Albuquerque NM. tested at 17%THC and 1%CBD. it actually did taste like a thin mint or some kind of chocolate mint candy. nice smooth menthol smoke with a hint of earthy skunky taste. very good day time smoke got more of a head high than body but still was a nice smoke. will try again, and recommend to anyone who like something different tasting than most strains. helped a bit with my ptsd, not as effective on my pain.

VAroma and taste are absolutely in the name.  The Durban Poison component is extremely dominant in this pheno in both Sativa effect and cooling texture of the smoke.  Truthfully, my favorite aspect of this strain is the THC-V content; another connotation of the Durban Poison parent.  This hefty cannabinoid suppresses munchies and leaves you with a slightly stoney and very heady buzz.

VThis strain is as potent as any OG Kush because it does have an OG Kush in the mix. Anyways this strain taste just like minty chocolate kush mixed with hints of berry and grape. It&#39;s amazing they said there is no GDP in this strain, however I beg to differ something is causing that berry and grape sweet flavor in the mix, Strange indeed. Anyways it has a pretty much potent stoney cerebral and body high. Great for medicating for pain relief while still being able to function doesn&#39;t put you down like an OG Kush but has the potency of an OG without the sleep aid. Maybe for beginners it would put them to sleep or low tolerance users. however I&#39;ve consumed the flower and co2 hash oil. Both never really put me to sleep but medicated me well almost got a &quot;couch lock&quot; but it&#39;s like a non fatiguing couch lock, I could get up and move. I feel this strain is great for chilling out with a few friends and watching movies or gaming. Or desktop work. You can still function on this but you will be giggly and euphoric, You will feel like an astronaught but still remain somewhat focused! It deserves a 5 star rating. The flower and concentrate is potent enough. However for sleep maybe not this herb try an actual OG or some other herb. I figure if you have no tolerance this might put you to sleepish sort of? It gives me an energetic but not racy cerebral stone and body relaxation pain relief high.

VThis GSC phenotype soooooorta reminds me of junior mints. I said sorta...The trichome coverage on your Thin Mint should be dense. The flower should be deep green and should have a musky mint aroma. I smoked this strain in a zig zag about 20 mins before watching \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth.\u201d Packed movie theater and those new reclining seats! I was stuck! It made the experience very pleasurable and I didn\u2019t get munchies until an hour later. Nice mental stimulation that borders on euphoric and psychedelic. I smoked some the next day and the sun became my best friend. I experienced some lethargy with this strain after smoking it over prolonged periods. So I vouch for this strain as a great sleeplessness remedy. This strain will give you a great heady lift off of energy and fun then it will bring your physical state down to a pile of relaxed muscles and joints. I stay active and I like this strain before a walk or low-intensity workouts then my body is ready to stretch. The intensity of the stretches lessens and makes the experience more enjoyable. People don\u2019t stretch or rehab because it\u2019s too painful. This strain eases pain and makes the process more enjoyable.

VThis strain is primo for me. I suffer from really bad digestive issues and painful periods. Like we\u2019re talking norcos and Zofran just to be more comfortable and able to eat and hold food down. I\u2019ve been going through lots of strains lately trying help the pain and nausea but still leave me feeling alert and not couch locked. Well folks! this is it for me!! Thin mints is a strain that leaves the knots in my stomach and cramps a distant thought.. Food suddenly sounds amazing again and when eating my stomach for once agrees. Half a small joint and I\u2019m instantly more comfortable, finally hungry and not thinking that life is seriously sucking. I can still to go about my day alert and focused (More on that later) or if I am just trying to relax; comfortable but no couch lock. &#128591;&#127996;&#128591;&#127996; Focusing on tasks are also a dream on this strain which I wasn\u2019t expecting. Like I started washing a bowl and suddenly my kitchen it clean. So bonus for those people that hate cleaning but this strain helps with that too. In other words 10/10 strain, feel more comfortable and even get your chores done!

VThin Mint Cookies is a great hybrid strain. Very relaxing, but at the same time can also be very energetic. This strain will increase your appetite and your libido for sure. Thin Mint Cookies leaves you feeling uplifted and calms you with the occasional, slight, but equally delightful tingling sensation. It is cerebral, almost to the point that you can find yourself easily distracted. This strain will not focus your thoughts, or bring much introspection. It will, however, pull you out of a stressful mindset and into a gentle high. Not the most POWERFUL strain in my opinion, but a good staple hybrid that combines relaxation from stress and a good level of energy.

VThis strain was similar to the GSC platinum I just had, but I liked the thin mint better. Similar sweet smell but with a fresh minty, herbal touch. Has a bit of a minty burn on inhale, and kind of a sweet hashy flavor on exhale. The buds are dense and dark, not too many hairs. Well balanced high, overall good strain.

Vit is a phenomenal phenotype of the cookie family. higher yielder than most cookies deep purple towards ripening. sweet earthy taste with the mint finisher, very psychoactive, stress relief and appetite are main medicinal benefits of this strain personally.

VI\u2019ve been a super duper stoner since Jr high and just recently started vaping oils due to the fact that my wife can\u2019t stand the smell of herb burning or that funky smell it leaves on your breath. I got Thin Mint because of the reviews on this site and it\u2019s medical properties for pain relief. AMAZING!!! I\u2019ve been pain free all day, even with a massive front moving through. I\u2019ve had super energy and haven\u2019t had the glued to the seat feeling either. I highly recommend this strain for all chronic pain patients.

This was my first time trying smoking in any form other then flowers so I\u2019m not entirely sure if my experience is solely from the strain it\u2019s self or altered by the delivery. That being said...\u000aThe high was very heady. Makes me feel like my nose to the top of my head are stoned while the rest of my body isn\u2019t. Very pleasant. The high is very was very reminiscent of the Durban Poison. Looking forward to to getting a chance to try this in a flower form.

VThin Mint Cookies is a great hybrid strain. Very relaxing, but at the same time can also be very energetic. This strain will increase your appetite and your libido for sure. Thin Mint Cookies leaves you feeling uplifted and calms you with the occasional, slight, but equally delightful tingling sensation. It is cerebral, almost to the point that you can find yourself easily distracted. This strain will not focus your thoughts, or bring much introspection. It will, however, pull you out of a stressful mindset and into a gentle high. Not the most POWERFUL strain in my opinion, but a good staple hybrid that combines relaxation from stress and a good level of energy.

VThere are a couple different accounts of what the true genetics of the &quot;Thin Mint Cut&quot; are, I believe the description here is a bit off but that&#39;s my opinion.  The genetics to my knowledge are Og Kush x (Grandaddy Purple x Durban) x Cherry - which turns what was maybe 1/3 sativa into more like 1/6 sativa - making this a heavily indica dominant variation of Girl Scout Cookies.  Having grown this myself you know when you have the real Thin Mint Cut - aesthetically it is unmistakeable - deep deep green-brown hues with almost burnt orange hairs and occasional purple hues if grown cold, it looks and smells like no other strain. The shade of brown is very distinctive and deep almost like mahogany. if cured properly for 3 or 4 weeks the smell of mint really does come out, and an unmistakeable coffee smell.  I consider this to be a strain for people who are really into the bouquet aspect, the smell and appearance, because they are beautiful.  As for the effect, I use it to fall asleep.  It does nothing but make me tired, whereas the original Girl Scout Cookies were much more stimulating as the Durban was more prevalent.  Not my cup of tea but a beautiful flower and useful for sleep disorders.

VAs a beginner this was way too strong. My first hit from vape made me high out of my mind, and super emotional. I was watching people sing on The Voice and started bawling my eyes out because one girl sang so good, lol. I did get motivated to practice guitar after the initial high wore off, which was awesome because I haven&#39;t touched the guitar in about a year. I ended up feeling the effects for several hours. Definitely too strong for newbies, but good for creativity and motivation to get things done.

VThe first batch I ever had of this stuff was pretty amazing. It looked great multiple colors greens,purples,orange hairs,covered in frost. It tasted like mint on exhale hence the name. Strong Medicine for body and soul.  I felt amazing body-high wise. On the head-high you are soaring up in the sky another level style. Long lasting as well. Only drawback u want more

VI&#39;ve been searching for a great weed that calms down my anxiety. I have generalized anxiety disorder. I get panic attacks for no reason. This weed helps tremendously. I just feel happy and forget all about my anxiety. Very calm high, not overwhelming, clear headed, and soothing. Gives you a little energy mentally for some uplifting feeling. Makes you very smiley and happy. \u000a\u000aGiggles, fun conversations, relaxation is what you find in this one. Great mid day. Becomes the come down brings on an amazing deep sleep!\u000a\u000aBest weed ever. Hands down, this is my bud of choice, if I need more weed, I won&#39;t settle for any less than this strain! \u000a\u000aColumbia holistics hooked it up! Great place and friendly staff. Good selection and they give great deals. I got 1.3 and 1.5 &quot;grams&quot; for $10 each!

There&#39;s very few that don&#39;t give me some form of anxiety - though the positives usually outweigh the negatives. However, this strain literally suppressed my anxiety. I was sitting waiting for it to come, and it never did. I almost got anxious waiting to get anxious. Not to mention it&#39;s high THC content, so it got me to the point I wanted to be at with none of the negative side effects. I strongly regret not stocking up on this strain, as my dispensary is now out of stock and don&#39;t know when they&#39;ll be getting more in :(

VI was stoked to try this strain. I will continue to smoke it, but it made me feel very paranoid and that was uncomfortable. It got me nice and high, which outweighs the paranoia. I also felt a tightness in my abdominal region after smoking it.

VFirst time I tried it I was excited!  The plug said Girl scout cookies had different flavors and I didnt know that at all. Where im from we dont have any dispensaries lol!!! When i hit the blunt i was upset i wanted to hit it in a joint so i can truly savor the flavor. Overall it had this good minty flowery chocolate taste. I think i tasted the chocolate more bc of the blunt but it was really good. I didnt have a trip but the guy in front me in the rotation was geeking hard!!! Only if leafy had video blogs so i can post the kid. He had my dying &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;

VOne of the finest examples of hybrid cannabis\u000a\u000aThin mint gsc is a potent strain with truly powerful hybrid effects. There is strong psychoactivity with this strain, while relaxation eventually sets in later on. The buds of thin mint gsc tend to be smaller, however it more than compensates for this with its ridiculous Trichome coverage and thc content. The  dense buds reek of sweet skunk berry. I purchased a quarter of Cannabiotix thin mint gsc, which has won multiple first place cannabis cups. For those seeking heavy couch lock and minimal mental stimulation, this strain may not be for you.

VThis is some good ass shit. Been extremely anxious going on 2 weeks now, and smoking this basically lasered all my fret. Like... straight up 2 weeks of hating myself because I love my shithole, petulant, half-cactus/half-carcass of an ex that has a new girl (even though he told me once he &quot;just can&#39;t date people&quot;... like, okay, sure, buddy) and keep wishing I was her, blah blah blah, typical white girl angst... and now I&#39;m barely even remembering what the fuck his name was. I&#39;d like to stress that this anxiety crap has been a constant for over 4 and a half years and I have a hard time remembering that sad sack of shit&#39;s name was Jesse, so it should say how ridiculously fucking strong this crap is. I&#39;ve had the original GSC before but DAMN, its offspring hits it out of the park. Fair warning: this baby&#39;s a cougher. Or maybe I have shit lungs. Either way, get you some.

VI dont know what to say about this strain but its smell is one of a kind. Crazy coffee/chocolate minty smell with a heavy pinene influence all about. taste is exactly as it smells and the burn is oh so clean that all you can taste is the flavour and after you exhale you cant help but give a few coughs.... This is defintely a go to for creativity and if you want a good nights sleep after your mind has finished racing for the past few hours.

VUpon arrival to the procurer\u2019s establishment, I had a choice between this strain and White Berry. I did a review on the White Berry before; this time, I stuck mostly to Thin Mint GSC.\u000a\u000aInitial appearance: coated, just coated. This makes the underlying green tones appear lighter than they really are secondary to the whitishness induced by the trichome coverage (essentially all pure white stalks and heads). There are still gradations between some darker spots with a lighter backdrop and very sparse orange stigmas. The texture is nice and firm but not anything considered excessively dense; it falls in the spectrum of the density of many common Cannabis strains. One may find these flower buds keefy (\u2018trichome-laden\u2019) to feel and sticky after 2 - 3 pinches of manual grinding by hand. There are occasional tinges of purple, and the calyx tips point upwards and form almost spike-like florets that are still thick and can aggregate into the floral, vegetative mass of bud (\u2018spike-like\u2019 = Durban; \u2018aggregate\u2019 = O.G.)\u000a\u000aSmell: initially, straight up dough like the original GSC but with a mint tone to it. Definitely something that reminds one of sweet biscuits (in a non-Cannabis sense), and repeated wafts, including to repeated and first-time exposures (such as in repeatedly closing and opening the jar), reveal further accents to this strain including skunkiness and, if really looking for it, a dark-chocolate scent that can, at least mildly, resemble actual Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies. In the midst of all this, the Durban smell that can be likened to marjoram (or some component thereof) clearly stands out and shines through as about 30 \u2013 50% of what I smelled (and smell). WARNING: WILL FILL UP ROOM/AREA WITH SKUNK FLOWER BUD AROMA!\u000a\u000aTaste: dough, dough, dough. It tastes like dough with that slight mintiness that\u2019s there in mojito on inhalation. While holding in an inhalation, the skunky and sweet tones become more pronounced on the tongue, and right before exhalation, one can find the taste of that dark chocolate with the dough, sweetness and mild to moderate mintiness. Coughing may occur, but this is due purely to the quality of this flower and can be detected by consumers as a, \u2018clean\u2019 sensation (literally).\u000a\u000aEffect: I\u2019ve complained quite a bit in the past about GSC because, honestly, I haven\u2019t been a fan of Durban in the past prior to ever trying GSC, and the original GSC definitely has a pronounced Durban component. This strain, however, I wholly approve of. The phrase, \u2018upgraded Durban\u2019 was a conclusion I ultimately came to. It seems a little more balanced to me and actually lends a characteristic that allows the Durban component to actually shine through in a way that may not be recognized otherwise. One way to describe this: the uplifting effect of Durban takes on the body with maintained Indica effect which eventually all segu&#233;s into full-on, head-and-body, relaxation, calming and numbing effects that are of notable intensity. One thing I DEFINITELY appreciated about this strain (and the reason why, as I type this, I changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars): the length-of-duration can be long with this strain. One 0.15 \u2013 0.2 gram bowl out of a glass chillum, when cleaned and properly flowing, endows a sensation that can last at least 2.5 to 3 hours. Larger quantities endow even longer durations of effect(s). Small quantities: immediate cerebral rush but Indica component definitely present hence uniquely, \u2018balanced\u2019 even if one may be taken aback. Moderate quantities: heaviness, slowing down, couchlock. Large quantities: waves of alternating cerebral euphoria , arousal to the extent of full wakefulness and heavy, intense, relaxing, \u2018calms\u2019. A hallmark characteristic: a sense of well-being. Small quantities intaken leave no sense of fatigue or tiredness. Moderate to large quantities may do so some hours after intake. \u000a\u000a***NOTE: one characteristic of this strain, for me, is that it can increase the appetite quite a bit, and it seemed to be a better idea to supplant this, &#39;hunger&#39; with just water as eating can drastically decrease the effect/sensations endowed by this strain. That is why, by my understanding, this is one of those strains that became such a popular mainstay: people can work on it and live a productive life with a full-schedule while maintaining a solid-intensity Indica that does have a good duration-of-action as well, and eating food can allow one to selectively, &#39;remove&#39; the components of psychoactivity/mental euphoria or changes in consciousness states thereof while maintaining other selected benefits such as for lower back pain, other body aches and spasms (at minimum).\u000a\u000aAnother thought that came to mind (in the context of Leafly&#39;s, &#39;Cannabinoid Week&#39;): is this, &#39;hunger&#39; with this strain specifically related to actual hunger or a mimic of certain actions of the endogenous hormone ghrelin? It may just be the batch I have, but I also feel some small spurts occasionally of, &#39;anti-hunger&#39; in-line with THCV. You get the benefits of maintaining those, &#39;hunger pathways&#39; (which can include but go beyond genetic stabilization) without actually, &#39;needing&#39; to intake food? A complex strain which definitely had some thought put into breeding it, which is why...\u000a\u000aOverall: I put this on my list of Favorite Strains. Solid. (*thumb up*)\u000a\u000aWould I buy this again? Yes! (By the kilo? Hm\u2026 [*scratching chin*])\u000a\u000aRecommend to Connoisseurs and Sommeliers? I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve had this by this point, but sure, let\u2019s say yes.\u000a\u000aRecommend to first-timers and/or inexperienced consumers? Yes.

VIt had a nice buzz. Relaxing without too heavy of body buzz. It may have been better. I ran into a problem I am finding that is common in nearly all Oregon dispensary bud and that is a nasty smell and taste like matches on exhale.

VTried the thin mint a while ago, as a VERY new smoker and DID NOT LIKE IT. Tried it again because Dank&#39;s was rolling an AMAZING 40% off Phat Panda for 420 - LOVED IT. Turned around and went right back to pick up another two eighths. I am extremely pleased with the high. It FEELs like an Indica dominate hybrid and not a Sativa dominate hybrid. I think all the strains in OG&#39;s lineage really speak to that. I suffer from anxiety, PTSD, depression, mild insomnia, I have joint pain from an injury in my knee, and I have psoriatic arthritis in my right hand. This is just what the doctor ordered! I feel highly functional but extremely, extremely relaxed. I don&#39;t feel wired at all, like I couldn&#39;t go to sleep right now. It&#39;s that really nice in-between place where you feel total relaxation but not SLEEPY. I feel like when I DO go to sleep I am going to sleep like a baby!

VUpon arrival to the procurer\u2019s establishment, I had a choice between this strain and White Berry. I did a review on the White Berry before; this time, I stuck mostly to Thin Mint GSC.\u000a\u000aInitial appearance: coated, just coated. This makes the underlying green tones appear lighter than they really are secondary to the whitishness induced by the trichome coverage (essentially all pure white stalks and heads). There are still gradations between some darker spots with a lighter backdrop and very sparse orange stigmas. The texture is nice and firm but not anything considered excessively dense; it falls in the spectrum of the density of many common Cannabis strains. One may find these flower buds keefy (\u2018trichome-laden\u2019) to feel and sticky after 2 - 3 pinches of manual grinding by hand. There are occasional tinges of purple, and the calyx tips point upwards and form almost spike-like florets that are still thick and can aggregate into the floral, vegetative mass of bud (\u2018spike-like\u2019 = Durban; \u2018aggregate\u2019 = O.G.)\u000a\u000aSmell: initially, straight up dough like the original GSC but with a mint tone to it. Definitely something that reminds one of sweet biscuits (in a non-Cannabis sense), and repeated wafts, including to repeated and first-time exposures (such as in repeatedly closing and opening the jar), reveal further accents to this strain including skunkiness and, if really looking for it, a dark-chocolate scent that can, at least mildly, resemble actual Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies. In the midst of all this, the Durban smell that can be likened to marjoram (or some component thereof) clearly stands out and shines through as about 30 \u2013 50% of what I smelled (and smell). WARNING: WILL FILL UP ROOM/AREA WITH SKUNK FLOWER BUD AROMA!\u000a\u000aTaste: dough, dough, dough. It tastes like dough with that slight mintiness that\u2019s there in mojito on inhalation. While holding in an inhalation, the skunky and sweet tones become more pronounced on the tongue, and right before exhalation, one can find the taste of that dark chocolate with the dough, sweetness and mild to moderate mintiness. Coughing may occur, but this is due purely to the quality of this flower and can be detected by consumers as a, \u2018clean\u2019 sensation (literally).\u000a\u000aEffect: I\u2019ve complained quite a bit in the past about GSC because, honestly, I haven\u2019t been a fan of Durban in the past prior to ever trying GSC, and the original GSC definitely has a pronounced Durban component. This strain, however, I wholly approve of. The phrase, \u2018upgraded Durban\u2019 was a conclusion I ultimately came to. It seems a little more balanced to me and actually lends a characteristic that allows the Durban component to actually shine through in a way that may not be recognized otherwise. One way to describe this: the uplifting effect of Durban takes on the body with maintained Indica effect which eventually all segu&#233;s into full-on, head-and-body, relaxation, calming and numbing effects that are of notable intensity. One thing I DEFINITELY appreciated about this strain (and the reason why, as I type this, I changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars): the length-of-duration can be long with this strain. One 0.15 \u2013 0.2 gram bowl out of a glass chillum, when cleaned and properly flowing, endows a sensation that can last at least 2.5 to 3 hours. Larger quantities endow even longer durations of effect(s). Small quantities: immediate cerebral rush but Indica component definitely present hence uniquely, \u2018balanced\u2019 even if one may be taken aback. Moderate quantities: heaviness, slowing down, couchlock. Large quantities: waves of alternating cerebral euphoria , arousal to the extent of full wakefulness and heavy, intense, relaxing, \u2018calms\u2019. A hallmark characteristic: a sense of well-being. Small quantities intaken leave no sense of fatigue or tiredness. Moderate to large quantities may do so some hours after intake. \u000a\u000a***NOTE: one characteristic of this strain, for me, is that it can increase the appetite quite a bit, and it seemed to be a better idea to supplant this, &#39;hunger&#39; with just water as eating can drastically decrease the effect/sensations endowed by this strain. That is why, by my understanding, this is one of those strains that became such a popular mainstay: people can work on it and live a productive life with a full-schedule while maintaining a solid-intensity Indica that does have a good duration-of-action as well, and eating food can allow one to selectively, &#39;remove&#39; the components of psychoactivity/mental euphoria or changes in consciousness states thereof while maintaining other selected benefits such as for lower back pain, other body aches and spasms (at minimum).\u000a\u000aAnother thought that came to mind (in the context of Leafly&#39;s, &#39;Cannabinoid Week&#39;): is this, &#39;hunger&#39; with this strain specifically related to actual hunger or a mimic of certain actions of the endogenous hormone ghrelin? It may just be the batch I have, but I also feel some small spurts occasionally of, &#39;anti-hunger&#39; in-line with THCV. You get the benefits of maintaining those, &#39;hunger pathways&#39; (which can include but go beyond genetic stabilization) without actually, &#39;needing&#39; to intake food? A complex strain which definitely had some thought put into breeding it, which is why...\u000a\u000aOverall: I put this on my list of Favorite Strains. Solid. (*thumb up*)\u000a\u000aWould I buy this again? Yes! (By the kilo? Hm\u2026 [*scratching chin*])\u000a\u000aRecommend to Connoisseurs and Sommeliers? I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve had this by this point, but sure, let\u2019s say yes.\u000a\u000aRecommend to first-timers and/or inexperienced consumers? Yes.

VFirst time trying this strain and I loved it. Used my crafty vape it tasted awesome. Smooth sweet and piney mint flavor. Effects came on fast and strong. Worked wonders on my PTSD and depression. Very manageable head buzz. Mostly uplifted and just happy. Was able to work no problems on this. Will definitely have again.

VI was nervous trying a stronger strain cause of the &quot;high feeling&quot; but since I have chronic fibromyalgia and arthritis through out my body. This strain is phenomenal because once you smoke a couple hits it takes the pain away for hours! Sometimes for a day or 2 then I smoke it again when I need it. This is the strain for debilitating pain and nausea. Helped so much!!

VLiterally hands down one of my favorite strains. I like variety and have 10 strains or so on hand at any given time and it is an ever changing rotation. But a few have become staples for me and this is one of them. \u000a\u000aIt is definitely minty but certainly has that familiar OGKush taste as well. I spent a bit of time in Amsterdam 15 years ago and this is one of the few strains that can take me back to that place.\u000a\u000aIt is euphoric, pain and anxiety relieving, and time warp inducing. I can usually handle a pretty heavy dose but this is a two quit hit for me. I don&#39;t really find those anymore, even as everything gets better and better my tolerance keeps up, but TMC kicks my ass.\u000a\u000aIt is an evening/at home strain for me, unless I was going to a movie or to see live music or something. I am not paranoid on it and am talkative and there isn&#39;t a ton of &quot;couchlock&quot; but I just don&#39;t see it as a super active strain...and for me I don&#39;t know if I could get a whole lot of actual work done (unless I was doing something super creative or hands-on/interactive).\u000a\u000aMy flower is 23.16% THC and I snagged it at Moss Crossing in Eugene!

VThis is some good ass shit. Been extremely anxious going on 2 weeks now, and smoking this basically lasered all my fret. Like... straight up 2 weeks of hating myself because I love my shithole, petulant, half-cactus/half-carcass of an ex that has a new girl (even though he told me once he &quot;just can&#39;t date people&quot;... like, okay, sure, buddy) and keep wishing I was her, blah blah blah, typical white girl angst... and now I&#39;m barely even remembering what the fuck his name was. I&#39;d like to stress that this anxiety crap has been a constant for over 4 and a half years and I have a hard time remembering that sad sack of shit&#39;s name was Jesse, so it should say how ridiculously fucking strong this crap is. I&#39;ve had the original GSC before but DAMN, its offspring hits it out of the park. Fair warning: this baby&#39;s a cougher. Or maybe I have shit lungs. Either way, get you some.

VThis is hands down my favourite strain. I&#39;m pretty susceptible to getting anxiety from most weed strains. There&#39;s very few that don&#39;t give me some form of anxiety - though the positives usually outweigh the negatives. However, this strain literally suppressed my anxiety. I was sitting waiting for it to come, and it never did. I almost got anxious waiting to get anxious. Not to mention it&#39;s high THC content, so it got me to the point I wanted to be at with none of the negative side effects. I strongly regret not stocking up on this strain, as my dispensary is now out of stock and don&#39;t know when they&#39;ll be getting more in :(

VWhy would I ever give a Girl Scout Cookie strain anything more than three stars? Here\u2019s why: it\u2019s what any other GSC based strain wants to be. Thin Mints captures and exceeds the euphoria of Gelato while also commanding a stronger body high than say Biscotti or Wedding Cake (all GSC based strains). It also carries the most amazing tranquilizer property. It\u2019s sedating without the feeling or lethargy or grogginess at any point. And honestly that\u2019s what I really want to highlight about this strain - it\u2019s a total knockout. I had the best sleep of my life last night, and I know I\u2019ve said that before in life, but this smashes all other experiences of \u201coh man, best night of sleep ever!\u201d This strain provides the mental and physical peace you need in order to not just fall asleep, but stay asleep. I work up in the same position as I fell asleep in. I don\u2019t remember waking up once, which I always do no matter how high I am. And oh, this high I\u2019ve gotten? Yeah it came from one regular sized dab. I\u2019m completely shook and blown away, since usually I need three times the amount to send me here, and even then, it won\u2019t keep me asleep the entire night. 5/5 recommended you don\u2019t sleep on this strain if you see it around.

Lasted about 3 to 3.5 hours total. Not sure what the average time should be, but so far, only Lof has performed better. Definitely recommend this strain, which appears to be a standard in the MMJ community.

VI guess, for me, the stumbling block is the word &#39;creative&#39;.  What does anyone mean when they say a strain makes them feel &#39;creative&#39;?  If lovely feelings of euphoria and contentment make you feel creative then this is a perfect strain.  If a good, steady, heady buzz makes you feel creative -- this is your deal.  If a feeling of awe at just how pleasant the world can feel (and we are talking about THIS world, right? THIS fucked up in the extreme world) Thin Mint GSC is the bomb&#39;s bomb.\u000a\u000aBut (ain&#39;t there always a but?) What if you want the uplift but a little less of the expansive headiness? A bit more focus (maybe a lot more focus), say... a bit more eyes-wide-open-in-amazement- at-what-you-just-groked-about-the-Universe... Thin Mint may not be exactly what - it&#39;s California - &#39;the Doctor ordered&#39;...\u000a\u000aNow, I&#39;m here to praise Thin Mint GSC (please don&#39;t stab me). It&#39;s a wonderful strain.  But I don&#39;t really find it condusive to work the way that, say, GG4 is (for me -- it&#39;s my creative day-starter) or Dutch Treat or Blue Dream or White Widow (that lady is special) or even Durban Poison (one of Thin Mint&#39;s components!) -- all strains that deliver a bit more &#39;grit&#39; to the headiness, a little more - focus really is the word. In my cannibis journey, strains like Thin Mint don&#39;t actually make it as Creative strains. To me, they&#39;re more &#39;blissers&#39; -- great (really great) for the end of the day as you decompress and step out from that deep work head -- FROM being creative.\u000a\u000aIf not for feeling like it&#39;s just being advertised incorrectly, I&#39;d give Thin Mint GSC 5 stars.  But I&#39;m weird that way...

Crazy coffee/chocolate minty smell with a heavy pinene influence all about. taste is exactly as it smells and the burn is oh so clean that all you can taste is the flavour and after you exhale you cant help but give a few coughs.... This is defintely a go to for creativity and if you want a good nights sleep after your mind has finished racing for the past few hours.

It was more sweet than it was minty, you got the minty feeling as you inhale. Two hits off of the pipe was good. But sharing 7 fat bowls and 3 blunts with 5 people? It got us all high, and stayed high until later the next day. And we aren&#39;t lightweights. ;)

It wards of the often stressful paranoia and anxiety that can come from Sativas, while maintaining the happiness and enthusiasm, all while relaxing you.

VWhen grown right this strain has all the elements of a true medicinal cali OG, combined with a truly original flavor that must be experienced to understand. The flavor is kush dominant with earthy minty aftertones that somehow never overtake eachother. As you begin to smoke you will notice the incredible smoothness of the mint and then the minimally expansive smoke will caress your brain and body equally with soothing waves of metaphysical bliss. If you can, get some from a reputable dispensary that uses minimal chemicals in production please do. The subtle mint flavor will disappear with a nasty grow ethic. It needs living care to insure the final product is worth it. Lots of cheap nasty attempts in Denver dispensarys. Personal reccomendation, Pink House in Denver can&#39;t be beat on it in rado.

VThe most fun I&#39;ve ever had while smoking- best enjoyed with a friend because you will be overcome with endless laughter. It hits you fast on exhale, and isn&#39;t good for first timers.\u000aVery smooth strain, like chocolate and dirt and a little something minty. As you come down you&#39;ll get very sleepy- gives you some munchies. Minor dry eyes but otherwise I only have good things to say about it. \u000aFull body high and relaxes into your head and muscles. This is a very nice hybrid of you&#39;re seeking relief from medical issues relating to stress, depression, tremors, insomnia, lack of appetite, and ADD.

VMethow Valley Nursery Thin Mint GSC has a very berry fruity smell to it.  More fruity than any other Thin Mint strains I have tried. The high has a big creep to it.  Once it hits you get a very nice body high. This was my first time trying Methow Valley Nursery and I would try it again.  For it being sun grown it&#39;s not that bad of bud. Doesn&#39;t look as pretty as indoor strain would but it comes with a 26.6% THC rating.

VOne of the finest examples of hybrid cannabis\u000a\u000aThin mint gsc is a potent strain with truly powerful hybrid effects. There is strong psychoactivity with this strain, while relaxation eventually sets in later on. The buds of thin mint gsc tend to be smaller, however it more than compensates for this with its ridiculous Trichome coverage and thc content. The  dense buds reek of sweet skunk berry. I purchased a quarter of Cannabiotix thin mint gsc, which has won multiple first place cannabis cups. For those seeking heavy couch lock and minimal mental stimulation, this strain may not be for you.

The high is well balanced between both strain types (sativa/indica). I can just get a good high off .15 if im trying to conserve. Been smoking good quality marijuana for 3 years now and i would highly recommend this strain if its grown right. Mine was top shelf!

VThis strain keeps your mind productive and your body relaxed. However, the bud&#39;s flavor was very strong, and I was at first taken back by the overpowering taste and smell of lavender and sweet sage underneath. So yes, technically, since lavender and sage are in the Mint family, the name is a good match. Overall, it&#39;s a lovely strain.

Vsoooo this was very nice. a slightly sweet smell blends nicely with othet skunky yet earthy aromas. the smoke was smooth and stayed smooth through the joint. the high was felt 5 min after ingestion. sleepy and yet alert, an all around high. first time ive had this strain so im not sure if 1944s version is as good as it gets, but if it is im not dissapointed good stuff guys.

VSIN MINTS: Solidly euphoric, focused, but a bit heady relative to its parent thin mints. It&#39;s got a bit more STANK ON IT, if you know what I mean. Definitely capable of getting out and getting things done, but not while remaining incognito.

VGot some of this top shelf. Have previously had standard GSC, including private reserves, but this stuff is one of the best I&#39;ve ever smoked. There&#39;s no denying the mint. I felt like I&#39;d just brushed my teeth. Very relaxing, very smooth, lived up to the hype.

VI have been trying different strains lately to help manage my back pain, anxiety, and depression. I found that this strain was very strong and helped greatly with my depression, stress, and anxiety. It did help a little with my back pain but not as much as some other strains. The high is very euphoric and relaxed. Overall a very strong strain not for begginers and an excellent day time strain that has an excellent high.

VThin Mint is a perfect &#39;blisser&#39; -- a strain you&#39;d reach for at the end of a working day to transition you from work to sleep (over the course of an evening filled with sparkling conversation, big thoughts, and a lovely, head-filling sense of contentment.  The Durban Poison gives it focus that&#39;s softened to a glorious luster by the OG Kush.  One could go outside and gaze at the stars with an air of profundity... or, just as eaily (and happily) curl up for a nap.  \u000a\u000aThat&#39;s a good strain.  No -- a great one.

VI like to keep a variety of strains on hand, for different moods/projects/whatever. And I gotta say -- the answer to everything, lately, has been Thin Mints. For an experienced smoker, I&#39;ve found that I can rarely get through a bowl before I get involved with something. Might be active, might be couch time -- Thin Mints is the answer!!!
