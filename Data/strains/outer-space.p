VI\u2019ve been trying to stay away from strong sativas lately, as I have noticed I get significantly anxious and don\u2019t always receive the benefits from the high, but Outer Space is the best sativa I have had the pleasure of smoking to date. The high is powerful and true to its name, but I still feel engaged and comfortable around other people, no anxiety attached. It is truly an uplifting strain and while it can feel potent, the high is controllable. This strain is a must!

VJust as the name suggests you definitely space out. Nice strong head change that lasts longer than most strains, however, it is mostly felt in the body. Similar to Herijuna. Relieved the stress in my mind as well in my body. Great for those looking for a strong longer lasting stress and depression relief. Can be too strong for some. I would suggest for a novice user looking for a stronger strain. \u000a\u000aStrain from Silver Sage Wellness Nevada\u000aTHC 23.7%\u000aCBD 0.06%

VBOOM there it is. I&#39;ve almost given up on reviews since I moved to a medical state in it&#39;s infancy, and I came from AZ&#39;s and they have so much out there.  \u000aANYWAY I scored a vape pen for $65 for 500mg (prices are really high rn) and I mostly got it for the strain, Outer Space. Having both parents at different times I figured I&#39;d try it.\u000aThe taste is more skunky like it&#39;s island sweet skunk mother, the energy it gives is AMAZING. It&#39;s so far the 2nd most energizing strain I have had out of 250.\u000aIf you need an energizing but stoney high that gets the creative juices flowing pick up this. \u000aThose without experience with sativa&#39;s already use caution it&#39;s strong and could cause you anxiety.

VStrain was recommended by my budtender and he was absolutely right, this strain is awesome. The smell is a complex sour fruity scent mixed with an island breeze. The taste out of a vape is quite nice as well. Initially the effects were distracting so I just turned some Cudi on and went with it. After one or two songs I really did feel like I was in space. It&#39;s been about 30 mins since then and I&#39;m back in control but I&#39;m definitely higher than I thought I would be. It didn&#39;t add to my anxiety either, I actually think it calmed it down a bit. A must try.

VOuter space -2 puffs of the Cresco OuterSpace Pen-   instantly happier and feeling creative energy flowing. The juices are moving! You can fuel a more relaxing state of mind come over you while keeping a nice cerebral energy. No anxiety created in fact it helps destroy it! This review does not need to be much more I can be short and sweet. This strain is an easy happy creative energy euphoric strain that truly is good for somebody with anxiety as it does not cause any extra anxiety I honestly feel like it calms you at the same time somehow so it\u2019s really nice and I highly recommend this to anybody who has the ability to get their hands on it for some nice daytime relaxing and working

VThis strain is by far the best daytime high.  Opens the mind while still being able to function normally.  Really helped with headaches and neck pain.  It will also give you a bit of energy if you need a little boost.  And if you&#39;re sleepy, you can smoke a bowl before bed and sleep soundly.  Very good medicine.

It&#39;s has a nice even blend and leaves me feeling extremely comfortable.
