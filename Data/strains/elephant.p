VI went from Tropical Living to living in the Pacific Northwest where it rains 300 days a year. My seasonal depression and lack of motivation was a major issue. Elephant is perfect for being productive.

VWorst strain I ever smoked, had to sell it to friend soon after I bought it and smoked some, no relaxation or body high whatsoever and could barely concentrate on any task. Would not recommend at all.
