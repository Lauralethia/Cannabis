VI\u2019m enjoying this strain so much that I don\u2019t even want to type, however now that I am typing, I\u2019m freely and comfortably focused. After cashing a bowl in my pipe, which took about five minutes, I couldn\u2019t feel much. But now that 15 minutes has passed, I\u2019m easily an 8/10 right now.\u000a\u000aIndica effects come on first. Absolute warmth flowing through like I\u2019ve never experienced - and I\u2019m outside in the dark of California winter. Sitting down is really what you\u2019ll want to do with this one, but if you need to be upwards then you can do that as well, just very noodle-like. The sativa effects are more dormant until about +15-20 minutes. For me, the head high is present but moderately relaxing. No euphoria, definitely no anxiety or fear to accompany you. Completely coherent, just exceptionally relaxed and slightly uplifted in mood. \u000a\u000aI sense I may want to munch with this one, but what strain doesn\u2019t make me want to munch? I feel like I could take a nap if I wanted to, but I\u2019m not sleepy per se. But once again, the warmth is what is dominant to me. Definitely would be good as a muscle relaxing strain, as well as even one for when you have a cold.\u000a\u000aAll in all, this gets the full five stars. A genuine hybrid with the best of both worlds, without the overpowering effects of something a strain like Gorilla Glue #4 would leave. If you see this around, try it out and tell us if you think it\u2019s a contender in the world of hybrids!

VEveryone is different and just because I had a bad experience with this strain doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t see the potential in it. Also, i should note that I am very new to this and it&#39;s possible that my tolerance level is very low and mixed with this potent strain was simply a recipe for disaster. It was recommended to me for my anxiety and it really only heightens my stress/paranoia levels. It acts VERY quickly and I seem to get really bad headaches with this strain. I do notice that the arthritis in my hip is toned down a little bit after smoking. Thinking my low tolerance was to blame, I had smoked it on several occasions to give it a chance but even the good trips were not that good - my heart rate skyrockets and I can&#39;t relax or find sleep. The only thing that seems to take me away from the moment is intercourse which, oddly, is fantastic.

VWent for an early morning trip to a new dispensary and was recommended this strain to help ease pain, help deal with insomnia and overall chill out. My s/o took to this strain immediately mentioning that they felt calmer, more relaxed, moderately tingly but more at ease. Highly recommended to combat sleeplessness, anxiety, depression and similar disorders.

VI love this strong strain. it gives you such a good feeling but for a brief period of time. I love how smooth of a transition it is and how much it helps with social anxiety! the only reason it&#39;s not a 5 star, is because it really only lasts for about an hour and a half tops. it&#39;s very smooth going in but pretty harsh when you exhale. but it&#39;s probably in my top ten favorite strains

Vwhite fire alien og... my favorite by far! Grown by raven grass in olympia wa this strain is seriously awesome. The flowers arent super dense, but thats perfect because it leaves more room for resin production... and these buds are frosty! Super stoney affects that lead to incredible euporia. The peak effects seem to last twice as long as all other strains. When vaped, the taste is spicy, piney, and woodsy. You can deffinately tase the OG genetics. Pick some up at the novel tree in bellevue and see for yourself!

VI was impressed with this strain. Very smooth when smoked in a joint or a bong. Very potent. Long lasting effects. Also makes excellent concentrates and edibles. This is one of my favorite strains, and it&#39;s also one I gave a rare rating of 5/5 stars, which I have done only 2 times before.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has chronic pain or migraines. It is also good for musical creativity if you are so inclined.

VHad a very great taste to it, and is great for relaxing, I wouldn&#39;t take this and do anything other than sit. It&#39;s leafy and brakes apart easy, but is pretty strong anyway. It does have pretty bad case of dye eyes but I&#39;m too relaxed to have a problem with it, but once your eyes hit the TV you will be in chillverse
