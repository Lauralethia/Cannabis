VFor me, the best results came from hitting this flower out of a bong. I ground up just enough for a nice bowl, and sprinkled the kief right on top of the bowl. The effects were almost immediate, and lasted a little for a good while. It made me super focused and driven. I wanted to keep moving and doing tasks. I was pretty much oblivious to everything around. \u000a\u000a\u000a

VWow the herbal musky taste and the smell similar to incense I spot on. Definite uplifting sativa effects. A little short lasting but overall a pretty decent strain. The biggest reason to try this strain would be the aroma/taste, not the high.

VWow! this is a REALLY great strain and super potent.\u000a\u000aReally nice pine/sage and hits nice.... Easy on the lungs, &quot;taking 2 ft bong hits&quot;.\u000a\u000a\u000aStarts with a lot of energy and creeps into a very stoney head high with total relaxation but still enough to be up in at em.  \u000aA weekend strain for sure...\u000a\u000aJoint pain turns to warm tingles.\u000aZero paranoia, and and you will either be focused on one thing or zone....\u000aDefinitely will turn on the &quot;No F!0ks to give&quot; button in your head.. as well.\u000a\u000aI can see why the price for the strain is high....and well worth it. \u000a\u000aThis is now my 2nd favorite overall strain!\u000a\u000aPurchased from Desert Rose in North Phoenix, Az.

VHands down this is the best Sativa I\u2019ve ever tried. Of course it\u2019ll vary betwixt users, but this one is best for me. I would recommend this to anyone. It instantly washes away stress and anxiety which lead to a lot of conversation. If ya know me, I\u2019m the quiet type so a lengthy conversation rarely involves me, unless it\u2019s Cannabis, music, art, or  Cannabis...&#128527;

VLove this. It helps with my MS muscle spasms and my nerve pain from Trigeminal Neuralgia. It definitely gives me a boost of energy.  I use a Kandy Pen for my dry herb so I don\u2019t think I get the actual aroma or true taste of it all.
