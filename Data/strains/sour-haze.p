VI suffer from acute and chronic pain : past history of GI cancer , Sugical intervention , spinal stenosis, and PTSD , GAD and anorexia nervosa (no fancy acronym for that) for these I medicate for. \u000aCurrently my doctors are unable to control the nerves (including pain) in my lower back, which is really painful. And I&#39;ve been seriously depressed.  I had a small dab of Sour Haze and my depression was gone ! Dab #2 (and these are small  .125 perhaps) I had forgotten the searing pain in my legs. Third dab and I could listen to music and vacuum my home... Happily.  I did not get munchies (but I expected that I was looking for something to help me with my depression and pain) I did however text and DM a bunch of people I haven&#39;t in a while and talked way to much ! I love  every second of Sour Haze . You can look forward to getting a bit dizzy, this did lift me WAY out of serious depression. It&#39;s not for bedtime unless you can sleep on a true sativa. If you want a sativa that will bring joy back to your life or a really smooth, energetic head (with a creeper of a little indica for pain relief and less racing thoughts) but enjoy that feeling only a haze can provide scoop up Sour Haze.  I am so exited to get to sleep so I can wake and dab this !! This is worlds better than Prozac !!!

VThis strain is amazing I gig the Sour D crossed with a Haze that says its unknown but this is energetic, has a long saliva buzz with no anxiety, pain, and anxiety melt away like left out butter while this strain is loved by women for cramps, and if they are unhappy one would love to get them feeling better S they should come first, unless you have a child and you better know and understand children need their mother and its also good for dye pressure and glaucoma as well as I&#39;ve beard pee whose doctors called them ADD which I don&#39;t believe that this special plant can be so rewarding, non pain pills needed and puff tough and insomnia is a thing if the past, but I prefer dabs Blackberry Kush and that old Afgani.  Haven&#39;t had any Lebenese blonde since beginning of July.  That&#39;s goodnight and i consumer ateast one gram of tested spatter and wax a day for ailments.

Vwas a good vapor experience... I had major problems with crams in my lower back... I got a vapor cartridge in this sour Haze... was very very good. had it running in my box mod. when I felt a pain full twitch I just hit my pen an bamm. Instant relief... I highly recommend if u want that instant relief. I got a higher watt in my box mod to get me a major hit... an adjustment as I needed. the cartridge was a half gram an lasted about four days of medicine. I definitely am goin to try an get this in shatter form or wax... I know I&#39;m d\u000agoing to need later on so it&#39;s best to keep I my medicine cabinet.

When I first hit the blunt, I got lowkey dizzy and my head felt a little bit heavier. But after 2-3 min. my surrounding started to feel mich clearer.

VPeople forget that different strains effect people differently. SHZ is a sativa strain and is not &#39;usually&#39; going to give you the &quot;head&quot; high. A lot of reviews here mention they wanted a more heady high. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re going to want to go go for an Indica dominant hybrid or a straight up Indica. personally, I like using this gor work at the computer.
