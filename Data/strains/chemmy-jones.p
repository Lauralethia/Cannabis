VI found Chem Jones to be a powerful sativa.  Relaxing yet doesn&#39;t couch lock, mind numbing is a very accurate description.  The smell/taste was that of dirt, earthy.  Not the prefer temp profile but it&#39;s really not bad, easy to get used too.

VPicked some up today from my local rec.  they had it listed at 35 percent.  It did not dissapoint,  totally heady with lasting effects.  The 1/8 I got came in one solid dense bud, it was sticky and thick with crystals.  The high was extremely  euphoric.

VThis has to be the single strongest strain I have ever tried, period. My friend and I smoked a 3/4 bowl in a steamroller, and I swear I couldn&#39;t talk for the next hour. It was the heaviest high I&#39;ve ever had. This is not a strain for a light buzz, this is the REAL DEAL.

VMy new favorite strain! It&#39;s rare that I choose a strain that I will buy more than three times. The high is incredibly creative and uplifting a dash of euphoria . Whether you&#39;re dancing somewhere to some great music,doing a lot of work Or meditating...it certainly has a body high as well, not at all a couch lock kind though ... The smell is very full bodied and very strong wonderful &#39;.. taste is always something I look forward to ,a wonderful treat  !

VThis strain comes on so strong that, if you&#39;re as sensitive to weed as I am, you have to be really careful about how much you use. If you get it right, the high can be fun and relaxing. If you get it wrong, you just might be making imaginary journeys from the desert of your belly to the lush and wild jungle of your brain (yes, it sounds absurd, but I literally spent a half hour having a delusion that I had to travel from my belly to my brain and there were different geographical features in between). My wife is jealous of the hallucinations, but I don&#39;t really find them all that amusing until after I sober up.

VChemmy Jones has an incredibly potent aroma. Heavy &amp; penetrating. It is tasty in a pipe but I loved it in a bong. Tastes like blood on rubber to me, but faded down and not pungent to the tongue. Springy buds. Not rock dense in presentation, but nicely filled out.\u000aWhat I love about it is the slow lift that all of a sudden pops you to the peak. Very smooth. I cough on gas usually, but chemmy is smooth.\u000aI had a neck &amp; shoulder muscle tension  headache and now it&#39;s gone. My eyes aren&#39;t red, but they are very glassy. I&#39;m alert, but feel very relaxed. Jumping up might make you dizzy a sec, but it rights itself out. I can whip through chores with no problem.\u000a This might sound weird but my hearing seems more amplified. Every bird note, distant dog bark, and car ...\u000aNegatives: your eyes can be squinty. Eyedrops a must. Dry mouth alert.\u000aOtherwise, I cannot recommend this more.

VChemmy Jones offers such a relaxing high. It provided some relief from my neck &amp; back pain, but more importantly really enabled me to completely destress. Often high THC strains make me feel very self-conscious &amp; hyper focused on negative thoughts. Chemmy Jones, by contrast, melted all thoughts away. Additionally, it enabled me to be productive mentally. I do development for a living &amp; had been struggling with a technical glitch for quite some time. I took a few hits of Chemmy and was able to focus and actually solve the problem. I found that Chemmy also brought me more emotional peace. I really recommend Chemmy Jones if you&#39;re looking to shed your worries but maintain function.

VWhere to start. I love the flavor, though my partner hates it. It wakes me up, it shoots me up with energy and creativity. I smoked a bowl this morning and then wrote a lesson plan... but now I&#39;m shaky and kind of cracked out so I need some indica. I&#39;m going to buy this again because the motivation was top notch, but I think I gotta mix it with some cbd to keep the anxiety away.

The buds are tiny little popcorn sized and I had never heard of the strain, but I couldn&#39;t pass it up.\u000a\u000aThe smell is strong - pine, tea and flowers maybe - and the smoke if pretty smooth. The high is very uplifting and energetic so far. It is certainly not top shelf, but I am looking forward to making it my daily smoke for the next few weeks.

Also went on a field trip to a childrens musem and after ingesting a tea mixture I made myself. Experience was lifechanging. I have fallen inlove with life all over again. would highly consider purchasing multiple shake combos in the furture. ONCE I GET a Cali Crusher Homegrown!.\u000a\u000amore review later I&#39;m to high right now. . . hehehehehe\u000a \u000aUpon futher smoking I began relaxing deeper and deeper into my body.
