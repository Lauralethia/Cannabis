VI brought these seeds to Colorado about 10 years ago, purchased from Marc Emery&#39;s seedbank in Vancouver. Extremely frosty buds, soaring high, and a buzz that made me stupid.\u000a\u000aThe craziest thing about the plants that my friend grew out, is that the main kola on one of the them was MASSIVE, the size of a peewee league football. As beautiful as it was, I pushed my buddy to remove the kola a little early because I was convinced that something that large would mold from the center outward. I was right, as we lost roughly 20% that we removed when we cut open the beast. But the rest was o-so-tasty.\u000a...MJ Odingreen
