VLaughed my ace off after smoking this, both my friend &amp; I enjoyed this strain. Although after a few days of smoking this the effects seem less &amp; less, I love mixing strains in a bowl tho &amp; this was a nice one for that.

VNice. Relaxing. I tend toward anxiety. This is a god head high but doesn&#39;t bring on anxiety.

VThe perfect balance between active and mellow. A very relaxed and mellow body vibe. It works perfectly with the active and chatty head buzz. You won&#39;t be getting a lot done but you won&#39;t be falling asleep either. Surrender to the sensations.

VVery citrusy on the palatte, but not very effective in terms of mental or body high. I felt like I had to smoke 3 spliffs just to get high. 3 stars because it had a good flavor and wasn&#39;t too harsh on my throat.

VDidn&#39;t do much for me. Smoked a J on new year&#39;s and I had a good time but I wasn&#39;t as high as I was planning to be. Probably would be better to buy the best quality to get the best effects from this strain.

VI feel like this is an indica-dominant hybrid strain. Always makes me relax and sometimes ends up in couch-lock.

VI really gotta try Afghani by itself one of these days, it&#39;s in practically everything. The Sativa half made me just bust out laughing watching funny clips on YouTube and the Indica half made sure I got some great sleep last night. Pick it up if you find it.

VI only took 3 hits from a pipe and I was hella high. I took it with a friend but we had totally different effects. I felt really awake and happy, but she was super tired and relaxed. We were both laughing way too hard at random things. The smell isn&#39;t that strong, but it&#39;s weird. The lingering smell doesn&#39;t really smell like weed, I have no idea how to describe it but when I was high, I was convinced it smelled like &quot;woven baskets.&quot; Overall, it&#39;s a good strain, but it makes it easy to get anxious/paranoid, so be careful.

VPart of the deal at Main Street on October 15th, low THC at 15%. Light yet robust green with nice crystals and subtle citrus is fragrant through the plastic pouch. A nice few nugs from Spark farms. \u000a\u000aA super mellow high. An intense bud, yet meelllow. I could handle this at work or before social gathering. That usually means a heavier Indica dominance, in my favor. Again, for me, a lower THC means this is a good strain for me to have WITH OTHER strains as well. After a few days of smoking lower % , the affects are lost and then I feel a bit wasteful with the medicine.
