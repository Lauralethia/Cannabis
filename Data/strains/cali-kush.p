VMy friend and I smoked this mixed with a bit of some other sativa out of a bong. It was crazy, the highest I&#39;ve ever been in my life. I was just sitting there in the car, thinking. My thoughts were insane and I made all these realizations that don&#39;t even make sense to me now that I&#39;m sober. I didn&#39;t necessarily feel happy, just really relaxed and at peace. I was super giggly and my friend and I laughed so hard at random things, it was great. Just like a little break from real life and myself. The only bad experience I had was I felt like the high would never go away. Time went slow and I was worried I wouldn&#39;t ever be able to drive home. This paranoia was only heightened when my friend told me that his dealer told him that Cali Kush mixed with a potent sativa (which we did) would keep you high for a week. This obviously isnt true but I was sooo freaked out. But eventually the high did wear off and I would definitely recommend it.

VGo get this bud at LivWell in their Leafs By Snoop section, this bud is amazing. Smokes great, looks beautiful for a small nugged indica, and has a perfect earthy/citrus smell to it. Normally not too big on &quot;Kush&quot; named buds but this tops any I&#39;ve smoked. Definitely a night time bud tho.

VGreat-And-Powerful Potent Strain. Plump Dense Buds Loaded With Trichromes. This is a Earthy, Cheese Smelling Strain with A Deliciously Sweet Taste. Great For Pain and Anxiety With An Overall Calming Effect. Great for Night Time Use As It Is An Indica-Dominant although There is Said To Be A Sativa-Dominant Strain A Well As Taking Into Effect Every Strain, Although The Same Strain, Are All Different. Definitely Recommend Phantom Strain&#39;s Cali Kush. Amazingly Cured.

VI love it seriously if your dealer got some try it. I buy 19.7 g for 90$ (yeah bitch I live in Quebec haha) I took between 8 and 12 hit from the bong and I had a pretty trip for a good hour but no longer than that (because I smoke a lot lol) and this kind is pretty amazing, because after 2-3 hit you feel a good sativa buzz, feels like ready to work but after 7-8-9 other hit you will be just soo fucking high cauz its still a big indica domiant (in my case). During the first 10-15 min I was totally lost but feel fucking relaxed. Soo this is my personal review enjoy my friend and flyhigh brothers.

VWow-- I took one hit off a select strains C02 cartridge before taking a walk.  I got about a block from my house and felt an intense need to get right to my couch.  I walked home, forgot how to open our gate, ate all the Chex party mix that we made for a Christmas party, then sat down.... and the carpet started to move and make shapes.  I saw faces, the sound from our speakers made pulsing waves of color...  Seriously, I have never been so high in my life, let alone off of one hit. For me, the is NOT a daytime strain (lesson learned).  I think it could make some paranoid.  This felt much more like the wild ride of a hallucinogen, so beware!  And have fun!

Vit def will have you relaxed &amp; mello . If you&#39;re walking, take it slow cause it&#39;ll make you dizzy. Def keep something to drink with you cause you&#39;ll get caught with bad dry mouth which might cause you to become paranoid .

VFirst smoke and I was like &quot;Woooooow&quot;. Instant relaxation followed by a very uplifted mood. It&#39;s a very euphoric smoke. A strange hybrid due to the fact it feels like an indica high but you do not get sleepy, at least not early on. I guess the sativa properties of the hybrid keep you awake (although there isn&#39;t much of a &quot;head&quot; high or energy spark you usually get from a sativa strain.) Bud is beautiful, light green colour with bright orange hairs. This is sold under a few names... mine being OG Kali Kush, which hands down is the best OG hybrid ever!\u000a\u000aUPDATE: After a few weeks of smoking this strain I noticed my anxiety spiked up... A no go for me now.

VGreat Strain. Would almost describe the high as a drunken psychedelic state. Left me incredibly social and spacey. Great on the body as well. My entire body felt like and floaty. The smell of the Bud was amazing. Piney and pungent. Can&#39;t wait to smoke this one again.

VGrown near San Fransisco, my stash is a slightly higher potency(15-18% thc) and definitely a sativa dominant phenotype. Very dense budz. Some measure 5-6 grams. Sweet woody taste. High can be day or evening. No couch lock. Sativa feel for entire high with indica characteristics existing as you settle in. Feels like a tuesday afternoon at Zuma Beach with nothing to do but live.

VWow-- I took one hit off a select strains C02 cartridge before taking a walk.  I got about a block from my house and felt an intense need to get right to my couch.  I walked home, forgot how to open our gate, ate all the Chex party mix that we made for a Christmas party, then sat down.... and the carpet started to move and make shapes.  I saw faces, the sound from our speakers made pulsing waves of color...  Seriously, I have never been so high in my life, let alone off of one hit. For me, the is NOT a daytime strain (lesson learned).  I think it could make some paranoid.  This felt much more like the wild ride of a hallucinogen, so beware!  And have fun!

I buy 19.7 g for 90$ (yeah bitch I live in Quebec haha) I took between 8 and 12 hit from the bong and I had a pretty trip for a good hour but no longer than that (because I smoke a lot lol) and this kind is pretty amazing, because after 2-3 hit you feel a good sativa buzz, feels like ready to work but after 7-8-9 other hit you will be just soo fucking high cauz its still a big indica domiant (in my case). During the first 10-15 min I was totally lost but feel fucking relaxed. Soo this is my personal review enjoy my friend and flyhigh brothers.

VGreat-And-Powerful Potent Strain. Plump Dense Buds Loaded With Trichromes. This is a Earthy, Cheese Smelling Strain with A Deliciously Sweet Taste. Great For Pain and Anxiety With An Overall Calming Effect. Great for Night Time Use As It Is An Indica-Dominant although There is Said To Be A Sativa-Dominant Strain A Well As Taking Into Effect Every Strain, Although The Same Strain, Are All Different. Definitely Recommend Phantom Strain&#39;s Cali Kush. Amazingly Cured.

With all the good parts of an indica, including a solid body high, I&#39;m feeling the woodsy smokiness but I&#39;d love more complexity because there&#39;s a strange evenness to it all. It silences my mind but not in the way a good short story by Margaret Atwood does or a new Beyonc&#233; song with its populist air around a subversive nugget.\u000a\u000aI feel at peace, even away from my gods, having found another faith.
