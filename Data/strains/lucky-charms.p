VBeautiful strain. When smoking it tends to make me just sit back and jam some King Tubby dub reggae and enjoy every last bit of it. I&#39;m not experienced or by any means a guru when it comes to Lucky Charms. But the last eighth I had was killer. I got some great shots of it too.

VLucky Charms stands for its name as a hybrid. I felt a warm relief in the back of my head that eased me into a cerebral buzz for the Sativa side of things. However, on the other side of the hybrid, it gave me an intense body relaxation, where it put me right into my chair. Some times I got one side of the hybrid more than the other.

VPicked up a 0.5g w/ kief joint for $5 from Seattle Tonics. Shared, but still very powerful. Felt really nice and dreamy. One of those creative stains where thoughts transition seamlessly and you get caught in a few cloudy day dreams. The body high seemed to creep up but was never too strong.

VThought I would make a Cereal Reference based on the older commercials I grew up with, but that would not describe this strain.  If your a thrill seeking adrenaline junkie 18-30 years of age... you will become emotionally involved with this strain. Goddess Hybrid is really Goddess Sativa in disguise.  Walking against the wind on my way to the taco shop was a mildly psychedelic experience. This flower does not creep, instantaneous effects to the head and chest with the first super piney toke.  That&#39;s where the drawback came in... referring to the chest.  There was some anxiousness and racey heart.  Not my absolute go to strain.  If you have this back in day it would be argued that you had the &quot;Kind Bud&quot;.  Don&#39;t do anything complicated on this strain, just the goddess take you on a Fantastic Voyage.

VI&#39;ve never found a strain yet that has such a short production time. Past strains I&#39;ve used took way too long to reach any kind of effect, but this, you take 3 hits and you&#39;re good. I really love seeing the components of this, as I wasn&#39;t familiar with lucky charms prior to. And I love that it is really useful in depression/anxiety. This is by far the best strain to help with daily issues I struggle with.

Which note do I listen to? &#129300; Screw you &quot;don&#39;t write a review note&quot;, you&#39;re not the boss of me!!\u000a\u000aokay-- so Lucky Charms is a bit on the potent side. if you&#39;re a novice smoker, I would start off small.\u000a\u000aThat said, make sure you don&#39;t miss out! lucky charms took a minute to feel for me (I contemplated taking a second bong hit -- glad I waited a little) but once it kicked in, it is incredible! I feel a nice body high in all limbs but I&#39;m still able to stand up/etc. Couchlock is not very strong (currently doing dishes/laundry). I was also exhausted before smoking but I&#39;m pleasantly awake now.\u000a\u000aThe head high brings a nice, relaxing pressure all over my head. I&#39;m dancing around my kitchen singing reggae music to my cat and he seems very confused. Even though I feel clear headed and active, I&#39;m thinking this strain is likely best for relaxing inside with some music, video games, etc. I don&#39;t have a whole lot else to say other than try this strain!

VI got the chance to try a little bit of this strain, and I was really excited because the name got me thinking of sweetness and milky goodness. The buds were dense and very frosty, mostly dark green. The smell was very light and faint at first, but I only had a nug or so to work with so that may be why. Once ground the smell was citrusy with some exotic spice and herbal tones. The taste was unlike any strain I&#39;ve had before. There was almost a menthol coldness to it that lasted for a while after exhale. The taste was very uniquely spicey and herbal, possibly sage and eucalyptus? There are also hints of tropical fruit. The smoke can be pretty overwhelming if you let it. As for the high, it was really stoney at first. More so in your head than your body, although your body does feel deeply relaxed. Made me feel like I was in a different state of mind for sure, less like weed and more like some other drug I&#39;ve never taken. I was melty and like jello. The night was really beautiful, and I felt like I was in a cabin in the woods somewhere. I&#39;m not sure if this strain will have the same effect on the next time I smoke it, but so far so good. Very imaginative and creative.
