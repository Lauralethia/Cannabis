VNice strong citrus scent with hazey undertones, but not a citrus taste? Quite creamy actually. Pretty tight buds for a strongly sativa dominant strain and highly coated with crystal.\u000aVery good example of a typical sativa high, reminiscent of the famous Kali Mist I remember smoking 20 yrs ago in the Damp Kring in Amsterdam &#128074;&#127995;boom. Nice high rather than stone, clear piercing high that\u2019s felt in the head and you can hear it piercing through your ears with a wave of electricity to the mind. \u000aFinishes with a mellow contented feeling that hangs for a while.\u000aAll in all a top example of sativa. \u000aLemon meringue makes your mind go bang.

VNothing pleases more than when a flower lives up to its name. This citrus and sweet strain does just that. At first, there is the comforting familiarity of lemon peels, but later giving way to sweet and nutty tastes and aroma from its cookies and cream parents no doubt. A fairly contained cerebral euphoria keeps you uplifted while on your way to the fridge to satisfy a spell of the munchies. A most definite crowd pleaser for those suffering from headaches. Have a slice and enjoy.

VAmazingly uplifting!!  But that&#39;s &quot;just as advertised&quot; for this wonderful strain.  What it does do for me that I wasn&#39;t prepared for is it completely resolves any hunger issues I may be having, which is a daily struggle for me.  And oddly enough it&#39;s my go to strain when I needed to increase hunger without drowsiness.  For me it rivals some of the pure Indicas that are widely used for just this purpose except you usually have to also take the Indica couch lock... But not with Lemon Meringue!!!\u000aThere also were no racing thoughts like some Sativa&#39;s cause, very creative, positive, uplifting thoughts!!  \u000aOf you do medicate late in the evening, no worries, take it slow and mellow and you&#39;ll drift off nicely, sometimes with very interesting dreams.\u000aI greatly recommend it for everyone&#39;s cabinet!!!

VI would pay good money for a candle that smells like the vapor of this. It&#39;s a beautiful lemon, floral vapor that coats your mouth in thick terpenes.\u000a\u000aThe high is very strong and super uplifting, clear headed, and motivating. I took one hit of this when I was exhausted after a workout and it brought my energy back and got me fluttering around the house, cleaning things up. A great daytime strain when you need to be getting stuff done.\u000a\u000aWord of warning for those sensitive to sativas though -- when I took my second hit I got some anxiety and my wife got overstimulated and anxious from one hit. Definitely still something I&#39;d go back to in moderation, but be careful with dosing if you&#39;re prone to anxiety.

VLemon &#127819; from the bright, citrus aroma, meringue from the sweet, smooth draw. This sativa is the delicious moment that first bite of the perfect pie touches your eager papillae, in a full body experience. Not different than a sugar rush, Lme may bring about slight headaches. Serving spacy realness, this strain is clutch for skygazing or Planet Earth vibes.

VTasty and wonderful. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a bud that tasted just like it\u2019s name, but it smokes great and is very activity driven, as most people have said. I do feel the anxiety creeping, but I think getting lost in a game is where this strain excels.

VI thought this strain was going to taste &amp; smell more like the lemon/citrus combo that is common. But, it was a bit more mellow making it lemon/citrus minus the pungent. Cookies &amp; Cream takes sum of the edge off of Lemon Skunk (parents). Buds were dense for a Sativa &amp; had a couple of different shades of green that were covered in a ton of fine trichomes. Buds had only a few amber colored pistils. The get up &amp; go of this Sativa only got me to get up (without the go) meaning the effects were not overwhelming like some Sativa&#39;s can be. A &quot;four star&quot; slice of mellow meringue pie, enjoy!

VI\u2019m extremely impressed with this Sativa strain. I got all of the positive effects of Sativa and no paranoia or racing heart. The smell is very enticing! Citrus and lemony for sure. Some people commented that it didn\u2019t smell so good or that it smelled like \u201cClorox\u201d. She\u2019s probably thinking of the yellow lemon scented ones. No complaints from me. Helped me feel less social anxiety and I was even more talkative and happy. I usually don\u2019t talk much so this is great!! 10/10 would order again. But I\u2019m on to new strains for now!!

VIt\u2019s great for going to bed. I try to smoke it and I nod off like I\u2019m on pain pills. I can\u2019t stay awake on it. I feel so lazy. I bought a bunch, So now if I can\u2019t sleep I smoke it before bed and I pass out in 15 minutes. It taste really good but all the other garbage. Nope. No motivation, no energy. What a joke.
