VThis strain is now on my top 5 hyrid strains to get. After first hit you feel a little energetic and then you feel the indica side kick in to totally relax your body. LA Woman is good for pain and stress, and good for when your at work. A++ To Green Stop in Colorado.

VThis stuff is pretty good. The nugs are a dark green color. The smell that comes from them when you break it up is a lemony smell. When you hit it, it doesn&#39;t have a very strong taste like the smell. The effects start in about 2 minutes after smoking. It&#39;s a fairly smooth smoke. You begin to feel spaced out and relaxed. Your eyes feel relived of pressure as well. After an hour, you begin to feel like your coming down, which is accompanied by a heavy feeling of hunger. Good strain for nighttime use.
