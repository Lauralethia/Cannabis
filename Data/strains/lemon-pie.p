VOnly gave three stars because it was super dry and burned way too fast.  I think I paid mainly for the name attached to the strain rather than the quality of the flower itself. I&#39;d only buy this again in a pinch.

VHoly fuck the high I received from this strain has yet to be beaten by any other strain; solely based on the crazy euphoria I received from it. I have no idea why the euphoria rating is so low but that needs to change.

VThis is good stuff.  Lately my tolerance has been through the roof but this one had me feeling exremely happy and incredibly horny.  Slight citrus flavor with some sweetness but it&#39;s kinda tough to nail down.  \u000a It&#39;d be wonderful if this one stayed around here for a while because I&#39;d definitely buy it again when I run out which looks like that&#39;ll be real soon because this is really good.

VThis for me is a light strain. It is mostly a light cerebral high.This is not crazy buzzy but it does make you happy, warning it does give the crazy munchies. It has a wonderful lemon smell. The buds are gorgeous with nice orange hair through out the green bud.

VNice fresh flavor. I got a gentle, fresh lemon taste but not much else. Moderate strength. I found the high to be so clear and somewhat generic that I didn&#39;t feel high enough and smoked through this faster than other strains.

VI am very disappointed. Got it as a shatter and  I almost couldn&#39;t feel any effect. Gave it 2 stars for nice retail packaging with &quot;Leafs by Snoop&quot;. It is hard to believe that this could be ever approved by a Master himself.

VIt was on special really cheap @FZT so I bought an eighth and was &quot;sourly&quot; disappointed  (sorry, couldn&#39;t help myself, heh).  Perhaps I just got a bad bunch, not sure though because this was my first time trying it.  Everything about it was weak: the smell, the flavour, even the high was barely noticeable, which for me is unacceptable.  I wish I hadn&#39;t been lured in by the low price deal.  Definitely will not be buying again.
