VAbsolutely mesmerizing high with this strain. A little heady in the beginning which turns into a sedating body high but then it shoots back up into the head with a creative cerebral high. I felt the effects for almost two hours and I am a seasoned smoker so I would not recommend this strain for first time users. Looking forward to seeing this strain around more often.

VTried this today and was pretty impressed. Nice berry smell, and it tastes like a flower garden. It&#39;s very sedating but at the same time energizing. Very nice sativa like buzz, makes me wanna do productive stuff but the indica lingers in the back and I feel lazy too. A lot of euphoria which doesn&#39;t come easy for me with flower. \u000a\u000aI think this would be good for somebody who is depressed. Also someone facing a good deal of fatigue. Especially mental fatigue. It would be a daytime smoke in my opinion.

VWhen I first smoked it I got really high. Huge head high. Intense if you&#39;re not a big smoker :P but I&#39;ve continued to try it and it&#39;s a great, chill high. Makes me feel relaxed and positive.

VPicked up an eighth of this yesterday, nice dense frosty buds. Smells a little sweet, vaped about 0.1g in my Flowerpot at 700, taste is sweeter and a bit like raspberry.\u000a\u000aNice eye slouch, slight body tingle, strangely energizing though. Slight dissociation feelings too.

VToday I smoke a blend called Brian Berry Couch and it was great. I have been in high spirits already for the past couple day so this enhanced euphoria significantly. I danced, I sang, and I had a great idea to start a blog and even researched yearly cost \u000a\u000aOne year ago, I got on a healthy kick yet again after being told by some irrelevant influences that I was so unhealthy. I purchased a expensive waist trainer in the biggest size. I tried it once didn\u2019t get past the first two buttons and gave up. Tonight, I was feeling foggy and I leaped into that damn waist trainer with pride.  Well tried to anyway. That Brian Berry Couch had me laughing through this entire process. Great Strain.

Vyoooooo, this strain is my newest FAV!! Keeps you up, active, talkative and just going. I deal with crippling (and medically diagnosed) social anxiety, depression on a daily basis. I am very sensitive to strains that trigger these side effects- along side paranoia and headaches- and I noticed that this strain didn&#39;t add to these at all. I&#39;m downright surprised and impressed by this strain and suggest patients with a&amp;d give this one a go:) enjoy! \u000a\u000a**medicated by grinding up the flower and rolling into a king cone-very yummy**

VGreat taste and a very mellow high.  While it gets the job done, the high was far less than others we purchased that day.  Mellow flavor, a bit fruity!  The high was very functional and allowed us to enjoy a day of strenuous activities without being funky.  This one came back tested at 14.9% .\u000a\u000aWe asked the guys at Maggies Farm Pueblo East and they suggested this - a good suggestion on their part!

VThis strain definitely tastes like berries and settles in behind the eyes first. It tends to stay there, but you do feel a nice bodily relaxation as well. No real propensity to make me cough, although it is working as a bit of an expectorant (I have the beginnings of what I think is the flu right now).

Vthis strain is super uplifting and produces an energetic high (duh, Space Queen lineage). reminds me of good ol jillybean. I am a research assistant and I enjoy this at work- keeps me focused, I&#39;ll enjoy before a run, or dancing...it&#39;ll also loosen up your muscles.
