VLike 4.8!?! A strain that killllls it!  Live life like it should be after a tough day of work or to enjoy a flick or even outdoors.  Sativa uplift! Not energetic but very happy, certainly not a couch lock but very relaxing and yet motivating feeling!  Muscle relaxant galore ( I have back spasms).  Spacey head high but and leaves muscular skeletal relaxed but not l0cked! A True, true sativa lean hybrid! Very nice-- don&#39;t pass it up! I&#39;ve only found it twice, and second batch has been wonderful!  Smell, earthy sweet; taste is vanilla and sweet/fruity.  Great for depression and muscle spasms *

VReal rating: 3.8 stars. \u000a\u000aI took a while to feel the effects of Thai Lights (around 20 minutes); felt the high mostly in my head at first, and then later on throughout the back length of my body. It all felt like a restful heaviness everywhere, like gravity was kicked up a notch. Very pleasant fruity beer aroma to the flower.
