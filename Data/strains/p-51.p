VThis strain is hands down my favorite. It relaxes the body and the mind. When I first tried it, I was so impressed with how superior it was to other strains - I had to get more. \u000aTo this day it is still my favorite. Great for evening time and a little goes a long way.  One bong hit wait 20 minutes and see for yourself.

VNot too strong. Was wishing for something similar to Headband. But got a weaker body high. Not too tingly or too much pain relief. Took a second to set in but peaked quick. After a few hours on my way back down (I normally stay high for 6+ hrs) So this feels short to me.\u000aGives me a relaxed/rested feel. But not tired. I have energy. Could have been coffee that I had but Im not sure.\u000aSlight body tingle.\u000aSlight pain relief. As in my neck hurts still just a little lessened.\u000aPretty clear in the head. \u000aJust wish for something better.

VHigh just kicked in after 3 bowls. About a Nickle sized thick nug.\u000aMy first time with this type was bad. I didn&#39;t have a high at all. But this time I ground up this nug really good and took some good rips Cough Cough. And I am feeling fine. Good all over body buzz. Im zoned out in my head. Focused on typing this review. I feel care free and slightly lazy/ tired. Munchies yes.\u000aUm I only got a wiff of the smoke. So I did like the smell. Sweeter with earthy. (wood) notes. I tried to say that as fancy as possible. \u000aObviously im pretty baked. I just want some chips and a tv.  \u000aSo a pretty good Nug. Picked it up for 15 per g. And got eyeballed more like 2g. So i scored pretty good on that.\u000a\u000aAlso a slight numbing sensation. And Intense focus.
