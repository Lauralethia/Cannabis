VWilliams wonder is a great strain that manages to hit upon all things that make people want to medicate using marijuana. It is a great hybrid that manages to help your mind and body feel releaxed and at one with eachother. The aroma reminds me of how fresh and fragrant pacific northwest trees smell. The taste is minty and forestry as the scent would imply. I would recommend this strain for anyone that wants the whole package mind and body.

VTurn down the lights, grab the softest blanket you have and turn on an album that you&#39;ve not visited in awhile. Kick back on the couch and literally feel the cushions allow every bit of you to completely drape and melt away, all while still feeling smart enough to navigate a hedge maze. Remember that thing that was aching a little bit ago? Neither do I....\u000aFor someone who often times enjoys only Indica this hybrid offers up one of the best fuzzy-warm feelings and carefree intellect I could ask for past 9pm. Nothing but high fives for this strain. From the aesthetic of it, taste of it and smell of it along with the beautiful ability to temporarily cure me of the long list of self diagnosed mishaps. Dig it. \u000a

VThis is an amazing strain that I happened to snag a couple of buds from a grower friend of mine. I medicated with one nug, about a nickle sized nugget of goodness, and for the first 25 minutes all I could think - literally - was HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!! This was a spectacular trip that instantly melted away all pain/cares/concerns within 3 minutes of exhale...2 minutes later I was flying. This initial &quot;trippy&quot; part was extremely enjoyable and smoothly transitioned into over an hour of jamming on my guitar to music I&#39;ve never played to before, then a chill faze that lasted me throughout the night (I woke to pee and was still lifted) that had faded by the morning. No residual effects that I have occasionally experienced with the stronger strains like this either.

VClassic Indica, these buds should have thick clusters of long orange/red hairs, medium amount of frost, and very smooth distinct Earth aroma and flavor. \u000a     ***LEAFLY; CORRECTION NEEDED IN DESCRIPTION*** &quot;Williams Wonder&quot; and &quot;Willys Wonder&quot; are two different strains. &quot;Willys wonder&quot; was exclusivly devolped for Wille Nelson, i believe he holds a pattent or trademark rights to it. Now, the true original &quot;Williams Wonder&quot; was devolped in beautiful Jackson County, OR, in the tiny town of Williams, Oregon. Which is just down the road from another famous town for growing: Applegate, OR. This superb growing climate is located at the very Northern tip of the world renown Emerald Triangle. As Triangles go, you get better as you get to the top, and Oregons part of the triangle is FAR superior to Californias portion of the Triangle!!!

V+_#(#(WilliamsWonder)#)#_+\u000a\u000a&gt;&gt; Dam, about 2 weeks ago after getting a bag of a few 2g nugs i was overjoyed to hear that i was WilliamsWonder. Let me tell ya, it shure was wonderful. After an extreme head, and body high i was exhaused. If you wanna do some serious relaxing, chilling, music jamming, or traveling this is the weed for you. Williams wonder was potent, and didn&#39;t mess around. If you can get your hands on some its worth the purchase.\u000a\u000a++Note I didn&#39;t find the picture, and for future people reading my journal entries. I will only post pictures of weed that i have taken myself.

VI&#39;m am attempting to write this review whilst under the influence of this marvelous gift from another .......realm?....The couch lock is EXTREME! Most defiantly a before bed med. I feel like I have a case of the stupids going on...... a strong heavy headed feeling. Immediate pain relief that lasted for 3 plus hours. The come down was sharp which was fine because it only takes 2 bong rips to get back on track again. very potent. 1 hit to many... OK. 2 hits to many.....worry. 3 hits to many......omg. I stick with 3 hits then repeat the process.....every hour give or take 5 or 10 minuets. Depends on the amount of down time available. Is not advisable to operate any machinery capable of maiming or harming anything or anybody. Living in the desert, it felt very nice to go outside during the day and relax. During which time, the high felt mildly Trippy.  Small amount of color distortion.

VThis strain is the fork in the road, in the sense that it&#39;s not great.. but it&#39;s not terrible either. It&#39;s an indica strain that is good for new smokers who want to feel relaxed without being too sleepy. It&#39;s not the best quality bud around, but it&#39;s the best to have a bulk of to spread out the better quality bud you may have. It&#39;s good for relaxing after work, helping with minor pains in the shoulders and feet. It also effects your head with a calming feeling after it wears off. Willy&#39;s Wonder is the just basic weed.

VHardcore Indica.  Easily the equal of Northern Lights, but puts you down with more of a bat upside the head than a feather pillow.\u000a\u000aSweet and... well, tangy? This Wonder creeps a tad, but buckle up for the long run, because the body effects have LEGS.  Good mellow euphoric head effects, perfect for zoning out at the end of a long hard day.\u000a\u000aWarning:  NOT FOR THE NEW USER.\u000a\u000aThis stuff is very strong and easily has the heaviest body effects of any strain I&#39;ve tried yet.  Other reviews speak of staggering around and that&#39;s pretty damn accurate.\u000a\u000aThe upside is that there is no let-down or hangover present here.  Very clean, very enjoyable and does it&#39;s job equally as well as the toxic crap your doctor is trying to hook you on.  You&#39;re not going to stress, worry or feel pain with William&#39;s Wonder.\u000a\u000aYou are, however, going to eat EVERYTHING within reach, your kitchen, your neighbors house... presuming you can get up to begin with.\u000a\u000aForm:  Concentrate (HYH Society Shatter)\u000aTokes/Hits to effect: 2 to 3\u000aTaste: Sweet/Tangy\u000aCough Level:  Did I just take a hit or not?

VOld school Afghani. Batch i sampled didn&#39;t really appeal to my senses at all. I tend to like the more sour, earthy, and fruity notes. Spicy, woody and herbal on this one, effects are there but not super strong. Nice for sessions i would imagine (or for making hash). At first i thought this would be Willie Nelsons strain...because its been around for so long and i figured an old head like him would appreciate it, but its not. He actually has one named after him though. Hopefully if i try this again it&#39;s different.

I instantly regretted taking 2 hits when I realized I had to get some things done 4 hours later. I was too worried I would not be able to do them since I was just locked in a chair. I would not recommend using this strain unless it is bed time. The smell is great! It smells of pine forests.

VI tend to favor Indica&#39;s so this was exactly what I wanted and expected. 40 shades of green on the buds. Sweet/Fruity aroma with a hint of subtle earthiness. Tastes just as good, and comes on strong. Strong couch-lock but still functional if you truly need to be. Nice and relaxing, do recommend &#127788;&#127794;

VMeh. Had some fun on this but this is not a strain I will be back for. From a recreation opinion it was fun but also sleepy. From a medical standpoint it didn&#39;t help with the headache neck pain I was having. For some reason this strain makes it hard for me to fall asleep, just kind of an awake zombie for hours all night. Dry eyes n mouth.. I can think of so many strains that are more enjoyable for me from a recreational and medical standpoint. \u000a\u000aGive me a good sativa or sativa dominant strain. it&#39;s like the only indica strain I think is good is Blueberry. Happy hunting.

Vnow for me coming across Willy&#39;s wonder (William&#39;s wonder) at my usual dispensary it really made a statement first glance. From that harvest, the jar was full of beautifully grown dense flowers with various shades of green. With a layer of trichomes the smell was almost kissing you as I leaned in to get an idea one the aroma. Sweet with hints of citrus undertones but still a bit floral. I&#39;ve never had this so had to go off of how the budtender described. I have to say did not disappoint! Left me with a nice body buzz but still that bit of euphoria, feeling very solid, focus &amp; personally a good strain to fight my depression because it can get very giggly...so.. maybe pack a bowl for two? \u270c

The cure on it isn&#39;t the best but it&#39;s still pretty dank... I agree it&#39;s a very good strain but its not my type... it&#39;s definitely a heavy indica... The flavor is good but not what a prefer... It&#39;s a good strain you can&#39;t really go wrong with it but I&#39;d prefer many other strains over this... so 3 stars

VThe wonder of Willy&#39;s Wonder is how it combines all the positive effects available in a huge variety of strains. It gives a sativa headspace and energy with intense, almost narcotic and opiate-like euphoria and couch-lock of a potent indica. There are the CEVs of a good kush, and the dissociation and giggles of outdoor mids. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good strain for the daytime, though. Because the indica effects are so intense, you might be out of commission for a couple of hours. It&#39;s a good evening smoke for the daydreamer. If you love to spend your free time sitting on a porch and contemplating life, you will enjoy this.\u000a\u000aBe careful with the dose; this stuff is potent. Always take less than you think you will need. The come-up is quick, so if you take it easy, you should be able to tell when you&#39;ve had enough, but if you&#39;ve taken even one small hit too much, everyone will know, you will have trouble walking, talking, and shouldn&#39;t drive. Start with one hit.

The oil had no smell, and was darker in color. This manufacturers (hush extracts) oil had a very bland taste, and the only notes I got from it were a slight pine and hash flavor. The effects are extremely sedative. I have a rough time trying to stay awake after dabbing this couch-locker. I would highly recommend this strain for patients seeking help with sleep. \u000a\u000aOverall I would recommend this strain for its benefits, but its flavor profile is very simple and bland.

VThis strain is literally one of my favorite strains. A very intense body high mixed with a fun and pretty vivid cerebral effect. Definitely listen to music when trying this strain, you won&#39;t be disappointed.

VI bought this strain at my local dispensary and it is really bad. do not buy. I smoked 3 bowls and the effects are very small. the bud is not green or vibrant like other strains. i feel this strain is to help people focus.

VThis strain is ok. Nothing too fantastic, from my experience.  It pairs well with other medications if you happen to be taking them for pain and/or anxiety. it alleviated my stomach aches and eased my muscle tension enough to stretch a bit. The turpene profile leaves much to be desired, but luckily this bud can found amongst your more affordable options, as it were. This is a great bud to start out with if you haven&#39;t or aren&#39;t very familiar with herbage &#128516;

Vthis is a lovely smoke: not a cough in the whole afternoon.  I didn&#39;t try *too* much of it as I had things to get done today and had to be available to loosely parent / hide from my teenaged son....  Impressions are really favorable.  I had a great time looking at pictures of artwork and listening to music....  colors nicely vibrant and feeling happy and creative.  There&#39;s a nice little tingle, and I&#39;d be really happy to spend some quality time with my partner, if it weren&#39;t for the teenaged son....  Anyway, my tender suggested I take this strain seriously, and with my obligations today I wisely decided to smoke lightly (not usually my strong suit).  He was right on, and I suspect the extreme couch lock and sleepiness that others got from this strain came from smoking too much of it too quickly.  It didn&#39;t come on strong, but later I noticed I was staggering a little.....  so no heavy equipment.  And unlike the Bush administration, I know my limitations: I won&#39;t go out and start two wars today, either.  Anyway, citrus/spruce.... indica dominant.  chases down the worries, but also those pesky responsibilities.....  a nice sunny afternoon playing frisbee strain if you don&#39;t smoke too much, and a complete bed-time herb if you do.....

VExceptional. Indica and strong. Almost takes my breath away after hits. Have to sit down.

VRIP Troy Davis :-(\u000amusic is good for healing. i&#39;m so sad he is gone from this world :-( but maybe God chose him to lead our nation into overcoming &quot;republican&quot; bullshit. those dipshits they call educated leaders running the right side of our government have their heads so far stuck up their asses! How have people come to be this way?! They&#39;re like the really bad villains in bad movies are like, you can&#39;t even imagine someone in real life could ever be this bad! (ok side note, I totally get how the Adam&#39;s Family creator thought of &quot;Thing&quot;! My hands look and act just like Thing when i&#39;m high on this stuff!!
