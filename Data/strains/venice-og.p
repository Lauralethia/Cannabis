VTried for level 8 headache. Didn&#39;t drop the pain down as much as I&#39;d hope, but made me not care about it. The tingly feeling that comes with it is fun and relieving to a certain extent. Makes my feet and hands very cold, so cold others notice so it isn&#39;t just a sensation. Since head is bad, I do want to drop the pain enough to sleep. While I don&#39;t feel knocked out and definitely can get stuff done, this doesn&#39;t keep me from sleeping.

VI really enjoyed the high that this strain gives. The bud itself has a beautiful look. Sativa strains are my favorite, and this one is among those special strains. It fades you but at the same time you are sharp and aware of time.

VSuper bomb buds! This bud doesn&#39;t make me feel lethargic, rather  quite the opposite. I can complete all my daily tasks but still be on a good fade. If you find this strain at your local dispensary, I highly suggest you pick some up and give it a try. You won&#39;t be disappointed!
