VI&#39;m so glad I tried this out, not only has this helped me reduce muscle aches &amp; pains, but it also calms my mind down and helps me fall asleep. The soothing euphoric effects kick in pretty fast, as well as opening my appetite.\u000a If you&#39;re planning on staying in for the evening &amp; wanna just zone out, You gotta try this.

VWhile this strain smells incredibly good it does leave a bit of a burnt effect on me. Making me incredibly sluggish for hours after the high wears off. Feels more like a straight indica if anything.

VThis stuff hits hard.  Single proper puff from firefly2 and I got full body tingles, bringing on good vibes and good times.  Super tasty pine flavor, but super strong odor, so this is definitely not one you can smoke in public without drawing attention.  Only real downside for me is my head feels really cloudy the next morning, making it a Fri/Sat-only strain.

VGot this from my connect, called it WiFi Gorilla, looked it up and found White Gorilla. I love Gorilla Glue and this is a heavy hitter. One bowl of this had me high, this doesn&#39;t get you sleepy at all you feel immediately calm, you get that head high where youre aware of everything but there&#39;s no stress to it. Its so pungent with a strong piney smell and slightly sweet scent as well. This is definitely one of my favorite strains now, im telling you, few hits of this and youre in for a great ride. Im currently incredibly high from this.

VOMG this stuff is insane, GG4 &#215; White Fire Alien OG, this stuff is pretty much great for anything and it&#39;s just so Kiefed out its white! I rolled a blunt and could only finish a quarter of it. I HIGHLY recommend this strain for people who have horrible pain and or bad Spasms as this stuff will lay you out. Do not pass it up IF you can find it! A+++++
