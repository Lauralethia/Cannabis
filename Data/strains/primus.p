VI became a member just to review this strain... Primus is By far the best strain I have ever had! I have been enjoying various strains for years trying to find the &quot;perfect&quot; strain for me and I finally  accomplished that. It&#39;s  Happy, euphoric,  creative, energetic BUT pass out on command..   Relieves pain anxiety, This strain is like no other! I have had this strain from two different growers-Rainier Farms and sweet water farms. BOTH WERE TOP NOTCH! If u haven&#39;t tried this strain TRY IT!!

VOne of the stankest, rankest smelling strains you&#39;ll ever lay nostrils to - &amp;I mean that as a compliment. EXTREME chemmy, earthy, skunk smells, blend together to create a very loud, lingering taste and smell. The  better this strain is grown, the more extreme this becomes. Has a somewhat racey, sour diesel-type sativa &quot;feel&quot;, although indica effects are present as well.

VI&#39;m new to being able to choose strains, after moving from Minnesota.\u000a\u000aThis is the strain I chose to take in the evening to relax and fall asleep. It&#39;s been great for that. I can feel my muscles letting go and it seems like it really clears my mind. I also can smoke a ton of it without getting spins, which is great.\u000a\u000aThe reason I&#39;m giving three stars are because I find the dry-eye to be really severe and also my munchies get outrageous. Maybe the worst munchies I&#39;ve ever had.

VFirst off, let me just say that this strain STINKS like skunk mixed with diesel which made me nauseous that I wanted to pass out! That&#39;s when you know you have GOOD weed. Personally I am not a fan of this kind of smell, but that&#39;s my opinion. Flavor was pretty smooth with subtleties of sweetness yet that diesel taste too. Boy, did this strain hit me like a train. All I remember is going to bed and melting completely into my bed. Got 10+ hours of sleep. This is what you want for a bed time strain!

VFor me, this is a strain that is best smoked in a bong. It works very well when smoked in a joint/pipe, but daaaaayum, when I hit this from a bong, it&#39;s lights-out! The effects are the same, but it seems that, for me, getting that extra quantity, down deep, makes a big difference.\u000a\u000aIt is overall a single-phase high, it just does it&#39;s thing and keeps doing it. At lower doses, I can still think clearly and carry on deep conversations, which is nice. At higher doses, it wraps my mind in a nice blanket of bliss, which is exactly why I use it. Depression/stress fades away and I just laugh at Insomnia. Other people I smoke with like it even more than me, proof that we&#39;re all weed-unique!

Tight fluffy bud structure so it retains its &quot;stickiness&quot; as long as it&#39;s not aggressively trimmed. \u000a\u000aPretty easy to break down by hand and makes a great joint/blunt weed.

That scent has faded a bit but still very unique. Flavor is sweet,piney,fuely with some fruity notes...very skunky room smell...this cut was 25%, dense flowers

VThis strain was a heavy hitter, I had just completed a 7 day work week and then my ex flew in to see me and we walked the Strip the entire day. I was hurting, bad, and so we went to the Reef and had this beauty. The first hit smacks you with a gravity intensifying heaviness, and pain evaporates under the weight of this bud. The first 5-7 minutes are you going &quot;whoa&quot; and looking at the joint to make sure it isnt a 100 lbs of awesome anxiety crushing pain relieving magic.

VI love this strain. what can I say. Washington state growers still water, i think 27% how can you go wrong. to me the taste is more like a coffee and fruit flavor. the high can range from giggly to heavy sedation and the euphoria for an indica is off the charts. if you are feeling creative and want to go out and try a different strain that will blow you away,i highly recommend this one. ghost train haze for sativa and Bruce banners for hybrids and you will have a great amount of diverse flavors and highs.

VI&#39;m still a newb when it comes to weed.  I smoked my first joint in late July and didn&#39;t smoke again until September and I only do it once weekly now.   My very limited smoking experience includes GSC, Bubblegum (still my fave) Blue Dream, Lucky Charms, Cinderella 99, 707 HB and Primus.  Primus could be my 2nd favorite so far.  It has the ability to stick me to the couch if I let it.  That being said,  I could still function and carry out tasks as well.  I went for an evening walk immediately after smoking this and the fall colors on the trees really popped and it was completely dark other than the street lights. This is a very euphoric, uplifting strain. Just an overall relaxing and enjoyable strain.  I&#39;ll definitely buy Primus again.

VI feel happy, oh so happy! Primus is my second favorite strain of indica. It&#39;s a total head and body high and is a fully functional high for experienced smokers. Offering a smooth smoke (no coughing), Primus is great for alleviating stress, depression and pain. Its my go-to for an instant dose of happiness and relaxation. Primus OG does not disappoint,

VGreat strain, super fluffy nugs with tons of crystals. If I were to compare this strain to something, I would say it&#39;s like the feeling of a gentle Spring breeze blowing on your face, then you realize that life is meaningless and we&#39;re all just floating on a spec of existential pain. \u000aSo it&#39;s super dank.

VI absolutely love this strain. After a tough night of training at the gym all I want to do is get home, enjoy some tunes or a movie with my girl and my friends. This strain is perfect for that. Almost immediately relaxes all of your tense muscles while not turning your brain to mush like some Indica strains. By far, one of my favorites without having to go for a traditional hybrid. All of the benefits of an Indica with a fun head high. Highly recommend. \u000a\u000a-J from Denver

VThe bag I had was phenomenal. Very dense nugs with a potent smell and flavor. This stuff was caked with trichombes. Didn&#39;t exactly have me feeling sleepy, but it was a couch-locker for sure. There&#39;s a bit of a cerebral effect as well, made me feeling social and creative.

VI had Primus in a Hash Joint by Sweet Water Farms and I absolutely loved it. It smelled very piney and that&#39;s one thing I look for. It was pretty skunky. When I let it I was surprised at how well it burned, the paper didn&#39;t run or anything. It tasted earthy, piney, and citrus like. The high hit me very quickly and it went straight to my eyes. I was tired instantly. I smoked about half a gram joint of it, and it messed me up. I usually only smoke oil so I was surprised with how good I felt with only half the joint. Overall I was very satisfied. Will be buying again.
