VI lived on Oahu for 4 years from 2011-2015 and Hawaiian Skunk is one of the best strains I&#39;ve come across out there. Definitely the stickiest and strongest smelling strain I&#39;ve ever come across in my life. The person who grew it outdoors in the Hawaiian soil is an awesome medicinal grower. A perfect hybrid offering the best of both worlds. Pain relieving, euphoric, and very Stoney. I was lucky to come across this strain, as its one of the best Hawaii has to offer.

VAt a first glance the casual weed observer may hold a nug of Hawaiian Skunk, and notice it&#39;s impressive density, unusual for a sativa, and it&#39;s sprawling orange hairs. A closer look though, perhaps with a iPhone flashlight, will reveal rich crystals, covering the entire nug. I want to say it is relatively odorless compared to other strains, but a slight head cold has probably compromised the integrity of my olfactory senses. While in most cases I&#39;ll note that the flavors in bud tend to shine in vaporizers, notably the Pax 2, the hot metal taste of the vape overpowers the slight earthy flavor. I put a little bit in a bowl to see if there was a difference, however I didn&#39;t pick up on very strong flavors in that either. \u000a\u000aWith a vape, the high tends to take a little longer to kick in, however it when it does kick in it can certainly sneak up on you. I always notice the tingly feeling in my face at first with Hawaiian Skunk, which slowly turns into a full-body high.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s not without a head high, which will come on last. If you smoke enough of it, it definitely becomes quite psychedelic.\u000a\u000aIn smaller amounts it definitely works as a daytime strain, however after a few bowls it can have seasoned smokers on their asses. I recommend it for anyone that smokes to increase appetite, it relieves any stomach pain and you will be fairly hungry as soon as the initial stone comes on. \u000a\u000aSkunk has also been consistently giving me creative streaks every I smoke it.  Also noted over the past few days of smoking it - I&#39;ve been dreaming fairly vividly, which is rare for me if I&#39;ve been smoking later in the day or at night.

VThis strain was an absolute creeper. Though my stuff was &quot;bottom bag&quot; material (smaller nugs, and some shake) it smelled very earthy, with a sweet hint of a fruit. It starts off in the head and uplifts your spirits before working its way down to relaxation. Perfect for beginners and pros! &#128077;

VHawaiian Skunk - my first vape cartridge! As of yesterday Oregonian recreational users can buy concentrates.  The budtender said that Hawaiian Skunk tasted phenomenal, and boy was she right! Mine tested at 65.91% THC and 1.30% CBD and it tasted like a fruit punch jolly rancher! DELICIOUS, like candy! I&#39;m already sold on vaping with cartridges over smoking flower. This is much stronger than flower, but cleaner, no ash or ashy taste, and so convenient to toke on! A little goes a long way, and this will be much cheaper than buying flower for me.\u000a\u000aHawaiian Skunk is definitely a sativa dominant hybrid and I&#39;m enjoying a clear headed, non descript high. It tastes by far the best of any weed to date that I have smoked, but that was all through bongs and herb vapes, so I look forward to tasting other cartridge strains!  The high from Hawaiian Skunk rolls in in waves, so be careful!  One hit lasts me a few hours, I&#39;m finding, but I&#39;d say it really kicks in after 40 minutes.

VI have been toying with this strain for almost a year now, GREAT uplifting flower that bursts of Lemmon, berries and summer. \u000a\u000agreat for both indoor and outdoor grows.  \u000a\u000aonly downside is 13 to 14 weeks for full maturity :/

VThis is a very pretty strain with a lot of the red hairs you see on those light green buds the lighter green the bud the less red hairs are on  the bud. The darker the bud the more potent it is. What else that is interesting to me is that the description here states this is an outdoor bus but my HS is an indoor strain that&#39;s the only type my supplier gets and I only know this because I asked about this bud. Anytime I get a menu I check the strains on leafly. Cool right
