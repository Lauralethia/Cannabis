Vto me this OG is different from the other OG&#39;s, Paris well make you sleepy but really happy and not that hungry. it&#39;s a different type of indica it&#39;s hard hitting but it keeps you smiling :) 10 / 10  similar to Skywalker OG and SFV OG. (my opinion)

VThis Strain pleasantly reminds me why I need to smoke more Indica Strains.  After smoking approx half a bowl of this flower out of a small glass pipe, the &quot;High&quot; quickly took hold my body with a little pressure just in the back of my eyes.  Then about 15 minutes later a pleasant blissful Cerebral High begins to take hold.  Even though mild to moderate psychedelics came on pretty strong, I was still able to mentally function and get some work done... Like this review I&#39;m writing now.  This has been a Solid 2 hour high, about as good as it gets :)  Not a particularly tasty strain, but the Mind and Body high more that make up for it.  Definitely add this to your Strain Stash.

VParis OG is my new favourite Indica. It totally relaxes you, but doesn&#39;t knock you out. It&#39;s also incredibly smooth to smoke, let alone vape. Paris OG delivers when it comes to pain, yet also has nice cerebral effects. I&#39;ve visited some really cool dimensions with this stuff! Overall it&#39;s a pretty amazing strain and totally worth trying for yourself.

VSmell and taste are appealing.  From my experience, Paris OG is not as heavy-hitting as you would expect from reading other reviews.  I assume this is due to Paris OG originating from 2 hybrid strands, which I feel also contribute to how uplifting Paris OG feels for an Indica.  I don&#39;t ever feel &quot;couched&quot; from Paris OG, but I definitely feel the body high once it takes effect.  Overall, I find Paris OG useful for help with stress, relaxation, and day time use without any decrease of motivation or energy levels.  For someone looking for a nice day-time Indica, Paris OG will suffice.  For someone looking for a strand that will 100% help them sleep, I would look for something else.

Usually I get high for 30 minuets and my tolerance takes over,but with this strain I stayed high for 2 hours and finally went to sleep. It helped me with my insomnia.It is also very harsh and made me and my friend cough for a ridiculous amount of time

VParis OG is a heavy hitting indica-dominant strain. The bud has hints of purple and dark green. The bud is covered in trichomes and has a sweet fruity smell. The effects bring about a long lasting and intense feeling of rest and relaxation. I would recommend this strain to a patient who is looking for a sleep aid that will also work to relax your mind.

Vone of the strongest buds i&#39;ve ever had. i had some garlic cookies the bud tender said was tested over 30% and this paris og seemed near as strong. almost too strong and i&#39;m a veteran smoker. half joint and your set. almost had a bit of paranoia with it it&#39;s that strong. but this is from our best dispensary grower in the area so your results may vary. nice cure on it, not dry, burned nice, smooth and thick smoke. definately stones you with a bit of uplifting effect. after a few tokes you will forget what you were thinking about and notice your staring at the wall. one of my new favorites.

VA 4 out of 5 for a harsh smoke.\u000aGet&#39;s me really fuck&#39;n hi.  yes\u000aHighest Highs....\u000aThis time wasn&#39;t harsh.\u000aReally good \u000a\u000aBumped from AllBud.com\u000aINDICA - Paris OG is a relatively rare medical strain, though it can be found in at least one Southern California medical marijuana dispensaries. It&#39;s an indica-heavy hybrid, though the exact ratio of sativa to indica isn&#39;t widely known. THC levels are said to be fierce, surpassing 19% in some tests, while CBD levels are considerably lower, less than 1%. That&#39;s much too low to recommend Paris OG as treatment for epileptics or other patients whose conditions require CBD. Instead, this strain is a useful means of treating depression, glaucoma and eye pressure, headaches, muscle spasms, and nausea. The full, heavy body high is calming and sleepy, so Paris OG is also good for insomnia, and it induces euphoria, happiness, and a tingly sensation. Expect a woody diesel smell with hints of flowers and pine needles, matched with a flavor of flowers, citrus, and pine. The nugs are huge and sticky. Negati ves aren&#39;t commonly reported, but dry mouth and red eyes are usually the most likely. Though its name suggests French roots, Paris OG sells best in the American Southwest and Michigan.

VImmediately when you open the seal the pungent earthy aromas send you to heaven. The earthy tones, combined with an almost lemon-chocolate scent, makes you excited to crumble this bad boy. Although  it is hard to imagine the scent getting stronger on this dense, hairy, crystal coated bad boy, it does. The flavours are deep and complex, which is truly enveloping of the senses. Pain disappears instantly; making it my no.1 stop for relaxation and release. A full body high that will send even the most tense souls to sleep.

VThe potency of this Indica made me see why it won so many recent awards. It hits hard with a mellow body high and few cerebral effects. A harsh smoke that you instantly forgive as soon \u000aas it hits your body, which is almost instantly. Nothing will really bother you on this stuff. But it will tend to suck the motivation out of you. Good for movie viewing, insomnia and that unbeatable warm, lazy afternoon feeling when you can float above it all. I got couch lock with this, and won&#39;t smoke it during the day unless I&#39;ve cleared my schedule.

VVery hard resinous flowers blanketed in frosty sugary tricombs. I am an Indica man because my back and sleep issues. It worked great for both, you know its good whwn your spine is numb and your actin&#39; dumb. Earthy skinky smell with a hint of citrus undertone. Would reccomend for Insomina, Appitite and pain, dreamy yet pain killing high.

VImmediately when you open the seal the pungent earthy aromas send you to heaven. The earthy tones, combined with an almost lemon-chocolate scent, makes you excited to crumble this bad boy. Although  it is hard to imagine the scent getting stronger on this dense, hairy, crystal coated bad boy, it does. The flavours are deep and complex, which is truly enveloping of the senses. Pain disappears instantly; making it my no.1 stop for relaxation and release. A full body high that will send even the most tense souls to sleep.

VIllinois THC 24% . By far the best Orange Grow product I have ever had. The buds are beautiful with the crystals shining though out.  The effect is strong relaxing definitely an indica but still able to function and get off the couch a little bit goes a long way. &quot;Highly&quot; recommended

VIt was a great flower when it comes to taste and effect. The feeling was great. Super relaxed, Stress Free, but up enough to not get couch locked. The one down fall I didn&#39;t like was that it didn&#39;t burn very well. I had to continually light the flower to maintain a proper smoke. I would guess it would be a great flower to vape do to taste and effect. Other than that I truly enjoyed it.

VI selected this strain from Choice in Southern Orange County.  This is a top shelf selection and my personal favorite INDICA of 2014. The effects are almost immediate, powerful and long lasting.  The flavor is insane, power pine-tree with heavy skunk funk and a woody foresty scent. This is not a functional strain.  I ground in my simba grinder, too my standard &quot;scoop&quot; which is about 1/4 gram and load it into my Vapor Tower, and pull through a KONG bong.  I am able to pull 5-6 decent sized hits, before tossing the &quot;revape&quot; into my collection jar for making canna-coconut oil.  The flavor is appreciated for minuets after you take a hit.  The effects are similar to and INDICA punch in the face.  You will sit down, and when you do the only reason you are getting up is to eat, and then maybe eat again.  Whatever was on your mind is no longer!  It makes me feel great, vapes like a dream.  The buds are firm and funky and caked up with white crystals.  Some red hairs poke through the buds and make them look like candle tips.   Whomever grew this batch knew WTF they were doing.  Best of 2014 in my books.

VParis OG is a lot more fun that many Indicas. Anti-depressant, anti-anxiety med. Works like a charm. Like the old days \u201cweed\u201d is supposed to work.\u000aYou get a bit headachy, then the giggles, then creative and happy, then a bit hungry, then sleepy. Like a newbie but not. My body pain seems less intense, burning neuropathy pain more dulled. Less inflammation. No muscle spasms that I could feel or record past few days smoking it. I\u2019m liking it. \u000aTho I am not a fan of the taste. \u201cEarthy\u201d my ass.  Not a fan.  I love the texture and fluffy tackiness of it though. Looks like broccoli &#129382;

I felt like the description of what a stone person would look and act like because I was just laughing and munching hardcore...and I mean HARDCORE. Would not suggest smoking this in the day because you will become a couch potato and accomplish nothing. I ended up watching American horror story after hot boxing my friends closet and it was the weirdest shit of my life. Overall though this is my favorite one(so far) to smoke before bed.

VParis OG usually gets a very high rating and people seem to love it. They batch I got was loaded with crystal trichomes and looked as if it was going to great. I was a little disappointed though as it was a little lack luster with the quality of high I felt from it. The taste was mediocre too, certainly not the worst but not great either.  I was excited to finally try it when I picked it up but ended up being a tad disappointed.

VParis OG was a spectacle that I picked up in cartridge form from a local dispensary, made by Naked THC brand; mainly because I had a stiff neck from sleeping funny, and was having trouble getting to sleep in the first place. Right out of the \u201ctube\u201d that the cartridge came in, I noticed a rather fruity smell, nothing more, nothing less. Plugging in and taking two long 5-second drags, I was introduced to an almost pine-fruit-lemon-pepper that made me sneeze when exhaling through my nasal cavity. The high is very draggy and lazy, definitely made me want to stay put. Although about an hour in, I was hit with hard munchies that seemed rather difficult to get over. This is a night time bud for sure, in all the characteristics it displays after vaping. Park yourself in front of the tv and get ready to fall asleep. Will buy again.

VNice relaxing wave rolls over your body, euphoria sets in not long after. very strong chronic pain relief, felt pretty happy too. My mood was very uplifted and it made me hungry to boot.

V*Medical Review*  *4.7* Wow this is a good strain for pain and swelling!  I have RA and this really helps. If you have arthritis or muscle pain check the strain out. It&#39;s my number #2! it definitely take less then my #1 to do the trick. Great smell and Taste! Very pinny. Great for anxiety and depression too!

VThis strain has probably the most intense high you will settle in to. I smoked two bowls from a pipe. The head change came after a few seconds of my exhale but it wasn\u2019t too intense. After I finished my second bowl I still didn\u2019t peak in my high yet. It wasn\u2019t until maybe 10 minutes after consumption did I realize how locked to my Xbox and bed I was. Very smooth come up into a very intense high as even writing this review gets harder by the passing moment. Enjoy this at home with nothing to do!

VThee most flavorful strain ive smoked.  strong stereotypical OG piney lemony terps make the Paris OG a fun smoke.  very little head high to accompany the full body bliss going on.  Best description of the infamous Paris in 1 word &quot;sedative.&quot;  must smoke among the OG strains.

VDefinitely a well medicated feeling. I like that it doesn&#39;t give me an overwhelming sleepy feeling so I can smoke it after a long work day and do a few things before heading to bed. AMAZING for insomnia! But I do get headaches once my high wears off or when I wake up in the morning.

VI&#39;ve only enjoyed Paris OG in oil form solvent free. At first you don&#39;t think its affected you. The trick is to stop as soon as you think you should vape a bit more.  Otherwise instead of a nice relaxing Netflix binge watching session you will be in a coma.  I strongly recommend this for night time use unless you want to go thru the day feeling like you&#39;ve done heroin.

VJust tried this in vape form. The first hit made me cough like a motherfucker, and a few hits later, I found myself smiling. Unfortunately, the positive high came with a headache. Maybe it&#39;s the diesel scent, or just the strain in general. It was a strong head buzz, maybe too intense, and that&#39;s what made it worse. Maybe smoking this after a good night&#39;s rest, in bed, is the best way to go to avoid a headache. Fighting against an indica is a bad idea anyway lol.
