VAs a caregiver, I must discuss the one particular thing that this strain helps, and it is anxiety. It will take the edge off and calm you without making you tired or high as a kite. If you have days when you feel off, this is the go-to everytime and anytime of the day.  Every one of my patients love this strain including myself. Why would you take a pill when this all natural medicine works just as well without a bunch of bad side effects. Put this strain in your medicine cabinet if you have a lot of stress or anxiety. Not particularly large buds or much smell or taste,but excellence can come in a plain wrapper too!!

VI wish I could a photo of the 3.5 in Bud that I picked-up at Altitude Organics. Beautiful little hairs fall on the surface of the deep green with maroon highlights flower. I smoked my meds, the pull is strong but sweet, with a smell of &#39;incredible&#39; enlaced.\u000aAs a 100% disabled Vet, the medicinal value of this guy is high for pain and anxiety relief. While I functioned fine with ICE, I can see where you might want to wait for dinner-time before indulging. The quality was super high...you won&#39;t find many &#39;dispensarys&#39; carrying the quality of buds that Altitude Organic does. Hats off to the growing team at this place!

VThis strain is very relaxing and mellowing, but it is not a creative/productive smoke. It has effects similar to a euphoric, couch-lock, stoned feeling, but without the typical sleepiness or fatigue. Very smooth smoke with a noticeable flavor akin to Sweet Diesel.

VFairly potent high, but kind of short lived for me, although it seemed to last longer for the people that were smoking with me.  While the high lasted it kept me drifting back and forth between a strong body high and intense mind high, which was disorienting in a pleasant way.  The bud was pretty dense and sticky, and to me smelled like pickles with a hint of gasoline.  The taste was not particularly noteworthy but the smoke was very smooth.  I just wish the high had lasted longer.

VYou take this weed which is a very light green covered in crystals, with little bits of just white chunks in it, and light it, you taste a pungent chemical flavor with a minty aftertaste. It doesn&#39;t take a lot with this weed to get you high, and just a little can last a long time! Amazing mellow cerebral head high. 4.5/5

VIf I could give it another half star, I would. Pretty good strain, took a huge bRip and it caught me by surprise. Huge clouds of smoke. Super chronic. Not the stoniest since it&#39;s a 50/50 hybrid but it&#39;s nice to smoke on once you&#39;re already blazed too. I liked the taste. Different. A little chemical tasting. A good changeup. Working good for Crohn&#39;s disease/social anxiety, muscle spasms and depression. Smoking some dank Scooby snacks too at the same time, though haha. Pretty good strain 1/4 for 49 recreational here.

VI really disliked this strain. It made my mind race and gave me a very heavy body feel, which did not help my anxiety or insomnia and made me really uncomfortable. I gave it a try three different times and felt the same way each time. Probably shouldn&#39;t have done that, lol. However, I do hear that is beneficial and works well for many people. Most definitely not my strain of choice.

Vbought this from Brothers in Portland off division. Well... they had this going for $20/ate. I said why not. The smell was ok. the look was great and  lightly frosted too.  A closer look at the bottle and it says 5.106%. So then I smoke it. like...nah whatever... it had a light cool mentholy type finish too. Well let me tell you it&#39;s def 5%. So then I went to Cannabliss and bought some Tangelope to cut it and we are smoking baby lol.   So I say that to say. it wasn&#39;t bad but it didn&#39;t give me that punch. it was big buds too. but again 20/qtr and you smokin all day and Brothers in Portland

It&#39;s very nice, mellow and contemplative, not very intrusive in my day to day activities and I&#39;d put the effects of pain reduction at 75% even, depending on the day. After having had almost no pain reduction from the last strain before ice I&#39;m very pleased to have less pain again. \u000aI&#39;d definitely recommend this strain if you have multiple sclerosis with burning pain!

VFor a 50/50 strain this stuff knocks me out cold and I&#39;ve been smoking for almost 20 years. Maybe since it&#39;s from a different breeder rather than Nirvana (Female Seed Company) the review didn&#39;t match the effects 100%. Don&#39;t get me wrong. If you&#39;re looking for something to use at the end of the evening about an hour before bed this is your strain. EXTREMELY mellow and laid back. However I would use a different, more sativa strain during the day and leave this hybrid to nighttime only use.

Vlet me tell you the story when i first bought ice. it twas a cold stormy night around 10 30. i grabbed my bong and loaded a bowl with animal cookie kief on top and a dab sandwich. i took 1 hit and almost dropped the monster hitter. i then took another hit and 3x hits by 5x hits i was in outer space. trying to get my thoughts balanced. my toes were warm and felt detached from my body. i felt tingly not on my hands or arms. my eyes felt heavy. i felt like nodding off. i wanted to order 50 mc nuggets from mc donalds but was too busy couch locked to my bed. the end.

VThis strain if smoked is likely to induce coughing, however it&#39;s high is very intense.  You&#39;ll likely be in a somewhat lazy, extremely euphoric daze for hours.  \u000a\u000aPMP Testor experience:  Every time I smoke Ice, I&#39;m surprised at the intensity of the high.  Full mind and body lift-off.  Great for hanging with friends on the couch and being social.  A little cotton-mouthy, and definitely likely to cause a cough when smoked. The high is well worth the cough however! :)  Love this strain!

VI bought a good amount of this about 3 weeks ago. at first it was a bit much but after about 4 days of smoking it it became a perfect strain. I loved going out after smoking it and I found it to be a perfect morning bud as well. great energy level and fantastic mood. glad I got as much as I did because it was great. only down side is again it&#39;s potent at first and gives you a real head buzz for the first 20 minutes.

I smoke a lot, and this strain kicks my ass. It gives me some anxiety, which is why I always tell myself not to get it again... but it&#39;s also potent as hell, doesn&#39;t have too big a body high so you can easily meander, and it makes your brain swimmy.

I was relaxed and happy. Two things I specifically said about it to friends, It did not make me sleepy or hungry! IT was AWESOME for me. Nice Head high, and pain relief!! I medicate for Physical and Mental needs. This ended up being a HUGE awesome reliever for my immediate stressful needs! Totally recommend to Seasoned Stoners.... High in THC, Not for the beginner!

VPicked up some White Castle today, a hybrid of Ice and White Widow. This stash is by far the most unique scented strain I\u2019ve ever had. The aroma in my glass jar perfectly matches the flavour profile described in the \u201cIce\u201d strain description: the chemically smell hitting your nose first but soon dissipating to the usual smell of fresh bud with a strong presence of gourmet herbs and spices.\u000a\u000aThe aroma from the white widow on the other hand is almost non existent, but it makes up for a lack of stench with a heavy indica sedation and muscle relaxer. I\u2019m not sure on this but I think \u201cIce\u201d alone is a more average mid-low end quality strain with a unique smell and the white widow really gives it a nice kick while keeping the smell.\u000a\u000aI personally noticed my steps felt lighter and easier after having smoked a joint sitting down and then walking around downtown. This would be a great strain for workouts.

VThis strain of Ice is around in Lower Michigan [as a clone only] but not in any dispensaries at this time. It is not available to the public at large at this time either. This is my go-to strain. I always come back to this one even when I try other new-to-me strains. It has consistently tested between 20% - 24% THC. It works great for nausea and helps me forget that I am sick. It helps for falling asleep too. It also works for different levels of medicating. Smoke a little until you get the effect for treatment that you need. Need a higher level of medication? Smoke or vaporize more. It works great in this way for the low-levels [starter buzz] needed to the higher levels [fall asleep without realizing it] needed.\u000aIt may be available in the future at a place in Ann Arbor on a limited basis [as flower]. But not until the fall of 2016.

VI&#39;ve recently discovered this strain and I love it. Its potent yet subtle; very clean. You get the medicinal benefits without a strong &quot;stoned&quot; feeling and it lasts for a good few hours. It hits you with a tingling feeling in the head and limbs. It helps with my fatigue, anxiety, depression, and nausea. AND it gives me a boost of energy. You really get the best of both worlds with this strain. I smoked this before work and felt great all day.

VI think the name does double duty here. A terpene profile heavy in terpineol and eucalyptol comes across as a chemical, menthol, gassy petrol smell.

I topped these plants several times in veg and now they&#39;re large bushy beauties. They&#39;re in 30 gallon pots and standing apx 9 ft tall.

I loved going out after smoking it and I found it to be a perfect morning bud as well. great energy level and fantastic mood. glad I got as much as I did because it was great. only down side is again it&#39;s potent at first and gives you a real head buzz for the first 20 minutes.

VI have this as a new edition on my menu. It is listed in my 50/50 hybrid section, but I have to disagree with that. A very light head high that is a creeper. The body relaxation and the obvious high CBD content in this strain makes it a heavy leaning indica. I used it 4 to 5 hours before bed and did wake up a few times through the night, but WOW no body pain. My initial thought was to discontinue this strain due to my choosiness for high thc strains, but there is a need for some high CBD strains as well. I will test it again, but would recommend it for helping with body pain and stress.

VBought a quarter of Ice from High Tides Delivery in Eureka, and loved it. The buds were nicely frosted and trichomed, and the high was a good balance between sativa and indica effects. I really liked Ice in terms of dankness and potency, but it didn&#39;t stick out to me as the best around, you know? Still, a really good strain.

VGrew this after reading the awesome reviews and seeing there was currently nowhere to get it here in the SF Bay Area.\u000a\u000aEveryome we&#39;ve given a sample from our harvest says it&#39;s amazing! Real good high without the couch lock, good for pain and stress/anxiety. Some people said it made them really hungry/munchie but others not so much. \u000a\u000aProblem is, now we can&#39;t find a dispensary willing to buy it. Everyome just tells us there&#39;s no market for it... They just think they won&#39;t be able to sell it since it&#39;s not a popular enough strain. \u000a\u000aOh well. We mostly grew it because we wanted to try it. More for us, I guess. But the rest of the Bay Area is definitely missing out on this one!

VPeople say Ice doesn&#39;t smell, but this stuff smells phenomenal. Very unique and hard to describe; is like waking up in the morning to a beautiful fresh spring day. The look of the herb is sort of dark green with the right amount of red-hairs. I enjoy grinding this product because it just open a Pandora box of smells and makes you want to roll the dang thing and smoke the whole jar! I see where the White Castle (Ice Widow) gets its flavor and potency. A well-flushed plant will deliver a smooth smoke without compromising your throat with 0 coughing. I enjoy it and will recommend it for that beautiful spring day.  Only reason I&#39;m giving 4 stars is because the plant can be a bit difficult to grow if you don&#39;t pay attention to what you are doing. Other than that, this one is a keeper.

You get the medicinal benefits without a strong &quot;stoned&quot; feeling and it lasts for a good few hours. It hits you with a tingling feeling in the head and limbs. It helps with my fatigue, anxiety, depression, and nausea. AND it gives me a boost of energy. You really get the best of both worlds with this strain.

It is a 50/50 with a 3 hit head buzz and a heavy body stone all in one. It has a harsh hashy taste, and the buzz is like a hash buzz as well. The papaya that I grow is a hybrid of ice but is a heavy body indica. The ice is both. Any experienced user would love this strain
