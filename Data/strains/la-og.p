VVery dank stuff, long red clusters of hairs with very green leaves that only peak out barely from the ton of whitish amber crystals.  The high was strong and was prominent in my forehead and fingertips but was overall a full body and head buzz.  Also made me feel more creative, but the high was so enjoyable it was difficult to get going on anything.

VI really enjoy this strain. Its really high in (caryophllene) like the gorilla glue #4. Works great for pain and anxiety.  Also combined with cbd for opiate withdraw. Suffer from severe anxiety and this strain doesn&#39;t give me any anxious feelings at all. A must try for anxiety, depression and PTSD.

VGets to work in two big hits from a 14mm size bowl. This stuff makes you feel tickled in the abdominal muscles.. Then eventually heads North and massages your head. Then dances on your skin. And then hunger. That is the high for this also you see in waves. Pretty fucking good high. I like this better than gsc. Gsc was alot more chronic and kinda gave me a head ache.

VI picked up a gram from MedicalHerbs4U on recommendation and currently make this my occasional vape. Wow. Massive head high with explosions of color, augmented sound and supreme giddiness. Incredibly happy/euphoric and finishes with energy. Hits right in the sinus/eyes at first, then starts moving down the body. On the plus side, this makes me horny as hell!\u000a\u000aNugs are dense and slightly sticky - springy when ground. Very piney/citrus on the nose - delicious. Vape produces a hint of citrus on the tongue and opens the passages nicely.\u000a\u000aDownsides: noticed a slight headache afterwards, on the tail end. But that could have been from not drinking enough water at the time. Slightly dry eyes and expect dry mouth.

VLarry OG WAX and LIVE RESIN are absolute Killer! I enjoyed the flower and reviewed it here (gave it a 4). The wax came in at only a tad under 60% THC, which is a little low for concentrates...However, even small dabs are  very potent. The wax I got was from Kynd and the price was relatively good. Taste was excellent and a little sweet. Smoke was easy and mellow, using an enail at 600D F. I still enjoy flower, but concentrates are so much more INTENSE, convenient, as it turns out, cost effective, once you get set up...

Overall it was a nice high, wouldn&#39;t say it was too in your face or anything more mellow than intense... A nice smoke before bed dab a few hits of this and Master OG and I&#39;m relaxed enough to at least lay down to be able to pass out...

VFull disclaimer: I used a O pen (vapepen) and am a first time user, trying to help my insomnia. Took about 4 good hits to try and go to sleep, big mistake! Once I got in bed and closed my eyes my reality became a prison of infinite self referential evaluation. I literally thought I would lose my mind. For brief movements I could get a handle on reality, but only the smallest foot hold. It was like being forced to mentally render not only this universe but ever parallel quantum alternate spin off of this universe. Whats worse, I could not stop thinking about the thoughts of others thinking about my thoughts and what they would imagine or write. In the end I came away with this image of a fractal multidimensional representation of the universe and where I fell in it. The only thing that helped me at all, was when I had the mental strength to open my eyes. Needles to say, I don&#39;t understand why anyone would use this stuff. As a result of this terrible experience I no longer fear death.
