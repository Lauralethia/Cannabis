VPowerful. \u000a\u000aI tend to get a little nausea.  I get headaches if I have a lot. I feel euphoric, goofy, and happy. I have lots more energy even when I\u2019m sitting still. I\u2019m prone to anxiousness and this does not cause any anxiousness in me.

VWow. As an experienced cannabis user, this strain initially caught me off guard. It didn&#39;t look the most sexy, but it was dense &amp; pungent as hell. Definitely indica dominant, and super tasty, a light froot loop scent from it. Nice lung squeeze effect which comes from mostly indicas.

VIncredible strain, sometimes she gets a little tall but large buds dense and full. I pictures of my runs somewhere&#39;s. love the taste, the high everything. Smooth if flushed well and dried even. it has a acid citrus flavor sometimes more to the grapefruit side or the acidic flavor of lemons and pine taste. \u000aBeen running it for a while now and will continue as long as I can.

VOne of THE best strains I&#39;ve smoked next to Larry og. Very strong and not for the weak. I&#39;m and experienced smoker and me and my friend tapped out halfway through the blunt. Amazing head feeling and makes you very creative.
