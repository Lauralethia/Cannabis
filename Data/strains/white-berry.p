VIt has been awhile since I have added a new favorite but white berry has been added to my list. This relaxing and euphoric indica has swept me off my feet. At first you taste the sweet flowery taste with a smooth hit to the throat. It has a very leafy aroma. I&#39;ve had a lot of positive effects and even opened up a few people who have had bad experiences with pot. This is really great for anxiety and for a slow easing high. You immediately feel euphoric and happy and then as minutes go by the high enhances to its full state and has a long lasting duration. I experience different highs as I either feel really sleepy, energetic, couch locked, or adventurous. There was never an inbetween when it comes to this strain. It&#39;s also opened up my mind and allowed me to be crafty and creative. This is great for low tolerance users and high tolerance users will find the effects benefiting as well. Definitely one of my favorites and I would choose it off the shelf for nighttime and early relaxing morning usage ~ \u2601\ufe0f

VSweet to the taste for those who apreciate different strains.\u000aI heard on a seed website that this strain is a cross of Blueberry and White Widow.  I understand the widow part for the intense but soothing high. Feels like someone put a pillow arround my head and tied it up there. Like other strains even the down part of it feels like your still not sober at all and is still enjoyable.\u000aThe blueberry part I wouldn&#39;t know since we don&#39;t get that strain where we live, but it do get the idea when I compare a dank, planty smell like M39 to this sweet and soft smoke.  \u000a\u000aI would advise against mixing any branch parts of the nugs to it for the simple fact that whenever there was some in my joint or bong it became very roachy very fast but that might just be the batch I got. \u000a\u000aAlso has a beautiful plant structure that will stay small and bushy like an Indica but thats just my opinion.\u000a\u000aEnjoy!

VI haven&#39;t smoked in 20 years so this ended up being a starting point for me.  Love the body buzz this gives.  I have suffered with depression and suicide thoughts for years.  One hit and it took my mind to a different place.  Definitely want to get of the chemicals (pill) I have to take everyday for depression.  This is a much better solution to all my issues!

VOne of my favorite strains! Crazy mind journey and euphoria. Great strain to love your mind in and get lost. I&#39;d suggest it got solo dolo nights with some great music. I&#39;d call this the &#39;spiritually couch locked&quot; strain.

VHad an amazing taste that solicited an excited response. Followed by a fast onset of a heavy body high with a huge happy/euphoric element. Talkative, giggly, and enjoyable. Very similar to Blackberry Kush but more clear headed and less buzzy. Had a defined sense of paranoia if in the wrong environment. Still very fun and stress-relieving in the right place.

VHot diggety damn! Got a first-timer free pre-roll at Panacea and took three pulls. Within ten minutes, I was teenage-wastelanding, laughing and mildly terrified, not at all prepared for what this strain delivers. I see 21% THC 1.25% CBD and think that&#39;s a pretty good potency, but not something to approach with caution. It&#39;s the polar opposite of how Blue Dream hits me; the tsunami of that opioid, vibrating rubber skeleton body buzz from the blueberry combined with the unhinged mania I get from white widow, as opposed to BD&#39;s smooth-talking power-walking vibe. Jekyll &amp; Hyde; White Berry is Hyde as all get out. I absolutely love it, don&#39;t get me wrong. BUT I have smoked it some more, and prepared for the effects, I can assuredly say that it is NOT FOR PUBLIC/SOCIAL CONSUMPTION! Only with your closest &amp; stupidest associates. For this discovery and the uberCBD tincture they had (holy crap! gotta try that combo, in a bouncy house!) I crown Panacea the Marquis de Green Mile and the Cong of Little Saigon!

VI love indica strains, especially ones that are strong. This knocked me on my ass, but at the same time it&#39;s a strain you can go for a walk on and not feel high. It puts me in a better mood, not much of a head high but it&#39;s great for relaxing and sleep. Definite couch-lock. If you like indicas, check this strain out.

Vlike shishkaberry, im normally not a fan of berry strains. I didnt mind this one either as far as they go though. Nothing fancy here. Did the trick, i felt it was pretty similar to the shishkaberry, maybe not quite as potent with a more sleepy driven effect. A great buy for what they are charging right now at the dispensary. Def worth the price. See shishkaberry though, i feel its better if youre looking for a little better potency and dont mind the huge price diff.

VI&#39;d compare it to blue dream but with a kick. \u000aMore Sativa then Indica, detect blueberry notes but also like a pine cream combination. Berry pine smell. \u000aVery Euphoric, definetly will get rid of a headache if you need it for that but id prefer a straight indica if you need something more for pain.\u000aTHis definetly cures anxiety, it gives you dry mouth and can slow you down like a benzo. \u000aIts a genius hybrid now that i think about it . underrated in my opinion.

Vlike shishkaberry, im normally not a fan of berry strains. I didnt mind this one either as far as they go though. Nothing fancy here. Did the trick, i felt it was pretty similar to the shishkaberry, maybe not quite as potent with a more sleepy driven effect. A great buy for what they are charging right now at the dispensary. Def worth the price. See shishkaberry though, i feel its better if youre looking for a little better potency and dont mind the huge price diff.

VDefinitely a unique terpene profile right on smelling the jar. Upon inspection, the flowers were completely coated in trichomes, had extremely tightly packed calyxes and were some of the densest variety of flower bud I had ever seen up to that point.\u000a\u000aSmooth on intake, smooth on exhalation, the complex profile of the, &#39;White Widow&#39; background comes through while maintaining the sweetness of the distinct, &#39;Blueberry&#39; flavor to it.\u000a\u000aEffects-wise: this is an all-rounder. What I would describe as a, &#39;heavy upliftment&#39;. It feels like the relaxation of Indica being yanked in the direction of, &#39;lightness&#39; entailed by Sativa. Sedative in larger amounts or in bigger inhalations/doses. All-rounder effects more pronounced in small amounts, and slight Sativa leniency in moderate amounts (can get &#39;zoney&#39;).\u000a\u000aOverall: I had a choice between Ogre Kush, Tahoe O.G., Girl Scout Cookies, Gorilla Glue and one other variety. I picked this one. Ultimately, it came down to the Gorilla Glue and the White Berry. I squeezed flower buds of both. The Gorilla Glue had a little more give while the White Berry was extremely dense. I picked the White Berry.\u000a\u000aThis seems to be a strain that someone who is a little more experienced, a Connoisseur or a Sommelier, may be able to appreciate as the terpene profile is indeed unique, and the effect is definitely outside of the commonplace, &#39;Kush&#39; and, &#39;O.G.&#39; strains that dominate the Cannabis market. Yet, it is still Indica.\u000a\u000aSomething different. I like it.

VReviews I read before my first dose of this medication were right on point. Great for anxiety and stress, was having a rough day when I got this and had an instant head change, right back to level almost instantly. Says here it&#39;s not great for pain, but it has a body high creeper effect, so you get the head change immediately and find your body relaxing after about fifteen minutes. Tastes great too!

Vthis strain was a big disappointment.  i read the reviews on this site and when i smoked it i was like wtf is this shit..  it did smell very strong and good though.  it was covered in resin and looked like it would be the bomb.  I knew the grower and he said he was very dissappointed in the plant as well.

VI had this strain from a friend of mine and honestly it was probably one of the worst strains I&#39;ve had. It wasn&#39;t grown well so that&#39;s maybe why but the effects didn&#39;t really kick in as much as I wanted them and note I smoked a whole Blunt almost. So really if I had no effects, didn&#39;t really get the after effects either. Overall a 6/10 until I try it from another person.
