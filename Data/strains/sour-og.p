VSmoked a decent bowl of SOg to relax and smoke my hookah, Currently at a nice buzz. Pretty decent body high, with a good head buzz too. Not over powering, and able to think somewhat clearly. I suffer from bad anxiety, and have 0 feelings of panic or anxiety, so I&#39;d reccomend this strain for people who are new to medicating. DONT SMOKE TOO MUCH. You wont be able to move.

VThis has become my new go-to strain during times of anxiety and gastrointestinal discomfort.  SourOG&#39;s quick onset brings symptom relief instantaneously, especially when fully utilizing this plants resin-rich buds and high terpene/cannabinoids prof. By making it into Solventless hash oil using the rosin tech, with about a 22%yield on my best presses.  I purchased my SourOG from Compassionate Care Foundation in New Jersey.

VI&#39;m kinda surprised at how high I am. This was a mid price at the place I got it so I wasn&#39;t expecting the most ouf it, but I was pleasantly surprised. \u000a\u000aGreat high, gets you really energetic, and really helps after those 10 hour work day 6 days a week situations. It&#39;s one of those buds with the classic gooooood kush smell. It also really helps with pain relief, loosens your muscles up. \u000a\u000aOne thing though, sometimes there are points in your high where you have so many things you wanna do all at once that you get stuck. If that makes any sense. \u000a\u000a** WATCH OUT! IT&#39;S THAT FIYAH! **

VStrain: Sour OG (Sour Diesel / OG Kush cross -- Hybrid)\u000aTHC: 25.57%\u000aCBD: 0.08%\u000aGrower: RM\u000aLocation found: KaLeafa \u000aDate purchased: 4.21.16\u000aPrice: $23.00 for an \u215bth (with Thursday -20% off and Loyalty Points used)\u000aWeight: 3.5g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: Not what I was anticipating and that is why I bought it. Diesel coated earth with a squeeze of lemons. It was more diesel than some Sours I have been finding in the PDX, there was a hint of lemon, a little earthy Jack type smell and the OG was in the back drop until the scissors sliced through it. \u000aLook: Dense green nugs coated in kif. Not the typical bud structure for diesels. Not trimmed perfect but the leaf that is left is so little and crystal coated no touch up was needed.\u000aTaste: These are two of my favorite tastes that are present in so many other strains that I know and love. My expectations are very high. :) It was pretty smooth on the inhale but nearly no Diesel flavoring lingering behind for my enjoyment. Literally very little for Kush or Diesels shining through. It was similar in flavor to some Jack variations I have had the luck of smoking. If I did not pick the flower myself and smell it again... \u000aRecommendation for medicine: I took the word \u201cBalanced\u201d out of in front of Hybrid on this one. It is not balanced. It is a weird combo. How can one be uplifted and relaxed at the same time? Try this strain (find a 22%+ version that looks amazing) and it is a paradox that is sold by the gram. Good for going into a daze and for a grand escape from the day. I have to give it a shot during the nighttime hours and see where it takes me. It does make me feel wonder, happy and ready to enjoy a small chunk of life.

VTo start off this review I&#39;m going to say this strain is a near perfect one for me. It smells amazing, nearly out of this world! In my opinion the pungent sour lemon smell is honestly the best. The taste is almost just like the smell, but with more of the OG Kush&#39;s earthy and piney undertones, which definitely become more recognizable while smoking or vaping this strain.\u000a     Sour OG also has some very good medicinal uses. I personally have crippling anxiety and depression, and this strain helps me through the daily roller-coaster that is life. Whenever I&#39;m high off of this strain, my whole world lights up and really lets me socialize and function with society. It helps me be a better person and gives me the energy to go do something with my day.   \u000a     As someone who uses cannabis regularly, I love having different strains to choose from when buying, and Sour OG is a strain I always love getting from my dealer. These are reasons why it gets 5 stars from me. \u000a\u000aTL;DR: SMOKE THIS RIGHT NOW [7]

VI am new to smoking marijuana for anything but parties when I was younger. I went to a local dispensary and explained that I have 6/10 pain level all the time. The budtender was super helpful and said Sour OG is popular and could be what you need. Safe to say he was right, the smell is a weird lemon meets diesel with an earthy note and the flavor is fantastic I can still taste it minutes later and the pain is drifting away in waves of lemon and diesel.

VOne of my all time favorites. Very strong sour chem smell overpowers the earthiness of the Og Kush&#39;s lemon coffee aroma. The buds are lime green and stacked with potent crystals. The smoke is smooth with a clean kush flavor that lasts long after you exhale making it a very enjoyable and tasty strain. The high comes on fast and strong in both the head and body. It has a good functional high that allows you to get through your day smoothly and efficiently.

VSour Og is really a great strain. The Sour Diesel gives you a great feeling. The  OG gives you a heady feeling, like enlightenment and Nirvana. If feels like Jesus is giving me a bath both literally and figuratively, with upmost respect nothing crass or dishonorable. If you see the representation he is the higher being and his mere presence is a blessing. This man is holiest of holy, king of kings the lord of   Lords, hale of all men. I kneel and I present him the Sour OG

VThis is my first review on here and it&#39;s due to this amazing bud I got yesterday at Recreational Highway 7 store in Tacoma, I was just touring around, I&#39;m from Seattle on some green crack strain that i was not so big on,  asked for something Euphoric yet focusing, got this and out of the many strains including new ones I always get, this is up there top 3, i need to go over some other ones but this gives you a relaxing feeling, just takes all your racing thoughts, throws em in the trash, allows you to focus on things you are usually lazy  or to amped when you get high and the taste is surprisingly SMOOTH strain, a strong Earthy, Citrus aroma that will allow you to get stuff done and multi task in a positive mode,  It&#39;s probably a top for me. PS. It haves a great sticky feel akin to the Gorilla#5 strain, should be up there with Golden PineApple and better then Blue Dream , recommended\u000a\u000a\u000aPS. On Another Side note, it skips my mind but I got this down in my first tour drive around Tacoma  at HIghway7 cant remember the guys name but he picked it out, nice collection, not sure about the lines, more employeed to help would be be nice but nice look, excuse the typos I&#39;m semi focused yet stoned, I hope this helps someone.

VSimply the smell of it made me want to keep smoking it- milky clean light pine \u000aI started the day off in a little bit of an irritable mood, seeing as a Islam person just beheaded a woman in Oaklahoma who refused to convert and was trying to get people to convert at his job. Islam big religion of peace! LMAO what a joke.\u000aI toked this bowl in a little bubbler  &amp; instantly felt something change in my mood. I thought about our second amendment and first amendment rights, and how Canada is trying to make a &quot;Blasphemy Law&quot; punishing anyone who talks &quot;bad&quot; about Islam, making the USA the remaining King of the entire world, of free speech, and how special it is to preserve this for everyones religious and secular alike!!&#39;s freedom here. :) It is that simple. I love America and would die for others  to protect free speech and freedom of religious and secular beliefs all in all. Create some art, speech or writing today and celebrate your freedom you have while you have it. America is the only nation left in the world with the first amendment and second amendment now as an essential base of their culture! :)\u000aI&#39;m so grateful to smoke weed in such a place!\u000a\u000aLight olive green festive with curly tangy hairs like orange confetti, with a milked aroma of earthy forest feeling. A taste that makes you want to smoke it just to taste that again. The high though...Did I just open the door to Narnia, or did I just age backwards into a child like state permanently? I can&#39;t tell... I mean, my spirit feels light as a feather while being to flock together with any flock while adhering to my own.  Any focus will be stripped to the root, beautifully, euphorically. Wait, am i now Harley Quinn now... oh Sh%* . harley quinn vibes! To my head to my toes I feel one with being human...first and second amendment rights are right in line with what it means to be human. hehe\u000aAnywho...this strain is best for those with depression, those temporarily lacking mental clarity and peace due to stress, or have inflammation or are working out right after smoking this.

VYou get exactly what a hybrid should give.  A nice blend of motivation which can morph into the indica couch lock that you need at night.  Sour OG is the most consistent strain for me.  Most of my flowers come from a wide variety of growers, some okay, some great.  While the varying degrees of amazing for this flower increases/decreases in conjunction with how amazing each grower is, the Sour OG strain&#39;s ability to consistently do it&#39;s job remains steadfast.  \u000a\u000aThis helped me with: anxiety from PTSD, gastrointestinal disorders, as well as insomnia.\u000a\u000aI love to blend this with Ghost Train Haze, as well as Sour Diesel, as the strength of those sativas reduces the couch lock.

VThis is an excellent afternoon/social strain that combines a buzzy, smiley head high with a relaxed, stoney body.

VThis is powerful stuff that will hit you fast. I always end up smoking too much. You probably will only need about 2-3 hits before you are feeling it. This is a hybrid of 55-45 in favor of Sativa and that&#39;s exactly what it feels like. This starts out as a powerful energetic Sativa head buzz and finally tapers off into a lazy Indica body buzz where you are ready to get some munchies and hit the couch. This strain will eliminate any pain that you have, no matter how severe. The one downside that may be for some people is the powerful fragrance. I had this in a metal box in the bottom of my closed drawer and you could still smell it out in the hallway. I don&#39;t have to hide mine from anyone but you might, so take the proper precautions if necessary.

Long time smoker but just recently starting to become more conscious of strain names and how they differ from each other and their attributes. I&#39;m an experienced smoker and not a light weight at all, but I feel like this is my first time getting high!!! Realllllly in my head but with a strong body high! Borderline too intense but I know how too pace myself, overall I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for beginners, and I would say if you are looking for more of a &quot;trip&quot; and a very up high with both heady and body highs ....this is for you

VI like the sour diesel strain.It has always worked for me.This strain (from Emblem) was in the low 20&#39;s (THC),and almost no CBD.I take nabilone for CBD so my lungs don;t have to do it.\u000aThis is a balanced strain with good therapeutic value,and a pleasant effect. I have RA and this strain helps with pain management,as well as the frequent nausea I experience on cimzia day,or methotrexate day..My sleep patterns ( I wear a fitbit) are improved whenever I have a good sour diesel type around,and I feel good overall. The aroma and flavor with this sour OG is a bit different than sour diesel but it has a similar effect. Aurora&#39;s Odin(sour diesel) is also very good. Recommended,from either supplier.

VI may be a newcomer to this thing, but Sour OG is my favorite strain so far. It&#39;s a pretty &quot;in your face&quot; hybrid as these things go, as I&#39;m in a state of somewhat intense tripping. My concept of time is off, but happily so. I&#39;m in the moment. I&#39;m energetic, switching between tasks pretty often. I do have the munchies like nobody&#39;s business, which is worth noting.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m energetic, still creative and not couch-locked, which is great. But neither do I ever get a feeling of paranoia or jitters or anything. A truly awesome strain.

Vbig fan of OG&#39;s here, and have to say that Sour OG, is similar to SOUR D.ha-ha anyways the smell and taste is that of the sour flavor, like sour d.ha the high hits quick and fast like most OG&#39;s I&#39;ve experienced, which makes it a favorite when trying to get a buzz quick. grab this if you can, or if ur a sour d fan.ha

VThis strain does wonders for anxiety and general low mood. The high is uplifting and quite relaxing with increased consumption. Sour OG is a great strain for daytime activity or just kicking it around the house. Tasted and smelled amazing. Attributes from both parent strains came through nicely.

No anxiety/paranoia (a must). Head high heavy; so very sleepy. I think anything with OG attatched must be a Indica dominant. Earthy with sweet &amp; bitter undertones (very nice). Body high exactly what I needed. Highly recommend for nighttime/bedtime use for pain/nausea.

VI like the sour diesel strain.It has always worked for me.This strain (from Emblem) was in the low 20&#39;s (THC),and almost no CBD.I take nabilone for CBD so my lungs don;t have to do it.\u000aThis is a balanced strain with good therapeutic value,and a pleasant effect. I have RA and this strain helps with pain management,as well as the frequent nausea I experience on cimzia day,or methotrexate day..My sleep patterns ( I wear a fitbit) are improved whenever I have a good sour diesel type around,and I feel good overall. The aroma and flavor with this sour OG is a bit different than sour diesel but it has a similar effect. Aurora&#39;s Odin(sour diesel) is also very good. Recommended,from either supplier.

VThis particular sativa dominant phenotype is a visually stunning creature. Spindly yet super dense, this flower produces small and medium size colas that spike off every direction. Forest green with just the slightest presence of lavender, if you look carefully, you can also spot burnt orange pistils blending in among the generous covering of frosty trichomes. Taste and aroma are what I would expect from this plant, given it\u2019s ancestry. Great clear-headed sativa hybrid that will likely find a place within the hearts of fans of both the Sour &amp; NYC Diesels, and other chem/diesely hybrids like Headband, Chemdawg, Gorilla Glue, etc. If you see this in your local dispensary or LP it\u2019s definitely worth the grab.

VA Perfect Marriage of 2 Top Shelf Strains of their own Perfections. Has the Best from both Parents . Perfect as Medicine for almost all Mental and Emotional issues , and Minor Physical Discomforts . Very potent due to it&#39;s really high Cannabinoid and THC content , so just one little hit of just a little would be sufficient enough for at least an hour and even up to a few more for Novice use , mild symptoms , and those wanting to be careful as not to be Agitated and not to Aggravate and or Induce Anxiety . Great for Recreation , Meditation , and Socializing . Provides plenty of Mental and Physical Relaxation . Relieves Stress , Depression , Worry OCD , Racing Thoughts , Paranoia , and Negative Self Consciousness .  It is Generously Uplifting , and Invigorating . Provides Good , Gentle Body Feelings similar to Opiates . Helps to Focus and let go of Negativity . Euphoria , Socializing , and Psychedelic effects are very Possible . Imagery can become very Pronounced . Visuals and Colors can become Very Sharp , Bright , Well Integrated  Expand , Bend , Float , Swirl , Blur , Smudge , Dance , Sway , Lean , Pulsate , Project , and become Well Contrasted . Patterns and Movements can become more , and quickly noticable . Sudden small dark and or bright Orbs and bright colorful Fairy like looking figures may be seen . The Effects are Strong and Instant , and Subtly Intensify , Change , and Grow .  Grows Good and Strong and with Full Potential . The Aroma of the Cured Flower has the real Smoky Diesel , Sour Grapefruit and Astringent Medicinal smell of Bandaids from the Sour Diesel parent , as well as Balsam Fir , Raw Limes , Wet Forest Floor , and a Musky Mushroom aroma from the Ocean Grown Kush parent . From a distance the smell is Skunky and of Roasted Chestnuts . The Flowers are very big , strong , round , and compact . They are very resinous , sticky , and completely covered in numerous Trichomes of all shapes , sizes , colors, and hues . The taste from eating and smoking is just like the smell . Smooth and strong . Leaves a distinct numby , Smoky Dairy and sour puckery taste and feel similar to Analgesic . The Experience is an Evolving One . Great for Anything . Very Approachable , and Very Enjoyable

VMigraine pain scale has been 5-6 lately. Medicated in the evening sometime after work. Nausea 4. Bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. Head high moderate but not too much very, nice. Body high very nice as well. Don&#39;t remember much bout taste as this was a couple of days ago. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (a must for me). Only thing that bummed me out was I was already coming down hard an hour after medicating. Gonna hafta try this one again to decide if I like it or not.

VI really love this one. It&#39;s took the edge off my stress and aided my appetite (that&#39;s a good thing for me) and nausea just enough to eat some. A little bit of tryptophan-feeling tiredness, not necessarily a bad thing. Probably a good sleep aid. Strangely also energizing. I&#39;ll just say it would be good to ingest before a debate if you had to be high. Focused and talkative about &quot;the issues&quot;.

VMy favorite strain thus far. Made me talkative and happy about most anything. Food tastes rad, as you would guess. It doesn&#39;t knock you out or anything, but as soon as you&#39;re ready to go to bed, the process of finding sleep is a very zen and content one. Pretty damn strong. Made a tea with it and then smoked a bowl, and I was completely on another planet, forgetting how to navigate my own house.

VThis particular sativa dominant phenotype is a visually stunning creature. Spindly yet super dense, this flower produces small and medium size colas that spike off every direction. Forest green with just the slightest presence of lavender, if you look carefully, you can also spot burnt orange pistils blending in among the generous covering of frosty trichomes. Taste and aroma are what I would expect from this plant, given it\u2019s ancestry. Great clear-headed sativa hybrid that will likely find a place within the hearts of fans of both the Sour &amp; NYC Diesels, and other chem/diesely hybrids like Headband, Chemdawg, Gorilla Glue, etc. If you see this in your local dispensary or LP it\u2019s definitely worth the grab.

VOg sour is a true hybrid. It starts of with a nice clear head high, after 45mins to an hour the head high starts to fade away and the body high kicks in full gear lasting another hour, then you start to come down... Now the come down is very relaxing and sleepy feeling, along with the munchies... you eat a little something &amp; hit the bed and you are out for the night, &amp; when you wake up you feel totally re energized... I sleep like a baby... Now for the medical side; Good for pain, stress, anxiety &amp; nausea... The buds definitely have that &quot;kush&quot; structure with a diesel lemon smell... the taste is great, it has that distinct sour taste &amp; the smoke is very easy on tha lungs. All in All, Donald Trump approves &amp; gives PSD &#127807;&#127807;&#127807;&#127807; 4 out 5. Highly recommend (pun intended) lol Peace, 420TRUMP.

I find myself chatting with  strangers and laughing more. It helped me to rediscover who I am and who I&#39;d like to be. No paranoia whatsoever. I would find myself drifting off and contemplating the intricacies of life in this wild universe, which is awesome and exactly what you&#39;d expect from a strain like this. Two thumbs way way up.

VI freaking love this strain, Sour OG is truly a great 50/50 Hybrid, one that actually hits me both ways everytime! The main reason why I like it so much is because I can medicate with it at any point of the day and still be able to function properly AND still be totally blown lol. These beautiful tight buds are a must try for anyone wanting to use it for Anxiety, Pain, Spasms and or Depression. Definitely a 5 star bud.....

VOverall a solid and heavy-hitting strain. Nugs are a bit sticky with a light green color, not too bright and not too dark. VERY pungent!!! The dank is quite overwhelming at times, but other than that the scent strays towards the regular kush profiles (earthy, etc.). The high starts off around my temples/back of my eyes and quickly spreads downwards throughout my whole body. I like this strain because it doesn&#39;t knock you the hell out but at the same time you get a very nice indica buzz. The sativa portion manifests itself in your mind and spirit, and will rid of worry and stress while boosting your mood. I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars because for whatever reason I was getting slight headaches a few hours after the smoke (and this RARELY happens when trying different strains). Update: After trying out this strain for a week I seem to get more frequent headaches from it, 3/5.

As the high progressed I felt very tingley and was very zoned in. Also you felt as if you were walking on clouds. Toward the end of the high it pretty much knocked me out. It gave me an amazing sleep as well as when i woke up. Great strain if you want to hang with your friends at a house.

VOk this one definitely deserves another review. After trying so many different strains, I went back to Sour OG this morning and instantly was reminded of why I&#39;m in love with this strain. And not because it&#39;s a knock out, because it&#39;s the freshest, most uplifting creative high, without anxiety, that I&#39;ve personally found. I have some shatter and I wish I had more of it! Do Not pass this one up! Definitely a great one for socializing!

VOk smoke, but honestly not too impressive. I have tried some from scc in sacramento, and the nugs were dense and we&#39;ll trimmed but came across with a weak flavor and very mild effects, there is a nice sour smell but it doesn&#39;t translate into flavours present in the smoke like with most sour strains, and all I could taste was a resinous flavour.

VGood sour taste, strong smell and initially a good head high, but very short-lived. It only lasted about 1 hour max after smoking. Didn&#39;t notice any pain relief. The batch consisted of very small flower/buds with a lot of shake, so it must have been the end of the batch. Disappointing and wouldn&#39;t get again.

VGave me a strong sativa &quot;head high&quot; shortly after consumption. 30 minutes later, the indica &quot;couch locked&quot; feeling came into play a little bit, but not so much that I couldn&#39;t still be productive. Not the best strain I&#39;ve ever had, but definitely far from the worst. Highly recommend giving it a try.

VI just tried sour og right now for the first time. Feels like what it is, a sativa dominant hybrid. Very pretty and very potent. Smells very similar to sour diesel. The smoke was smooth. The high is like a sativa high but not as spacey and dizzy. Body feels relaxed and loose. I definitely feel uplifted and awakened. My head high feels nice and relaxing. I see this as a day strain. It didn&#39;t give me real anxiety, but it did make me a little uneasy. I will smoke a little less next time to see if I don&#39;t get that raciness I got this time around. I tried this in the evening, so I will try this again in the morning and test it as a wake and bake strain. I will review it again after I have done so. For now I rate this a high 3 Stars.

VA++\u000a\u000aA great cross between two amazing strains. I prefer OGs over SOUR og, just because I feel the SOUR takes away the flowery jet fuel of the OG and replaces it with a planty cherry type aroma. \u000a\u000aNot complaining though, resin is through the roof, and nugs pluck off with plenty of goo adhesion backed protest.

VI was very impressed with this Strain. It has a nice shade of green with high lights of orange running through it. I agree with its description, it&#39;s a sit at home with pals and smoke type of leaf. Although be careful of smoking too much, this stuff will make you pass out really fast. I would say wait at least 45 minutes to an hour before you take another spin.

VPowerful Strain and a little goes a long way. Has that hint of diesel smell but is mainly filled with the OG fruity flavors. In fact this strain stinks so bad I bought a half gram Co2 cartridge here in vegas made by Matrix and the actual bag that held the airtight glass cartridge smelled strong. Usually you can&#39;t smell herb in a cartridge! The taste is amazing! Upon smoking in vape pen, Tastes like actual herb unlike many co2 cartridges. Def has that uplifting sativa high. As you can see with my name I&#39;m not a fan of indica. Only part of the indica I noticed is dizziness but I also smoked too much &#128540;. This side effect is listed here on leafly. The dispensary didn&#39;t have any pure sativa cartridges but I&#39;m happy with this one. Just take It slow and easy if you are using concentrates with this strain!

VOg sour is a true hybrid. It starts of with a nice clear head high, after 45mins to an hour the head high starts to fade away and the body high kicks in full gear lasting another hour, then you start to come down... Now the come down is very relaxing and sleepy feeling, along with the munchies... you eat a little something &amp; hit the bed and you are out for the night, &amp; when you wake up you feel totally re energized... I sleep like a baby... Now for the medical side; Good for pain, stress, anxiety &amp; nausea... The buds definitely have that &quot;kush&quot; structure with a diesel lemon smell... the taste is great, it has that distinct sour taste &amp; the smoke is very easy on tha lungs. All in All, Donald Trump approves &amp; gives PSD &#127807;&#127807;&#127807;&#127807; 4 out 5. Highly recommend (pun intended) lol Peace, 420TRUMP.

VThis strain brings the &#128293;&#128293;&#128293;! Reminds me of the first time I tried CA medical grade, before we had the goods here. Def worth the extra drive for me and $. Now that I&#39;ve tried it, would not hesitate to get a larger quality and save a few bucks.

VPretty and dense buds with streaks of bright orange through the lime green flower. Very sparkly. I loved this strain for wake and bake. I partake all day every day but this strain creates a body high that knocks out all pain and by 4:20 I&#39;m ready for beddy bye. The taste was a smooth blend of pine, hint of citrus, finishing with a bold, rich, coffee flavor.

VI&#39;m leaving another review after trying this as a wake and bake. I pretty much stand by what I said the first time. Very uplifting and euphoric. It&#39;s a very nice mental and physical high. The high is mostly heady, but not in a spacey way. This strain is potent because I only took 1 hit and I&#39;m pretty high right now. Again I got a little bit of uneasy raciness with my high but nothing to uncomfortable. To me,  the fact that it does make me feel a little racy makes this strain more useful for socializing and having fun, and not more serious errands or everyday duties. Although I like this strain, I will not use it for wake and bake or for before work medication. I rate this strain a high 3 starts again.

This hybrid stays true to the 50/50 as well. It had us in the clouds flying and after it had us in the clouds relaxing. It didn&#39;t make us sleepy or couch locked it just had us at a mellow state. The transition from head high to body high was extremely smooth. \u000aFor new beginner I suggest taking it slow. \u000a\u000aIt had me mumbling and zoned out at times. \u000aMy wife on the other had had her talking forever.

VWow! A lovely wax. Thick, rich brown look that smells like pine sap and a little bit of diesel. Taken through a vape pen, and makes this thick white vapor. When inhaled, tastes kind of sweet and bitter, like coffee and sugar. Leaves some very sticky, honey-like wax in the chamber. Love how tingly and happy I am, but I don&#39;t feel like I could do much in this physical - it&#39;s a good afternoon relaxing strain.

VOk, is this the same as OG X SD (OG &amp; Sour Diesel)?? That is what my review is for.\u000a\u000aW.O.W. I&#39;ve been feeling &quot;off&quot; and sick all day. Maybe I&#39;m getting a cold, or flu, or sinus infection, I dunno. Totally woozy, and tight, sore muscles ALL day.\u000a\u000aI had nothing to lose, so at 6PM I just vaped a microdose (an insanely small amount for a mouse) of SD X OG. I haven&#39;t tried this strain before so I had no idea what to expect, even though I try to fully research every strain before getting it.\u000a\u000aSo I&#39;m putzing on the computer as I have been all day, and within a few minutes my pain starts to quickly MELT OFF! I didn&#39;t even realize how much pain I was in until it released!! My headache went away, my insane tight back that&#39;s been torturing me all day melted away like magic, I feel pain-free right now. My God. Why are we pushed to take man made poisonous drugs again? Right now I. Am. Pain. Free from a TINY bit of an innocent plant.\u000a\u000aI have horrible stress and anxiety and this OG X SD took it all away.

VThis is the strain that will bring you out of the rain and make you feel sane.... Both the body and head high are powerful and could be over whelming to some. &#128531; but don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re not very experienced this is still a good strain &#128266;&#128227; very loud, but one hit is enough if you&#39;re dabbing. I have a pretty high tolerance and 2 scoops of crumble have me fully baked. &#127838;

I don&#39;t know why I expected it to be less dank, it smelled and looked great. And it smoked great too! xxD Also, if you&#39;re a thrifty bitch and you like to scrape your pipes and smoke your resin, it makes a pretty good tar for you ::) Great out of a steam roller.

VAlso known as headband it really does feel like slight pressure around the temple area. Holy crap this strain is potent I took one medium sized hit and it got me where I needed to go. Definetly take it easy if you have a low tolerance as too much gave me anxiety/paranoia but I&#39;m just prone to that with sativa strains. Sour og also eliminated my sciatica pain a lot more than some indicas have so this strain is great for day time motivation and pain relief.

V- I smoked at 6:11am. It\u2019s an overcast morning and I\u2019m purely enjoying watching cars drive by from my balcony. Can\u2019t tell if the strain induced hunger or if I was just hungry. \u000a- Body relaxation. If you have stiff muscles, you\u2019ll probably be led to find a position that better suits your posture/comfort, so it was pain-relieving in that sense, but it did not provide numbness or pharmaceutical-like pain relief. \u000a- No headache so far\u000a- Dry mouth &amp; dry eyes, as expected \u000a- Being outside would be beautiful (is beautiful, but I mean on a street surrounded by trees or a park)\u000a- Getting sleepy, closing my eyes feels good but I can still be productive (we&#39;ll see) \u000a\u000aCalmed me down for sure
