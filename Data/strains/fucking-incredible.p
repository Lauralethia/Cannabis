VI cannot find a negative comment for Fucking Incredible.  Perhaps my major complaint is my back is killing me because I renovated my front and backyard with this strain.  Every morning a bong load with a cup of coffee was fucking incredible.  Motivating because it gets me a little sleepy however folks might like that because of my hyperactivity.  This strain keeps me inspired all day.

The batch I got tested at 27%!!!  Anytime I need an indica I pick that one &amp; it never disappoints.  My tolerance is ridiculous &amp; I do mostly dabs, but this buds perfect.

It is a beautiful fluffy green, and so soft. the taste is incredible and smokes super smooth. It seems to be a sneaky high, but doesn&#39;t give me couch-lock like many other Indicas do, which is nice. Pretty decent for pain relief and anxiety.

VSo after a year of using FI to manage medial symptoms, I couldn&#39;t be happier that it still works for me today. Normally you built a tolerance to a strain if you over indulged. Just to give you an idea of how potent it is....\u000a  I smoke 0.5 - 0.75 of shatter a day. Usually 85% THC or better. Buying flowers a complete waste for me because of my tolerance.  \u000aI can buy an 8th of FI &amp; get high for 2 days. That&#39;s unheard of for me. If I smoke flower I usually have to smoke a couple blunts to catch a buzz. \u000aGet this strain. No way you&#39;ll regret it.

VThis is my favorite indica. I am a concentrate smoker, haven&#39;t found any FI wax yet, but I will buy the flower because it&#39;s strong enough. That&#39;s saying something too ; I&#39;m used to smoking wax @ 70% THC or better &amp; here&#39;s flower @ around 30% and it&#39;ll get me super toasted. \u000aBeautiful light green buds with orange hairs covered in trichomes. Oh that smell, exactly how amazing dank weed should smell. I wish I could smell that scent forever. Earthy taste, heavy stoney buzz. Some of the best nights sleep I got was after I smoked this strain. O hope some day I can find some FI concentrate.

VOkay, I&#39;m editing my review of this WONDERFUL strain.  It truly is &quot;fucking incredible&quot;....it&#39;s the BEST strain for nighttime for me, with my multiple medical issues, pain, hypervigilant insomnia, PTSD, etc., etc., the list goes on and on.  After three years of treating myself with cannabis for all these conditions, I have quite a bit of tolerance to many strains and this one just DELIVERS, every time.  I&#39;ve gone back for more three times now, without any distinguishable tolerance just yet, so this is awesome.  It is a quick acting indica for me, a few tokes, and within about 15 minutes I&#39;m ready to lay down for the night, and with this strain I don&#39;t have the multiple wakings during the night.  MAYBE once, but lately not even the one time.  So very happy with this strain and hope that I will continue to be able to get it.  The dispensary I went to first had it in beautiful plump flowers, which is what I wanted this time, but they only had pre-rolls (and I tend to not smoke it in harsher ways like this, so...a bit disappointed, but at least I could get some!)  This is five-star night time weed for me.  Get you some!  You won&#39;t be disappointed! :)

VOne of the most unique strains I&#39;ve had in a while ( I like to pick up at least 2 different strains a week.) I have been dabbing for quite some time. This strain is personally one of the most drunk feeling strains I have ever experienced. \u000a\u000aAfter I took the first dab (.075g)I found my body to instantly relax, pain I get from lower back diminished to almost nothing. I was still clear headed but yet very relaxed.\u000a\u000aAfter dab #2 (.1g) I found my self zoning out at my rig for about a minute after taking the dab. My mind began acting cloudy. This dab left a smile on my face and I began laughing at the most random stuff.\u000a\u000aAfter dab #3 (.1g) after taking dab 3 I began feeling the drunk feeling creeping up. I began to lose balance and my already cloudy mind got even hazier if that&#39;s even a word lol. My girlfriend and I finished off the night watching Malcom in the middle.\u000a\u000aLater on I fell asleep and woke up feeling great! Great way to get alcohol effects without hurting your body and the nasty hangover. \u000a\u000aI recommend this strain for those trying to relieve the toughest back pain. I also recommend that you ensure you have no responsibilities the rest of the night because this strain will fuck you up&#128526;\u000a\u000aOverall effects \u000aHappy\u000aRelaxed \u000aGiggly\u000aOff balance \u000a

VPicked up a gram of this, by Doc Croc, on the advice of a budtender from Natural Blessing in Tacoma/Spanaway, WA. This stuff lives up to its name - for more than one reason. At a total potency of 37.5% it took my wife and I 4 hours to get through one very small bowl, a few hits at a time.\u000a\u000aThe high comes on fast, with a buzzy tingling sensation around the eyes and back of the head. The arousal quotient on this one is intense - even more than Banana Kush. If you&#39;re looking for something to enhance the mood, this is a great one to pick up.

VI\u2019m on the fence with this strain. Usually after one puff, I\u2019m super relaxed, sleepy, and ready to pass out. It seems to suddenly hit me after a few minutes. However, if I smoke just a liiiiiittle bit too much, I get crazy anxiety, panic, and feel like I\u2019m going to die. This strain is very potent and I\u2019d recommend starting off with small hits if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s prone to anxiety like I am, and give it a few minutes before deciding if you want to smoke more.

VFucking Incredible is a great strain to smoke and to grow. When growing, you immediately notice the plant&#39;s sweet, unique smell as it continues through the flowering stage. Visually, the F&#39;in Inc can get very purple, almost black, depending on finishing dates and temperature. The plant is littered with trichomes and has great bag appeal. To smoke, the smell is replicated in the taste. Very sweet.\u000a \u000a I would reccomend Fucking Incredible for anyone who suffers from Migraines, Appetite Loss, Stress, or Insomnia. It is a very strong Indica, which when growing, expresses all of the stereotypical Indica qualities - short, stocky, big buds and an impressive yielder, with a finishing time varying from 7-9 weeks. \u000a \u000a One of my personal favorites

V(.5g) OD grown\u000a\u000aFI is really FI.....So far this is my favorite treatment for insomnia, not only because it helps relieve stress after a long day, but because it leaves you with a bit of an uplifting, positive vibe that carries into the next morning (sometimes), starting the day off free from burn-out, and most depression. I have not experienced any couch-lock from this strain, but as a day time strain, she is too weak, and makes you too lazy to let you get anything done.

VFucking Incredible is a great strain to smoke and to grow. When growing, you immediately notice the plant&#39;s sweet, unique smell as it continues through the flowering stage. Visually, the F&#39;in Inc can get very purple, almost black, depending on finishing dates and temperature. The plant is littered with trichomes and has great bag appeal. To smoke, the smell is replicated in the taste. Very sweet.\u000a\u000aI would reccomend Fucking Incredible for anyone who suffers from Migraines, Appetite Loss, Stress, or Insomnia. It is a very strong Indica, which when growing, expresses all of the stereotypical Indica qualities - short, stocky, big buds and an impressive yielder, with a finishing time varying from 7-9 weeks. \u000a\u000aOne of my personal favorites.

VI love this strain. Best one for me by far. I felt happy and light hearted after smoking. It lasts several hours after only 2 small hits. It helps headaches while on it, and pain in my body is gone. But the next morning it causes a headache almost hangoverish. The dry mouth and eyes is another side effect. I did noticeI did not get hungry with this strain. You get the munchies but not so bad that you feel sick if you don&#39;t eat. Usually some juice or a soda takes care of that. Hope this one sicks around :)

A large dose feels like being completely covered in a thick comforter. \u000a\u000aWould smoke again. 100%\u000a\u000aAdditional: will make you cough. A lot.

VTrue to its name. I have extensive, intense, chronic pain. This stuff is Fucking Incredible at handling my pain. I bought some beautiful nugs and made my own oil that I take in capsules so I can&#39;t give you a review on smoke or taste.

VMellow low grade high.  Smooth smoke but didn&#39;t taste very good.  Looked like brown dirt weed.  Worst I&#39;ve had in a very long time.

VBeen smoking high quality flowers for 38 years and know a little about how one is supposed to feel.  This med was so bad it has to rank up there with the worst stuff I have ever vaped.  Brown and ugly smelling from the Discount DePOT in Phoenix.  I would never waste any money on this stuff or on the dePOT.

VOk... This strain isn&#39;t bad, but I tend to lean towards the ones which don&#39;t mess with the head as bad. It was a good feeling and I did feel the pain reside a little, but then I found myself a little anxious. I will try this one more time, if anything changes, I&#39;ll be sure to update this review.
