VGreat strain if you are looking for a productive high. I really enjoy the the chill but awake feeling this gives you. would be great in the morning for a wake n bake with a cup of coffee. Has a little bit of a sneak up so the first time smoking I got super stoned. But even so I felt productive throughout it.

VDurban Poison with a twist is how I describe this strain. Maybe Durban Poison with a punch is better. The effects are DP like with an extra stony edge. I am still very uplifted, but my mind wanders a bit more than with Durban Poison.\u000aDense nugs, with an earthy, pine and citrus taste.\u000aRecommended.

VThe first time I had it, I tried as hard as possible to make it last forever, and I actually missed it when I finished what I had!   Thus I write a review. Nature is extra awesome- music as well.  Great enhancer . On my top 5 list.

VAmazing! I picked this up yesterday at Kushside in Everett, WA as 2 .5 gram pre-rolls marked @ 29% THC through Fireline ( and for anyone that knows there flower it&#39;s always consistently great stuff and I can honestly say for myself anytime I have ever purchased there flower I&#39;ve never been disappointed) which is cheap for them so was pumped then again Kushside always has cheap deals :) Anyways I struggle with PTSD and was have one of those funky days where just felt fatigue, edgy, and just didn&#39;t even want to be touched. I decided to blaze up 1 of the joints and after I finished it WOW, what a difference I have energy feel way better and gave me a nice appetite which is a bonus for me cause I struggle with lack of appetite. Will for sure fall back on this strain again.

VI got White Durban in the Platinum Vapes Oil. After the first few hits I was relaxed, and gave me a major case of the munchies.  Strong chronic pain relief, and intense euphoric sensations.  Had laser like focus, my mood was uplifted and got sleepy near the end of the buzz..

VThe high in his strain is good, energizing and heady. But the next morning headache and hangover is so awful for me. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it. won&#39;t be buying this strain again.

Vprocured a beautiful specimen grown by fireline. I don&#39;t review a whole lot of sativas but this one keeps me coming back. it has a very pungent aroma like a strong musk. virtually no sweetness to this one. heavy-hitting as well so expect to cough and look stoned as yum (i.e. red, glossy eyes). overall the high was euphoric and unbelievably cerebral. good times.

VQuality quality strain. A few extra bucks per gram but totally worth it. Great daytime smoke that tastes great. All you need is a pinch in the bowl and you will be set for hours. Very potent and lasts a long time.
