VI am in love with this strain. I&#39;m a busy mom on the go and I can&#39;t do high THC strains. I&#39;ve tried a plethora of CBD (in flower form) trying to find one that has minimal brain fog but high pain relief and this is it! I have a lot of muscle pain, and high high anxiety. And this strain hits them both, leaving me relaxed &#128154; if you like this, you may also like puffins farm &quot;danceplace&quot;.. Another great pain feeling strain

VThis strain works great for inflammation, pain, and anxiety. Best of all, it doesn&#39;t cause any kind of intoxication or head change (other than an improved mood) so I can use this to relieve symptoms of my Hashimoto&#39;s Disease and rheumatoid arthritis while still performing day-to-day functions as normal.

Vaka &quot;Z7&quot;.   Very dense buds, nice and easy smoke, mild chocolate and woody flavors.  i am a daily smoker and the balance of sativa to indica is a welcome reprieve from some of the mind-blowing strains i&#39;ve been lucky to enjoy.  the cbd content really helps with relaxing the neck and shoulders.

VI am a patient with MS and am using this strain for pain and a bit of anxiety.  I am using it in an oil vape cartridge through my Florida Dispensary (Trulieve).  It gives a nice dreamy feel without going over the top but squashes headaches, anxiety and some overall pain.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s giving WAY more relief than I expected.  This strain is amazing with just a tiny bit of THC and higher CBD.  Very good medicinal effects.

VAlso known as Z7, this is the perfect &quot;morning&quot; smoke for me. The little bit I picked up at High Tide Wellness Center in Brookings-Harbor, OR has only 0.6% THC and a whopping 16.4% CBD. A couple hits and I&#39;m good for either sitting in my office chair all day or behind the wheel of my car for a few hours. It really alleviates the bursitis in my hips as well as the tendonitis in my knees, but doesn&#39;t give me any psychoactive effects letting me do what I need to do with energy and clearheadiness.

VI&#39;ve had chronic back and leg pain for many years. I picked up this remedi spray tinkature. It&#39;s a balance 1:1 the,cbd. When I take mine I pass right out. And I sleep deep!! I usually get up 6-8 times a night. Last night I woke up 2 times. It worked great. Yes I still got up 2 times but it&#39;s a huge step from 6-8 times a night. Again, I&#39;ll take it and my eyes would be heavy in around 15-20 mins and it kills the pain!! Finally found pain relief!!

VIn CT, I have used Theraplant&#39;s Remedy concentrate through a Yocan Evolve Vaporizer for 6 months.  With a couple exceptions, it has been the only strain I smoked during this time.  With a very mild mental high, deep relaxation of mind and body, and inducing no hunger, it has eased my detoxification on a mostly fruit diet with extensive Robert Morse N.D. herbals. For the past few weeks I have increased periods of intermittent fasting from both food and water.  Old beliefs, anger, sorrow, depression, anxiety are being released like never before. Insomnia is fading as well.  The mind-body phenomenon is not who we are.  Peace.

I also get really,  really bad tension and migraine headaches and this makes them go away almost instantly. it also helps with my anxiety. I use it in tincture form and take it by the sublingual method. It has helped me so much and I&#39;ve been able to cut back substantially on my conventional meds.

VFound Remedy to be the most potent CBD flower to date.  My experience does seem to divert from the norm and it has with other high CBD strains.  I personally find them very intoxicating.  Maybe due to the fact that THC is so regular in my body that there has never been a too high moment with pot.  There have been extremely over the top stoned events where I still felt my head was with me enough to keep it together.  \u000a\u000aRemedy gave me a smack down of tranquility that worked out in my favor, but could have gone the other way.  Due to the happy ending plus surprisingly strong pain relief and much needed rest.  When I say strong do not take that lightly for when I realized my iPhone was missing my head hit the pillow......\u000a\u000aLuckily there was sense enough to go online to lock the phone with a message on how to reach me.  The exact location of the phone was right in front of me.  It was directly in front of the dispensary in which the medicine was bought.  Six hours later some honest girl walked out, found it, and brought it to a slumbering fool.  It was six hours later and there was gratitude beyond belief.  \u000a\u000aGratitude that  motivated my butt to go right back down and grab some more of this strain.  It did literally knock me out with a strong foggy hangover for a good 24 hours.  Now as I smoked more of it the effect got more regular and was not so debilitating.  As a heavy smoker of heavy percentage THC strains I could not work or do much except veg out.  The smell alone of light fragrant flowers is dreamy so def grab some of this flower if you see it around.

VThe lab I extract for carries this strain and it is one of the most unique strains you&#39;ll ever try. Oil is very soft and will only shatter if you put it on a cold plate.

I don&#39;t think I experienced any head highs, and I&#39;ve taken these all week.

VLook out big pharma because Remedy is a medicinal miracle! I get it in tincture form. For insomnia I take 40 to 60 milligrams about 30 minute before sleep. In lower doses (10 to 20 milligrams) during the day for PTSD: Anxiety, Panic, Muscular Tension. Remedy helped me get off Xanax. It relieves inflammation in my body and has lowered my blood pressure!

VLove this strain.  I buy my MJ exclusively in vape format and prefer very little (but still some) THC content, because  I&#39;m very susceptible to paranoia.  Remedy eliminates my lower back pain, but (at least in vape format) still provides just enough head buzz to enjoy while out on the town partying.  Definitely lowers my cocktail consumption, which is also great.  If you primarily want pain relief but still want just a touch of buzz, this is a great vape choice.

I need to maintain a &#39;high&#39; level of engagement and attentiveness while coping with anxiety, severe back pains (from holding those babes!) and just keep on track with the day to day of being a stay at home mother and homemaker with tons of household and farm chores. I&#39;m somewhat farm-strong but dealing with the wear and tear of so much work. This is my remedy! Keeps my head clear and my body supported. My patience high and focus right where it needs to be. Now, if I could only get a hold of some clones! I&#39;m still vaping what I grew two years ago. And yes! It still calls to duty just like I need it to.

VIt&#39;s helpful to sleep. It does not have any THC (label reads 0%) so no psychoactive component. If I just want to sleep, not have to function, I will use it at bedtime. For this, I use a Wulf vape. If I fill the chamber and smoke it all, I will feel quite dizzy, pretty thirsty, and really not present, quite rapidly. This is fine, since I want to sleep, and it is effective for this. I do suffer from chronic pain 2&#176; a motor vehicle accident three years ago, but none of the strains I have tried have helped that pain, and that includes this Z7. What happens is that the sleepiness over-rides the awareness of pain - if that makes sense. I don&#39;t actually care how it all works, as long as I am able to enjoy the strains I choose, to achieve whatever effect I need at that time. And this Z7 (Remedy) works for a good, long sleep without waking up. I do wake, after about 3 or 4 hours, and I just hit the vape again, and go back to sleep for another few hours. This is way better than the waking up every 45 minutes, every night, that has been my experience for the last 3 years, so for me, this is perfectly good.\u000a\u000aCheers!

VThis was my first ever cannabis smoke. I have sever panic attacks and general anxiety. I was looking for a high CBD to help me with this without the nasty side effects of benzos or antidepressants.\u000aI got this strain because I&#39;m scared that a head high would give me more anxiety, or I wouldn&#39;t like a strange feeling and panic from it. The one I got was tested at 0.77% THC, 16.1% CBD\u000a\u000aI was a bit scared of what I would feel, but gave it a go and... I felt NOTHING. Nothing in the head, which is good, but also nothing in my anxiety. After about 40 minutes, my anxiety lessened a bit, which... it normally fluctuates anyway in about these time frames, so I can&#39;t tell if it had something to do with the Remedy or not. I would be more inclined towards normal fluctuations or even placebo effect.\u000a\u000aThinking that maybe the day, first time use or something could be related to this lack of effect, I kept smoking everyday. Still I think that if there are any calming effects, then they are VERY mild.\u000a\u000aI started slow, but I end up smoking between 8 and 15 pulls per smoke session, but still doesn&#39;t help me.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m rating it at 3/5 because it didn&#39;t give me negative effects, which is a big plus. (Except sweaty feet, which I think was strange, but don&#39;t mind it)

I like to wait and put CBD strains to the ultimate test of the dreaded time of the month. This quickly eased my cramps, dulled my back pain and even helped the dizziness. The best part is I took only half my dose of my normal sleep medication and this helped knocked me out for the rest of it.

VMy favorite strain I have ever tried by far. Not really psychoactive, but definitely medicinal. If you have anxiety this is the strain for you. Anxiety will melt away and then some. The first time I tried this strain was as a preroll from a dispo in Seattle and after finishing it I wanted to go do some parkour. You will feel high on this strain, but you won&#39;t really be high due to how low in thc it is.  Great strain for just about any time of the day and any situation. While it is an indica, I find the body sedation is very minimal compared to a traditional high thc indica.

VThis review is for Lemon Remedy. This stuff is awesome. Great lemon/citrus smell and the same great taste. This stuff is sticky as hell. It seems Lemon Remedy has a little higher THC content then just Remedy. High came on slow but kept creeping up on me till I just felt warm and content. The high only lasted for about an hour (1.5 maximum) but the relaxation and pain relief worked a bit longer. This did wonders for a back spasm I had been dealing with for a few days. Took another toke right before bed and got a great nights sleep and my back was much better in the morning. All that CBD did the trick. I&#39;ll be buying more of this soon!

If you are looking for a high CBD strain that is an indica then try CBD OX much better then Remedy. &#128540;&#128076;&#127996;

VWe bought this in a preroll. It was tested at 20% THC and 1.o% cbd. We had never tried anything with cbd measured so we gave it a shot this weekend while camping. We started the cone but like always felt bad about wasting so much, we emptied it into a pipe. I don&#39;t know that we noticed any different effects from this strain above anything else we brought with us to smoke. The one difference was my wife&#39;s menstrual cramps went away immediately after smoking this strain. I still didn&#39;t get any, but I think I&#39;m on the right track.

VThis strain is legit. I&#39;m a highly sensitive person and was looking for a relaxing indica that wasn&#39;t overbearing. This fit the bill. The slight sedative effects are mellowed out by the CBD. This is the only Indica strain that I&#39;ve found with such a high ratio of CBD to THC. I use this at homd to relax. When I go out, I might switch it up and use a CBD sativa like Dancehall.

VAs always my strains reviews are geared towards medical marijuana patients in legal marijuana states. \u000a\u000a*This strains is truly a medical grade strain. It focuses on the CBD aspects with just enough THC and other cannabinoids to give that entourage effect to tackle a wide variety of aliments. \u000a* Very nice body relaxing which will ease pain and relax anxieties it can also be used to for sleep aid strain either way day or night this strain is good for whatever with very very little head high.

VThis is my lifesaver from panic attacks. It&#39;s very heavy-feeling so I&#39;ve only done it at home in the evening with nowhere else to go, but man is this packed with a ton of fuck-it. \u000a\u000aIt obliterates my short term memory span. I can&#39;t hold onto a thought for more than 5-10 seconds at a time. This is GREAT for panic attacks, which occur when I can&#39;t stop chewing on something and it gets so big in my head I can&#39;t move past it. Each time I started to have those anxious thoughts and feel my chest hurting, I&#39;d forget what was upsetting me and move on to something else. I think it was honestly a miracle the other night--I was a boneless hunk of nothing on the couch but at least I wasn&#39;t thinking I was having a hard attack. \u000a\u000aMajor dry mouth and dry eyes here. Other than that, this is a must-have for my panic attacks.
