VIt creeps up on you , but it will hit you hard .  All around great smoke! Taste is very earthy with spicy undertones. The high is uplifting, happy, and mood enhancing with a nicely balanced over all buzz, that will last for a while . If by any chance you need it for sleep too &amp; smoke while your relaxed , I garuntee it will put you to sleep nice :) I highly recommend this strain

VThis strain is incredible and definitely worth trying! I would describe this strain as a more hallucinagenic version of Deathstar. It&#39;s very relaxing, uplifted, euphoric and happy. Definitely an amazing strain for just hanging out, sleeping and thinking. I also highly recommend it for depression. I also have some crazy thoughts when I smoke Lost Coast OG, in a good way! Highly recommended.

VThis bud starts off with a flower or floral taste that turns earthy as you vaporize it. I use a vape that uses flower rather than oil. Began with a little eye pressure that quickly became euphoric. A great bud for a long an emotionally exhausting day. Not a bad flower but fairly mild and slow onset. Definitely something I&#39;ll use before or during work.

VLasts fairly long, maybe 2 hours. Was told this strain has high cbn levels, which is even more beneficial than cbd for me. Really helped with my pain and gave me greater mobility. Felt a bit sluggish and full feeling, so best for when you don&#39;t need to be too energized. Really beautiful, complex flavors due to the many terp of this og.

VVery enjoyable on a few levels. \u000aMade my pain manageable, def takes the edge off! I recommend consuming in whatever way works best for you - I puffed this in a h20 device &amp; in blunts because I didn&#39;t have enough to make edibles with and even though not my favourite method it was very nice. Can&#39;t wait to get some more and do some cooking! Smooth smoke, came on easy with a heady high for an Indica dominant strain. Smoke did not irritate my asthma much and it totally enhanced the conversation and energy. Anyway, pain (check). Energy (check). Did not tire out, so to speak, but wore myself out over the evening and by bed time was still feeling relaxed as opposed to like burnt lol ya know? With its taste, ease on the lungs, pain power, and uplifting stone I would definitely take a surf on Lost Coast OG again- A1

VI recently Just tried this strain for the first time from Ilera Healthcare in Plymouth Meeting PA and would give it a solid 4 out of 5 or 8 out of 10 depending on the scale. \u000a\u000a Lost Coast OG from Ilera Healthcare has around 14-15 percent THC which may not sound like alot to some but this strain gets the job done in so many ways for me. \u000a\u000aAt first glance the flower is bright green with vibrant orange hairs around it with crystals of thc oozing out of it.\u000a\u000aI picked up the flower and began to inspect it more closely before vaping it as i like to know what i&#39;m dealing with when i try new strains. \u000a\u000aLost Coast OG doesn&#39;t just look visually pleasing it smells amazing too with a lemon citrus smell that is strong but not too strong as it&#39;s aroma is very nice.\u000a\u000aI immediately knew it was time to consume this flower i had been inspecting for a minute or so, so i began to gently break apart the flower and finely separate it as if a grinder had been used in the process. Breaking apart the flower was a pleasure and my fingers were left smelling amazing as well.\u000a\u000aI quickly packed the flower into my G Pen Pro i had just gotten from the Dispensary and began to vape. \u000a\u000aLost Coast OG taste even better than it smells which is remarkable given how great it smells and looks. Just like it had smelled the lemon flavor and citrus flavors that i was tasting were incredible.\u000a\u000aThe high kicked in right away and I immediately felt relaxed and happy and uplifted at the same time.  \u000a\u000aI can definitely see myself recommending this strain to just about anybody as i find myself harder to please than the average consumer but this strain passes the test with flying colors for me!

Vthis plant does have the og taste and the weird bud formation, but it yields a little on the low side for me in a scrog dwc the potency was 18.5%thc when I tested it so for me it was on the lower end of my strains. I would say if your just getting started this would be a good starter since it is pretty easy to grow
