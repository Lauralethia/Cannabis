VI can&#39;t say it&#39;s my favorite strain because during the day I prefer something else. However, I picked this strain up at Verdes Foundation of Albuquerque, NM and I don&#39;t think there are many days where I don&#39;t have some to go through every night. Shout out to Verdes who made this strain amazing. Whatever you&#39;re doing is working and I highly recommend this strain to fans of heavy hitting indica strains.

VWhen I first got my card I had no idea what would work for nerve pain from 4 surgeries, due to the nerve being damaged during first surgery. I went around to different places and tried a lot of different strains. Most worked better than the pain medication I had taken for 12 years, but I have social anxiety, and we all know a lot of strains make you extremely paranoid, and anxiety creeps in like your ex stalking your Facebook. One day I decided to try somewhere else with some different options to choose from. I was greeted by Layla, who helped me with my 21 question game. Layla suggested Rare Darkness and mix in a little CBD strain. Grabbed my pipe when arriving home and maybe took two hits. Immediately the nerve pain just disappeared, along with back arthritis, anxiety, and ADHD (at least I am told that) squirrel. I was shocked, and in amazement. So excited I cleaned the whole house. The next day the pain was still gone even 24 hours after smoking no pain. I reloaded with only Rare Darkness this time and still today I can not believe the relief this has given me. I called and canceled doctor appointments for pain meds, physical therapy, and threw the medication I had left in the trash. Rare Darkness not only gave me my life back, but it possibly saved me from damaging my liver and stomach any more than I already had from pills. I smoke usually every three days just because, sometimes every night for life\u2019s stress. I have not taken any pain meds since Layla at Sky Dispensaries, in Ahwatukee did what no doctor could help me with. Thankful for Layla\u2019s knowledge, caring, and help is an understatement! If you suffer from chronic pain, depression, anxiety, or stress I highly recommend getting yourself at least a gram to try. A couple hits the pain is gone and I think clear, and get everything done. When you are just hanging out with nothing to do. Roll one up with Rare Darkness and enjoy the incredible high. Pure happiness and laughter. To me it is the F it high. Life calms down and my mind is not 100 miles a hour. Want to fall asleep go for it, stay awake no problem. Rare Darkness is a miracle plant for myself. I hope anyone that may feel hopeless about pain, anxiety, arthritis, depression, or having to go to your nephews Birthday party at Chuck E Cheese can find the relief this plant has given me. I also was 315 pounds before smoking Rare Darkness, I could hardly walk from the damage done in my feet. Now I am down to 250 since June, this stain does not give me, personally, the munchies, if anything I am not hungry after smoking. It\u2019s worth trying, I really hope it helps you like it has me! Once again thank you Layla at Sky Dispensaries in Ahwatukee! If you have not gone to this location well you are missing out on the best customer service, and just flat out great caring people! Not to mention great daily deals, incentives for your loyalty, wide variety of everything you could dream of, affordable prices, no pressure sales, one on one help with all your questions or needs, flower is top notch, most importantly are the people!!! You will not find a better group of people to be around!!!! Thanks to everyone at Sky Dispensaries!!!! Mike Smith

Vafter having some of this I decided to eat some strawberries. Oh my goodness! I am not kidding when I say that the strawberries from Fry&#39;s taste like freaking candy!!I don&#39;t even like fruit. This is crazy!  do you know what is an awesome song to listen to while on this strain? I will tell you. Mornin by Al Jarreau. It&#39;s such a fun song there is like no way to be in a bad mood and listen to that. I think that a man that listens to that song in his car with the windows down at full blast would have to be really confident in himself and I find that kind of sexy. You know who is really bad ass? Phil Collins! You know that song he sings about feeling it in the air tonight? That&#39;s a really good song

VI dunno maybe I&#39;m a weirdo haha but this one is not one of my favs and was kind of a bummer. I love the one parent (Rare Dankness #1) but I could leave the other. I find that this one does not hit me the way the RD #1 does, I get a little bit of a head buzz and almost negligible pain relief, like it has no punch. It set off my asthma and made me cough a lot. Nice dark buds and a decent enough taste but I think I&#39;d rather spend my $ on its mommy!

VI\ufe0f LOVE this strain. I\ufe0f suffer from anxiety, depression and PTSD and this strain is like a warm hug from a best friend. I\ufe0f took it with me on vacation to medicate with and it did not disappoint for symptom relief. \u000a\u000aOn the fun side it gave me the giggles real bad- laughing so hard I\ufe0f was crying and I\ufe0f wanted to pop in the Sandlot and have a laugh fest. I\ufe0f also wanted to have really introspective conversations and it made me feel content. There is a pleasant sense of time loss and it makes me want to get out and explore the world or curl up. Then after a bowl or two at the end of the night I\ufe0f drifted off to sleep with a smile on my face.

VThis strain is AMAZING for insomniacs. I have MS and the pain typically keeps me up at night. This helps ease the pain but more then anything just knocks me out cold. I have used it 5 times and only once was I able to stay awake for longer then an hour and a half. I&#39;ve been doing this a long time and this is the first strain to knock me out so strongly. Definitely not for day use. Perfect for late night use. Make sure you don&#39;t have anything to do! I personally will only use this right before bed and for that purpose its a great strain.

VA voluptuous smoke for the body-high lover who doesn&#39;t mind walking through the wake of a dream. Immensely helpful with pain associated with inflammation in targeted joint areas and GI tract. Notes of berry, sage, and cognac give this strain a profoundly warm draw with instant effects of sleepiness and bodily etherealness.

VMethod of consumption: Kandypen Galaxy.\u000a\u000aType: Sunflower Meds house made shatter.\u000a\u000aPros: Fast acting relaxation and pain relief. Calms mind and can cause sleep if needed. Taste is very pleasant, grape/berry flavor. \u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth and minor dry eyes. Wouldn&#39;t use if you have plans to leave the house or do something.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Relatively smooth pull and exhale. Hits the body first, then a little  behind the eyes that causes tiredness. No munchies. Couch lock is present, if you don&#39;t fall asleep. Little head effects, not really a social strain. While your mind and body will be relaxed, you&#39;ll be too relaxed/sleepy to want to do much of anything. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this if you need something to help you sleep or to relax &amp; kill pain. Nighttime/Sleep aid strain.

VWow!! &#128512;Definitely a body and head high. &#128483;Definitely an indica head high, not THC euphoric drunkenness but more thinking about something for too long and then catching yourself and saying wow I&#39;m high. &#128161;&#129300;Long slow drawn out thoughts, but in a peaceful way\u262e. 2 puffs and I am donezo (indica donezo, which for me is highly highly preferred to a Sativa donezo). Sweet draw, but not as sweet as Sapphire / Cherry Thunder Fuck (&#127826;favorite strain). 4 \u2b50s \ufe0ffor pain, 5 \u2b50\ufe0fs for turning down the mind \u23f2&#127898;I&#39;m definitely totally baked. The kind of baked where you are walking around your house and lose depth perception so you end up tripping on a &#128094; on the floor you didn&#39;t see, or hitting a table edge with your leg because you didn&#39;t realize you were that close . .

VI was disappointed with this strain. The first time used it was really relaxing, minor cerebral high. Not really sedating. As I tried the whole 1/8th, I found it less and less appealing. Low buzz, no real high and it was fleeting quickly. \u000a\u000aThe buds I got were really small, like tiny marbles and they were brittle. Not sure if this is a variable this time or not.\u000a\u000aLooks and smells great, just weak and not really sedating.

VI\u2019m giving this a 4 for now, it drops my eyes and I fell into a relaxed state within two puffs. Not for beginners lol... I moved a little slow but enjoyed fully. This is definitely a stay home and hang in bed or couch strain. I\u2019m being honest right now.. I used it just to smoke &amp; chill and I took a nap. I never take naps. I didn\u2019t wake up once when I smoked a bowl before bed. If ur having trouble staying asleep or getting to sleep this strain will call Mr. Sandman for u and it felt great. I woke up fully rested and happy! Smooth taste as well, I picked it up in flower form.&#128526;&#128541;&#129316;&#128564;

VI love the smell and flavor, but this strain knocks me out. I smoke it way too fast I guess and my tolerance is extreme right now so that may be a factor. To give you an idea, I can take 200mg and still feel like I took one hit off the bong. I don&#39;t k ow how else to explain a tolerance level. Anyway, back to the strain, I have rheumatoid arthritis, and some days are really painful for me. I use rare darkness and it allows me to deal with the pain and be happy at the same time. I wish I could find something that does this without knocking me out though. Sadly, sativa sends me on panic attack city.

Vsay goodbye to anxiety \u000athis strain has helped so much with anxiety disorder and overall mood stabilization, with minimal couch lock and and a slightly euphoric high this strain can be used during the day to easy your tension and helps with body aches and pains.
