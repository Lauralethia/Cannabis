VJack Wreck is a cross between Jack Herer and Trainwreck. Had a sour yet sweet smell to it and the high lasted a very long time. Mainly used for pain relief but can also be used for insomnia. Great taste and burns a long time.

Vgreat sativa stain for mid day.really high thc (26% for the g I picked up)so it takes away the muscle aches but it still gives you a pretty intense jolt of energy so you can keep going. I can see thc sensitive users getting some anxiety from this one so you should probably only try this one if you been smoking for awhile

VI created an account just to make this review. I am a 3-5 times a day smoker mainly for appetite. I rarely get really &quot;stoned&quot;. This reminded me of some of the first few times I smoked, it is seriously the most intense strain I have had. Vibrant and energetic,  with lots of mental stimulation. Beautiful stuff.

VThis shit is some flehm. It&#39;s hella cheap also. It&#39;s quick high and its not that smooth of a burn. But it&#39;s $7 a gram at my dispensary and it works perfectly in blunts.

VAmazing medication, love the subtle stomach hunger without breaking the fridge. Potent mind and body mix that takes away pain and pursues the minds  eye. I feel this strain was meant for the creative after a hard days work.

VFirst encounter with JW. Very quick high that lasts. A sweet piney smell with some skunkiness. This high is creative and thought filled. A great strain to employ before reading or any artistic pursuit.

VDefinitely a great sativa, but as I had read these reviews before trying it, I expected a little more energy and creativity from it. Still good stuff, though! Certainly made me feel quite content but also very sleepy after a few hours. Looks like other people may not have experienced that side effect, though, so I would definitely recommend giving this one a try if you&#39;re looking for a sativa!
