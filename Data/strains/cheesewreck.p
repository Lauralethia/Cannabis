VLove cheese!\u000a\u000aPungent smell of feet just like cheese it produces a distinct aroma with a sweet and earthy notes.  As I mentioned being a fan of cheese I can say that U.K. Cheese and cheese #1 weren&#39;t as enjoyable or as potent as this nice hybrid of train wreck and cheese. Will definitely smoke again as long as it&#39;s available also would recommend Blue Cheese strain for those who enjoyed it as much as I.

VAwesome strain, perfect blend of indica and sativa effects. I consumed using a nice Cheeswreck wax and and hit right away with the trainwreck-y sativa side while the Cheese indica rolls in after a little to calm it all down. Flavor is great, my pheno leans a bit towards the lemon from the trainwreck, but does have a flavorful cheese-y exhale. Medical properties are great, is apatite stimulating and relieves aches and pains.

VTakes a longer than other statins to settle in, the high definitely creeps up on ya outta no where, this would not be good for someone who gets nervous or anxious/paranoid easily w cannabis. For me though I feel good, chill, vibey, music sounds better, I suck at Xbox now though lol. Smells just like Cheesecake, idk if other cuts are as dense as mine but the nugs are the densest I have ever had in 2 years, an eighth nug is the size of my pointer finger somehow, the nugs are dense as hell 10/10 dense. Kills productivity honestly so it&#39;s more for chillin I think. It makes me so high I forget that my stomach hurts rather than it taking away my stomach pain/nausea lmao at least I&#39;m not thinking about it and it&#39;s no longer a problem so it does help in that way. Idk what to do on this strain lmao I suck at Xbox, I don&#39;t feel productive, music is dope though, and I&#39;m happy, relaxed and, thinking about positive/creative stuff so that&#39;s a plus I&#39;m just sitting melting though haha. I think this strain gets better the more you smoke it, you get to know how long it&#39;s gonna take to set in with its unique delayed affect, and also how much to get the best high, sometimes a little too much makes me so high I don&#39;t even do anything after I sesh haha. Good strain though, great flavor, dank.

VFloratec(h) Nutrients, This strain grew like a Sativa with Indica influences, leaves started off wide like an Indica but later when switched to flowering, began too spread and thin out.\u000a\u000aThis strain loves to feed and if left without for about  week it will show quick signs of Nitrogen def. So pay attention to your feeding schedule and how it&#39;s doing.\u000a\u000aThe high isn&#39;t overwhelming whatsoever but depending on how you&#39;re feeling has potential to be an instant-effect strain. High is an easy let down, calming, fine smell to it. cured for about 2-3 weeks will definitely bring out it&#39;s name.

Tastes great, and gives you that heady, fun body buzz you&#39;re looking for when you&#39;re doing hiking or biking. This isn&#39;t the stuff you spark up when you&#39;re looking to unwind, but definitely more for socializing and working out.

It also has some pretty decent arousing effects of you&#39;re with your partner. Nice bud to keep you awake but eventually helps you wind down. Had no problem driving and it eliminated my elbow pain. My only complaint is the flower itself isn&#39;t too attractive but that isn&#39;t a strong enough reason not to give it 5 stars.

It only had .44% thc but had 19.46% thc-a and .56% Cbd. For a total of 17.4% thc. As someone who pays attention, though not closely to percentages, I was thoroughly surprised by the entire head and body high I got from just a couple small tokes. A little goes a long way with this one. And to make it even better it was a pre roll bought for only 6$ at sweet relief in Yakima wa. If the pre was this good I can only imagine the amazing qualities the actual flower will have
