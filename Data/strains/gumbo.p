VI love this strain (name changed to Gumbi at The Farm) however I find it odd that people say it makes them sleep. This strain does the opposite to me. I can&#39;t sit still and I&#39;m energetic and without pain at all -which is great. There&#39;s also no psychoactive effects on me. I do however have a hard time taking the smoke, it&#39;s harsh, it&#39;s really smelly and I go through it very fast.

VYUMMMMMBO!! This is an awesome Indica! It&#39;s pleasantly potent and well suited for nigh-time use, or an overall mellow, almost pain free day. Fantastic sweet and pungent aroma equals the extremely wonderful intoxicating/medical  benefits of this relaxing strain! Well done to the breeders! I tried both the 25% flowers, and the 75.5% concentrate; and I am a lucky man for it!

VMedically, Gumbo is good for symptoms up to moderate range.  It does take a few minutes for the effects to set in, but my body has warmed up and I am starting to relax.   Some of my nerve issies have settled down, and my mind is quieting.

VThe flower and oil experience is 1:1. This is one of my favorite indicas, which tastes fairly decent in oil, just a tad thicker and darker.  Indicas have always been vampiry in my head, so this is basically the clove of 2016-2017.

VCresco has improved their oil tank and moved away from the plastic wick tanks that they started with. The new style cartridge is excellent. Gumbo is a heavy indica that gives a great heady buzz with a relaxing sensation for the body. I have not had any Cresco oil products for several months, and I am happy to see that the quality, flavor, and potency of the oil is still excellent. The flavor is piney with an herbal finish that reminds me of sage, the only drawback is that the oil is a bit harsh and brackish as compared to lighter tinted oils that I have tried.. The flow and saturation are both excellent; easy-to-pull giant clouds are possible even with low temperature settings. I am eager to try all of the oils, and I am very pleased that Cresco has upgraded these items.
