VSmoked it before bed without my girlfriend as i wanted to sleep to wakeup early and found myself messing around on the internet listening to funny videos cause i could not sleep. My heart rate was up and i really did not feel like sleeping at all, i was close to call a friend to chill. I would not recommend for insomnia, but to hang out with friends it&#39;s perfect and gets conversations going. Nice Sativa high, felt uplifted euphoric and social. Also really nice to grow, was my first grow and definetly had a nice crop! was about 3.5 ft. tall and we have more than an ounce. On the living plant, it really smelled like orange in a couple foot radius, even non smokers said it. Once dried, stays with a nice fruity smell and smoke does not cough at all. 4.5/5 !

VObtained From: Dispensary\u000aType: Indica-Dominant Hybrid\u000aQuality: Organic, Indoor, Medical Grade A\u000aTHC: 14.1%\u000aCBD: 0.5%\u000a\u000aBuds are covered in orange hairs and are dense and compact. Odor is strong pine with hints of skunk. Has a sweet citrus smell.  Great strain for depression, and irritability. Provides clarity and an attitude adjustment when necessary.  Definitely a mood enhancer. Stony but not fatiguing. Helps with aches, spasms and stiffness. Is not effective for severe pain or nerve pain. I was able to smke quite a bit without becoming paranoid though at higher doses I noticed some anxiety creeping in. Keeping it at 4 or less hits, I have had no problems and on the contrary found it helpful for ptsd symptoms. Great all around strain but not exceptional.

VCan&#39;t honestly give a 5 star rating to this strain; However, there are a few reasons that should make this bud a unique contender for your next purchase.\u000a\u000aCali-O is a highly active and clear-headed sativa in light doses, leaving the user energized and ready to go. In higher doses, Cali-O can bring on some deep euphoria and relaxation that might have you a bit less active and a lot more couch-locked.\u000a\u000aHaving tried the flower, shatter, and vape cartridge of this strain, I can say that across all mediums the high is quite fleeting. That&#39;s to say, the enjoyable cerebral stimulation and energy rush you enjoy for the first half hour or so will usually dissipate into a body-wide relaxation and mental calm by an hour and a half after smoking (regardless of amount).\u000a\u000aThat being the primary reason for the 4-star rating, it&#39;s important to add that this strain doesn&#39;t produce any mental encumbrance or &quot;THC Hangover&quot; after the initial high fades, which makes this strain great for those who just need a jumpstart to their day or workout routine.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d recommend California Orange for use with stress and fatigue, as those are the two that I can speak to from experience. The buds have a pleasant citrus-like smell, reminiscent of oranges but not entirely the same (unless you get the wax/cartridge)

The smell was citrus but the taste was a little sour for me. Still, the sativa effect of this strain gives a nice concentrated high.

V I love this strain. It is the most balanced I&#39;ve ever experienced, between indica/sativa. The buds were light green/yellow color with orange hairs. Very sticky with resin ever after curing. Vaping produced a thick vapor but did not make me want to cough. It has one of the nicest flavors of any strain I&#39;ve ever tried. The effects come on within about five minutes with both a head spaciness and mood elevation along with a body pull from the indica side. It&#39;s not an overwhelming strong strain so I would probably recommend it to those just starting. No anxiousness or paranoid. I doesn&#39;t seem to influence fatigue one way or the other. It did provide a uplifted focus to the day but did not cause any jitters. It helped my back pain. It help my nausea but it took about a half hour. Good for anxiety, stress, depression and to a lesser extent pain and nausea. I don&#39;t see it too often, but will always try to get some when I can.  -sy

I knew it was going to taste good as soon as I smelt it. \u000aReally enjoyed smoking it and I was on a nice mellow-high for the rest of the night. I felt really happy, talkative and euphoric.\u000aThe only thing I would say against it is that I found myself reaching for a drink every 5 minutes and there was a periodin which I rubbedmy eyes for about 2-3 minutes straight. Also a little dizzy when I stood up.

VOn a gloomy Saturday evening, I invited a friend to watch the one of the all time greatest novelists Stephen King&#39;s 2017 film adaptation of &quot;It&quot;. Before meeting with my buddy, I quickly blunted my personal stash of the strain called Space Queen, and went off with my journey to meet him at the mall. I was told that my buddy would bring a friend. While falling in line to get the tickets, this certain friend brought her own strain, the California Orange. \u000a\u000aWe slammed an entire bowl full of this wonderful strain like tomorrow was the last day on earth, but really we were all just too excited to watch the film. \u000a\u000aCalifornia Orange definitely was a catalyst to my newfound discovery/love for Stephen King. The next day I found myself reading the actual book, while under the influence of this wonderful strain. \u000a\u000aThe intensity of the sour taste gave me chills down my spine that allowed me to feel euphoria physically impossible to be felt by mankind alone. This herb is magical, let alone legendary.

VI LOVE the taste and smell of California Orange.  Absolute best tasting bud I ever had and the effect is long lasting.  To me, while there was a light body buzz, it leaned very strongly toward the sativa side and would not have guessed it was a 50/50 hybrid strain. Very, very energetic.  Felt like I had just taken some ephedera pills.  Great for days when you don&#39;t feel like working out or jogging.   It let me down in other areas, though.  I typically use cannabis either to treat my migraines, insomnia, or as a creative boost and to help me focus on what needs to be done (I am in the music industry and often work long hours at my home office).   While the high was definitely enjoyable, California Orange made me fidgety, with very slight dizziness and anxiety.  I was easily distracted and couldn&#39;t focus very well on my tasks.  Also, there are way better strains for pain and insomnia.   Overall, I&#39;d say it&#39;s good for working out or as an enhancement to purely recreational activities, but I was very disappointed because this strain does not fit me for creative work...yet it tastes and smells ABSOLUTELY HEAVENLY!! :(

VOn a gloomy Saturday evening, I invited a friend to watch the one of the all time greatest novelists Stephen King&#39;s 2017 film adaptation of &quot;It&quot;. Before meeting with my buddy, I quickly blunted my personal stash of the strain called Space Queen, and went off with my journey to meet him at the mall. I was told that my buddy would bring a friend. While falling in line to get the tickets, this certain friend brought her own strain, the California Orange. \u000a\u000aWe slammed an entire bowl full of this wonderful strain like tomorrow was the last day on earth, but really we were all just too excited to watch the film. \u000a\u000aCalifornia Orange definitely was a catalyst to my newfound discovery/love for Stephen King.

V5 star for California Orange from Seedsman. There are two versions available :one is california orange from Seedsman and other is Californian Orange and belong to Dutch passion. First one is proper old-school with genes of skunk 1 plus very distinctive scent, huh yes very stinky, other one is COMPLETE MISTAKE, some type of fluffy, odd looking, but very nice smelling, not mine flavour, tasted leafy, had quite few, from different harvest dates and conclusions are: Seedsman after 9.5 weeks are instant killers, very nice looking dmense buds, second..

VGreat strain for the \u201chome, relaxed, rainy day, binge watching your favorite tv show with a few snacks\u201d stoner. It\u2019s definitely sweet smelling and tasting as well as some nice hints of citrus and orange. Of course vape oil is a tad different and definitely carries out the stronger tastes and flavors of the strain. Great body and head high perfect for just kicking back on a Sunday or when you have a mid life crisis where the stress and depression kick in.. this is the strain for you. First time stoners, I agree that the type of high you get depends on the type of activity you\u2019re doing. But over all shouldn\u2019t make you lazy but just enough relaxed and not hyper but focused. Cali-O is definitely going to be my other quick go to strain!

I feel pretty good, and I know tonight I&#39;ll actually be able to sleep. Not to mention that the smoke doesn&#39;t smell too bad, and the weed itself smells nice. If you&#39;re going to smoke this, make sure you don&#39;t have to do anything social afterwards. All in all, I give it 5 stars.

VI think this is a good weed, but &quot;not my kind of weed&quot; I.e. the kind of weed I like to smoke. For that reason alone, that&#39;s why it gets 3/3.5/5.\u000a\u000aI smoked about 5-6 hits through a cheap metal pipe outside my house, and when I stood up I was expecting a high feeling to rush through my body, but I didn&#39;t get that at all. I rushed right to the biscuit tin, I didn&#39;t even feel hungry at all, but probably had a mental taste for the biscuits. As I was eating the biscuits, I started laughing intensely. I asked myself why I was laughing; I didn&#39;t have the high kind of feeling when laughing acknowledging my own highness. It felt like I was still sober.\u000a\u000aI went upstairs and the extremely happiness and energetically carried on. I had practically no body high - it was 100% head high and had no feeling to relax at all, and at this point I could confirm that I was high, but it was just a discreet high. When I realized I was high, I went forward to write lyrics at an attempt for the weed to unleash my creativity, and I wrote some really good lyrics. They didn&#39;t really make sense at all - it was creative and ambiguous though - rather &quot;artsy&quot;. When I laid on my bed using my laptop, I finally felt the body high. I ended up falling into a deep sleep at 9:30 rather than the usual time I get to bed at 12 - 1. Amazing sleep.\u000a\u000aI would say this is the perfect thing to smoke in the morning for the general happy-go-lucky attitude you want to reflect... just avoid mattresses or anything comfy for that matter or else the indica within will prevail. \u000a\u000aTLDR: Good head high, good for creativity, you can&#39;t tell you&#39;re high at first; if you want the body high, just find something comfy and you&#39;ll fall asleep instantly.\u000a\u000a3 - 3.5/5.

V5 star for California Orange from Seedsman. There are two versions available :one is california orange from Seedsman and other is Californian Orange and belong to Dutch passion. First one is proper old-school with genes of skunk 1 plus very distinctive scent, huh yes very stinky, other one is COMPLETE MISTAKE, some type of fluffy, odd looking, but very nice smelling, not mine flavour, tasted leafy, had quite few, from different harvest dates and conclusions are: Seedsman after 9.5 weeks are instant killers, very nice looking dmense buds, second..

Vbest tasting extract i have ever vaped.  so sweet so very smooth and worked great for my pain issues. This kind of stuff is the future of cannabis consumption, flavorful and exactly what you would expect with a name like cali orange. I will be trying everything this company has to offer because of this fine stuff right here.  i know its twice as much as the shatter but treat yourself with a gram of this heaven in your atmos greedy you wont regret it.

But I don&#39;t mind being sketchy.  It&#39;s just part of the gig.  Gave me cotton mouth like a bitch.  It was unbearable.

I feel pretty good, and I know tonight I&#39;ll actually be able to sleep. Not to mention that the smoke doesn&#39;t smell too bad, and the weed itself smells nice. If you&#39;re going to smoke this, make sure you don&#39;t have to do anything social afterwards. All in all, I give it 5 stars.

VSuper interesting strain for something I thought was going to be straightforward. Some hybrids like this feel very one track to me; Take a couple hits, feel a good body buzz, think about why white people keep trying to keep bears and shot as pets, you know. This strain actually starts off as a sativa and works its way up to an indica. Two hits get me the head high of Jack Herer. Two more gets me stoned like Deathstar. Very cool to try this legendary strain.

VThe sweet orange smell of that strain gives the perfect first impression of what is coming. Very potent, but doesn&#39;t make you couch potatoe. It makes you very happy, euphoric and talk a lot if you are with a group of friends.  It hits really fast and you could definately see the transition during the high between the indica and sativa in this strain. Great day or night strain. If you decide to smoke it at night, don&#39;t finish your night with that because you won&#39;t fall asleep. The little energy boost will take away the fatigue and could result in counting sheeps. I didn&#39;t experience any side effects. Great overall strain. Removes stress and good for PTSD or Anxiety.

VI just tried this nice hybrid strain and it was amazinggggg. Although it says this strain is a 50/50, yesterday that felt like a 80% sativa 20% Indica. That is because my head, WAS THROBBING&#128540; I played soccer while on this and it was a very fun experience. However, some might consider me as an apprentice smoker cause I&#39;ve only hit the bud about 10-30 times, but I can tell you, buy enough and take enough hits, this strain is a fun time for anyone&#128077; u

Vfor a budget friendly strain it&#39;s not bad; a 50/50 hybrid, rather good tasting, however this strain doesn&#39;t pack as much THC content as I desire so I end needing to smoke more than I would need with some stronger strains.

VCalifornia orange is a great day time strain that will leave you feeling happy, energetic, and level headed. The psychoactive effects aren&#39;t that great, but the body effects are definitely there which is why this is so good for day time use. You won&#39;t feel like you are walking funny but you definitely will feel pain free. This has worked really good for anxiety and depression too. Sexual benefits are a two thumbs up as well. You can&#39;t go wrong with this strain. I would highly recommend for newbies and your every day tokers.

VI thought it was about time I added a cali orange entry. Me and a buddy a while back came across I believe an 8th of california orange. We went up to the local elementary school, layed out a blanket, sat down and filled a pipe full. I dont remember much from that night but I do know it was my greatest high by far. I remember my friend taking a hit and then he was tryin to pass the bowl too me. Only problem was I couldn&#39;t see the bowl, only his hand. I ended up reaching for it and felt it and went on with our smoking. I also remember stumbling a little bit on the walk home which I never do. And mind you i&#39;ve smoked for quite a while before this particular sesh so believe you, me that I was quite suprised in the potentcy. But theres my rambly cali orange story. Best high i&#39;ve had so far. :)

VThis is the first strain I grew several years back. I cut it a couple weeks early because of the cold climate. It was easy to grow and grew very big. If you brushed your arm against it by accident your arm would smell like orange big time.\u000aThis plant smelled EXACTLY like the orange popsicles that I have had, the orange oil, tangy smell and taste was exact, no skunk smell that I can remember. It was ridiculous in that manner. \u000aIt didnt taste too smell when it came down to cure. I can only imagine how it would have smoked if I cut it when it was fully matured.   This plant made me stoned, I wouldnt say couchlock, it was different, like, lethargic. Like if I wanted to go upstairs and get something it felt like &quot;awww maaaaan&quot; I have to get up and go aaall the way upstairs and get it. Everything was a major chore. That was the main thing when I smoked that stuff,  but I didnt feel like I was vibrating and completely stoned. It didnt make me super happy, infact I kind of felt a bit dark when I smoked that stuff. But it wasnt like anxiety attacks or anything. I would try it again for the oranginess and to see how it measured up to the last time.
