VThe flowers and Sage and sour is the fact that it&#39;s very diesel and menthol like it smells very musky and has undertones of some pine and Chestnut. I wouldn&#39;t rate this strain a five out of five however I prefer fruity smells and tastes. This strain is great if you&#39;re having one of those depressed or rainy day moods. If your stress level is high if you have some pain in the morning not physical pain, but mental pain. It&#39;s been a rough week so far but I know with this strain I can get through anything. I would really recommend this for those that are looking for more of an up beat type of lifestyle. If all you want to do is sit on the couch and take it in I would say you can do that too however it is best to use this for a creative potential and taking care of your medical needs. If you&#39;re looking for something to relax you all the way and put you to sleep that is not what this strain is designed to do if you need to put on your big boy pants and get some things done I suggest you take that strain along with you for your journey.  Before major bad mood morning kicking in sage n sour knocks this ball out of the park.

VThis is the first Sativa I&#39;ve smoked where the happy and uplifted feeling lasted well after the high.  I took about 3 tokes and immediately started feeling &quot;good&quot;.  What I mean by that is, my senses were elevated higher than normal where different stimuli like sounds and smells brought a &#39;good mood&#39; effect to me.  I had many happy thoughts and there were smells and sounds that brought back happy memories.  I also felt very relaxed, yet alert.  It has a high likelihood of dry mouth though. A LOT of dry mouth.  My tongue kept sticking to the roof of my mouth.  There was ZERO paranoia associated with this strain.  I highly recommend this strain.

VThis was my first strain EVER. It&#39;s lovely. I can climb mountains for 2 days straight on this stuff. It&#39;s VERY energizing. I put up a fence in my yard while puffin away on my SnS vape cartridge. It gives you a mild high, hence (built a fence). If I was too high I would stare at the fence and picture it being built on top of the twin towers that don&#39;t exist anymore, but they do because I&#39;m baked out of my skull. WTF am I even saying? Whatever, it&#39;s good stuff.

VSage and Sour is an exceptional strain that offers one of the most vibrant, euphoric and focused effects the Sativa flower has to offer. Having never tried Sage, I can&#39;t speak to its presence, however, the Sour Diesel certainly is. The smell and flavor of Sour Diesel are somewhat mild, however, the experience certainly leans toward it. Leafly calls Sour Diesel a strain which is suited for medical purposes from pain to depression and anxiety. The same can be said about Sage n Sour.\u000a\u000aEdit: While in low doses Sage n Sour can present with euphoric and relaxed properties, in higher doses I&#39;ve noticed it can provoke particularly acute anxiety/paranoia.

VI tried this after trying another sage strain, thinking it would be the perfect combination with the sour. I suppose it was, but I found myself getting a very cerebral high but was still able to be quite talkative. The downside was I supposed to be somewhere, but instead a friend and I found ourselves blabbering on about nonsense for over an hour in order to feel &quot;calm&quot; enough to finally go to where we needed to go. It was quite strange, but I&#39;m never one to knock anything that actually gives me energy as this is often quite difficult to do. I had some more about 2 hours later and found that I had lost that metal charge and just became cloudy, stoney, quiet and a bit paranoid.

VStrain: Sage N Sour (Sour Diesel / Sage cross -- Sativa leaning [Hybrid?])\u000aTHC: 27.61%\u000aCBD: 0.10%\u000aGrower: LGF\u000aLocation found: KaLeafa \u000aDate purchased: 3.16.16 \u000aPrice: $30.00 an \u215bth\u000aWeight: 3.5g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: Herbal floral earthy pleasantly Sour Diesel. Smells like a bouquet that is at a small distance, but the herb is near my nose.\u000aLook: Little dense light green nugs coated in orange hairs and crystals. \u2190Makes me happy it is the St Paddy\u2019s Day holiday bud of some of my dreams. The bud structure is more dense than Sour Diesels I have seen. The Sage crossing is a superb idea. Trimmed well.\u000aTaste: I am hypersensitive to any tastes of Sour Diesel (in my lungs or in the air). It is present but faint. The Sage, herbal flavor comes through in some potent ways. The floral, bouquet aroma did not translate into a sharp taste but the lingering flavor left behind was where the Sour D decided to stay. It is Sage going in, Sour Diesel after it is out. Amazing and eerie.  \u000aRecommendation for medicine: This was good for an uplifting, mostly Sativa bud. At 27%+, focus that some speak of is a little more difficult to wrap my head around but there are so many variations, how to compare sometimes...It is definitely a euphoria strain in my humble (and high) opinion. I think that if it causes me not to feel much, it could be a nice pain relief for some conditions.

VPerfect strain for wake &amp; bakes.  Let me reiterate that idea PERFECT STRAIN FOR WAKE AND BAKES!!!  First off the zesty herbal garden aroma &amp; matching flavor go perfectly with a cup of coffee or tea (or oatmeal stout, no judgement here =).Another good reason this flower has the W&amp;B seal of approval is the upbeat, motivated &amp; positive buzz it brings on.  Everything about this bud is clearheaded from its odor straight through to the focused high.  Not to heady though that it would cause insomnia or much anxiety.  Great for smoking joints since the fluffy buds are not very dense, yet still tight enough to make a crispy, snap sound when broken up.  I am sort of a sucker for that sound coupled with feeling in between my fingers.  The sound of dank buds about to be enjoyed, beautiful!! (I&#39;ll toke to that =)\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: Not sure if it is due to my \u000aADHD or just a thing, but seems worth mentioning.  At lower percentages or smaller doses this herb acts as described above which is the norm.  When I tried a higher percentage (25+%) grow one time it knocked me out hard almost instantly.  Seriously felt like xanax or valium causing a disruption in my plans for almost two days as I slept away like Rip Van Winkle.  So check it out, doing a little experiment rolled up 3 joints of the lower % grow and went to town on them.  It started to hit me in the usual manner until starting third joint.  A quarter of the way into partaking of this fine flower the joint hit ashtray as my head hit the pillow.  Luckily I used my noodle so planned to have nothing to do, but sleep almost coma like for a bit.  This also happens with Jack Herer so just use caution if you are a freak like me.  Don&#39;t let that scare anyone away this is fabulous cannabis.

VSolid! I tried this strain as grown by PDA in WA State and immediately hit up a hot hatha yoga class. I&#39;ve been beating myself up physically with lots of lifting and summer sports, so I was pretty sore. Not sure if it was the S-n-S, but I was motivated to dig in deep on a lot of poses that may have otherwise killed me. Feeling decidedly creative and ahead of the curve, I found myself modifying and embellishing on many of the poses, so probably wouldn&#39;t recommend for someone looking to do something that required you to strict attention to instructions. :) That said, at one point the instructor invited us to smile in the middle of dancer and I realized I already was.

Vdiesel is the most recognizable the flavor, slightly sour aroma, buzz is mostly deisel; cerebral sativa. texture;nice light color, not much density(very airy buds). overall the strain does stand out and will be prefered by many medicinal patients

VThis Sage N Sour gave me an Uplift to do a Lil cooking and I didn&#39;t overdo it and pay for it later wit more pain... It has A nice Aroma wit a Hint of Sage... It&#39;s Not overwhelming at all and it burns really smooth with NO Harsh burn on throat after inhaling. I recommend This Strain to anyone who needs a lift And can still Enjoy The Happy Relaxation Afterwards. .. The only thing I had a problem with is that they only had Grams... I HAD TO get 14 Lil bottles and I weighed each as I opened and only 5 out of 14 weighed a whole 1.0 gram.... the other 9 were either 0.8  or 0.9  so idunno who Weighing this Medicine out But I feel I was Shorted a WHOLE GRAM FROM THE OTHER 9 THAT WERE NOT 1.0 GRAMS....

VSurprised at how much I like this strain seeing how I don&#39;t really like sage, as it does have a slight smell of it however the taste is more over powered by a piney citrus flavor with an earthy appeal to it all. Very uplifting and energetic effects while still relieving stress, pain and helps with appetite when your not feeling your best. Good for daytime not so much for middle of the night as it will keep you up for a couple hours and by that time the munchies get the best of you.

VSo aroma wise, this strain is super spicy and very &quot;old world&quot; in that it reminds me of a mix of cooking herbs.  I smell some lemon, a lot of musky and woodsy tones like pine and bark.  Shit was all around in your face variety of spices!  The smoke was ok, I&#39;m not used to such dark tasting bud, it was different.  I got a full buzz on in about 7-8 minutes, which I noted was usually long for me... but what I did notice on the return, was that the high was for a longer period of time than I usually experience.  Overall, I LOVE it, definitely recommend if you can get your paws on it!  \u000aStay Well &amp; Stay Blown \u000a@MsLolaJae  (Your #StonerVixen)\u000a xoXXox

VI had high hopes for this strain and was kind of let down. the batch I got was a lot more sage than sour. It  actually reminded more of cheese. The buds were not great, like an indoor strain that went outside way to early to finish.   Not to say its entirely without merit, good for starters or early morning/day usage when you have things to do later on.  it did relax some muscles I would rather not feel

VAwesome Sativa dominant strain. Great sage n sour smell perfect name. A breeze to grow in organic soil for beginners.(was in my 1st or 2nd grow ever with the best results of 5 other strains. I had no or little experience and probably got lucky harvesting it perfectly ripe) IMO this is T.H. Seeds best strain and a great happy, uplifted high. Great for my anxiety if not overindulged but don&#39;t recall much pain relief could be wrong since I was just enjoying the good mood it gave me. Dense frosty buds of super Dank medicine. I now could probably push this strain to much greater results so I can most definitely recommend it for those with depression, Anxiety, bipolar disorder and those who like a nice social daytime or night buzz with no sleepy comedown. I am looking forward to running this strain agin soon and would have already if I didn&#39;t have other strains getting older waiting for their time to shine lol. I recommend it and don&#39;t hand out 5 star ratings to just any good strain this one was special for me and in my top 20 all time. Different strokes for different folks though so I doubt it&#39;s going to impress an Indica heavy pain relief strain for patients with severe pain(it could I don&#39;t have any severe pain so I can&#39;t relate) Fast flowering for a Sativa dominant strain 8-11 weeks depending on grow conditions. I remember having some high temps and a hard time keeping my indoor garden cooled mid day with just a 12,000 BTU window unit at the time and the sage &amp; sour didn&#39;t mind the heat fluctuation problem I had then(fixed now lol) really tasty strain tooooo!!!!

VSage n sour smells deliciously sweet with a hint of an earthy herb garden in spring.  On first puff, the smoke is very smooth with a slightly bitter and savoury aftertaste. A little goes a long way with this sativa; you will feel the euphoric effects almost immediately.  I think this is one of the best things for anxiety, depression, winter blahs, concentration, and creativity.  \u2665\ufe0f\u000a\u000aSage N Sour and Yoga might just be the absolute best combinations for absolute zen yet!

VAwesome stuff. I&#39;ve only tried a (very) high CBD variety by Cascade Gnome here which smell mind blowingly good - strong citrus piney goodness. I&#39;ve never seen/heard of this strain with such a strong CBD content (CBD 15% / THC 0.8%) so it&#39;s a virtual zero head high but just enough to relax and stay focused even after several bowls... which I love because it tastes/smells so good, I&#39;m happy to continue smoking it without being floored or ceilinged. Tiny bit of couch potential and a bit of fog but really easy to shake off and get active. Also makes me sleep like a baby, without  thickheadedness in the morning. Huge fan - hope I can find this one again. May try the normal variety.

VUsually a jack herer person, always on the hunt for sativa that elevates creativity with minimal crash. I have a decently high tolerance being a daoly toker, and after 1 or 2 hits I found my pen glued to the paper for a solid 15-20 mins writing my heart out. It felt like all the little unconscious thoughts I had in the past few days crept up on me clearly and presented themselves as somewhat complete problems and solutions. Wonderful shit!! #1 on my list now

VSurprised at how much I like this strain seeing how I don&#39;t really like sage, as it does have a slight smell of it however the taste is more over powered by a piney citrus flavor with an earthy appeal to it all. Very uplifting and energetic effects while still relieving stress, pain and helps with appetite when your not feeling your best. Good for daytime not so much for middle of the night as it will keep you up for a couple hours and by that time the munchies get the best of you.

VSo aroma wise, this strain is super spicy and very &quot;old world&quot; in that it reminds me of a mix of cooking herbs.  I smell some lemon, a lot of musky and woodsy tones like pine and bark.  Shit was all around in your face variety of spices!  The smoke was ok, I&#39;m not used to such dark tasting bud, it was different.  I got a full buzz on in about 7-8 minutes, which I noted was usually long for me... but what I did notice on the return, was that the high was for a longer period of time than I usually experience.  Overall, I LOVE it, definitely recommend if you can get your paws on it!  \u000aStay Well &amp; Stay Blown \u000a@MsLolaJae  (Your #StonerVixen)\u000a xoXXox

VClocking in at 17% THC, it was no surprise that, overall, was a good time.

I hate to say this, and I don&#39;t mean it in a bad way, but it tastes like a soggy wet shirt..... you know what that stuff tastes like, we all did it when we were kids.\u000a\u000aThe high is a sour diesel high, but sort of leveled. Almost indica leaning in a way..... at least my bud had some indica elements to it. Other than that,  it was fairly similar to sour diesel. Close enough to say I&#39;d probably not try it again if I knew of good quality sour diesel..... it just wasnt as much of a hard hitter, but that&#39;s what IMO makes it special. It has certain effects SD just doesn&#39;t have with some indica leaning properties.

VA really nice Sativa I got at our dispensary.  I, too, &quot;over-did&quot; my first time (flower-in-pipe) and got pretty slow.  However, I was super-relaxed and was able to calm down.  I take care of my 88-year-old mother.  Stress gets bad.  Thanks to this strain my stress went way down.  I do have to say, for me, anyway, it helps with &quot;sleepy-time&quot; as I call it.  Hours later, I was able to go to sleep and I woke up the next morning pretty refreshed and regenerated.  Enjoy!  (Heavy laughter the first 30-40 minutes)  NOTE: THC is Winter growing in New Mexico--medical (Does THC-A go up after you have it awhile?)
