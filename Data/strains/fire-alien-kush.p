VFAK is another amazing hybrid!  Super relaxing, happy, after work strain thats perfect for watching a movie!  The world slowed down a touch with this strain and I felt the Universe come together as one.  A very potent strain that makes me feel quite content, highly recommended!  Beautiful flower with an interesting nose.

VI think this is my new favorite evening bud. Leaves me clear-headed enough to enjoy complicated movies and games but makes my body comfortably numb and super relaxed. Nicely rounded indica hybrid with delicious herbaceousness.

VI&#39;ve had versions of this grown in the Las Vegas Area. It seems like it takes more from the alien in the smell and high. It&#39;s decently frosty, good taste in vape but you get a little harshness on the exhale using the bong. I can see this could be an A grade bud with a little work.\u000aThe high left a little to be desired. I felt a decent headrush after massive loads but the effects weren&#39;t very long lasting or intense. I&#39;ve never been the hugest fan of fire og and it&#39;s hybrids as I prefer that loud, lemon, kerosene funk with those heavy terps and head pounding high from pure og cuts. Still a pretty bud just not as potent as I&#39;d expect.

VThis is a overall good strain. I get more indica type effects from this strain. Defiantly a great tasting and smoking weed. Unfortunately im more of a sativa person. Great for the kush fans out there. Its like a uplifting kush high its kinda weird. Its super green and crystally and doesnt taste like your typical kush...

VThis is my absolute favorite strain of the moment!! I always smoke a bowl before watching a couple episodes of Brickleberry and then passing out. Fantastic for feeling like youre sinking into the bed. I couldnt stop laughing after smoking a bowl with friends, only a couple hits and youre high as a UFO! Also, love the sweet n fruity smell of this! Definitely appeals to people who dont want the stench of weed in their house.  \u000a\u000aYummy flavor, amazing body buzz, good times :)

VPicked up a quarter from a Medical Co Op in Tacoma. Smells very earthy. Kind of grassy. There&#39;s a pine scent with it too. Tastes about the same when smoked. It is definitely a 50/50 hybrid. It has the right body and head high ratio. I don&#39;t usually like hybrids and go either strait indica or strait Sativa, but this strain isn&#39;t bad. Good mix of both.
