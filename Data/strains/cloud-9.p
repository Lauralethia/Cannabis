VThis is a very euphoric and intense strain.  Your thoughts will wonder, but still come back pretty quickly.  This is a potent strain and if take to much, you have a half angry and half paranoid high.  In the right doses its good for pain and relaxation.

VThis strain smells amazing, and smokes really nicely. I got wayyyy more stoned than I expected to, But It was really enjoyable. nice body high without the couch lock, plus a really good cerebral high. I just found myself rambling on and on, and felt super talkative. good stuff!

VThere&#39;s really only one way to describe this strain in its totality: UNBELIEVAMAZABLINGLY WONDERBALLS\u000aThe cerebral effects are unmatched (or at least in my experience) and allowed me to eloquently deliver a speech to my friends on how the government is using the forward facing cameras on our iPhones to monitor us 100% of the time we are on them, and how they are compiling a stock of photos from our social media accounts to keep tabs on us at all times.  Then, as I was talking, I realized that the thumbprint reader on my iPhone 6 was directly uploading into the FBI directory, furthering their control of our lives, and our every step.  The crescendo came when I informed everyone that the Presidential Debate was just a distraction from the real issue at hand ---- the fact that Michelle Obama was born a man, and that our current President changed the bathroom laws simply so his wife would feel more comfortable when she was going number 1 in a public restroom.  This was a pretty intense speech given on a boat last Friday afternoon to my 3 friends who listened eagerly.  We later realized that Cloud 9 was the shizznitobamsnipsnapsack.

VThis is my new favorite strain! The effects are amazing. I&#39;m talkative, thoughtful and relaxed on Cloud 9. My mind was telling me to get up and get on the elliptical but my body wouldn&#39;t let me. So instead we watched Prince&#39;s live film Sign &#39;O&#39; The Times with the surround sound on. It was simply amazing. The high lasted really long and by the time I was coming down my mattress felt like a bed of clouds. Amazing amazing amazing!!
