VEXCERPT: &quot;The overall feeling of well-being increases (both in body and in mind). However, I still feel motivated. &quot;\u000a\u000a||-----||\u000a\u000aFULL REVIEW: A nice, uplifted calm feeling. \u000a\u000aI vaporized at 205C - 210C and really enjoyed the entire process. The smell when I opened the container. The visual aspect of the buds. The awesome way it grinds up perfectly. \u000a\u000aIt has a sweet taste and little to no bite at all. \u000a\u000aThe calming deep breaths started first, then a feeling of being fully relaxed (think post-massage). \u000a\u000aThe overall feeling of well-being increases (both in body and in mind). However, I still feel motivated. \u000a\u000aI personally feel like I could go for a nature walk and really, really enjoy every aspect of that walk. Or... I could sleep (which I will be since it&#39;s late), and REALLY enjoy it (even if I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m enjoying it).\u000a\u000aThis is the wonderful gift of Mango.\u000a\u000a_IamMaryJane_

VI recently happened upon this strain and had a couple of hits with a newly acquired pub mate. A strong and welcoming high, it is also subtle in its potency and the effect lingered throughout the night. I\u2019ll have to try more before writing a more definitive account, and look forward to doing so.

VSo sweet and yummy. Total couch lock and I love it. Great for insomnia and anxiety and pain. Sleeping for more than 6 hours in a row. Perfect for migraines, pain, and restless leg syndrome. Not good if you want to be productive. This is something you smoke after a hard day and before  a long shower, and then slither into bed.

VVaped distillate from a cartridge. Immediate calming effect and increased creativity, as a paranoid person normal tasks were actually easier to focus on. One of the reasons I prefer cartridges and concentrates is the lack of smell that lingers on you. Without that I feel even indica&#39;s like mango can be utilized efficiently during the day. \u000aAlso no burnout. The distillate tasted remarkably like mango with that slight hint of THC. Big fan

VI&#39;ve had this mango strain one or twice before but I never remember it tasting as much like mango as this batch does. It is like you just ate a mango. Yeah sure there are strawberry, cherry and countless fruity tasting and smelling flowers but this one definitely takes the cake. The effects are very nice and calming, it&#39;s the taste that really impresses me. Wow!

VWow. I thought my weedman was just telling me a random strain name (you know, because some dealers in non-rec states do that) so I would be more inclined to buy it thinking it was fire. I was skeptical because it didn&#39;t smell that strong. But holy shit, when I took that first pull off the pipe, I knew it was in fact Mango. The fruity taste, smooth smoke, and euphoric feeling afterward was enough to make me a believer. \u000a\u000aOne hit, I can just zone out and do an activity like guitar or video games. Two hits, that&#39;s couchlock and a movie. Anything after that is sleep. Floating, blissful sleep. However, it does majorly cause dry mouth so drink a ton of water. It also left me in a brain fog upon waking, but thats because I smoked more than usual with my very low tolerance. I still highly, HIGHLY recommend this strain!

VOne of my all time favorites! Smells like actual mango with a hint of pineapple to me. Very citrusy. Fat, dense buds and my grinder collects a lot of kief from this leaf. My favorite is GDP. I&#39;d love a cross between Mango &amp; GDP. That could be perfection.\u000a\u000aEffects? Immediately tasty. Calmness takes over a few minutes in. Two good pulls and I was where I needed to be but enjoyed it so much I kept puffing. Can&#39;t wait to try it in vape/oil from. Should be nice out of my Pax 3 later.

VThis strain has a fantastic smell right off the bat and has the taste to match.  A very rich mango flavor when I used it in my bubbler.  The nugs where very large (about 2 - 4 grams a nug) and super frosty.  Not sure what nutrients the grower used but this strain is amazing.  Instant head high with a creeping body indica high that comes from high CBD strains.  Great after a long day of work.

VMango was a light Indica / heavy Hybrid (Indica side) in effects to me. The smell and taste was lightly sweet &amp; fruity. Looks of the buds I had were nothing to mention about one way or the other. The strain has been around since the 60&#39;s (&quot;updated&quot; in 91). Received Third Place in the Indica category during the 02 High Times Cannabis Cup. Worth a try for sure :)

VOkay, so I had to try this purely based on the name. I love mangos and was overall, impressed!  I purchased this strain from MedicalClub.ca and was really impressed with the sweet, tropical mango flavour and smell.   This strain relaxed me and put a smile on my face.  It gave me an overall physical high more than a head high, which really assisted with my pain symptoms.  This strain is NOT strong enough to help me with my sleep issues, but its a nice strain to smoke while relaxing and reading a book or watching a tv show.  It did cause me to cough a little bit and caused some munchies for sure.

Nice, relaxed and happy high, and eases you into a restful sleep at a slow pace. Smells and tastes phe-nomanal. Pretty good for social anxiety as the side effects of paranoia or really any side effects at all are minimal if Im gonna be honest. I haven&#39;t tried this yet in some of my most anxiety-inducing places (i.e. clubs) but for now I can say this does it&#39;s job well.

VI was surprised how much I liked Mango. I don&#39;t know if I agree with the flavor being as specific as a mango. Certainly fruity but maybe the concept or idea of a piece of fruit, not any Mango I&#39;ve eaten at least. Very delicious none the less. Mango was very helpful when relaxing and falling to sleep. I could do without the need to constantly talk. Seriously considering\u200b buying a clone of this strain.

VPMP Reviewer....I love this strain!  Smells like tropical fruit and tastes mild and sweet.  This is a great night time medicine.   I feel the Indica as it makes me relax, giggly and cuddly.  Eventually sleepiness comes along and I sleep well for hours (which is pretty good for me) When I wake up in the middle of the night, I take a puff or two and sleep the rest of the night!  It&#39;s my nightstand drawer medicine.

VThe first time I tried this it was like a time ward. One seconded it was 6:30. Next it was 10:30. I have a pretty high tolerance level. So it&#39;s always enjoyable to get a strain that gets you going after only a few nice hits. Highly recommended this if you are able to chose it. You will not be disappointed.\u000a

VMango smells and tastes wonderful, but turns your head to mush.  Body felt heavy and tired, impossible to work or recreate on this stuff.  Bad hangover lasts entire next day.  Typical indica weed: down buzz, exhausting, burnout at end.  I&#39;ll pass.

VThis is my favorite strain by far. I prefer it for the gym, especially yoga or long walks which pairs phenomenally with music. It gives me an energized inner calm that helps me live in the moment and get through my day with little to no come down (which is a miracle because of my BPD, a living hell)  Did I mention taste? Delicious mango, with the calm of walking on the beach in tropical paradise.

VI saw on Facebook that Glisan Buds had a fresh drop of Mango, and I could just tell by the description that I had to try some!  I\u2019m a newbie and so far have only bought strains that smell good.  This is important to me. One thing that stood out for me with the Mango is that it supposedly helps with inflammation, and I have this wonky knee at the moment\u2026\u000a\u000aTrue to its name, Mango smells like...mango!  The budtender shined a light into the jar and the buds were thickly coated with white crystals.  The smell had a PoW! and I knew I was going to bring some home.\u000a\u000aI took a hit as soon as I got settled in at home and on the inhale the smoke tasted fruity.  The odd thing is the exhale did not taste fruity; in fact it tasted stinky, a bit like a paper mill almost.  This can be forgiven, because the high is wonderful.  It\u2019s an indica and delivers quite the body high.  My body feels content, relaxed, and heavy while high on Mango.  The high developed quickly and lasted longer than the other strains I\u2019ve been using lately.\u000a\u000aI could using this to help sleep for sure, but most of all I just feel REALLY relaxed, more so than the other two strains I\u2019ve tried. I give it \u201chigh\u201d marks!

Giving a long lasting high, you&#39;ll be on the sofa for hours, unable to properly communicate. But that&#39;s fine because your whole body is as soft as a fucking baby and your mind is playing some crazy tricks on you. Don&#39;t toke too hard on this biff though, my friend saw some goblins on the train.

VPMP Reviewer....I love this strain!  Smells like tropical fruit and tastes mild and sweet.  This is a great night time medicine.   I feel the Indica as it makes me relax, giggly and cuddly.  Eventually sleepiness comes along and I sleep well for hours (which is pretty good for me) When I wake up in the middle of the night, I take a puff or two and sleep the rest of the night!  It&#39;s my nightstand drawer medicine.

VHmm...May be my new favourite over Blueberry. I don&#39;t get the cons of stomach upsets or munchies on Mango vs Blueberry. Nice, relaxed and happy high, and eases you into a restful sleep at a slow pace. Smells and tastes phe-nomanal. Pretty good for social anxiety as the side effects of paranoia or really any side effects at all are minimal if Im gonna be honest. I haven&#39;t tried this yet in some of my most anxiety-inducing places (i.e. clubs) but for now I can say this does it&#39;s job well.

VOkay, so I had to try this purely based on the name. I love mangos and was overall, impressed!  I purchased this strain from MedicalClub.ca and was really impressed with the sweet, tropical mango flavour and smell.   This strain relaxed me and put a smile on my face.  It gave me an overall physical high more than a head high, which really assisted with my pain symptoms.  This strain is NOT strong enough to help me with my sleep issues, but its a nice strain to smoke while relaxing and reading a book or watching a tv show.  It did cause me to cough a little bit and caused some munchies for sure.

VI go for indica dominant strains due to lower back pressure and headaches and Mango did the trick on both parts. First toke was amazing mango, almost a sweet orange flavor and not really harsh at all on the exhale. The flavor alone had my curiosity piqued but after about the third hit, I was  feeling the heavy indica effect that comes with this strain. Body pain melted away, pressure was relieved and, after my tooth pain eased from the strain&#39;s power, the appetite button was hit. An overall good case of a pain relieving indica for relaxation, pain suppression and issues with lack of appetite. Quality and good looking, Mango is definitely a must try for anyone who says they like a good indica.

VI&#39;m pretty sure i just got a quality sample but this was some of the best bud i&#39;ve  ever smoked. It was actually called Mango Dream. Got Completely high from 1 skimp joint. Only smoked for about 6 minutes and i was G.O.N.E. Not necessarily ecstatic but i was most definitely uplifted. Great bud.

VI saw on Facebook that Glisan Buds had a fresh drop of Mango, and I could just tell by the description that I had to try some!  I\u2019m a newbie and so far have only bought strains that smell good.  This is important to me. One thing that stood out for me with the Mango is that it supposedly helps with inflammation, and I have this wonky knee at the moment\u2026\u000a\u000aTrue to its name, Mango smells like...mango!  The budtender shined a light into the jar and the buds were thickly coated with white crystals.  The smell had a PoW! and I knew I was going to bring some home.\u000a\u000aI took a hit as soon as I got settled in at home and on the inhale the smoke tasted fruity.  The odd thing is the exhale did not taste fruity; in fact it tasted stinky, a bit like a paper mill almost.  This can be forgiven, because the high is wonderful.  It\u2019s an indica and delivers quite the body high.  My body feels content, relaxed, and heavy while high on Mango.  The high developed quickly and lasted longer than the other strains I\u2019ve been using lately.\u000a\u000aI could using this to help sleep for sure, but most of all I just feel REALLY relaxed, more so than the other two strains I\u2019ve tried. I give it \u201chigh\u201d marks!

VThis is my favorite strain by far. I prefer it for the gym, especially yoga or long walks which pairs phenomenally with music. It gives me an energized inner calm that helps me live in the moment and get through my day with little to no come down (which is a miracle because of my BPD, a living hell)  Did I mention taste? Delicious mango, with the calm of walking on the beach in tropical paradise.

VI was surprised how much I liked Mango. I don&#39;t know if I agree with the flavor being as specific as a mango. Certainly fruity but maybe the concept or idea of a piece of fruit, not any Mango I&#39;ve eaten at least. Very delicious none the less. Mango was very helpful when relaxing and falling to sleep. I could do without the need to constantly talk. Seriously considering\u200b buying a clone of this strain.

VIf Growing, look for the extremely Sativa dominant Pheno and use it for crossbreeding. I have found that pheno results in extremely high ceiling smoke that massively elevates the traits of the plant it is bred with. Great production and health.

VI have most mental ailments, as well as R.A., and other pains. this strain was great as far as helping me manage my physical/ mental ailments without actually making me lethargic, or couch locked. the smell was of tropical banana&#39;s and mangos. the smell was pungent, meaning the terpenes were there for signs of its strength. definitely one of my top out of the 60+ strains I have tried. :) high amounts I know will couch lock so beware beginners.

VThe most relaxing strain I&#39;ve had, without sacrificing my will to move. When it set in, it was like a large band was removed from my chest and I could finally breathe fully. Yet I was still compelled to continue working on a piece of art. The only downside is I wasn&#39;t capable of being very verbal, but the level of relaxation that came with it was excellent.

VMango is generally a flavour I like. Me being used to the Eastern confection of Mango Hi-Chews I felt would help me pick up on the nice taste. Really shouldn&#39;t have trusted my boyfriend at the time with picking weed! This stuff was very dry and sour, had a nasty flavour it left in my mouth after anytime I took a hit. The high was very weak too, it didn&#39;t do much except make my mouth feel gross. Not recommended, it&#39;s basically reggie.

VThis is my first taste of Mango -- I found the flower to be very dense.\u000a\u000aWhat we all want, with any strain, is to taste it for what it is....  \u000a\u000aPersonally, I rate my weed first by taste and second by effects .  I&#39;d rather enjoy the taste -- and smoke more to get high -- than to smoke one puff... and be done.\u000a\u000aAs my taste pallet has developed, I&#39;ve noticed a few things about burning a well ground bowl of bud.\u000a\u000aOften the taste comes through immediately with the first hit.  &quot;Green to Queen&quot; I always say. As well, flavors change throughout the burning buds life.\u000a\u000aMy review for this strain of Mango is that it took too long for the flavor to come out.  I could only get a hint of the taste Mango..  and it didn&#39;t come out until there was 2-3rd puffs left in the bowl.\u000a\u000aThis is another &quot;top shelf&quot; bud that failed to deliver the essence of the strain.

VThe first time in a longtime that I have had medicine that is a one hitter and quitter. I could not believe it. Took five hits the first time by accident and thought I was in North Korea. Almost passed it over, but quickly realized that I over did it. Pick this strain up if you are looking for a quick, in fact, straight to high experience. One joint lasted me two days. I was scared to hit it Lol. Definitely will be picking up more of this strain, while being more careful in my dosing.
