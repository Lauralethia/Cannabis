VWhen you open the bag of this super potent strain you are hit immediately with a piney lemony zest smell! Without a doubt you know you hit the jackpot. Grinding is best sonce the strand is super sticky and will leave your fingers sticky as well! Loosely roll your blunt for a better smoke intake with a nice and slow burn. One of the few strands that completely gets rid of my right shoulder pain and that is why this baby gets a 5 star!

VThis strain puts me in a very analytical state. Great for writing. Good head high and puts me very aware of my surroundings; aware to the point where I panic at some moments. Pretty psychedelic actually. Smoking some right now... and that&#39;s my experience with Alpine OG.

VRelaxing, mind and body. I was Nauseous and it took that away. Very tasty you only need to use a little bit and it goes a long way definitely stimulates the mind it\u2019s much more body and mind relaxing Than it is psychoactive
