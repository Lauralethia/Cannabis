VHave you noticed that virtually every reviewer believes this strain is special?  It&#39;s because it is. This is one of those unique strains that has an amazing smell from a unique sweet blueberry muffin terpene profile, a powerful euphoric effect, beautiful crystal structure and a calm and focused high.  I don&#39;t feel the munchies or apprehension or anxiety or fear at all - super smooth inner calm reminds me of Gorilla Glue #4. Better than Blue Dream by a mile.

VFor somome who gets anxiety super badly from Weed, this weed gave me absolutely no anxiety. I felt calm and realx. I did feel a little on the edge but this strain relaxed me so much. I also get paranio but the strain oddly gave me no paranioa. The idea is to just enjoy this straind and let it do its just. If you fight it or go against it then you might end up with a bad trip.
