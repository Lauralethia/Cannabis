VA true indica! This strain tastes amazing but definitely for just relaxation high. You start off on a good head high then this strain will knock you out if you&#39;re even remotely tired. But the taste alone makes for excellent boat times !

VSuper Dense! Heavy in the jar earthy aroma hits me in the third eye.\u000aThe Smell: Fruity not grape like it smells more of a deep sweet plum, undertones of soil fresh soil not manuer its hard to explain like soil from the amazon, it&#39;s also a little musky, pungent!\u000aThe Bud: Damn Purple fer sure that velvet royal purple! It&#39;s a rose structure, foxtails towards the top, some really heavy in orange as well haze yellow over it some lean to the left and right. Compact and dense not spongy at all, fresh, and dense, the size of a quarter, tested at 18.85% Thc CBD .04%, and 0% CBN this place prides it&#39;s self on exact genetics and correct testing for each product consistently for each batch as well. Lot# and Batch tested by stepphill labs. Very very impressed with this, through research I&#39;ve found that these genetics are also known as bayside purple. \u000a\u000aThe Taste: Earth, Pungent, Pepper! Very Flowery tasting on the tips almost sorta sweet very interesting very hmmm, like a rose perfume. \u000a Very happy I am rhyming a lot and back in the rap game this is fer sure the best for pain and I can feel music better since I am also a producer it&#39;s a clear-er picture of how and where to go with music, very jazzy beats to those rhyming gates to the plates that dish out the best dinner an&#39;t nothing thinner than french dinner serving size in portion to that&#39;s slimmer hunger games in the new game in which I like to say it&#39;s all gravey like bailey. So yea&#39; kind of like that free styling I love how it makes me focus a lot love the audio effects on this I say try vaporizing it&#39;s changed my life for the better and haven&#39;t switched to anything since.

VI love how dark the leaves on these small nuggets get its super deep purple to a rich black textures of sweet and floral leave me peaceful with each toke. The body effects are sublime with relaxation on every calyx. These nuggets shine with a yellowish coating the kind you see on nicely grown golden goat. It leaves me with a dry mouth after a while. Other than helping with my cachexia and anorexia with adhd gone thanks to this I can sleep easy thanks deep purple. It also helps with tinnitus it effects sound differently really something quite nice :D

VI smoked this indica strain at night, ready to go to sleep after a long day but instead this strain made me energetic and excited and brought on my OCD symptoms. I was up for hours organizing my house. unable to turn my mind off.  Overall, the taste, smell and look of this bud was great, but the effects were not at all what I need for my medical issues.

VOutstanding! Dark traces of trich&#39;s over these small buds. Got a poco from SWOP and I gotta say, dank - very dank. Give em a lil squeeze and super sweet smell of this pops, but the bud hardly moves its a nice little rock! Very hairy and  with tested 18% it&#39;s no wonder I wanted to try this strain. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a oldie but a goodie! Stress is gone I feel like getting a lot of my un-fished projects done and out of the way. Pain was a 7 now it&#39;s a 1, absolutely great. The taste is Herbal at first but extremely smooth afterwards. I rate this sublime simply because it helps on all my needs. AdHD is gone I am very focused if I need to be; like writing this review :P. Smells of floral and great lavender lineage maybe?  Anyways would recommend simply, because its an absolutely heavy relaxer if need be and if you want to get things done its a go with the flow sort of feeling rock on everyone! Also one more thing its sweet as if you were to be in a grapevine field just the aroma alone would describe how pungently sweet this strain truly is.

Vi&#39;ve suffered from panic and anxiety, depression, insomnia weight loss with loss of appitie and migranes since i was eight. tried a plethera of phsych meds for twenty plus years with no relief; in fact the side effects have caused me more harm than any benifits  the loss of jobs and even seizures when the docs cant get you refills on time. i&#39;ve had to call the crisis line a couple of times because they could not scedule an appointment in time to fill the meds they said i should not stop taking, worst withdrawl ever. i&#39;m 50 years old now and not taking the phych meds any more, the side effects were worse  and damaged my thyroid, high colesteral, tartive disconisia (SP) etc.;the meds never helped all that much with my conditions anyhow. i&#39;m so tired of not sleeping through the night and waiking up in a panic; sometimes i have anxiety so bad it is paralizing. i&#39;ve even had histerical blindness, would have never believed that could accually happen till it happened to me after my husband and father of four passed away in 1994 when my children were 1,3,8 and13. \u000a\u000ai pray that you can help me, and i look forward to meeting with you and your staff.\u000a\u000athankyou,\u000a\u000aHeather\u000aP.S. i have not tried Deep purple or any yet, have to schedule an appointmant
