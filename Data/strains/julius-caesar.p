Vwow what a surprise. usually the reviews are a little hype for me, and the product falls short of expectations, but not here. spot on reviews for overall feelings, this is great with Netflix or people and conversation

VOne of my all time favorite strains. It hits you extreamly fast. By the time I got back to my room from my smoke session, I was already gone. The smell is rather enjoyable for someone who likes the outdoors. Overall a really enjoyable and relaxing mind high.

VNew cannabis user here, so I&#39;ve only tried a few strains, and so far this one is the best. I noticed it&#39;s sweet, almost perfume-like taste, which I enjoyed. Then noticed it&#39;s euphoric, relaxing effects. I felt happy and very relaxed, but not sedate. Wanted to be out and social. Definitely a good day high. Will probably be a favoritive during summer!

VI am reviewing this strain in the form of concentrate, specifically Moxie&#39;s live resin.\u000a\u000aAlready a moxie fan, but this is a standout even amongst their premium extracts. In budder form, the flavor has a very distinct topical fruity taste to it - and a high equally as pleasant. This is a mood lifter. But the flavor....seriously it&#39;s amazing. Will pick this up anytime I can find it.

VGreat and strong. Smells and taste good. At first i felt a bit paranoid and anxius. After a few mins it was magical, i felt so free, happy and euphoric. One of my favorite highs. Must try

After the tripp ull start feeling heavy and it will take u straight to sleep, a deep relaxin sleep. Love this strain\u000aTotally recommended.

VThis strain was very strong. Felt the high right away feeling a bit anxius and paranoid but that only lasted a few minutes. After that it was magical. Feeling a total mind trip very happy, free and idealistic. Awesome smell and taste. Totally recommended

VThis is one of my favorite hybrid strains. The high is extremely cerebral and psychedelic, with an additional slight muscle relaxation. It is a very strong and intense high. Would not recommend it to beginners.
