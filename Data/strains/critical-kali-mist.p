VLarge round shaped buds for the most part and others more cone shaped all of them however dense yet spongey and easy to rip apart with lost of hairs and trics blanketing the buds that we all beautiful shades of green. The smoke is a clear hard hitting sativa that almost can cut through the high of a indica,that I had been smoking on earlier that day, clear headed high that hits you quick and wakes you up yet it&#39;s still great for relaxing. I&#39;m usually not a fan of sativas but this one is great everything you&#39;d want it a potent sativa high.

VEarthy smell and taste with a hint of sugary sweetness. Not really energizing but leaves me feeling happy, light, and relaxed without feeling lethargic. Good daytime option, especially for anyone dealing with pain that doesn&#39;t want a racey or knockout strain but still wants something potent.
