VAs a true born Indica lover, let me assure you this Black Domina/Critical Mass Indica hybrid has been like a fine wine, to this old timer. The buds were large, med to light green flowers with orange hairs jumping out. It has a rose flavored palette aftertaste that only a &quot;Weed Snob&quot; like myself could appreciate.   Expensive, more dispensaries should carry this narcotic like Indica to supplement the opiates for those who must take them. and to help others avoid them altogether with this pain relieving miracle plant! It is a welcome relief to smoke or eat away my pain, than to contemplate the dangers of a freaking pill! Doaback68@gmail.com

VProbably one of the most underrated strains. Got one heaven of a bag last week ( 10 grams )\u000a\u000aBag appeal: Ball-shaped bud, 1g per piece. Not overwhelming but other points even this out.\u000a\u000a\u000aSmell: Unbelieveably good. Sweet Tropical Fruits with a hint of Rose. Best smell I\u2018ve ever experienced.\u000a\u000aTaste: (Joint) Very sweet and fruity-like. Best tasting weed ever.\u000a\u000aHigh: Extremely mellow. You just want to snuggle into bed, watch a movie and slowly fall asleep. Makes you feel good and happy. Probably the best strain after a breakup.\u000a\u000aFinal statement: Great strain, but smell/taste depends on your grower\u2018s skill. I would recommend ! ( Black Domina x Critical Mass )\u000aOverall 4.1\u2b50\ufe0f

VIf you could make happiness have a smell this is it.

Nausea GONE!, slight munchies, pain? pfft what pain. \u000aNormally a very anti Indica due to the full on couch lock, and the foggy head aspect of it.

VI got this as a &quot;flower&quot; gift to myself on Vday. The bud tender recommended it to me at Moss Crossing in Eugene, and I usually listen to this one and a few others in particular. And boy was she right on! It is tasty. I think it is sorta peachy in addition to the hint of rose. But that could be more the profile of the batch. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t often buy the same strain twice just because I really dig variety and like to switch up phenotypes. But I have picked this one up three times now. And I will probably get it a few more before I get bored of it and move on to a new rotation.

VGot an ounce of this wonderful bud from my new caregiver. After a few bowls, it&#39;s become one of my favorites. I typically go for heavy indicas, and this did not disappoint. Pleasant taste, crazy head high although I still felt somewhat functional. I didn&#39;t notice any body high effects, but then, I was stoned, so I probably just don&#39;t remember. This strain is perfect for my C-PTSD maintenance, pain maintenance, insomnia, and the most important factor in smoking pot: it does a fantastic job of making you forget about your worries for awhile. It swaddles you in euphoria and holds you gently until sleep comes. The buds I got were sticky as hell and covered in trichomes. I love you, Sugar Black Rose!

VI suffer bad anxiety and panic disorder. First thing I noticed was it\u2019s pungent almost lemon smell. Very sticky and the buds are tight and beautiful. After 2 tokes my anxiety melted away and found myself laughing at the TV over nothing in particular. I\u2019d love to come across this strain again. It also knocked out a nagging headache I had! Recommend strongly. It didn\u2019t take much for me to achieve desired affect so it should last a while.

VThis strain smells and tastes just like its name advertises: like a sweet (maybe a sickly sweet) rose.  It&#39;s a nice taste, but I find it a bit overwhelming. After a while, it tastes more like an air freshener rose scent rather than a real rose, and it started to grate on my nerves.\u000a\u000aThe high is a typical Indica high, and it&#39;s very sedating. Four puffs on a joint is enough to couch lock me. Six is enough to put me out. \u000a\u000aOverall, a nice strain in moderation, but it&#39;s not something I&#39;d pick up again unless my goal was specifically to combat insomnia.

VWow\u000aI usually like sativa but I found this beauty in concentrate Form and it smelled amazing so I gave it a try. I went back for five more grams the next day. It hits pretty sweet off my nectar collector, and the high is almost narcotic like. Very effective for back pain, anxiety, and sleep. Ps My friend reported an initial burst of energy that dissipated into relaxation, but I think it&#39;s because he is not well versed in &#39;dabs&#39; or my nectar collector. Quite the strain, highly recommend. Would be interested to try the flower in a nice j.

VI suffer bad anxiety and panic disorder. First thing I noticed was it\u2019s pungent almost lemon smell. Very sticky and the buds are tight and beautiful. After 2 tokes my anxiety melted away and found myself laughing at the TV over nothing in particular. I\u2019d love to come across this strain again. It also knocked out a nagging headache I had! Recommend strongly. It didn\u2019t take much for me to achieve desired affect so it should last a while.

VI am seriously in love with this indica dominant hybrid! Its sweet and savory aroma translates beautifully into a delicious taste. Reminiscent of tangerines, champagne and black pepper. \u000a\u000aThe effects are super versatile! A small dose is perfect for fighting daytime pain, or nausea. A few more puffs morphs the high into a relaxing night time buzz that is perfect for after dinner and pre-bedtime. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m keeping a full stock of this in my medicine cabinet. You should grab some too!!

VThe 18% THC listing is way off.  I contacted Delicious Seeds to comment how my prime Black Domina dominant pheno SBR mother seems stronger than 18%.  They sent a pdf of the lab analysis showing 24.6% THC for the strain.  More like how she compares with the higher end stuff around, 18% being a little weak by my standards.\u000aI have no idea where the 18% number comes from, usually breeders fudge it the figures the other way around.\u000aNot just tasty, SBR packs a punch.

VGot an ounce of this wonderful bud from my new caregiver. After a few bowls, it&#39;s become one of my favorites. I typically go for heavy indicas, and this did not disappoint. Pleasant taste, crazy head high although I still felt somewhat functional. I didn&#39;t notice any body high effects, but then, I was stoned, so I probably just don&#39;t remember. This strain is perfect for my C-PTSD maintenance, pain maintenance, insomnia, and the most important factor in smoking pot: it does a fantastic job of making you forget about your worries for awhile. It swaddles you in euphoria and holds you gently until sleep comes. The buds I got were sticky as hell and covered in trichomes. I love you, Sugar Black Rose!

VSugar Black Rose is a special strain that has what it takes to impress the majority of folks who try it.  Nice dense little stinky buds.  Very unique smell that borders the line between sweet floral &amp; exotic spice.  Standing by itself with a terpene profile matching no other strain I have tried before.  Whoever named this flower was spot on!!\u000a\u000aBuzz seems to match the flavor starting out almost invigorating like the spice notes trying to overpower the sweet ones.  The clove like zest puts up a good fight while the cannabis clouds still in the air.  Sweet odor that I can&#39;t really put a finger on has mainstay holding a heavy indica vibe.  Within 5 minutes the the thought of &quot;invigorate&quot; has vanished seeming like a dream just dissipating away with the last hint of spicy ganja smoke.  Very soon thereafter the mind follows dissipating into peaceful rest.

VI LOVE this strain and would rate it 5 stars because of the unique and quality flavor (5 stars) and high (4 stars), but unfortunately (for me, anyway) I find the current growers Forte Farms are VERY inconsistent with the product quality and presentation. My first buy was a HUGE hit as the bud was dense enough and the lack of byproducts (stems/leaf/etc.) for the $49/8th price excellent. The shop soon sold out, and when the strain returned the bud quality and lack of byproducts was down significantly, as the bud tasted leafy- like joint stock. A VERY poor combo for a very expensive flower, so I haven&#39;t purchased any since because each time I inspect a jar, the product looks just crappy and I will NOT pay over $40 for a crappy-looking and tasting 8th of anything, period.\u000aSo, my review would be that the strain can be quite nice, but the consistency and quality for the higher price (at least through the grower Forte Farms) just isn&#39;t good at all. I have had the same results from Forte with their Kronic strain ($49/8th) which is great at times, and crappy at others.

VI&#39;ve been having serious issues with depression,and my doctor wanted to prescribe all these pills...like Zoloft and Xanax...I don&#39;t believe in Big Pharma myself,so I immediately said no,as I&#39;ve lived my life without them so far. I got this from a friend who knows someone that tends to a pretty substantial number of plants in different growth stages and strains...I told him what I needed and got hooked up 40 dollars for what seemed to be about a half an ounce,which is quite a bit.\u000a\u000aThe smell and taste is very floral and &quot;beautiful&quot; I suppose you would call it. It isn&#39;t a very strong smell like some who aren&#39;t around marijuana very much would expect. What I experience is that my limbs and head feel very heavy after about 25 to 30 minutes. I wasn&#39;t quite falling asleep,but all of my cares in the world disappeared. This plant has changed my life. The mindset tends to stick...I only smoke this maybe once every 2 weeks. Or even less. Treat this strain like you would treat any other medicine...This isn&#39;t a &quot;I want to get high for a minute&quot; strain. This is a &quot;I want to make myself better&quot; strain. At least for me.
