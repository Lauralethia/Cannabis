VQuality genetics and a strain of OG I&#39;ve always wanted to cultivate. It has a slight uppiness to it like a sativa but quickly settles into an Indica body numbing buzz. Aleviating pain and joint discomfort, goid for sour moods and appitite stimulation. Glad I finnaly got to see how this one works out for me, and it dise great at that, you won&#39;t be disappointed  it&#39;s also very gard nit to dut and just smoke bowl after bowl, its very smooth and tastes like lemins siaked un disel.

VGreat strain/grow; sweet herbal taste &amp; smooth smoke that doesn&#39;t burn or make you cough unless you get a massive hit or something. Makes your eyes feel stoney but no couch lock. Currently my fave daytime med, takes my mind away from my pain enough to have decent focus &amp; tcob, but def stoney enough to get a teensy bit distracted sometimes too. Very euphoric for me also!

VI already know I&#39;ll get a bunch of thumbs down for this, but I don&#39;t see what the big deal is about it. I have heard people rave about it, and the reviews speak super highly of it. Maybe it&#39;s a light buzz that you don&#39;t really notice.  \u000aAnyways I picked up half gram ofRug Burn OG by MUV shatter, a brand I expect good stuff from, I smoked 75% of it before I decided to stop &amp; try again the next day. I medicated as soon as I woke up, once again not much of a noticeable buzz. It didn&#39;t effect my mood at all I hear it&#39;s good for any mood disorders. \u000aI will try this strain again, it&#39;s possible AI just got a bad batch

V*Dr.Nugz Special Collection* This 2012 high times cannabis cup 3rd place winner is a really special hidden gem. While its unimpressive smell may not entice you right away, make no mistake; Rug Burn OG is dank. I went from skeptic to adoring fan boy in about 15 minutes. It brought many sensual sensory delights on many moonlit evenings with my wonderful lady love. This is what I call &quot;the wine of nugs&quot;. All and all, this home run hitter wins my heart over not for looks or smell or power, but for it&#39;s carefree tension melting experiences you can&#39;t put a price on.

VThis is definitely the perfect Indica, it has a very potent, cheese/sour smell. The taste is there, and its a smooth hit. The feeling is fantastic, its a bit of a sneaker, but as a daily smoker, I was able to smoke one bowl and feel pretty good right after. About 20 minutes later is when I started feeling myself melt into my chair. Very lazy high, little bit of munchies, but I cant get up to find anything lol. Overall this is a great strain, I would suggest it to anyone looking for a perfect, before bed, indica for those looking for something to help that insomnia

VThe first time i had this it was overripe and had some brown leaves but smelled similar to Platinum OG, super pinesoly and clean...one hit BURNED the back of my throat and got me sick in the sinuses for almost a week, lol. Since then its been extremely similar to the Ghost in nuance, shape, smell and pretty much everything else. The RD#1 that Scott hit to everything was a stud though and seemed to lock down alot of nice dominant genes. Not the most potent OG but that makes it more diverse than some of the powerful, 1-2 punch ones.

Two nights in a row I&#39;ve found myself half asleep, squinting, one eye closed, trying my damndest to look at my phone. Rug Burn makes anything but sleep impossible for me, but in an uncomfortable way. I love UW, Grape Ape, Bubba, Afgoo... a deep, sleepy indica is my favorite. Rug Burn is not that.

VOne of the best strains I&#39;ve had from Harvest of Scottsdale, stands head and shoulder above the rest and slams the senses in delight. Extremely aromatic (along the likes of Jack Herer or Grape Ape in terms of pungency) with dense, conical buds that are generously frosted. Bright orange hairs add visual texture throughout as well. The taste of the smoke upon exhale is enough to make the most experienced patients lean back with eyebrows raised, impressed frown and head nods all around. Tastes exactly as it smells- a true rarity. Smoking this flower leaves the user wonderfully relaxed and in a mellow mood, yet still allowing for creativity in the mind and the opportunity for an involved harmony with one&#39;s surroundings. Newer patients should caution the sedating effects of this strain despite its hybrid nature, and veteran smokers can enjoy that a little goes a long way for uplifting any situation.

VI&#39;m using leafly.com to journal my cannabis experiences, so I thought I would start with the first strain I ever tried.\u000a\u000a\u000aI tried Rug Burn OG using my friends Volcano Vaporizer. I took about 3 or 4 big hits over about a 45 minute period of time. I have to say, not having the smoke and being able to partake in cannabis via vapor, was a good call. Little to no coughing. I started feeling something about 30 mins in and by an hour after my first hit, I was for sure feeling the effects. At first, it felt like I was wearing a cannabis crown, a lot of smiling, then it moved to my feet and then eventually to my face and chest. I was with 3 other people, one very experienced and 2 very inexperienced like me. They were chatting it up, but I wanted to do nothing but go sit on the couch. I chilled on my couch with my friend and my dog and just listened and chilled. Did I mentioned I chilled. For the next two hours, I just sat on my couch, listening to the sounds of my house and my wife, who for some reason decided to clean the kitchen and make some snacks. The one great part of this experience was the next morning, when I woke up, I felt great.\u000a\u000a\u000aSo, there it is, my first cannabis experience.

VAlthough listed as an indica, I found this strain to be almost sativa dominant.  Very clear, energetic, creative high without any anxiouness/paranoia.  Imagine as though someone has taken OG kush and sprinkled it with subtle fuely sour diesel undertones..  This one really does taste how it smells - a dark, slightly spicy grapefruit/citrus fuely kush. The taste lasts right down to the roach which is always a bonus. The buds have sativa structure, almost a combination of hazey foxtails rather than hard tight calyxes.  I would highly recommend this strain to kush lovers out there that want that uplifting sativa high, although i may have just stumbled across a unicorn phenotype.. ; )\u000a\u000aPeace!

There&#39;s a lot of affects for the head it helps with lack of appetite pain stress anxiety ADD/ADHD and of course nausea. Rug burn is covered with hair is but is slightly separated by little parts here and there I would suggest the strain to be coded with strikes but I actually beans clusters have more THC in them than the whole bud.  rug burn is covered with hair is but is slightly separated by little parts here and there I would suggest the strain to be coded with trikes but I actually big clusters have more THC in them than the Whole bud.

VOh man, what an awesome strain.  The purchase was based off it&#39;s pungent, diesel aroma which I knew would smack me in the face, as nugs like that always do. The high is a nice, uplifting euphoria with some sedation attached (or maybe I was just tired from a long day). It might turn out to be the best out of the 3 strains I got, we will see.

VOne of the best strains I&#39;ve had from Harvest of Scottsdale, stands head and shoulder above the rest and slams the senses in delight. Extremely aromatic (along the likes of Jack Herer or Grape Ape in terms of pungency) with dense, conical buds that are generously frosted. Bright orange hairs add visual texture throughout as well. The taste of the smoke upon exhale is enough to make the most experienced patients lean back with eyebrows raised, impressed frown and head nods all around. Tastes exactly as it smells- a true rarity. Smoking this flower leaves the user wonderfully relaxed and in a mellow mood, yet still allowing for creativity in the mind and the opportunity for an involved harmony with one&#39;s surroundings. Newer patients should caution the sedating effects of this strain despite its hybrid nature, and veteran smokers can enjoy that a little goes a long way for uplifting any situation.

VGot Rug Burn OG from Ganja Candy Factory. I have to say, she is amazing!!! Strong citrus scent with a hint of sweetness to it. Great nug size, very frosty! Just all around beautiful!!! I\u2019m smoking it as I write.\u000aAwesome all around! I would love to go into details but feel like I would sound deranged. \u000aThe important information is, that it is amazing and you should definitely try it especially if you are a medical patient with; insomnia, back pain, depression, anxiety (i have horrible anxiety &amp; bipolar depression), writers block,  third eye blocked, chakra blockage, or what have you. This the strain to try!!! You won\u2019t regret it, (takes puff) that\u2019s for sure.

VI love my sativas and for a strain that&#39;s supposed to be indica dominant from the review I read it was very strong having a high THC (in the 20&#39;s) content and acted more like a sativa being an uplifting cerebellar high which made me more energetic and gave me a feeling of well being. Didn&#39;t give me the munchies either as that is NOT a wanted side effect. Already take something to suppress my appetite as it is. IDK about others but most sativas act as pretty powerful aphrodisiacs with me. I&#39;ve heard from many men &amp; women alike that cannabis period has this effect on them as well.  Forget the little blue or pink pill, smoke a joint or eat a cookie. Not sure if cannabis acts the same with men as say a viagra would but sure does work for women and a hell of a lot cheaper than the new pink pill and of course safer. If you&#39;re a regular smoker and looking for a hard hitting high that isn&#39;t sedating and last&#39;s 30-40 mins per average sized joint. I recommend you check this strain out, it&#39;ll be worth it.
