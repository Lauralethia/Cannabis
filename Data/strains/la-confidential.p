VGave me an appetite for vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with Baileys like you wouldn&#39;t believe. Probably not great stuff for yoga or hiking - more of a strain for watching reruns of Ren and Stimpy or The Dark Crystal, or, hell, just any box with light coming out of it. Has some potential for encouraging screenplay ideas or nonsense aphorisms, and for having sex if the day hasn&#39;t been too long. Good for reading Tang Dynasty-era Chinese poetry. Don&#39;t attempt to play an instrument on this one; it&#39;ll feel large and ungainly and sound hollow. Early on, I laughed at an episode of South Park for what had to be about 4 minutes. During the comedown, the world started to sag a bit. Super for sleeping and achieving muscular equilibrium while doing supine body awareness meditation!

VThis strain right here is a Classic. Calms to the core. The taste pallet is truly unique, offering a pungent, danky, piney, citrus that you cannot mistake. Once you smoke it you don&#39;t forget it. LA Confidential is a very well rounded strain that seems to be the perfect fit for any situation. Pick this one up if your seasoned or a newbie smoker alike.

VI was fortunate enough to get some organic outdoor LA Confidential from Humboldt County this fall at harvest time. This strain is truly top of the line, and there&#39;s a reason that it&#39;s one of the most popular medical strains in California. \u000a\u000aThe flavor of the buds is unmatched - I agree with the other reviewer who said it tastes like wintergreen upon inhalation. When you exhale, it tastes a bit fruity/lemony, and you get a distinctly skunky taste. The smell of the smoke is fantastic and classic.\u000a\u000aI do not recommend this bud for anxiety or sleep, as it has a lot of euphoric, head buzz qualities to it, unlike some other indicas that may be better for such medical applications. After I smoked my first hit of it, I had a grin plastered across my face. I think this strain has good pain relief qualities, but I have smoked other strains before bed to calm down because this bud makes me high, happy, and jubilant. I already made sure to secure the rest of the batch. :)

VI know LA con isn&#39;t the highest THC strain or the most knockout hybrid of all time but theres just something cozy about her. Shes like that old friend that you know has your back...it just works, and works well. Nice chiggity check yourself euphoric buzz that starts behind the eyes and warms you up from head to toe. Dense little round nugs super light green with tints of purple with that high leaf ratio indicas are known for (good for hash making), but has a nice texture to it and nice trichs. That smell in the air is unmistakable similar to a good kush. Idk shes just bae, ya know? lol

VPicked up some prerolls from Essence in Las Vegas. I was looking for a good, relaxing high that wouldn&#39;t amplify my natural anxiety. The bud tender recommended LA Confidential without hesitation. \u000a\u000aGot it back to my hotel, took one good hit with some buddies, and got comfy in my bed. After about 5 minutes, we all noticed the telltale dry-mouth, but it took another 5-10 minutes before the wave hit. It brought a nice, mild euphoria with some early giggles and talkativeness that gave way into a pleasant sleepiness. It was super easy to drift off into my own headspace, but I could snap back into reality and engage in conversation reasonably well. I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying to do anything thought-intensive, though. \u000a\u000aAs usual for me, I got a tinge of anxiety as I was coming up, but it melted away in seconds and never returned. Once I decided to fall asleep, it happened instantly. Woke up clear-headed the next morning, feeling great.

VMy new everyday anti-inflammatory. I&#39;ve got chronic pain in my lower back and hips. Bursitis is uncontrollable. I&#39;ve developed terrible rebound headaches due to the amount of ibprofin I was taking. Now I smoke a little bit of this. Works wonders. Gets me motivated. Twice I was smoking a joint and forgot i was smoking! When I say twice I mean two different times I was smoking the night before my first try of the LA Confidential and I stopped right in the middle I put it in the ashtray I went out into the other room incomplete project.. Organization needed doing.. Mind you I was going to bed at the time. it got me right up didn&#39;t notice my pain was obviously better considering I was cleaning. and then the next day I was smoking I did the same thing I put in the ashtray I forgot i was smoking so, I walked out of the room and did a small load of laundry! ((Only difference between the first time I smoked and the next day. I smoked this strain for the inflammation and the motivation..I knew what to expect, and so I was smoking while I was cleaning the house..Hits you quick head body, the  come down no crash.. I especially like vaping this in the day.

VThis is a review from two stoners who are currently baked on LA Confidential.\u000a\u000a\u000aBud quality:\u000a\u000a  Smell:  loud af 9/10\u000a\u000a  Sight:  green with orange pistils nothing special               6/10\u000a\u000a  Texture:  wellhumidified, smashed flat, smooth 7/10\u000a\u000a\u000aSmoke:\u000a\u000a  Pull:  smooth pull, no harsh feeling on the throat 9/10\u000a\u000a  Taste:  was diesely but not in a bad way it&#39;s taste was actually good, both of us even exclaimed it tasted better than most buds we&#39;ve smoked 10/10\u000a\u000a\u000aHigh:\u000a\u000a    General Description:  It hits very heavy and very quickly leaving the user physically feeling stoned literally but very much mentally aware and capable.  Feeling total body relaxation and a calm wave over my body.  Very tired only for night time but it is overcomable, if you mix it with some sativa would make for an excellent stress reliever and energizer! 8.5/10\u000a\u000a  Positives:  relaxing, good for insomniacs, euphoric, nice body high, pain relief\u000a\u000a  Negatives:  tiredness, a little heavy hitting for newcomers\u000a\u000a\u000aNote:  would not suggest for a busy day.  It&#39;s good for a lazy day on the couch and may knock you out even still.

V**LOVE**Purchased this strain in Portland,OR recently from Health Awareness Group. This is an outstanding bud. Nicely cured, dense but still a little sponginess. I hope I&#39;m describing this right because I love how it made me feel, body and mind. It is an uplifting, relaxing high but it didn&#39;t make me want to curl up in the next bed I saw. Although you could smoke this near bedtime and you&#39;d have no trouble sleeping. Definitely worth a try IMHO.

VMellow is the word with this one.  Vaping this can even taste a bit marshmallowy at times, and the effect is best characterized as mellowing.  It combines a potent body high with some nice cerebral qualities.  Conversation flows easily with this strain, and my wife and I have had some pretty thoughtful and productive conversations on it.  Not the strongest strain I&#39;ve tried, but a nicely balanced one.\u000a\u000aLA Confidential makes me very laid back and relaxed, but also deliberate and focused as a result.  Unlike other indicas, this strain doesn&#39;t knock me out unless I&#39;m already exhausted, and leaves me feeling focused and purposeful . Personally, I prefer that to feeling like a bumbling, out of control idiot, but there&#39;s a time and place for everything I suppose. It&#39;s also what makes this strain great for both relaxing and performing a variety of tasks requiring your focus and attention.  A great and versatile indica.

VLA Confidential can be a very nice strain. It makes me very very relaxed and tired and makes me feel very in tune with peoples emotions. It also puts me in a mood to think and helps me think about a lot of different things. Because it is such a heavy indica, it is not any good for daytime use. Although, it helps with insomnia and if you use it RIGHT before you fall asleep, you will have a pleasnt floaty feeling as you drift into a heavy sleep. The next morning, your muscles will be very loose

VI put LA Confidential in the same category as Chocolate Chunk, Salmon River OG, and God Bud. All three are amazingly calming and focused. I don&#39;t meditate, but if I did, these strains would be highly conducive to it. I try to keep an indica/CBD mix in the house, but if I have LA Confidential, I don&#39;t need CBD.

V&#129304;&#128170; LA Confidential smells so nostalgic... reminds me of high school... Like fresh cut grass layered with pine... an adventurous summer morning as a novice weed smoker... This is a classic heavy hitter with a bitter smell and taste. Very potent!!! This strain will start you off on the couch, stoned out of your mind and you will make your way to the fridge where you will become completely ravenous. I won&#39;t even say what it made me do, but let&#39;s just say I was practically fiending for salts and sugars and anything crunchy. Highly recommend this strain to anyone who loves indicas! It has a very subtle psychedelic effect to it. b-Myrcene: 1.711 mg/g,  Limonene: 2.815 mg/g,  Linalool: 1.375 mg/g.

VTasted in an Arizer Extreme Q at 190 &#176;C.\u000a\u000aAmazing sweet taste, very tasty yet the vapor is very soft when inhaled. There&#39;s one strong dominant taste giving an authentic flavor to this strain, which will make it easy to remember and identify/authentify it in the future. It doesn&#39;t taste like a mix of other flavors I know. Me and one of my friend both particularly noticed that the taste lasted on our tongue tens of minutes after having finished the vape session.\u000a\u000aThe high comes in smoothly and is very relaxing,  yet there is a good cerebral high with it so you can enjoy a balanced high. Highly recommended for indica/kush smokers but I&#39;m sure the sativa smokers will like this one too.

VThis is a strain I&#39;ve been wanting to try for a while because of all the great things I heard. I grabbed a sample gram while out and about. I found some a really nice light dep that was supposedly organic. The buds were real lime green and extremely dense. These buds were so hard I had a difficult time getting them started in the grinder. Unfortunately my flowers didn&#39;t have much bag appeal and once ground, there was still hardly any aroma. My nose was a left a little disappointed. I burned a small bowl, smooth, completely flavorless but smooth at least. After a short time the effects were felt, so I torched another small bowl and could almost instantly feel the head high. A great little kick to the front of the skull and shortly after my knee aches are gone. My body shortly forgets the long road trip it took that day. A third bowl sometime later sets me up for a solid 2.5 hours of comfort and relief, my tensions are gone and joints feel relieved. The strain didn&#39;t leave me totally gorked or couch locked, but very relaxed. Not my personal choice for sleeping, recommended for evening use.

VAhhhh yes! A true classic heavyweight champ! L.A. Confidential, one of my favorite California Indicas of all time baby.\u000a\u000aThe appearance can be anywhere from a darker green, to absolute 100% purple. Usually has shorter bright orange pistils.\u000a\u000aIn the smell you can always detect sweet berry type of a scent, occasionally this is mixed with an earthy/woody smell, and if it&#39;s a very well grown phenotype you often can smell and/or taste a distinctly grape flavor. As far as taste goes: pretty much the same as the smells.\u000a\u000aEffects: A lot of people like to use this to help them fall asleep, or get rid of pain. This stuff is also excellent for nausea and stress. Very relaxing, melted butter body high with a funky, heavy, stoney and heady Indica groove.\u000a\u000aGo crank up Electric Wizard&#39;s &quot;Dopethrone&quot; album and bust out your big bad beast bong and get riiiiippppped!\u000a\u000a-BONG THE RIPPER \u000a\u000a

VL A Confidential is one of my all time fav strains--  a  5-star &quot;go to&quot; strain that I always make sure to &quot;stash a bit.&quot; Perfect when you feel stressed or wound up. This one will relax you, but not necessarily put you to sleep. Good for sharing with a loved one, if you know what I mean ;)  \u000a\u000aI&#39;m not great at describing flavors or aromas, but LA provides both a body high with some cerebral lift. I love it!

VI just bought several different grams from here the other day, and this was my fav. Really good for pain &amp; anxiety, especially if you mix it with the Omrita CBD. Good high without feeling too heavy, but can definitely knock you out. All in all, highly recommended!

VGreat strain, the head high is strong with this one. It&#39;s an excellent appetite enhancer as well as a decent sleep aid. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this strain for getting energized or loose at parties, or beginning/working on a creative or important task. Medically, this strain is a fine one

VReal potent effects with this, definitely not a day time consumption kind of weed (at least not if you want to get shit done). Managed to get a gram at Greenhouse, it was a great looking nug, real dark, dank appearance. Slightly musky fragrance with a real &#39;holy shit I&#39;m stoned&#39; feel - again; not one to consume if you&#39;re partial to a wake and bake as you&#39;ll more than likely end up asleep again.

VI have nothing to do for the next 3 weeks before I start my new job, so I&#39;m trying Indicas in the morning because I just don&#39;t give a rip.  I did wake and bake with a Select Elite vape cartridge, which is 76.3%.  My eyelids became heavy within a few minutes and I immediately became aroused and noticed that my sense of touch was enhanced.  It&#39;s like psychedelic cialis.  The best thing about LA Confidential for me was that I could tackle tasks such as running errands but I could just as easily binge watch Ozark on Netflix.  The most intense sensation for me was being horny.  I also felt talkative, but I&#39;m sure I slurred my words because this strain also had an intense psychedelic effect.  I would compare this to Shark Shock, which is a favorite of mine.

This stuff is also excellent for nausea and stress. Very relaxing, melted butter body high with a funky, heavy, stoney and heady Indica groove.\u000a\u000aGo crank up Electric Wizard&#39;s &quot;Dopethrone&quot; album and bust out your big bad beast bong and get riiiiippppped!\u000a\u000a-BONG THE RIPPER \u000a\u000a

VVery sticky, great smell, smooth taste. Effects: Wow! Psychedelic like a mild, clean acid trip, but with no nervousness, anxiety, etc. Great for socializing. Mind expanding big time. The world suddenly made sense. I understood the world (and people) around me at a much higher and deeper level, and it felt very good doing so. It was like God had cranked up the mental evolution dials on me! I can see why this strain would be popular in social situations. I became very outgoing. It curbed my urge to drink booze too. \u000a\u000aAfter the high sets in though, no one wants to smoke much later. It&#39;s that good. And long lasting. A little intense for some people I would imagine. Shared 3 bowls over about 3 hours and still felt high/tripping in the morning ... but in a good way.\u000a\u000aNot everyone will enjoy this trippy, mind expanding type of high, but I just loved it! Highly recommended if you&#39;re the cerebral type.

VLA Confidential is another one of those great indica a that can still keep you light on your feet. I try to only smoke indicas because they help me sleep way better, but this is a great bud to sip on throughout the night if you&#39;re trying to relax, but still be socially active. Definitely good for having a relaxing night with good friends.

VI think this has become my favourite strain. Ive been using this for a few months and cant describe how good it is. Buds are big and heavy with a pine/kush scent. I normally smoke pure indicas and this is a great example. Great body high, i find it totally relaxing, it really soothes my back muscle spasms. A few weeks ago i had a root canal at the dentist and was in a lot of pain afterwards, i took the prescribed medicines from the dentist and they had little effect, two joints of LA Confidential and i was pain free. Its a great indica that i can smoke during the day as i dont find the sofa coma too strong. The only thing i dont really like is the taste, its not great.

VLA Confidential is one of those laid back strains that packs a nice little &#39;punch&#39;!\u000a\u000aThe key here folks is supplier. I had some LA a couple months ago from one dispensary in town and it was meh. Got the most recent bag from a place a little further out and holy Hannah! Much better quality = much better effect. Ok seems logical but not kidding I almost didn&#39;t pick it up b/c of my previous experience. Even after 25 years of using cannabis I still need the occasional reminders about these things lol\u000a\u000aSo here&#39;s what I liked most about this strain relative to my pain... it relaxes me enough off the top that I get some relief of pain not just from my ability to chill mentally but also physically. With some &#39;new to me&#39; acute nerve pain, this strain actually broke through and made a difference.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve not written a post in a while cause I&#39;ve been dealing with spinal problems. Needless to say, along with my severe osteoarthritis, waiting for my knee replacement, my rebuilt other knee, my calcific tendinitis in my shoulders, my skin challenges, and fighting depression, I now have ongoing sciatica with nerve pain &amp; numbness in my leg. Walking with a limp for so long has wrecked my low back :( So after hospital x3 I&#39;ve been on muscle relaxers, opiates, anti-inflammatories, acetominophin, gaba- pentin, and the physical therapist has me walking with a cane. It&#39;s been about 1.5- 2 months since this all started. I&#39;ve gradually lowered and lowered the pain meds to a point where I can still work p/t and do a few other things with minimal meds and more cannabis. I&#39;m a Sativa queen who has very quickly crammed up on Indica info as a result of my changing medical and pain needs. \u000a\u000aLA Confidential helped my underlying or parasympathetic nervous system chill as well as my conscience mind. I take a nerve pain blocker right now but that doesn&#39;t mean the pain is gone- I just can&#39;t feel it sometimes. My body still knows it&#39;s there and it makes it very challenging for effective pain relief and rest. This strain- when good quality- hit me in the &quot;chiller&quot; so to speak. In minutes I felt my spine muscles relax and my back adjusted naturally. That&#39;s a sign to me I&#39;m relaxing. My headache faded and I felt happier in a mellow kind of way. I don&#39;t like the after high munchies, but for those who have mild to moderate appetite issues this is a good one to try. \u000a\u000aRecreationally I would use this one around a campfire or on a fishing boat in the sun. Would pair well with a light beer or a cider. Best of the west right here! \u000a\u000aPeace peeps.

VL.A. Confidential is a great strain for relaxing anytime of day. This strain produces fast acting results that fade gradually over an hour or so. I love this strain for post-workout munch-a-thons, and over all relaxation. However, this strain produced a euphoria feeling that seduced me into abandoning my stretching and led me straight to LA LA land. I like to remain functional during sessions, but I wasn&#39;t complaining when I came to. Sometimes you need a power nap to get through the day, and LA Confidential may help you with that. It&#39;s flower is hodgepodge containing green and purple leaves with a &quot;piney&quot; aroma. If the grade is right, you&#39;ll enjoy this strain over and over.

Voh man i messed up bad when i confused this strain with my &quot;daily driver&quot; haha, which is green crack. i had an 8th of both i had picked up the day before, and they were in identical green containers. when i woke up at 5am the next morning all groggy and went for my green crack i guess i grabbed the LA confidental. i then proceeded to load up my gravity bong and take my usual 4-5 morning pulls. i sort of noticed the taste wasn&#39;t green cracky but i was half asleep. fast forward 15 minutes and i&#39;m in the shower just sort of spacing out, not really getting clean. at this point i was like &quot;wtf is going on man&quot; and it took me forever to do everything. i figured out my mistake. yikes. wow i am veryy sedated. next i have to take my damn kid to school and he&#39;s asking me if i;m awake while i&#39;m driving him there and that pisses me off but i bet i do like a sleep. then, work. ugh. \u000a\u000ai park and it&#39;s like leo trying to get out of the car all fucked up on qualudes in wolf of wall street. my legs don;t work and i&#39;m just a mess. i walk in and my boys know i;m fucked up right away but they promise not to tell melissa the manager. i go to my station and pretend to do my job but i can;t that well. this stuff is knocking me out. at lunch i get made fun of, but i eat probally almost the whole tbell menu lol. in the afternoon i fall asleep at my station. finally work ends and i drive straight home. at home my wife bitched at me but i&#39;m too tired to care. i forgot to pick the kid up at school. so anyway i decided to level myself out with a few gravity pulls of green crack, and then i went upstairs for dinner and talked everybody&#39;s ear off haha. weird day. la confidental is strong and only for night time for me from now on.

VWith this strain you&#39;ll know your high. But after a while it&#39;ll mellow you out. I would recommend this strain to PTSD patients that just need a simple downer nothing to powerful but enough for you to chill out. Navigating the head high is manageable with a puff or two any more than that would put you in a place where you&#39;ll have to manage the head high.

VI don&#39;t really understand the appeal of this one. It&#39;s not nearly as euphoric or mood boosting as many other strains, Indicas especially. It&#39;s relaxing and just gives you that high feeling more than anything else so I guess if you like that go for it. Personally not a favorite.

I got this from Leaves of grass so this is mostly true popcorn, it is small, fluffy buds but is smokes really well still! It packs a punch, chilled me out right away which is what I need, and I prefer this over Pog for sure. It is pretty skunky which I love. I got 3.5g.

Smoke was pretty smooth and taste had almost a peanut butter start and a vanilla cinnamon tea finish. High started off relatively clear headed. Seemed to be more of a creeper. Felt very still and pretty Zen, creeped into a very stoney high. Actually felt like a stone. Couch locker and very relaxing and soothing.

However, it doesn&#39;t make one feel too lazy or exhausted, just a little detached from reality. Best for late nights listening to music and just chilling. A very life-affirming feeling strain!

Very potent, LA Confidential high will surprise you out of nowhere ~10 mins after smoking.

VLa confidential is so good that it can neutralize my ego making it very difficult to write a review after consuming. I really enjoy Dama\u2019s LA con. It smells like a scent that I would make a cologne out of. Musky, woody, spicy. A good over all semi-sweet stink. Hairs glow orange off dull green amber trich covered tightly dense nugs. Grinder is definitely needed for this strain. Tight nugs get sticky when stinky. Cough expands through my body like a wave of chill air. Cough comes on after exhale. Cough is strong but surprisingly short. Effects are like me behind my bedroom door alone after a lifetime of dealing with a mad world. I smile as joy embraces me, taking a deep breath letting my body and mind melt away into a tranquil state of content and ignorance. Sleepiness and an appetite occur an hour after consuming.\u000a\u000aI recommend for physical and mental pain.\u000aI enjoy getting this again.

VA little bit on a sunny weekend day goes a long way. A lot is like ketamine.\u000a\u000aPicked up an 1/8th of the LA Con from Green Door in SF - super stanky dank that&#39;s all spiny like Jack Herer. Tastes great and instantly hits the head. Strength causes wicked coughing. Feel is energetic yet dissociating. Its high THC levels can cause anxiety or paranoia. \u000a\u000aA careful veteran&#39;s stoniness of choice.

VCouch lock, game lock, headphone lock, movie lock even bad reality show lock. More of a Sativa person but this is a great go to Indica for relaxing and taking it all in. Got some really nice fresh buds from Trichome here in Phoenix and definitely impressed with the flavor, burn and potency. 2-3 large hits and your good for 2 hours. I&#39;m giving it an 8 out of 10 for this Sativa/Hybrid lover.

Smoke was pretty smooth and taste had almost a peanut butter start and a vanilla cinnamon tea finish. High started off relatively clear headed. Seemed to be more of a creeper. Felt very still and pretty Zen, creeped into a very stoney high. Actually felt like a stone. Couch locker and very relaxing and soothing.

VThis strain was a roller coaster ride for for me, but in a good way.  One minute I am lucid, having a good talk or laugh with my friends, the next I am completely checked out to another place, staring off into the distance, and my friends are trying to get my attention back.  This seems to go on throughout the ride on LA Confidential.\u000a\u000aNot my favorite personally, but I have no complaints either.  I haven&#39;t used it much, so I may add more info later.

VI thought I didn&#39;t really like Indicas but this is an amazing strain. It&#39;s got all the euphoria and creativity of a sativa high but with an added full-body relaxation. However, it doesn&#39;t make one feel too lazy or exhausted, just a little detached from reality. Best for late nights listening to music and just chilling. A very life-affirming feeling strain! Great stuff.

VHad this up in Tahoe. My buddy had it for authentic medicinal purposes (he has a pinched nerve in his neck caused by a spine injury). At first, it hits you like a mutherf__king 18 wheeler, but settles in and you feel faaaantastic. Felt great about life, and the surroundings just seem to blur into one mass while I focused on my beer, or the TV, or whatever. Nice and even the whole way too, once the first 15 minutes were over. Smells like a Kush, with nice skunky weed smell in general. Not sure I could do this everyday, but for having some friends over and listening to tunes, this stuff is great. You maintain control with the ability to be social, but could also sit in and order 5 pizzas while watching movies.

Smoke was pretty smooth and taste had almost a peanut butter start and a vanilla cinnamon tea finish. High started off relatively clear headed. Seemed to be more of a creeper. Felt very still and pretty Zen, creeped into a very stoney high. Actually felt like a stone. Couch locker and very relaxing and soothing.

The smoke from LA Confidential was Nutty, smokey, kind of light, but still crappy tasting. I&#39;m pretty sure they used to call LA Confidential &quot;Cat Piss&quot;, and the strain that they are now calling &quot;Cat piss&quot; Isn&#39;t actuallly the old school strain. LA Confidential gets you high, and tastes like a Kitty litter box....with some nuttiness

VThis is a nice and level indica strain without too much laziness or the feeling of being slumped. You do get a nice body vibe with a very mellow touch. Not as intense for an indica strain as I would like. Maybe mix this with an Agent Orange for a great mixture. Nice floral and herbal smelling bud. Smells like a damn meadow of flowers, but a finely trimmed meadow. Shit smells like the Queen&#39;s Garden. Gets you nice and loose though. Good for a post-practice or post-workout  to ease out the muscles or maybe even get in a game of ball with this stuff. Doesn&#39;t knock me out for helping me sleep though, which is a little bit of a negative factor for me.

LA Confidential has a very herbal taste with a subtle sweetness that I enjoyed very much through my Pax. This strain is great for muscles relaxation and migraine prevention. After vaping two half packs I feel like I\u2019m sitting next to a warm fire. Truly a spectacular strain of cannabis.

VDude, this strain is out of this world.  After smoking a bowl, I am feeling uplifted in spirits and extremely sleeeeeeeeeeeeepy, which is great because it&#39;s really difficult to get to sleep due to the constant pain and muscular spasms I have from nerve damage.\u000a\u000aIf you need a strain that will uplift your sprit while gently whisking you off to dreamland (which as an added bonus relaxes muscles and fights pain very well too), you cannot go wrong with LA Confidential.  I&#39;m really enjoying this strain, and I&#39;m glad my dispensary had it!\u000a\u000aAs an added bonus, this was ranked 2nd highest in the dispensary in percentage of CBD at .9% (just slightly lower than the ridiculously high LSD OG @ 1.3% they also have), which is great for sufferers of pain and muscle spasms.

Healthy large nugs and blanket crystals like mad. Smells awesome too. \u000a\u000aThe high is the sell though, it\u2019s indica to the bone. It\u2019s one of the best sleeping strains I\u2019ve ever encountered and the reviews here (as usual) are spot on! It\u2019s heady and cerebral with a full body high. Imagine that! Watching a movie, reading a book, unable to move, but there\u2019s a friggin party going on inside your head? Great stream and after 30 mins or so it\u2019s just the body buzz. Great strain if this is what your after ;)

VLA Woman has always been a favorite, so when I was given the opportunity to try one of her mothers, couldn&#39;t say no. I see where my favorite Lady gets her charms. Smoked a bit harsh with a full earthy flavor. Heavy indica buzz transitions to deep relaxation; enjoy dreaming before falling asleep.

VA superb strain whose most desirable trait is a very strong taste of afghan hash. It&#39;s a OG Affie x Afghan. It grows very slowly in veg and takes about 60 days to ripen. Medium-Low yields.\u000a\u000aThe high is: trippy, relaxed (but not sleepy).\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VLA Confidential hits within seconds after smoking a bowl, you just suddenly realize that you&#39;re high. It has a relaxing and euphoric trip, you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re being pulled down. It&#39;s an instant favorite because of how balanced LA Confidential is as an indica strain.

VNote to self: \u000aFlowers from &quot;The Clinic&quot;\u000aDefinitely smoke at night if you also have a sativa flowers. Great for pain and significant for inducing nighttime sleep. Helps me eat and takes away g.e.r.d. symptoms  when I wake up. Gives me a true feeling of couchlock which I relate to not wanting to go out and do anything at all even if I planned to prior to smoking the flower for pain relief for the trip I was going to take to the store. That is why I say save the sativa at night and smoke the La Con.

VLA Conf is an excellent strain for whatever ails ya. I have enjoyed it in both flower and O.Pen CO2 extracted oil and it doesn&#39;t fail to deliver. It is tasty in both forms and quite a beautiful bud.\u000a\u000aIt makes a great pain reliever as well as a night time med and for those who are able to remain active under Indicas, it&#39;s good for that as well.\u000a\u000aAs for taste, it has a combination of piney/diesely OG taste as well as the finish of a grapey-musky purp.

VLA Confidential is my favorite 100% indica strain in battling insomnia. The nuggets are always danky to the nose and the tastes of it are super delicious. I pick it up regularly.  It knocks me out to slumber quite quickly.  I use LA Confidential during the week more than the weekend.  I tend to use the Kush hybrid strains, like Skywalker, on weekends for the more sativa effects on the mind.  LA Confidential is yummy, yummy and yummy!! \u000a

That being said however, I still did enjoy the other effects of this strain, but it&#39;s still so good at making you talkative and giggly, and just down right blunt! I was saying things that if I was not stoned, would be taboo or just rude, but when you are stoned and have what appears to be NO filter from the brain to the mouth!! (Nor a pair of gates or a fence to be found in sight!!) \u000a\u000aBut in all seriousness, this strain is fun with others around that ya just gotta overlook that pain part sometimes.  laughter also is one of the best medicines right? :)

Good for creativity too. I agree with most of the reviews that it&#39;s just a good all around high, ticks off all the basic qualifications-eliminates pain, feel good, smiley, though no couch lock (which is good). I didn&#39;t experience the psychedelic affects that a few people seemed to get. It&#39;s an okay strain. I won&#39;t purchase again though.

VI&#39;m an Indica-puro fan through and through. I have to say, despite the 50/50 Hybrid feel to this strain, the full-body numbness, level of relaxation and anxiety suppression are unparalleled to any other Indica I have tried. There is defiantly a head-high controllable-anxiety-feel to this flower. It&#39;s how I wish I could feel on Sativa strains yet can&#39;t, so it&#39;s a cool feeling to have the psychedelic head effects and not freak out and lose my shit like if I smoke Sativa. Anyways, I&#39;m high&#127809;&#128168; and need to stop typing so I can enjoy this buzz and pass out asleep - stay frosty\u2744\ufe0f my friends and duces\u270c&#127996;\ufe0f

VI have been searching high and low for a great indica, and with the help of an amazing bud tender I found it. I wanted something great for pain and sleep. after smoking the flower (which has an awesome flavor and smell), about a half hour in, I was hungry, relaxed, and my back pain ebbed away. I was able to fall asleep when I wanted too, and enjoyed the high. this stuff is freaking awesome.

The smell is pretty good, no negative side effects on my part, a very even ignition. I really didn&#39;t have any problems with the strain, and to be honest it doesn&#39;t have any special quality&#39;s I can brag on either. Although I will admit, my last hit off the bowl got me beyong stoned, like trippin&#39; balls, big black balls. Overall, I give it a 8.

VThe perfect Indica for gray cloudy days, but you still have enough motivation to get up and go do stuff. It hits hard with a nice mellow body high, clear headed thought process, very calming especially since I am prone to anxiety. The perfect chill pill that doesnt give you the munchies. I found my new favorite, and Im usually a sativa smoker.

VTo start things off, this strain is pretty average looking, but the taste is just great. It has a very strong Almond taste, and it&#39;s beyond smooth. The smell is pretty good, no negative side effects on my part, a very even ignition. I really didn&#39;t have any problems with the strain, and to be honest it doesn&#39;t have any special quality&#39;s I can brag on either. Although I will admit, my last hit off the bowl got me beyong stoned, like trippin&#39; balls, big black balls. Overall, I give it a 8.

VLA Confidential is the perfect night-time high, it makes you happy, sleepy, and lazy with a hint of creativity with those bizarre, lost in thought conversations with your inner monologue. Paired with Dutch Treat, this was exactly the heavy hitter/ sleeper i was looking for. Comparable to Tahoe OG or Pre 98 Bubba Kush. With its&#39; strong smokey flavor, you might consider pairing this with citrus flavor like Super Lemon Haze if you&#39;re not looking for a sleep time high, or an earthy/minty strain like Chocalope.

VThis is a strain that holds a place in my top 5 indica list. The high comes on strong in the first few minutes and your body relaxed followed by euphoria and an overall calming sensation but you can still get some work done and focus, if you dont toke too much that is.. Careful not to indulge too quickly on too much of this fine herb because this strain will knock you clean off your ass while putting you in a deep comatose sleep wich is great for insomnia and also for pain. \u000a\u000aFantastic indica

VI really enjoy this strain, you can feel it almost immediately and if you don&#39;t, believe me it&#39;ll creep on you, uh the only negative thing I would have to say is I smoked some before work and ended up being a bad experience, I didn&#39;t enjoy it at all and was not well focused and very very paranoid. I usually do good at work even under cannabis but this was a lot to take in, it&#39;s more of a watch anime and eat kind of strain.

VI&#39;m an indica fan, so I enjoy this when it&#39;s around.  It&#39;s not my favorite, but close.  It&#39;s fun and can be very &quot;stony&quot;, even trippy if you really hit it hard.  It&#39;s also a classic in the cannabis world, and I can see why: it&#39;s a nice, fun high that fades after an hour and let&#39;s you get to sleep.  \u000a\u000aIf you get the chance, try this classic.  If you are mainly a sativa smoker, this might be an indica for you.

VI have been looking forward to vaping this strain for a while and it did not disappoint. It has an amazing body high from head to toe that will keep you feeling relaxed. LA Confidential has a very herbal taste with a subtle sweetness that I enjoyed very much through my Pax. This strain is great for muscles relaxation and migraine prevention. After vaping two half packs I feel like I\u2019m sitting next to a warm fire. Truly a spectacular strain of cannabis.

VTried this strain last night. LA gave some energy,a mellow energy.., pain relief I didn&#39;t notice the true pain relief unti I decided to organize some things after I had already decided to lay down and watch a movie! omg I didn&#39;t thunk I this nuch to say bout it. Obviously it made me talkative, I was alone but I just keep typing so assume that I&#39;d be talking..Lol. I&#39;m just smoking my second joint of this right now actually. . I&#39;ve been smoking the same joint for over 45 mins givinge me the uplifting, get it done kind of feeling. hits ya hard.In a good way. I left the joint in the ash tray twice and forgot i was smoking I even threw in a small load of laundry. Imflantation is no doubt gone down incredible for inflammation ((bursitis &amp; low back imflantation too)) Really Good I can&#39;t take any Motrin Advil or Aleve. I&#39;m so glad we harvested this strain this year. The Yield was definitely decent Next year I&#39;ll be paying extra attention to my LA plant.Find a better spot maybe give this baby a spot in the front row lol.

VMy latest review for this strain. As I just took a sweet hashy toke from my bong, I can first feel a light-tingling behind my eyes. A few moments later, I feel the tingling spread out throughout my body and I feel great. Also, one of the things I&#39;ve always loved so very much about this strain is the sativa effects that are included are just enough to make a good indica experience feel...Heavenly. It isn&#39;t over the top but just a fun, feel-good boost to your imagination. However, I wouldn&#39;t use this strain if I planned to do important stuff anytime soon.

VLA confidential is a great strain before you hit the sack. When I medicate with LA confidential it hits quick and real heavy stoney head high. Almost like it sits on my eye lids. The taste is exceptionally smooth and real piney. Must have indica for those insomniacs that needs help laying their tired head on their pillow.

Just don&#39;t smoke too much. I did and got a headache and the spins when trying to just fall asleep! Sucked...\u000a\u000aI rated it really well though. It&#39;s a very strong strain.

When I medicated I was pain free and I need strong medicine and with 4 bowls I was good for a couple hours and not too sleepy like some strong OG&#39;s. The high comes on right away and your eyes get low and u feel happy and your smiling. Very nice. I&#39;ll give it 4 stars outta 5 just because it&#39;s not too strong but it was strong enough to take pain away and stress which is great.

VFantastic Indica for treating M&#233;ni&#232;re\u2019s disease. The strain seems to have the ability to reduce inflammation in the inner ear. It might spike the tinnitus slightly during the high but the ringing is below baseline the next day. LA Confidential is only moderatly effective for Crohn\u2019s however. As for effects- beautiful spacy euphoria. Will not promote deep negative thoughts like some Indicas can. Only slight munchies. Promotes deep sleep. I love it!!

Good for creativity too. I agree with most of the reviews that it&#39;s just a good all around high, ticks off all the basic qualifications-eliminates pain, feel good, smiley, though no couch lock (which is good). I didn&#39;t experience the psychedelic affects that a few people seemed to get. It&#39;s an okay strain. I won&#39;t purchase again though.

VThe sample I had was 20.59% thc and 0.4% cbd. The buds were perfect and cured well. Upon smell its not that special unless you break open the middle and get the terpenes to release then you have a subtle sweet smell that tails off into something earthy I guess.. It does work well for pain and I would even suggest a Cbd product to couple with LA confidential as I did, a peanut butter cbd product wored quite well but on its own still effective.. Though the thc content was there its clear its an indica strain as some would say they dont feel much but then again there expecting a sativa experience when they should try to focus on how there pain and anxiety is be treated with this great med.

VHow lucky am I!? Ctown has been on a tear lately! Can\u2019t wait to see what the warmer weather will bring. I have a guy who always always has good weed, and once every six weeks or so he has something incredible. Two days ago he sold me some LA Confidential. Healthy large nugs and blanket crystals like mad. Smells awesome too. \u000a\u000aThe high is the sell though, it\u2019s indica to the bone. It\u2019s one of the best sleeping strains I\u2019ve ever encountered and the reviews here (as usual) are spot on! It\u2019s heady and cerebral with a full body high. Imagine that! Watching a movie, reading a book, unable to move, but there\u2019s a friggin party going on inside your head? Great stream and after 30 mins or so it\u2019s just the body buzz. Great strain if this is what your after ;)

VI had some of this mixed with a little &quot;purple shit&quot; (don&#39;t ask me exactly what that is, that&#39;s just what I was told). It was pretty dreamy at some points, and when i came down it made me pretty sleepy. It kind of was a drag afterwards, so this definitely a before bed strain, not for the middle of the day. It strongly smelled of skunk, and I would say a tiny bit minty smelling, maybe. Very pungent.

VDude, this strain is out of this world.  After smoking a bowl, I am feeling uplifted in spirits and extremely sleeeeeeeeeeeeepy, which is great because it&#39;s really difficult to get to sleep due to the constant pain and muscular spasms I have from nerve damage.\u000a\u000aIf you need a strain that will uplift your sprit while gently whisking you off to dreamland (which as an added bonus relaxes muscles and fights pain very well too), you cannot go wrong with LA Confidential.  I&#39;m really enjoying this strain, and I&#39;m glad my dispensary had it!\u000a\u000aAs an added bonus, this was ranked 2nd highest in the dispensary in percentage of CBD at .9% (just slightly lower than the ridiculously high LSD OG @ 1.3% they also have), which is great for sufferers of pain and muscle spasms.

VI think the full suite of effects embodied by LA Confidential can be summarized in two words: Fucking. Lifted.\u000a\u000aLA Confidential is one of those strains that brings out all of the best attributes of indicas without any lethargic or very heavy sedative effects. The pinewood scent has a nice hint of coffee, but smokes extremely earthy. Always a pleasure when I&#39;m able to pick this one up!

VTo start things off, this strain is pretty average looking, but the taste is just great. It has a very strong Almond taste, and it&#39;s beyond smooth. The smell is pretty good, no negative side effects on my part, a very even ignition. I really didn&#39;t have any problems with the strain, and to be honest it doesn&#39;t have any special quality&#39;s I can brag on either. Although I will admit, my last hit off the bowl got me beyong stoned, like trippin&#39; balls, big black balls. Overall, I give it a 8.

VTook two big hits from a bong of this stuff to start - and after 5-10 minutes it hit my like a hammer.  Def not a thinking high but def a head high.  Very intense, mostly good - may have made me existential all evening, but may have been cuz I was smoking with an old friend I hadn&#39;t seen in forever.  Very talkative too, probably more rambly than I like.  Not as much of a happy/euphoric high as I like but my friend seemed to get a really happy high from it so I&#39;ll be trying it again.

That being said however, I still did enjoy the other effects of this strain, but it&#39;s still so good at making you talkative and giggly, and just down right blunt! I was saying things that if I was not stoned, would be taboo or just rude, but when you are stoned and have what appears to be NO filter from the brain to the mouth!! (Nor a pair of gates or a fence to be found in sight!!) \u000a\u000aBut in all seriousness, this strain is fun with others around that ya just gotta overlook that pain part sometimes.  laughter also is one of the best medicines right? :)

VLA Confidential is my favorite 100% indica strain in battling insomnia. The nuggets are always danky to the nose and the tastes of it are super delicious. I pick it up regularly.  It knocks me out to slumber quite quickly.  I use LA Confidential during the week more than the weekend.  I tend to use the Kush hybrid strains, like Skywalker, on weekends for the more sativa effects on the mind.  LA Confidential is yummy, yummy and yummy!! \u000a

VLA Conf is an excellent strain for whatever ails ya. I have enjoyed it in both flower and O.Pen CO2 extracted oil and it doesn&#39;t fail to deliver. It is tasty in both forms and quite a beautiful bud.\u000a\u000aIt makes a great pain reliever as well as a night time med and for those who are able to remain active under Indicas, it&#39;s good for that as well.\u000a\u000aAs for taste, it has a combination of piney/diesely OG taste as well as the finish of a grapey-musky purp.

VNote to self: \u000aFlowers from &quot;The Clinic&quot;\u000aDefinitely smoke at night if you also have a sativa flowers. Great for pain and significant for inducing nighttime sleep. Helps me eat and takes away g.e.r.d. symptoms  when I wake up. Gives me a true feeling of couchlock which I relate to not wanting to go out and do anything at all even if I planned to prior to smoking the flower for pain relief for the trip I was going to take to the store. That is why I say save the sativa at night and smoke the La Con.

VSo I decided to this this strain a real try and picked up 4 grams today. I was immediately impressed not just by the frostiness but with the hints of purple i got to see in a larger quantity of buthis bud must be promoted to d that isn&#39;t as recognizable the same day as I bought &#39;Purple Rhino&quot; so I digress. This bud then gets yet another belt promotion to:\u000a-PURPLE BELT BUD- I noted some nice sweet notes in the green (lightly flecked w/ purple) hits. I enjoyed the green hits so much I wantwed to just kack the bowl after a couple of hits and get a new one. So I went to much smaller &#39;personal&#39; bowls... $5/g @ MC, COWABUNGA!

VTaste: Was sweet and flowery. Pulled this out of my glory stash after a year and was still pungent once cracked open. \u000a\u000aLook: Nugs were dense with a dark green shade. Many crystals along the inside with darker shading maybe due to nutrient deficiency towards the end. But still great looking nugs. \u000a\u000aSmell: Sweet and mildly pungent, Flowery scented. \u000a\u000aHigh: Great for day time use, head high with eye pressure from it, relaxing but attentive as well.

VWow this is some thunder when it hits. Head stash for all Indicate lovers. Little biddy plant with small yields of afghani greatness. For me it&#39;s a 1 hitter quitter sometimes 2. Easy to grow in all methods and mediums. Clones really well. If your looking to impress ur friends with some powerful Dank this is the 1. Wondering what to cross this with for more yield n keeping potency. Hmm?? Lol

VAmazing high! I love the strong smell of the bud. It gave me an energetic high with no stress in the world to think about. Music sounded better as always during the high. Would highly reccomend. &#128077;&#127997;

VDon&#39;t know if I take shit, don&#39;t know if I was just having a rough time in my life, but when I bought this strain, it gave me a bad experience every single time I smoked it.

VEasily the biggest stone of any strain I&#39;ve tried, to date.\u000aThe closest I&#39;ve ever gotten to the effects is when they shot me up with Fentanyl before heart surgery.\u000aAfter pulling about three hits, my first time, I decided to read a newspaper and immediately fixed on a human-interest story (Well..Puppy interest, actually.) showing a pair of Dogs up for adoption. The photo came to life, as I could see and hear these Puppies barking, wagging their tails, playing together and begging for attention.\u000aAfter staring at that for about a minute I thought to myself: &quot;Damn, this is some seriously good s**t!&quot;\u000aHow an Indica dominant can happily wreck my bonce like that, I have no idea.\u000aLove at first toke. Devastation the next!
