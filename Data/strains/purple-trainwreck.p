VDon&#39;t let the name fool you. Very good strain.  I&#39;ve been smoking this for a couple weeks now and overall it&#39;s a decent high. Not as much of a crazy high I expected. Not a big fan of purp but it really blend the strain. The taste is very pungent but overall a sweet taste the purp really gives you a mellow body high (not too much). The train wreck keeps you very euphoric and very easy to concentrate.

Vthe first two times I got this strain I was very disappointed. But this time my local florist gave me a nice batch. Big dense nugs with lots of purple...a shit load of crystals. Lemon taste. Was a very very nice high very relaxed while maintaining a strong sativa type high.. Not for beginners.

VI have spent the last month+ checking out many popular strains since I moved to Washington State. This one has risen to be one of my favorites. I feel like it consistently works. I find the high very euphoric and narcotic like. I have also been mixing about 2/3 PT with 1/3 Blue Dream and I really like that combination. The Blue Dream adds a little lift and energy to the high.  For me, however, PT does not work well for a day-time, get things done strain. It just makes me feel a deep sense of pleasure and happiness. Nice to just lay back, stare at the stars, and wonder what it is all about....

VAwesome smoke! It starts off with an uplifting happy creative feeling. Then leaves you relaxed and fulfilled. Definitely a great strain for depression and a good nights sleep.

Wonderful cerebral high that helps with both depression and anxiety, and amazing body high that will melt any pain or discomfort from a hard day at work or from other causes.

VA powerful strand. I&#39;ve used this one a few times and one time I had a little too much. It made time go by very slowly. I didn&#39;t feel like I could do much so I just laid down - which made time go by even slower. I think part of the problem was that I did this at noon. I recommend this one for later in the day. When I smoke, the right amount, it gives me a permagrin, loosens me up, the pain dissolves, and I feel great.

VThis was one of the first &quot;Grade A&quot; strains I had when I first started smoking, and every time I&#39;ve had it since it&#39;s been amazing. It has the great body effects from the purple which may be overbearing if you smoke too much, leading to a deep couch lock and nap, as well as the uplifting, focused buzz you get from the train wreck, which in my opinion makes for a mix for a great high for pain, nausea, cramps, migraines, and discomfort as well as depression, stress, and insomnia.

VOkay first of all this train wreck will literally wreck you. right when you get that first hit, you feel like flying on a eagle to paradise. Me and my gf were both lit playing video games but be warned if you have any anxiety or paranoid this strain will make it go away in a flash. I have major anxiety issues that any little thing will set me off and make me freak but when I smoked this, I felt a little anxious and then I started to listen to music and enjoy the outdoors. Over all I give this strain a 9/10 for creativity and stress free and anxiety free. also it makes you want to go on crazy adventures. hope you enjoy.

VI tried a couple versions of Purple Trainwreck for this review. \u000a\u000aA really solid hybrid, if grown right the terp profile is just as impressive as its effects. Great for a bit of Netflix and chill or just chilling watching Netflix.  Keeps the brain turning while sending a euphoric pulse throughout the entire body.  A very relaxing strain but never made me close my eyes, which is something I really look for.  10/10

VI was a little wary of this one because I do not like trainwreck, but I love the purple family, and the particular grower (Cannasol) delivers great product, so I figured I&#39;d give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised! \u000a\u000aThe ladyfriend and I both loved the flavor, which was very piney/ earthy. It had that old school weed taste that I adore. Buds were very purple and green (I&#39;ll submit a photo for ya&#39;ll). \u000a\u000aEvery damn time I smoked this strain, I&#39;d end up sitting there, staring into space holding my pipe for 15 minutes. Every time! My partner had a similar experience... whenever she&#39;d go to pass it, she&#39;d forget if she had already smoked &#128514; It brings a euphoric chill out that&#39;s really quite impressive. \u000a\u000aI&#39;d agree with the other reviewers who said it made them happy and chatty. It&#39;s relaxing but not tiring, chatty/ giggly without being active, and euphoric without being psychedelic. All in all, a very enjoyable strain.

VI really like purple trainwreck (by cascadia farms). Smells like effervescent lemon black cherry hops and wood. Tastes like aroma with hash. Expansion is immediate and moderate. Cough is strong but brief. Effect is immediately euphoric and uplifted. Eases into more happiness and relaxation body and mind. Great all day strain for me.\u000aRecommend for creating, frisbee golf, or zoning on a screen.

VPurple Trainwreck (PT) is certainly a good choice for your medicating needs, however, it left me feeling not quite fully medicated after 3 enormous bong rips.  That being said, it begs into question this particular strains potency.  \u000a\u000aPT, a cross hybrid strain of excellent medicines GDP and Trainwreck, boasts a pungently fine smell of pine and lemon.  The buds are dense, frosty, and intertwined with magnificent looking orange vines throughout.  PT&#39;s taste is unique to other medicinal strains I have frequented as it has a unique melon taste and mild harshness on its finish.  \u000a\u000aIf getting high is your ultimate goal then PT is a good choice.  If you are seriously attempting to medicate a serious health condition this medicine may not be strong enough for you.  \u000a\u000a3/5 stars

Vthe purple train wreck I had was outdoor. it came in dense nugs with dark purple and slight dark orange hairs and small trichomes.  The smell was a bit spicy and herbal until broken up then it has a sweet berryish scent . the taste was earthy and the effects were not instant b it after a few minutes it came through in a heavy Indica feeling that left me feeling unmotivated and sleepy. great for night time  insomnia or stress relief.

VPerfect evening variety, this will wreck any stress from the day and leave you calm and subdued. Taking after the Train Wreck, the initial effect is immediate and not lacking in power. A combo of indica &quot;knock down&quot; effect with soaring sativa euphoria and mood enhancement that tapers off into a tranquilizing, virtually sedating 50-50 body/head high that will stick around till bed time. Leaves me in perfect condition for a peaceful nights sleep. I did notice a little bit of the munchies, but nothing overwhelming.

VI hope my dispensary never stops carrying this amazing medicine. depression? evaporated. stress? don&#39;t even think about it. pain? gone. what a masterful combination of two potent strains. this is the perfect 50/50 hybrid for me. not as euphoric as train wreck by itself but the indica leaning bodily relaxation of the granddaddy makes up for any sativa effects that might be lacking.

VThis strain is a creeper. Took about 4-5 hits of this medicine and thought it was mild until about 5-10 minutes passed. Got kind of twitchy in my hands and a pretty good rush of energy. After about 15-20 minutes things leveled out and I felt very clear headed and motivated to get a bunch of things done. Introspective. Overall enjoyed it, but would recommended a little time in between hits.

VSmoked 2 small bowls of this stuff one day and got a crazy head high. It felt like there was a rollar coaster in my brain. The taste isnt too pleasant. The high will really start to kick in about 7 minutes after being smoked. This is the type of weed I would smoke if I wanted to get really messed up.

VOnly three stars because the flavor was so overwhelming to me. It was spicy, sour, berry, diseal and Powerful! It was the powerful part I enjoyed. The other part of strong flavors was not as enjoyable. No matter if vaped or burned, those flavors, whew!! The flowers are beautiful boasting giant sized, cone shaped nuggets with purple hues toward the center of these dark green, sprinkled crystal flowers. I had only three buds and the weight was 7gms of medicine. I felt anxious at points and relaxed at others. If you can stand the flavor it&#39;s worth the try just because of the. Potency of this flower. And the potency goes lingering on for a good while. Great for pain and inflammation as well. Mind bending too, but mixed with those occasional paranoid feelings. \u000aI give it a five star rating for potency and three stars for strong flavor and paranoia here and there.

VI got this from my weed man, when I first got it I wasn&#39;t sure how I felt about it. Then I got my wisdom teeth pulled about 2 days later. I smoked this post surgery and made all my pain go away.

VConsidering that there really hasn&#39;t been a great influx of weed in the southern valleys of Sunnt Arizona, comming across this particular strain has been a blessing. While it allowed me to go straight into work after a morning bowl packed of this sugary-trichome-packed-purple-goodness it can definitely put you to sleep.

VBought from canablyss in Lake Stevens. For a name like purple train wreck ......wrecked I was not. This bud was terrible. Not sure if it&#39;s the manufacture or not but this strain from this location literally had zero effect on me. Might as well pulled up a fist full of grass from the backyard and smoked that! Wouldn&#39;t have had to pay for that! Bud had zero smell zero taste zero expansion. Just wasn&#39;t good at all! Wish I could rate zero stars.

VPurple train wreck when grown right is precious I had the privilege of having a great batch of it. Its sweet pungent taste was very good and the high was sativa dominant which is one thing I loved about this hybrid.

It produces a good sativa energetic high coupled with a chill relaxed body buz that causes the whole body to go numb. HSO always has reliable genetics. Finished product smells of citrus &amp; lavender with a spiciness at the end. Flavor is more of a sweet spicy floral.

VI use the vape. It\u2019s not the greatest, but it\u2019s certainly enjoyable. I find myself feeling a very pleasant bodily numbing. However, it\u2019s not as numbing as a deep indica. Instead, it\u2019s more of a physical \u201cfuzziness\u201d that stays consistent. \u000aThe downside is that it\u2019s not doing anything for my insomnia, nor do I feel very euphoric.

VOn my first puff on the $10 pre-roll, this strain managed to provide a satisfyingly undemanding cerebral high studded with these cute little whimpers of oscillating euphoria,  felt mostly in and around my eyes; but soon my whole body caressed a lingering tingly sensation that had been coaxingly hard to ignore. The flavor description is accurate: definitely one of the more herbal releases I&#39;ve yet encountered. This isn&#39;t to say I didn&#39;t like Purple Trainwreck (because it certainly had shown promise in certain areas), but I&#39;m just not a dedicated fan of having to smoke celery. Cleared a lot of bad thoughts from my head space which I genuinely hadn&#39;t been expecting.  Its high wasn&#39;t in any way overpowering: wonderfully subtle... it was weak enough to actually allow me to get work done in a timely matter (casually coasting along while I took pictures), but also expertly tapped into my creative cognition without distracting me entirely from my tasks. I however wasn&#39;t sold on its flavor, but you can easily get past that.

VI personally would rate this strain 3.5.\u000aI smoked through a vaporizer and instantly got a headache. I imagine smoking anything probably has the potential to give you a headache, so I&#39;m unsure if the cause was smoking in general or this strain. Apart from that it was an average high, may help with anxiety but nothing spectacular. It could have also just been a dud but I probably won&#39;t get it again &#128549;

VAn excellent Indica Dominant Hybrid with a significantly high level of THC Content, which according to the bag from the dispensary is 17.21% on the low side and 25.15% on the high end. I acquired this strain along with some Chemdawg and some Blue Dream. The Chemdawg is also an Indica Dominant Hybrid, but the two strains seem to affect me quite differently. The Purple Trainwreck has a higher range of THC content, but despite this, I seem to get a stronger and more enjoyable high from the Chemdawg. I gave the Chemdawg a five-star rating, so I felt like the Purple Trainwreck had to be rated slightly lower. Both were far better than the Blue Dream however, which I plan to only award a three-star rating. Although I am mentioning that I feel Chemdawg is a superior Indica Dominant Hybrid strain, I find it superior to most of the strains I&#39;ve acquired over the past year, so it&#39;s a pretty tall order to compete with Chemdawg, and although I give Chemdawg the nod, Purple Trainwreck  is very close to the same degree of quality and is unlikely to disappoint the discerning smoker.

The high is one of my least favorite after heavy experimentation though, I think a user put it nicely in a review under mine stating that he noticed &quot;darker&quot; thoughts on this medicine, and I would say that its true.   The body high is pretty lame imo, and the head effects are just confusing and you can&#39;t really get your bearings until the high wears off,  stupid mindfuck weed, and that comes from the trainwreck genetics..

VGreat strain. It was a little bit of a creeper, but once it hit the high was a very manageable head high and gave me a nice spurt of energy. I experienced very little munchies. I also used it in a vape and had a similar experience.

VThis weed was fantastic with a lime green color is had loads of thc crystals very potent. with it&#39;s bright orange hairs, the trimmer left many of the bright purple leaves untrimmed to wrap around it giving it this beautiful vibrant appearance. When smoked, it had the classic trainwreck flavor with a after hint of berry creating a high that is extermely intense. not for beginners very intense cerebral high.

VPurple Trainwreck smells like purple grape mixed with forest floor vegetation.  On the exhale it tastes like pine.  Mine tested at 18.28 % THC and .29% CBD.  This is supposedly a sativa dominant hybrid but on me it\u2019s straight down the middle. I\u2019m both relaxed with warm fuzzy alertness and I gotta say, what a nice, gentle way to wind down on a weekend evening before joining the rat race again tomorrow!\u000a\u000aThis would be a great strain for someone new to smoking cannabis.  It\u2019s not as strong as some other strains and you get both the relaxation and happy uplift benefits of this nicely matched hybrid.  I\u2019m in a content dreamy mood and am savoring the magic of nighttime.  \u000a\u000aI would really like to try Purple Trainwreck to vape in concentrate form someday for added punch!

VCut i had was 2g at 21% total thc. Overall i really like this. Feels like what it is, a potent slightly indica dominant hybrid. Feels heavy and stoney with a slight cerebral effect that helps it (or hurts it) from becoming a night time knock out strain. I would probably buy this again despite the smoke being a bit harsh. Although that is probably a growing flaw and does not speak on this strain itself. Also personally i dont love the taste, i try to focus on effects. Simply put, if you like strong stuff i say give this a go.

Lol\u000a\u000aTwo things i noticed; firstly, I had very little appetite and even when we stopped to eat, I only picked at my food.  Secondly, I could not get enough water in me!! I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll be up peeing most of the night. \u000a\u000aThe high took a bit to hit, but when it did, was noticeable for about 5 minutes, then following that, i was the king of one-liners.

VI was expecting much more from this strain based off the reviews on Leafly. The Flower gave off a Grape and Pine smell. Smoked out of a Grape Swisher. The effects immediately hit me, kinda like a freight train. Lol. I felt super relaxed or lazy right away. To the point that I didn&#39;t want to get up off my chair in 100+ Degree weather after I was done with half a blunt. I started feeling very anxious and a bit of paranoia. The anxiousness became a little too much. My mouth was insanely dry which caused me to drink a lot of water. With all the water I drank, combined with my anxiousness and paranoia, I couldn&#39;t stay sitting down, I was standing the whole time. It wasn&#39;t a good experience.\u000a\u000aI bought a half of this and at the end of several blunts and bowls, I actually started giving it away. Lol.

It will definitelt put you into daydream mode if you smoke a decent amount, very active sativia blend, be careful lol. Mad amounts of dry mouth. Munchies are pretty noticable with this strain.

V Old school with a modern twist. The buds were cleanly trimmed, dark green with touches of purple and orange. The aroma was sweet and earthy. The taste was a little more pungent than I expected.Grapey and a bit piney. The high is very relaxing, balanced, and long lasting. It went on for the good part of 4 hours. Great for pain, anxiety, ptsd.

VAn excellent Indica Dominant Hybrid with a significantly high level of THC Content, which according to the bag from the dispensary is 17.21% on the low side and 25.15% on the high end. I acquired this strain along with some Chemdawg and some Blue Dream. The Chemdawg is also an Indica Dominant Hybrid, but the two strains seem to affect me quite differently. The Purple Trainwreck has a higher range of THC content, but despite this, I seem to get a stronger and more enjoyable high from the Chemdawg. I gave the Chemdawg a five-star rating, so I felt like the Purple Trainwreck had to be rated slightly lower. Both were far better than the Blue Dream however, which I plan to only award a three-star rating. Although I am mentioning that I feel Chemdawg is a superior Indica Dominant Hybrid strain, I find it superior to most of the strains I&#39;ve acquired over the past year, so it&#39;s a pretty tall order to compete with Chemdawg, and although I give Chemdawg the nod, Purple Trainwreck  is very close to the same degree of quality and is unlikely to disappoint the discerning smoker.

VOn my first puff on the $10 pre-roll, this strain managed to provide a satisfyingly undemanding cerebral high studded with these cute little whimpers of oscillating euphoria,  felt mostly in and around my eyes; but soon my whole body caressed a lingering tingly sensation that had been coaxingly hard to ignore. The flavor description is accurate: definitely one of the more herbal releases I&#39;ve yet encountered. This isn&#39;t to say I didn&#39;t like Purple Trainwreck (because it certainly had shown promise in certain areas), but I&#39;m just not a dedicated fan of having to smoke celery. Cleared a lot of bad thoughts from my head space which I genuinely hadn&#39;t been expecting.  Its high wasn&#39;t in any way overpowering: wonderfully subtle... it was weak enough to actually allow me to get work done in a timely matter (casually coasting along while I took pictures), but also expertly tapped into my creative cognition without distracting me entirely from my tasks. I however wasn&#39;t sold on its flavor, but you can easily get past that.

VSmells like a pine forest upon bag opening. It&#39;s gotta be those pinene terps.  I had this strain my first time when I first came to the city. I made some friends who showed me where to get some MJ and it happened to be Purple Trainwreck. So much fun for when I&#39;m exploring. It feels very heady and colors become more vibrant. It instills a feeling of happiness.

VPurple trainwreck.. A great, relaxing after work smoke. Balanced enough to not knock you out, but if you lie down after a few hits, you might be done for. Either way, it is a pleasant experience. \u000a\u000aThis particular test was lower shelf at ~17% THC, but a whopping 1.06% CBD caught my eye. It definitely shows in the mellowness of this one.

VThis strain had a unique and delicious smell which immediately stood out to me. It was not very \u2018purple\u2019 except for the inside of the nugs. Not something I really care about but details!\u000aIn terms of its effects, the high was very balanced. I did really enjoy it as a sociable strain... A lot of laughs! I did however get the worst munchies ever. It was sooooo bad. I had to stop and assess my situation as I caught myself ramming 5 slices of\u000aturkey into my dough hole.\u000aAnyway, overall it was a good strain, not quite worth 5 stars IMO, but good!

Works wonders for my anxiety but puts me in a bit of a fog.  Honestly the type of strain i like at night for a relaxing card game or maybe movie night.

VThis strain really came through for me. Today I felt completely void of joy. Absolutely defeated as a human in every way. Sick, in pain physically and emotionally and very tired. Somehow this strain not only eased my suffering but made me laugh and get body tingles. Cannabis is the difference between life and death for me and I take my strains very seriously. This is actually my first review and I mostly came here to warn you guys that this strain tastes like turd hole so beware if you&#39;re picky.

VDissolved the tension in my neck and shoulders. Hands down the most physically relaxing strain I have tried since I got my medical card. Healthy Pharms in Georgetown, MA makes a nice batch and I commend them for helping my body relax again after my shoulder was out of place for years. Sweet and grapey, with a nice earthy berry flavor just like Leafly says. I did arm rotations and stretches and my neck and back were cracking like crazy - so therapeutic.\u000a\u000aIt was not as purple as I expected, but this is irrelevant. Only noobs prize color over character.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d love to keep this strain around for after-work, evening relaxation and to balance out any overzealous sativas I happen to encounter throughout the day. 5/5

VI use the vape. It\u2019s not the greatest, but it\u2019s certainly enjoyable. I find myself feeling a very pleasant bodily numbing. However, it\u2019s not as numbing as a deep indica. Instead, it\u2019s more of a physical \u201cfuzziness\u201d that stays consistent. \u000aThe downside is that it\u2019s not doing anything for my insomnia, nor do I feel very euphoric. The general lack of advertised effects only lets me  give 3 stars to this one.

The high is one of my least favorite after heavy experimentation though, I think a user put it nicely in a review under mine stating that he noticed &quot;darker&quot; thoughts on this medicine, and I would say that its true.   The body high is pretty lame imo, and the head effects are just confusing and you can&#39;t really get your bearings until the high wears off,  stupid mindfuck weed, and that comes from the trainwreck genetics.. Not a fan of trainwreck anything.  This is a potent strain, but its not medical marijuana IMO, its street marijuana.

Warm eyes and slight tingly feeling engulfs your body while the first, second, and even third hit tastes like a  very earthy spicy grape. Felt creative and motivated for first hour; then ready for a nap.

VTried this strain as the O-pen liquid vape cartridge. Taste-smooth upon inhale, smooth upon exhale. Flavor-mote of a berry taste. Functionality-no immediate couch lock, very functional and aware 10 minutes after 3 puffs on my IVXX vaporizer. Lower back pain from pulled muscle and misaligned lumbar-gone Great medical product and still able to function without everyone around me knowing I am medicated.

VI have had this before but this sample was not grown the best it could have. The high isnt really there even though it tests fairly high. It is a nice hybrid done right. Uplifting with a hammer. Indugle too much and you can just plant your ass on the couch for awhile and maybe catch a few z&#39;s. Taste should match the smell, a dank grapey funk both on inhale and exhale. Try this one out.

VLove the purples! They shmoke good, taste great, and an all around rad strain.  A must try and should be mid to top grade, depending on the batch, but never the downer of the crowd!

VWe just got some of this strain, and already I&#39;m not much of a fan. I think I had wanted to avoid anything with the name &quot;Trainwreck&quot; in it, but we tried it anyway. Not a fan of type of high, or the fact that after I tried it, it kind of interacted negatively with some other physical and emotional stuff that was going on, and it became kind of a negative experience for me. Probably won&#39;t try this one again, or anything that has any traces of GDP in it.

VI see all of the rave reviews, but I guess everyone experiences a different high, and that not everyone can smoke all strains. This was the absolute worst high ever. First, I did not buy this off the street, it came from a dispensary and I have even called the dispensary to ask if they had other complaints. The first time i smoked it, i was nauseous, even into the next day. I decided to try it again with my cousin and we both experienced nausea. Last night, I accidentally smoked this shit again (i forgot i had two blunts with two different strains) and it was the worst night of my life. Nausea, diarrhea, anxiety, and projectile vomiting... right onto my floor since i was already on the toilet.... never again in my life. I dont want nothing with purp in it and i will stick to my tangie cookies.

VVery strong periodic panic attacks, paranoia, very dry mouth, extreme dizziness and hallucinations... Definitely the worst high I have ever had. Dry mouth, and dizzyness lasted for a good day and a half, paranoia lasted for about four or five hours and i smoked a bowl and a half from a one hitter... Completely underestimated the potency of it. Maybe the THC was unbalanced or possibly laced with a narcotic
