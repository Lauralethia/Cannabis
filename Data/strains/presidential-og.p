VExcellent choice for ADHD management. Higher THC levels than the average bud (21.6%), so you don&#39;t need much. This one does a great job of clearing a foggy head, zapping anxiety, and allowing you to be as mindful and present as you want to be. Also, I have poor circulation, and one hit of this strain every few hours keeps my fingers and toes toasty warm

VNever tried this strain before and I&#39;m smoking it right now. first off this is some of the loudest weed I&#39;ve ever smelled, dealer came thru and I instantly smelled the weed on him from 5 feet away. it gives off a earthy, sweet, and spicy smell, the bud is very dense with alot of crystals and vibrant colour. \u000aand second this makes you feel relaxed af with a little couchlock too but not enough to where you couldn&#39;t  get up easily and go on a walk or something and it also makes food taste great which I love, I&#39;ve never smoked a strain that gave a taste like this when eating food! the way the food seems to melt in my mouth making me even more relaxed and kinda sleepy at this point it givesl off a little more of a body than a head high, I feel pretty calm in a happy way also.... \u000a\u000a I&#39;ve just smoked for another 10 mins so here&#39;s a little quick story: I try to keep the smell down in my room using blunt power (weed smell spray) that was in my pocket because my people don&#39;t know I smoke so me being me I pull out my lighter instead and start igniting it everywhere thinking I was using my blunt power &#128514;&#128514; this sure will someday be a conversation starter!! \u000a\u000afeel very calm now calmer than the last 5 strains I&#39;ve smoked and a very relaxed, very sleepy, and kinda stuck to the couch now as couch lock has taken over a little more you will only need about 3 or 4 hits to help you fall asleep and I&#39;m on my 9th or 10th at the moment. Now, I&#39;m more of a sativa type guy but this presidential has almost made me chose indica over sativa for once. me being in an &quot;illegal&quot; state it&#39;s hard to find a certain strain, but my ex coworker at subway is my plug him and his buddy go to calorodo and Cali bringing back 40-90 pounds pretending they are a delivery truck I think he said it had something to do with a fake animal or egg cantainer semi-truck bringing back each 4 pounds different strains pretty smart idea! &#129300;  he earned over 300$ just today I got paid for working 2 weeks at subway today and my paycheck was 138.68 &#129318;\u200d\u2642\ufe0f SOOO BACK on topic, my bad I&#39;m high off this weed that is one of the best indica strains I&#39;ve ever smoked it really makes smoking alone almost as fun as with someone but more relaxed, once again I use relaxed because that&#39;s just really how it is!!! also it burns smooth af out of my pipe very smooth, dry mouth does kick in a little but I&#39;m Inside rn so it&#39;s not that bad you can take big hits from this without coughing easily and any slight head pain I felt has gone completely and better considering I&#39;ve been awake for 20 hours, 3 of sleep, then 45 before that and I&#39;ve been on a tolerance break for 4 days, if I fell asleep now I&#39;d probably get one of the best night sleeps I&#39;ve ever had and possibly sleep for 15+ Hours\u000a\u000a-Head high 40%\u000a-Body high 60%\u000a\u000aVery tingly and feeling my happy and relaxed emotions are mixing in a way making the high better and more euphoric. leafly is very accurate on the effects. \u000a\u000a...So it&#39;s the next day now and I just woke up I don&#39;t remember falling asleep... all I remember is hitting my bed and then I was out, definitely for nighttime use I slept 1AM-2PM the next day 13 hours on accident. had a better High, and sleep from this strain than Purple OG. If you want some bud that will put you to sleep easy this is the one for you.\u000a\u000aI will continue to smoke this and get way more stoned thanks for reading bros and leave a thumbs to let me know how I did with my 1st review on leafly up, or, down... I wanna know. \u000a\u000a(This review is based off the effects It gave me personally. the effects can vary for anyone)

VThis is hands-down the best strain I&#39;ve encountered for my insomnia. It disorders my thoughts in such a pleasant, floaty way that I can tell my mind to shut the heck up, take its hands off the wheel, and go with the flow. It also relaxes my body very nicely and relieves aches and pains. With other strains I&#39;ve occasionally been pestered by anxious thoughts, but Presidential OG consistently makes me feel like a warm, happy puppy. This stuff is a flippin&#39; godsend.

VLeafly is very accurate when it comes to what Presidential OG is good for. It&#39;s a heavy indica that instantly hits your lower body, as well as your head. I wouldn&#39;t call it pressure, but you do feel a slight heaviness on your face.\u000a\u000aSmoking this strain at night will put you in a relaxed and calm state that would be perfect right before sleep. It is simply one of the very few best strains for insomnia.\u000a\u000aSmoking during the day keeps you calm and focused all while giving you just the right amount of euphoria.\u000a\u000aSmoke responsibly.

VPicked this strain up from the Jazz Club in a pre roll and was floored by its beneficial effects. I suffer from fibromyalgia and cervicalgia. It is often a soreness that never leaves me in the form of headaches and body aches. The skin on my body hurts, especially around my face. I was able to light this up and feel relief after only three or four tokes. My face was tingling in a pleasant way, which is my body&#39;s way of telling me that my nerve endings are finally relaxing. I was in way less pain after my pre roll and felt a hazy yet, thinking high. I also passed out for a nap afterward but was able to get up and still cook without soreness or pain. Great strain indeed.

VThis was one of the 2 strains included in my first purchase of dispensary marijuana, and right of the gate I knew what I had paid for. The high comes on relatively quickly but not with a sudden onset that could ruin your high. Overall, the euphoria was really good, I was really relaxed, and I had a really positive attitude toward pretty much everything (I&#39;m  usually somewhat of a cynic). Haven&#39;t had dry mouth at all, and my hunger has been supressed (until now that I just thought about food) Scratch that.

VPresidential OG Kush is one of those strains that seems great in some unknown way but in the end it turns out that we like them because they get us super stoned.  Prs is one of those and negates paranoia in style.  Chillaxing describes the main Prs effect. Look&#39;n for action, then don&#39;t miss Gth.  ns

Full body euphoria, anxiety, Spasms, pain just wash away this stuff is a must try. Also, people when you see my ratings at 5 stars it&#39;s because I only get the best of the best I can&#39;t smoke anything else because it just works so good.

VAs soon as you make this purchase and take your first sniff you are greeted by a wonderful aroma. I enjoyed the pungent almost citrus/fruity side of the smell. When I grind the flower the smell turns to more of a sour aroma. If you have ever smelt Sour Diesel then you understand the pucker you get when you sniff it. Its the same way when I grind up this weed. Now the smoke is what i really enjoyed. It hits hard, and it hits pretty quick also. The high is more on the body side, although there is some head high there also, it&#39;s less noticeable. You definitely don&#39;t need to use a lot to get high. I am an avid smoker and just one bowl of this effed me up. Its an extremely heavy Indica, so if you plan to smoke this and go about your day expecting to be productive you are mistake. If you have bad anxiety like me, or have issues sleeping this is a great remedy. The biggest affect you will notice from this is really heavy eye lids, and a relaxed body making it that much harder to stay awake. Overall i enjoyed this strain, and the affects it gave me. This strain earned it&#39;s 4 stars from me, and i will definitely buy it again. Enjoy Your High Everyone!!

VPicked this up from a dispensary that is new to me. Buds smelled great, piney, earthy, citrus, nice. Full dense buds coated in crystals, sold as Presidential Kush. Used a one hitter to take one toke. Felt very medicated regards to pain, but still energetic and functional. Hour later and took a few more tokes and felt tired, but pain was way less. Felt a tingly buzzy body feeling, stoney head, very pleasant, but definitely indica showing itself heavy. Recommended for pain, insomnia, migraines, have to check it out and see if it works for you.

VThis tasty strain caught me off guard. Although my tolerance is fairly high and I&#39;m usually very good at handling my drowsiness when it comes to indicas, this one hit me like a freight train- but in the best way possible. Full body relaxation is a promise with Presidential OG, and if you&#39;re having issues with not sleeping I highly suggest smoking a good size bowl or joint of this strain. It&#39;ll be your new best friend.

I took Trazodone for a while to help, but I didn&#39;t care the way it made me feel the next morning. I smoke 2 bowls worth of this stuff an hour before bed, and not only do I fall asleep, but I stay asleep, with minimal grogginess the next day. This strain is also good to watching Super Mario Maker on YouTube, but for getting a good sleep, Presidential OG is a godsend.

VHave you ever had a Kush variety before? Well, Presidential is going to be very familiar to you. My basis for comparison is SFV OG Kush, an excellent Kush strain. Whereas SFV is more uplifting for me personally (based on Ballpark Holistic&#39;s genetics) Presidential Kush is more sedating. I waked and baked a bowl out of my Arizer and had a fun, relaxing day. Being an &quot;Indica,&quot; Presidential had the spasmolydic effects without too much of a couchlock feeling. I was able to go about my day without feeling massive stoned. Altogether, I&#39;d say Presidential is a good strain for someone who wants relaxed muscles and a functional day high. I like it, but, I love a strain like Dark Star for a zooted out mystical Indica high.

VI picked up an eighth of this, grown by Mean the Green, harvest Date 9/18/2016, consumed 2/5/2017. There are no notes about growing location, conditions, or pesticides used. The smell is sweet berries and that oh-so-wonderful aroma of well-grown kush. The sweetness and kush-iness carry over to the flavor, where they&#39;re met by a nice purple grape flavor, almost concordy. The high comes on quickly, and if you&#39;re not careful, it will knock you right the hell out. My wife and I smoked a generous bowl of this and were out like lights for the next four hours. This is a great strain for insomnia, headaches, muscle aches, and joint pain.

VNever though of myself as an indica fan, but Presidential OG is the perfect amount of chill without drowsiness.  It quiets the noise in my head so I can relax without leaving me in a stupor.  There are no bells or whistles; just a solid strain that provides a good functional daytime relaxation.  My favorite aspect is the lack of paranoia or racing thoughts I get from many other strains.

VBeen having trouble sleeping lately, so I decided to give this a try. Took an introductory hit early in the evening, just to get acquainted -- very potent, but not unmanageable. Definitely made music more enjoyable, which isn&#39;t unusual for pot, but this is the first time I really savored the harmonizing in modern folk. Felt really grounded on this, but it didn&#39;t knock me out as I wanted. Maybe because of my mild ADHD, I need a bit more sativa to quiet my mind. Wasn&#39;t crazy about the chest-heaviness, though. Felt like I had taken cough medicine. When I did finally get to sleep, I slept very well -- for three hours. Then an outside noise woke me up. I felt groggier than I usually do on pot, with a slight headache. Reminded me of mornings after you&#39;ve had too much to drink, but not enough for a proper hangover. I&#39;m giving it 4 stars merely for the way it makes music feel. \u000a

Presidential OG is a wonderful indica that excels in nighttime toke sessions, but in small doses is also a top notch daytime strain.  It doesn&#39;t have a very poignant smell, however it does have a pleasant pine/wood taste on exhale. We could all benefit from a &quot;talk&quot; with this commander in kief.

VI found effects to be delayed, then suddenly intense.  Unpredictable too, reaction seems to depend greatly on hydration level, empty stomach, etc.  Smoked @1/2 gram one day, with no noticeable effect.  A week later, smoked maybe half that (half a joint) -- Very sleepy and dizzy / spinny / clumsy.  Headache and fog in the morning.  And if you like a beer with your smoke, this is will send you from 0 to blackout drunk in a couple of tokes - no enhancing properties, just ends the party.\u000aSmells nice though.

VMy new go-to strain for sleep. My circadian rhythm is fucked from a combination of depression, anxiety and working midnights - I was using Trazodone for a while and it helped, but I didn&#39;t care for the groginess I felt the next morning. I smoke two bowls of Presidential OG an hour before bedtime and I&#39;m good to go. This strain is also good for mellowing out and watching Super Mario Maker levels, but it&#39;s a godsend for an inability to sleep. Fair warning, though: this one&#39;s a cougher.

VI picked up an eighth of this, grown by Mean the Green, harvest Date 9/18/2016, consumed 2/5/2017. There are no notes about growing location, conditions, or pesticides used. The smell is sweet berries and that oh-so-wonderful aroma of well-grown kush. The sweetness and kush-iness carry over to the flavor, where they&#39;re met by a nice purple grape flavor, almost concordy. The high comes on quickly, and if you&#39;re not careful, it will knock you right the hell out. My wife and I smoked a generous bowl of this and were out like lights for the next four hours. This is a great strain for insomnia, headaches, muscle aches, and joint pain.

My circadian rhythm is fucked from a combination of depression, anxiety and working midnights - I was using Trazodone for a while and it helped, but I didn&#39;t care for the groginess I felt the next morning. I smoke two bowls of Presidential OG an hour before bedtime and I&#39;m good to go. This strain is also good for mellowing out and watching Super Mario Maker levels, but it&#39;s a godsend for an inability to sleep. Fair warning, though: this one&#39;s a cougher.

Vthis herb is so awesome.  big,  dense,  sticky buds that&#39;ll put you in your place. the name definitely fits it, as in my opinion this should be left for the experienced smoker.  amazing pain relief, and a heavy sedation from a citrus pine flavored power plant.  definitely top shelf all the way

VBeen having trouble sleeping lately, so I decided to give this a try. Took an introductory hit early in the evening, just to get acquainted -- very potent, but not unmanageable. Definitely made music more enjoyable, which isn&#39;t unusual for pot, but this is the first time I really savored the harmonizing in modern folk. Felt really grounded on this, but it didn&#39;t knock me out as I wanted. Maybe because of my mild ADHD, I need a bit more sativa to quiet my mind. Wasn&#39;t crazy about the chest-heaviness, though. Felt like I had taken cough medicine. When I did finally get to sleep, I slept very well -- for three hours. Then an outside noise woke me up. I felt groggier than I usually do on pot, with a slight headache. Reminded me of mornings after you&#39;ve had too much to drink, but not enough for a proper hangover. I&#39;m giving it 4 stars merely for the way it makes music feel. \u000a

VCrossing Bubblegum and OG Kush is like backcrossing to a Hindu Kush. My first Impression was a &quot;Cheese&quot; like tone to the smell. They most certainly pulled out the Kush qualities during this grow.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m pulled one bong rip for a wake and bake. The effect is physical, sedative, and calming. This purchase did not come with potency info on the label which is disappointing.\u000a\u000aI would try a different grow of this strain. Perhaps grow my own.

VSmell is strong, earthy and sweet. I grabbed a preroll of this bad boy because of the indica to help me get some sleep for once, and it knocked me out fast and hard. \u000aTaste is full and earthy, super kushy and mellow. If you need to pass out after watching half an episode of The X-Files, this is your strain. It&#39;s my go-to to help relax and slow down enough to get some good rest.

VI am an anxious person, I smoke this strain to help me sit down and take some of my ambition away.  Perfect for watching a film or two without feeling guilty.  It has not caused me drowsiness as some folks are saying.  However, for me, this is positive as it allows me to stay awake for the entire film.  After smoking, I remain very clear and cool headed.  It is not quite as uplifting as some strains.  If you are already a lazy person, this may not be the strain for you.

VVery good. Smoked it in a blunt mixed with paris og but i had a little more of the presidential in it. Super dank and pungent and gorgeous. Great medicine for pain and still keeps you happy because cheap indices make you paranoid like purple romulan which sounds real nice but i was fooled it was horrible but this indica is great and still keeps you a little up like a sativa would. GREAT TOP SHELF STRAIN MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!

VDefinitely a 5 star strain here, has a presidential name for a reason. This stuff is so strong it&#39;s not even funny it&#39;s just heaven, definitely a strong indica that will couch lock and put you to sleep. Great for insomnia, anxiety, depression &amp; pain on my end. Grab this top shelf bud as soon as you see it! You will NOT be let down. I also recommend &quot;True OG&quot; if your looking for another super dank indica OG.
