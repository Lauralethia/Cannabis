Vthe name is bound to piss off anyone that was around the Vietnam war , but this is the perfect strain for getting rid of that anger.  Amazing citrus \u2013 spice smells, kind of like peeling an orange, it reminds me more of an orange tea.   Killer breakfast flower as once the initial blast of head change calms it leaves you energetic and motivated. That first blast of euphoria is enough to erase the morning blah. This is one of those strains that stop me from trying new things, when I see that under the counter I put my list away and purchase Agent Orange.

VI got a half gram of Agent Orange concentrate from (Refine Seatte x Center St. Collective) and it is awesome! As soon as you exhale you get a slap in the face of straight ORANGE PEELS! The flavor is unbelievable almost, and it stays around on your tongue for several minutes after. The high is VERY euphoric, happy, and creative. It had me smiling at absolutely nothing several times! Which means this would be a GREAT strain for those suffering from Depression. Would also probably be helpful for Stress and Nausea. This is a pretty heavy Sativa so if you are anxiety prone or become paranoid easily this may not be the strain for you.  All in all a very solid smoke [4.2/5] - StrainCentral

VWOW! This strain is amazing... it is a complete 50/50 straight down the middle. This strain is wonderful for a chilled out daytime use (in my opinion). Usually a Sativa, for me, makes me want be active and makes my neck and shoulders feel kinda tight. This strain still makes me want to be active, but the tightness in my shoulders and neck are not as distinctive, basically I have to think about it to feel it. \u000aAs for the psychoactivity of this strain, it is well-balanced, doesn&#39;t make me feel lethargic, and I can focus when I need to. For me, the head high is 8 out of 10, and the body high is about a 7 out of 10. And I have been using cannabis every day for the last 3 years. \u000aThis is all subjective of course and varies from person to person, as well as where you get your medication from. I purchased my &quot;Agent Orange&quot; strain from Bloom in Phoenix, Arizona and I have been happy with them so far.  \u000aOverall I recommend this strain for people who have ADHD, because personally for me, it helps me focus and sit still. I also recommend this for people who have pain and like to move about their day. And if you have both pain and ADHD, well then this, might just be the perfect strain for you.

VI love this strain. On the first hit, that sweet orange flavor combined with the instant euphoric rush makes me feel like I&#39;m inhaling pure sunshine. \u000a\u000aNormally not a sativa guy. But I tried this for some acute depression and it never fails to make me smile. I also love how calm and serene my thoughts are with AO. I would definitely recommend trying it for anxiety. \u000a\u000aNot a strong pain killer in my experience. But as a clear-headed daytime medicine for depression, anxiety, or stress this is a 5 star strain.

VThis is m first time trying AO. Wow this is a great strain. I starts out with a very high sativa buzz, very uplifting and happy. Then it goes into a very mild indica, slight couch lock, with giggly infusions. This is a great strain if a strong smell of oranges and citrus, I would recommend for anyone with stress or anxiety.

VI&#39;ve only just began gettin into the Sativa end of the mj spectrum, and this beautiful flower is one of the many reasons why! What a wonderful aroma in this lady here! It&#39;s sweet and citrusy. The taste is bright and citrusy and just smooth! Perfect Spring morning smoke, but not to potent. I still have a college class to go to in 45min but I feel great. I&#39;m up, alert, and ready for the day! In fact, I spent an hour editing my midterm paper so there you go... a first hand testament to the wonders of the Sativa mj race! Amazing! The only reason I wont give Agen Orange \u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605\u2606 is I feel it lacks potency. or maybe I have a high tolerance... either way \u2606\u2605\u2606\u2605 is still good!

VI was skeptical of this after growing it out.  It is a sativa dominant plant.  It seemed slightly more susceptible to root rot during very hot weather.  Resist the temptation to overwater during heat.  Use shade instead, if possible and keep root oxygen up.  \u000a\u000aThis was a tall, sort of rangy plant, not as pretty as some, but with a great flexibility.  It stood up during 107 days with 20 mph winds.  Staking highly recommended anyway.  \u000a\u000aAgent Orange reveals its power after it is cut.  During the curing and trimming, there is a very strong almost industrial orange fragrance.  It makes you think your house is clean, but, not.  It has a bud that is a little smaller than an indica strain, but well clad in orange hairs.  As it matures the hairs become silvered with resin droplets.  I harvested on the third consecutive day after nights dropped below 68.  A little bit of chill is a nice ripener.  \u000a\u000aOnce trimmed and tasted, Agent Orange immediately went on my list to grow again.  It held up well outside, produced a very respectable amount of prime cuts as well as almost another pound in a second cut of lower, less mature foliage.  It has a definite citrusy taste and smell.  You could imagine it having been cured with orange rind or something, but it is what it is.  Used in a vape, it expands the lungs, and does something very confusing to the brain.  Immediately.  For a while.  It is great for cerebral thought and those stargazing summer evenings or nights in front of the fire.  Great strain, already got another round of it in.  Cheers Mountain Wellness Services!

VAgent Orange is a strain which is both down the middle for me as for cannabis that is preferred also being a close to midpoint hybrid.  At higher THC percentages this flower acts more like an energetic sativa giving a buzz similar to when first getting high. Not sure about potential as pain reliever, but great mood &amp; appetite enhancer.\u000a\u000aWhether it was a sativa or indica first setting the mind ablaze when first getting stoned it didn&#39;t matter because everything is more animated in the early stages. The world before rose colored vision is much like a movie reel flashing before the eyes this world, but the good vibes version of it =)  Perma-grins.  Roadtrips.  Stuffing face with everything &amp; anything in a munchie hysteria.  Melting away into burnt out bliss......\u000a\u000aThat is the result of AO at over 20%.  Anything under is just a mediocre middle ground high which depending on price is great for the taste alone which is nice.  Reminds of that cleaner made of orange peels that can be used for a plethora of cleaning duties specifically good at getting oil out of stuff.  Taste follows suit with odor managing to still taste orange on last few ass hits which is a good thing.

One of my new favourite strains, this stuff smells terrific and really uplifts mood, unlike other strains that are just heavily head-high.\u000a\u000aThere&#39;s also DOUBLE AGENT ORANGE (at least out here in Denver&#39;s dispensaries) which is supposedly just a heavier version of Agent Orange.

VVERY nice! This one&#39;s a keeper for sure!\u000a\u000aI&#39;m experimenting with a variety of strains, to see how functional I am under specific conditions. Yesterday I used a little Agent Orange in my vape pen and went about business as usual, that business being to take my elderly mother on an errand, to lunch and to a doctor&#39;s appointment. These tasks usually wipe me out early on and  I am  in &quot;endurance mode&quot; by the end.\u000a\u000aInstead of feeling beat down, I had enough energy to do these activities without the heavy blanketed feeling of fatigue I tend to get. I was tired by the time we were finished, but not overwhelming so. \u000a\u000aOne hit was enough to allow me to feel relatively pain free AND to be productive. I&#39;d say I felt the effects for close to 3 hours. When I don&#39;t have to drive anywhere, I&#39;ll try two and see what that gets me.

VThis is an awesome strain that leans more toward the sativa side. I have tried it in flower and concentrate form. The flower has a very distinct fruity taste, but the concentrates from this strain are so damn tasty good. Not to mention one of the stongest longest lasting highs. So overall a tasty flower and an exceptional concentrate strain. Go get yourself some at H4L east mesa!!!

Vvery pungent. great for anxiety. very energetic buzz, I was overwhelmed with energy, and clear headed-ness , I also had cramps which agent orange helped subside, Its more of a high CBD strain, you wont have any couch lock, the high is not intense, and I experienced not the slightest bit of hunger. Very flavorful as well. It was an enjoyable smoke all around (for me at least !)

VIt&#39;s a great morning high. My depression can make morningz really hard. So hard that getting to my weed is even hard. It takes a little bit to kick in, but once it does I feel very productive.. on the other side of that though, if I&#39;m trying to relax and smoke, I feel like I melt away almost. If I don&#39;t start my high motivated, it makes it almost impossible for me to get up and go, then I feel my anxiety get worse and worse. It is either a really good high, or a very stressful one for me. It also definitely makes me EXTREMELY paranoid when I&#39;m alone. The taste is smooth, and despite my horrible lungs, I can easily take big pulls. The smell is nice and mellow, and it doesn&#39;t leave a nasty taste in my mouth. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a great strain for some, but it didn&#39;t tackle the medical issues I hoped it would

VRecommended for nausea, stress, depression.\u000aThis is the second time I&#39;ve reviewed this strain. I&#39;m revisiting it because this strain has some unique cumulative effects and I want to note them. The last sample was expertly grown and cured. The current sample is even better, with heavy, more resinous buds. Still a tightly packed, light green sativa structure. The effects are a light focused cerebral effect, including a mild spaciness. My nausea disappeared completely (rare). Pain is dealt with by distraction rather than by direct control. This is an active strain, not a couch lock one. It brought me right to the edge of being jittery, so this might not be a good strain for anxiety, PTSD, etc. Overall, this is a daytime, get out and get things done strain. Would be good for nausea, stress, depression, etc. I&#39;m going to try and keep this one on hand, for certain days. -sy

I am not a seasoned smoker and am trying to stop 40mg daily norco and this my friends may very well do the trick.  I only hit a bubbler 2x and I&#39;m mellow not couch locked, not agitated, erases anxiety like cleaning a chalkboard.  Give this one a whirl, you&#39;ll be happy you did.  For those trying to get off pharma, keep looking for the right flower, it&#39;s out there!!!

VAgent Orange. I got a bag of this last night. when I open it I got a chubby because it smells so good it was probably the best smelling but I&#39;ve ever smelt citrusy and Flowery and fruity scents everywhere. with knowing how good it smelt I thought it was going to be better than it was. it is a very good bud for the day it kind of keeps you concentrated and level-headed with a slight euphoric feeling. but overall I would rate this as in overall beginner or mid-level marijuana enthusiast level of cannabis. other than the brick weed I had right before this :-( so I guess I&#39;m going to with what I can get instead of this which is Trainwreck I would prefer that over this and those were my only two options.

VI recently got some Agent Orange in wax form. It&#39;s a sticky mess, but it still vaporizes well. As for the high, this is the most mild strain I have ever used. The high isn&#39;t that noticeable. In my opinion, this strain may be good for medical purposes. It leaves you a tiny bit high, but you do not lose any mental functions at all.\u000a\u000aNow onto the flavor. This is the most flavorful strain I have ever used. It smells similar to some kind of cleaner, but it tastes like pure orange juice and pine running down your throat. If you like piney strains, then this is definitely the one for you.

VGreat for after school/work, before bed, or just to relax. I would recommend this to any insomiac, anorexic, or pain patient. The buds are light to dark green with patches of dark orange hairs and lots of crystals. The smell is very skunky and pungent. The taste has a hint of citrus but smells almost like the taste. Helped me sleep and relaxed my muscles and relieved whatever pain I had. Made me giggly, creative, very talkative until the body high kicked in then it was straight to the kitchen about 2-3 hours later I slowly fell asleep and slept very well

VI recently got some Agent Orange in wax form. It&#39;s a sticky mess, but it still vaporizes well. As for the high, this is the most mild strain I have ever used. The high isn&#39;t that noticeable. In my opinion, this strain may be good for medical purposes. It leaves you a tiny bit high, but you do not lose any mental functions at all.\u000a\u000aNow onto the flavor. This is the most flavorful strain I have ever used. It smells similar to some kind of cleaner, but it tastes like pure orange juice and pine running down your throat. If you like piney strains, then this is definitely the one for you.

VHad read some good things about this strain. Acquired some at Oregon&#39;s Finest in PDX. \u000a\u000aVisually, this strain is a light green color with orange-brown hairs interspersed all through the small tightly packed bud. The bud is covered in small crystals. It has the structure of a sativa dominant strain. \u000a\u000aThe sample I have was obviously cured well. It crumbled easily, but left a sticky resin on my fingers. It was easy to grind.\u000a\u000aIt vaped well at 365F producing a respectable vapor density. Not a cough in the whole session. The favor was more general citrus than specifically orange. A nice light taste and feel. \u000a\u000aWithin five minutes, I felt the first effects of this nicely balanced strain. It provided decent relief from my nausea and made me hungry. Not the best medicine for pain relief, but not bad either.  This is not a couch-lock strain. More of a go out a get things done type. Peak effects seem to last about 45 minutes, drastically tapering off after about 1.5 hours. Left me a little dry eyed and thirsty but not unusually so. I like this strain for nice light effective medication for nausea and some pain control. I imagine it would also be effective for depression and the like. I didn&#39;t experience any agitation or paranoia. I will definitely try this strain again some time. Similar strains include Cali Orange and Super Lemon Haze.

VI liked this under the name jilly bean but the genetics are the same, fruity taste very citrus-y. Reminds me of a lemon haze almost. Nice head buzz and just a touch of what feels like an indica effect to me, no paranoid kick in from the sativa buzz and a slight mellow body high but nothing noticeable indica like sleepiness or couchlock. While uplifting, this is a non-focusing strain for me.

VThis strain is unlike many I&#39;ve tried so far in that it energizes the brain HEAVILY, yet it gives a very intense body-stone. Do not smoke this puppy if you want to go to the gym or do the taxes lol. It&#39;s also a very &quot;psychedelic&quot; strain, giving some interesting and intense closed-eye visuals almost every time I&#39;ve smoked it (granted I usually smoke at night when the brain&#39;s already in that kinda zone). I&#39;d honestly say it&#39;s the best nighttime strain I&#39;ve tried, lulling me into a trance-like state that&#39;s PERFECT for hypnogogic imagery. My recommendation is smoking this at night before bed, you&#39;ll be laying in a heeeeavy bath of thoughts. Only reason I gave it -1 stars is cuz it&#39;s a pretty unfocused high. Besides that though, have a happy voyage!!!

VThis strain is unlike many I&#39;ve tried so far in that it energizes the brain HEAVILY, yet it gives a very intense body-stone. Do not smoke this puppy if you want to go to the gym or do the taxes lol. It&#39;s also a very &quot;psychedelic&quot; strain, giving some interesting and intense closed-eye visuals almost every time I&#39;ve smoked it (granted I usually smoke at night when the brain&#39;s already in that kinda zone). I&#39;d honestly say it&#39;s the best nighttime strain I&#39;ve tried, lulling me into a trance-like state that&#39;s PERFECT for hypnogogic imagery. My recommendation is smoking this at night before bed, you&#39;ll be laying in a heeeeavy bath of thoughts. Only reason I gave it -1 stars is cuz it&#39;s a pretty unfocused high. Besides that though, have a happy voyage!!!

VAbsolute fire. Great day strain. The orange taste really comes out! Very uplifting with an energetic buzz which wasn&#39;t too powerful. Knocks out minor to moderate pains. While it leans towards the sativa end of the scale I myself didn&#39;t experience any anxiety which is always nice. Perfect for getting work done, working, and playing video games. Definitely in my top 3.

I planned to get my hair done and was fully able to be completely relaxed with no couch lock and conversations were clear even though I definitely feel the head high. I may have found a new favorite daytime strain!

VPersonally one of my absolute favorites. Where do I start? The smell reaks of orange peels and fermented cheese! If it doesn&#39;t smell exactly like orange rinds than you played yourself. The taste is citrus with a pungent clean aftertaste. The effects are incredible making this a perfect anytime medicine. You will know when there is Agent Orange in the building.

VI&#39;ve been smoking this strain for about a week and a half - it&#39;s alright if someone offered it to me I might buy it again but only if there aren&#39;t better options.\u000a\u000aTaste - dirt/orange peel\u000a\u000aOnset of Effects:  1 minute\u000a\u000aStrength: probably between 18 and 22% THC so it&#39;s doing alriiiight but not great in that aspect\u000a\u000aEffects:  strong mental and physical effects I feel like my ears are clogged with pressure almost like a band of pressure around my forehead,  tight chest.  Mentally I feel fucked.  This is not a fun strain to get too high on, moderate to low paranoia.  Thoughts difficult to control.  Moderate auditoria hallucinations.  Visually an 8 ad far as alteration of my vision.\u000a\u000aEating 3.5

VI recently got some Agent Orange in wax form. It&#39;s a sticky mess, but it still vaporizes well. As for the high, this is the most mild strain I have ever used. The high isn&#39;t that noticeable. In my opinion, this strain may be good for medical purposes. It leaves you a tiny bit high, but you do not lose any mental functions at all.\u000a\u000aNow onto the flavor. This is the most flavorful strain I have ever used. It smells similar to some kind of cleaner, but it tastes like pure orange juice and pine running down your throat. If you like piney strains, then this is definitely the one for you.

VReading these reviews make me wonder IF other patients are receiving the REAL OG &quot;Agent Orange&quot; or something less??  The great potency and high are just a footnote compared to its permeating beyond-belief smell of crushed orange being not fully ripe!   I&#39;ve grown dozens of strains and this is the most distinctive around.  If you smell it or smoke you&#39;ll never forget it.  The scent characteristics are narley and rowdy, almost radioactive.  It&#39;s totally unique with no comparables.  Tangerine dream is nowhere in the same league and a &quot;joke&quot; it won a cannibals cup.  A major caliber strain with the boldest smell ever.

VAgent Orange is by far my favorite strain. It reminds me of the California Orange from the eighties- but fine tuned for the PERFECT  BUZZ . It is very uplifting with no side affects synonymous with some Sativa dominant strains = can use all day, and there is just enough INDICA in the genes to make it a heavy , Stoney high with no burn out whatsoever. What Subcool has done in creating this strain is incredible and second only  to natures landrace strains, such as Malai and Columbian gold. The taste is pure Orange Candy.

I recommend it \u000a\u000aAgent orange no wonder it tastes citrus  orange, get it

VA great stand by strain. Common enough to come across in quite a few spots, though I love getting it from any Nectar location. \u000aI love the uplifting, almost giddy effect I get from it. It also isn&#39;t too spacey or relaxing so you can still function while allowing yourself to unwind and smile a little. I seek this one out for depression and anxiety and find that it&#39;s quite a pick me up. Highly recommended. \u000a

VA very nice looking strain right off the bat, definitely stands out with its bright vibrant orange hairs. As the name would suggest it smells like oranges or some sort of zesty citrus. Smokes pretty well but may seem harsh or dry to some, and also has a little bit of a orange taste to it. Overall it has nice calming mellow effects but may also provide bursts of energy or productivity during your day.

VThe buds have a citrus, sweet, slightly pungent aroma. Smoke tastes sweet on the inhale, flowery on the exhale, then an orange taste remains on the tongue between hits. I felt very relaxed after I smoked, it was in the early evening and I had something to go do. So it was nice in that it got me relaxed while I had a little down time, but when it was time to leave the house, it was easy to get moving and alert. No couch lock or drowsy effect, just nice and calming.

VI&#39;ve been searching for a strain that I can use while at work (you know, so I don&#39;t go postal &#128127; on anyone). I&#39;m still on the search but I found a pretty good candidate in Agent Orange &#128526;. \u000a\u000aI only smoked 1/4 of a joint and it gave me an instant high for about 45 minutes. What I experienced was a tingly body sensation &#128559; that made me very social &#128516;. It did make me a little stoney, almost slowed down my pace ( I didn&#39;t hate this) but it made me enjoy every moment.

VI just wrote my last review on Very Berry Haze vaping a bowl of this amazing stuff. So i definitely feel the sativa side of this 50/50. Happy, talkative, creative its all in that review. Pain relieved and nausea annihilated. Super satisfying munchies; I&#39;m finally allowed to eat and not feel nauseous and it is great. However when its time for bed Agent O has me ready for it as well, and offers a calm relaxing high from its Indica roots. When i ripped the vacuum seal on the bag the bud came in for the first time i was vaping on some Golden Goat and it was a scent explosion. This bud smells like straight citrus and oranges and is super sweet smelling. When i vaped it, it tasted a little nutty, kinda like macadamia, but after a while my whole tongue felt this zing of flavor like a lemon zest citrus kind of zing/tingle. Highly recommend Agent Orange. Especially for cancer and similar patients.

VGot an 8th of this from a local dispensary. The smell and taste is absolutely unreal. It&#39;s like biting into a fresh orange peel. The high I&#39;ll admit is not the  eat I have ever had but it&#39;s still pretty good. The taste is just so unsusually fruity it easily makes up for\u000aIt. If you see it around I think it&#39;s defini worth a try!

VAgent Orange right off the bat, became my favorite strain from the moment i smelled it and smoked it, and also the first strain to hit out of a bong. the taste is very sweet and citrusy as it says, and theres no bitterness at all. A very good indica to take when you want to sit back and enjoy your time, does help with pain pretty well, and gives you a great time. just make sure to have some snacks with you because this one gives you big time munchies haha

Vthe smell is what actracts you first, let alone the name. it gives you a very pungent, citrus, and very sweet smell. with earthy funk under tones. the bud structure was solid all the way through from the 8th i got from Van, WA. it taste exactly how it smells, and it will freshen up any room when vaped in. didnt bother my wife or cat at all. the effrcts are instant and very uplifiting, mood changer in a indeed. very euphoric and stress relieving, no sign of paranoia what so ever, gives me a perefect combination of body mellow with a a hint of heady uplift. nk cloud nine effect just drfity and wondering thoughts, which is nice to slow things down abd focus on a single task. like cooking, or cleaning etc. hughly recommend this stalrain, especially for the price that i got it for. $30 = 8th. :^)

I\u2019m really uplifted quite immediately after the first hit, nothing to wait for there..then, it is a great euphoric brain melt that cradles your focus gently.

VPretty good. I saw someone say it was 50/50, seemed more like 60/40 sativa or slightly higher. You feel it fast. You can feel it in the head and the body but it&#39;s not overpowering to either. An hour after I had a few puffs, I didn&#39;t feel like smoking more. I played some video games and did some laundry and didn&#39;t feel like doing more for a couple of hours. It&#39;s nearly 3 hours since I last smoked and I still feel it. Could go smoke some more or just go to sleep. Not the most powerful but solid, mellow head and body high. Recommended

If I smoke a bowl quickly from a bong I get couch lock and my eyes roll back into my head, I get tired, and I&#39;m useless for a few hours. But if I don&#39;t smoke too much I get a good high like any other strain.  My &quot;pharmacist&quot; gave me over a quarter for $20 - he is very cool.

VThis hybrid is pretty well-balanced, leaning slightly more toward an indica effect.  The relaxation and pain relief wash over you first, so if you&#39;re using this to combat insomnia, hit the hay right away.  If you stick it out for a while, the sativa effects start to come into play, creating the happy, uplifted feeling that can make you chatty as well. I highly recommend a second bowl when the first one starts to wear off to really get a restful sleep.  \u000a\u000aThe four stars is because of my personal preference for the more sativa-heavy hybrids.

VI can\u2019t quite grasp why, but this strain is probably the most unfulfilling smoke I\u2019ve ever had... it just doesn\u2019t add up; the nugs REAK of a chemically sweet orange odor, are covered in the good old sticky icky, and are just about the prettiest looking things you\u2019ve ever seen. But the high (if you can even call it that) is a conundrum. It hits you quickly, traveling straight to the brain where it grabs ahold somewhat uncomfortably. I like to compare it to the feeling of wearing an adjustable hat one or two sizes too tight, it\u2019s just not pleasant. While it\u2019s doing this you\u2019re not \u201csedated\u201d or \u201crelaxed,\u201d but rather a bit anxious and irritated, just waiting until you can readjust your snug hat. This feeling ends up serving you with a mighty headache on the come-down that will make you wonder what the hell went wrong with the genetics of what could\u2019ve been a stellar strain. P.s. if you are able to ignore the tightening headiness of this strain, you will find that your creativity and focus on tasks, art, school work, etc... is somewhat improved.) All in all, look elsewhere for an enjoyable Sativa...

VExtremely uplifting. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a strain that makes you extremely tired. It&#39;s definitely a daytime strain. I smoke this at night, compared to more indica strains and I notice it doesn&#39;t make me fall straight asleep within thirty minutes. (I personally like it, some may not for insomnia purposes.) It makes me feel focused and alert, I&#39;m surprisingly not overly foggy headed and slow, which is a refresher compared to most of the strains I have smoked recently. (Lemon Skunk) I believe euphoric and creativity-inspiring like this are less common than the ones that will knock you on your ass with fatigue. Wonderfully beneficial for working.

VSATIVA hybrid- literally 50/50\u000aA well-balanced hybrid that combines the smooth Orange Velvet with the bold Jack the Ripper, Agent Orange will capture your senses. Wonderful smells of oranges and fresh-cut citrus fruit will entice you immediately, while the pigments of deep maroon and purple will make this bud stand out in a sea of green. The effects are uplifting and motivating, yet still deep like a Kush. Fav strain!

VNice orange/citrus smell and taste. The first time I bought this, it was a little bit leafy (more satvia dominant), but the effect was energetic but yet not overly so, I rally liked it for being active and getting stuff done. I just got AO again, but this time it was more compact, more indica oriented so it was more of a 50/50 and it was more relaxed. Still good, but I prefer the sativa dominant phenotype, that&#39;s better as a sativa. So depending on what you are looking for, get the leafier type for a sativa style or the more compact is about a 50/50, both are good. Not harsh so you won&#39;t cough much also.

VThis strain is a creeper. It will hit you hard if you smoke too much of it. Saw some rainbows on this. If you&#39;re looking to trip hard try this, but if you&#39;re looking for something you can actually function on, skip it. It helps with pain because you literally won&#39;t be thinking about it anymore. It kind of makes space and time stop.

The high myrcene and limonene content help infinitely with the depressive, sluggish end of bipolar disorder without hitting that &#39;hard-edge&#39; of anxiety or paranoia that some of the citrus-ey strains can cause. Mild expectorant has been great for clearing up some chest and sinus congestion I acquired this week. High CBG in this strain. Perhaps this is why my migraine has left me?

V&#160;**DISCLAIMER**\u000aIf Reading In Attempts To Gain Insight On\u000aJust How &quot;Stoned&quot; You Can Get Please\u000aLocate Another Reviewer.\u000a\u000aSo There I Was, Early Winter Desiring A Strain Typically Grown During The Spring/Summer Time. Whats A Sativa Fanatic To Do? You Go Fishing For Likend Strains Possibly Of Comparison Which Lead Me To Agent Orange And It Did Not Let Me Down. This Particular Batch Isnt Necessarily As Citrusy As Say A Orange Crush Yet Then Again Taste/Smell Is Way Down My List Of Priorities. The Initial Hit Is A Little Scattered But Then It Almost Just As Quickly Settles Down Into A Upbeat Focus Maybe 10 Minutes After Max. Not A Bad Strain At All Wouldnt Mind Some If Need Be And Found Locally. If Your Into A Clean Slightly Spiked Daytime High Id Definetly Give It A Go. This Specific Batch Held A SCA Rating Of 14% And Was Consumed With One Full Drag Via Pipe.\u000a\u000a- Thee Parris Hill {Your Sophisticated\u000aSmoker For The Unstoned Masses}

VDefinitely not the best bud I&#39;ve ever smoked. the looks were just fine. it had really vivid crimson and green colors, but the smell was just bad. it smelled like peppery orange. it was a very potent smell and not one you want to smell over and over again. kind of gross to be honest. the smoke tasted similar but was smooth and not harsh at all. the high is more like a buzz, and lasts 45 min tops. probably never gonna buy this ever again.

VRe-tried this strain, along with another Orange flavored strain and I have decided that Orange based strains are not good for me. The 2 that I have tried, AO and Orange Cream Soda, have both wreaked havoc on my depression - making it far worse. As a general rule, I&#39;d say give it a shot as they worked wonders for pain relief, and really do rid the stress and anxiety for a short period, but after that period ended things got pretty dark for me. I will not be using these 2 meds, or possibly any other Orange based strains, in the future.

VGreat, uplifting cannabis that will slowly tickle your brain with euphoria and leave your body relaxed and mind more focused. This is definitely a sativa dominant hybrid for me, that provides a slight indica body high that you don&#39;t feel in true sativas. The taste is a very distinct orange taste that sticks on your taste buds for a bit, nice especially if you like citrus. The smell is unique and boy will it smell (kind of like an orange scented cleaner). The smoke is very expansive and pretty smooth. Agent Orange is a great daytime or chilling at night bud that eases depression, stress and anxiety.

VI am a senior who has become an advocate for medical marijuana in the last two years. Currently my biggest health issue is dizziness and vertigo brought on by allergies and inflammation. All the Jack Herrera strains help in reducing inflammation, and among those the absolute best is Agent Orange. After falling from a vertigo attack, I find that one puff is enough to stop the world spinning and then I\u2019m able to sit up. I am also an active, creative person, so I appreciate that I am able to function well under the influence of Agent Orange \u000aBecause it is a short-lived strain, I usually blend it with another strain, such as 3 Kings, to extend the relief.  I tried to filter out the dangerous tars--because I have never smoked and hate to pollute my lungs--but I soon found that the filters were taking out the necessary chemicals I needed.  The problem with edibles is they are not made with the strains I need so do not give me relief. I just wish I didn\u2019t have to drive 20 hrs. round trip to get it.

VOne of our fav&#39;s, something we look for when we spot on our way through Colorado!  This last time (for this review) the bud was spot on!  You can SMELL the orange on it when you open the container.  While super dry, this strain gets the job done is super quick order.  We were having a GREAT time after just a small amount of this wonderful stuff!  It tastes like an orange had a love child with a skunk.  Only negative was it completely dried my eyes out to the point where we nearly had to use a jack-hammer to get my contacts out before they fused to my eyes....  \u000a\u000aI HIGHly suggest trying this out when you have a chance.

VMigraine pain 8-9; nausea same when I medicated round 1130 or so. No way was I getting outta bed otherwise. The pain these last 3 days has been debilitating! Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. Nausea all gone; pain all but gone (3-4). But considering twas an 8-9 that&#39;s a big improvement. When my migraines are @ their worst even the best weed doesn&#39;t take it all away. Body high allowed me to eat. Head high a lil slowed down but how bad my pain WAS may have something to do with that as well. High lasted 3 + hours which was superb for an obvious Sativa dominant. I&#39;d highly recommend for daytime/afternoon use for pain/nausea/anxiety! :-)

VAhhh, this may be the &quot;Anytime&quot; of the day strain, as far as I&#39;m concerned. This fruity flavored poof was smoothe &amp; easy. I could actually feel the gradual shifting of gears, every 20 minutes or so; ultimately taking me on an amusing trip.  I was left happy, relaxed &amp; slitty-eyed.

VThis strain is a good day time smoke if you smoke this at night you will be up for a WHILE. Agent Orange is great and has a sweet natural smell that isn&#39;t artificial at all. It smells like an actual orange if you had a blindfold on. Great overall and is very sticky so you need to break this up a lot before you throw this in your grinder. 10/10

VThis is my favorite strain aside from Pandora&#39;s box. It isn&#39;t over powering so you can smoke a lot (I like to smoke frequently through out the day and like to get stuff done while doing so, such as school or work related things).  It tastes very good, kind of pine/citrus sort of flavor. Predominantly a Sativa strain I do believe. Great stuff. I suggest trying Pandora&#39;s box and/or Vortex as well if you like this strain.

VThis is a very interesting hybrid and provides long lasting effects (2+ hrs for me).  The high is somewhat trippy leaving you with a nice head and body buzz to start things out.  Dizziness and a little disorientation following.  In the end you may find yourself zoning out in a chair and next thing you know you are out cold.  I did do some yard work after smoking this and it does leave you somewhat lethargic.  If you need a good sleep this one will definitely help.   Agent Orange definitely affects your vision so I highly recommend this as a stay at home weed.  This is a nice choice to have on hand for pain.

VI can\u2019t quite grasp why, but this strain is probably the most unfulfilling smoke I\u2019ve ever had... it just doesn\u2019t add up; the nugs REAK of a chemically sweet orange odor, are covered in the good old sticky icky, and are just about the prettiest looking things you\u2019ve ever seen. But the high (if you can even call it that) is a conundrum. It hits you quickly, traveling straight to the brain where it grabs ahold somewhat uncomfortably. I like to compare it to the feeling of wearing an adjustable hat one or two sizes too tight, it\u2019s just not pleasant. While it\u2019s doing this you\u2019re not \u201csedated\u201d or \u201crelaxed,\u201d but rather a bit anxious and irritated, just waiting until you can readjust your snug hat. This feeling ends up serving you with a mighty headache on the come-down that will make you wonder what the hell went wrong with the genetics of what could\u2019ve been a stellar strain. P.s. if you are able to ignore the tightening headiness of this strain, you will find that your creativity and focus on tasks, art, school work, etc... is somewhat improved.) All in all, look elsewhere for an enjoyable Sativa...

VTaste like orange chocolate liquor barrels on exhale, both inhale/exhale are tremendously flavored first coupla tokes, then turns to earthen citrus mixed with carmel and cocoa powder. I\u2019m really uplifted quite immediately after the first hit, nothing to wait for there..then, it is a great euphoric brain melt that cradles your focus gently. Appetite is a decent one, not the junk food type. One of my favorites.

VFirst, being like my 6/7th review, let me have you know I only review strains that I find exceptional.  AO is no different. \u000aAgent Orange has a nice pungent and citrussy smell and the test is a little like it (not amazing)-- but I&#39;m all about feel.  \u000aIt&#39;s surprising this is not a Sativa bc I definitely get some energy, nothing racy, a nice head buzz/ fast rush or quick to hit the dome! Love that!  A nice sense of euphoria as well!  Not a crazy body high but certainly a very pleasant and heavy head high. Maybe not for beginners. Great for good thoughts as well! Uplifting.  Nice highbred! (Sativa) &#128521;

VThis hybrid is pretty well-balanced, leaning slightly more toward an indica effect.  The relaxation and pain relief wash over you first, so if you&#39;re using this to combat insomnia, hit the hay right away.  If you stick it out for a while, the sativa effects start to come into play, creating the happy, uplifted feeling that can make you chatty as well. I highly recommend a second bowl when the first one starts to wear off to really get a restful sleep.  \u000a\u000aThe four stars is because of my personal preference for the more sativa-heavy hybrids.

VDefinitely a strong orange/citrus aroma. Had quite a &quot;tropical&quot; sort of taste as well. Smooth enough to clear a bong, no problem. The high caught me off guard slightly, and hit me pretty hard. It was very euphoric experience. Definitely recommend it for sativa lovers.

VI\u2019ve had this app for a while now and I\u2019ve never wanted to write a review except for NOW. This is an amazing clear headed high. I was able to play outside and drive after smoking this. Super light feeling and lots of laughs. It has my thoughts going, but nothing too overwhelming. This is a lot smoother than fortune cookies and sour power pack. If you like granddaddy purple this is it\u2019s exciting opposite. Love love love it.

VA very nice looking strain right off the bat, definitely stands out with its bright vibrant orange hairs. As the name would suggest it smells like oranges or some sort of zesty citrus. Smokes pretty well but may seem harsh or dry to some, and also has a little bit of a orange taste to it. Overall it has nice calming mellow effects but may also provide bursts of energy or productivity during your day.

VIf I could give this strain 10 stars, I would. The first time, and sadly.. the last time, I smoked it my whole body went numb, right? This numb sensation was followed by a mild tingling and then BAM! I&#39;m fucking soaring through the time space continuum like the bong hit I took was of some DMT. The flavors... oh my god the flavors. Needless to say, I have been searching high and low for this beautiful strain and waiting for it to come about again. Finally, AO resurfaces at Arborside in Ann Arbor. Got some seeds lads and ladies. I&#39;m fucking geeked!

VI had such a great week of experiences with this strain. The citrus notes are really refreshing and keep me looking for more. My eyes do get a little dry when using, but nothing that cannot be fixed with an eye drop or two. The draw is really smooth, without too much of a catch or being too harsh rather. Would recommend.

VNice orange/citrus smell and taste. The first time I bought this, it was a little bit leafy (more satvia dominant), but the effect was energetic but yet not overly so, I rally liked it for being active and getting stuff done. I just got AO again, but this time it was more compact, more indica oriented so it was more of a 50/50 and it was more relaxed. Still good, but I prefer the sativa dominant phenotype, that&#39;s better as a sativa. So depending on what you are looking for, get the leafier type for a sativa style or the more compact is about a 50/50, both are good. Not harsh so you won&#39;t cough much also.

But if I don&#39;t smoke too much I get a good high like any other strain.  My &quot;pharmacist&quot; gave me over a quarter for $20 - he is very cool.

Vpicked up this strain from a local disp in oil vape form. not a heavy hitter I must say but I found it quite nice when doing a home improvement project. the high itself started off body and worked it way to a nice light head. only complaint I had asides from strength was dry eyes. other then that the experience was enjoyable. first smell through the nose I picked up a sutle citrus not lemon like Citrix, more of a sweeter citrus. flavor wise I tasted light citrus orange but then a heavy earthy came upon exhale. if your a beginner agent orange might be a good start.

If you&#39;re looking to trip hard try this, but if you&#39;re looking for something you can actually function on, skip it. It helps with pain because you literally won&#39;t be thinking about it anymore. It kind of makes space and time stop.

Wonderful smells of oranges and fresh-cut citrus fruit will entice you immediately, while the pigments of deep maroon and purple will make this bud stand out in a sea of green. The effects are uplifting and motivating, yet still deep like a Kush. Fav strain!

VExtremely uplifting. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a strain that makes you extremely tired. It&#39;s definitely a daytime strain. I smoke this at night, compared to more indica strains and I notice it doesn&#39;t make me fall straight asleep within thirty minutes. (I personally like it, some may not for insomnia purposes.) It makes me feel focused and alert, I&#39;m surprisingly not overly foggy headed and slow, which is a refresher compared to most of the strains I have smoked recently. (Lemon Skunk) I believe euphoric and creativity-inspiring like this are less common than the ones that will knock you on your ass with fatigue. Wonderfully beneficial for working. Say, if I smoked before I do homework or paying bills, I would be able to be focused, such as I am right now. \u000a\u000aI love it!

An hour after I had a few puffs, I didn&#39;t feel like smoking more. I played some video games and did some laundry and didn&#39;t feel like doing more for a couple of hours. It&#39;s nearly 3 hours since I last smoked and I still feel it. Could go smoke some more or just go to sleep. Not the most powerful but solid, mellow head and body high. Recommended

Vthe smell is what actracts you first, let alone the name. it gives you a very pungent, citrus, and very sweet smell. with earthy funk under tones. the bud structure was solid all the way through from the 8th i got from Van, WA. it taste exactly how it smells, and it will freshen up any room when vaped in. didnt bother my wife or cat at all. the effrcts are instant and very uplifiting, mood changer in a indeed. very euphoric and stress relieving, no sign of paranoia what so ever, gives me a perefect combination of body mellow with a a hint of heady uplift. nk cloud nine effect just drfity and wondering thoughts, which is nice to slow things down abd focus on a single task. like cooking, or cleaning etc. hughly recommend this stalrain, especially for the price that i got it for. $30 = 8th. :^)

VTwo of my favourite strains together. Nice orangey flavour and aroma. Potent, but not overwhelming high. OJ leaves me feeling happy, energetic, &amp; clear headed. Flowers were big but not full of wood, tons of gnarly orange hairs and lots of frosty trichomes. Will definitely re-order from my LP, Tilray.

VAgent Orange right off the bat, became my favorite strain from the moment i smelled it and smoked it, and also the first strain to hit out of a bong. the taste is very sweet and citrusy as it says, and theres no bitterness at all. A very good indica to take when you want to sit back and enjoy your time, does help with pain pretty well, and gives you a great time. just make sure to have some snacks with you because this one gives you big time munchies haha

VA little more on the uplifting side of things, this did give me a slight haze with the cerebral effects.  Most astounding thing about this strain...  yes, everything has a smell, and sometimes that smell relates to the name, but there is NO mistaking it with this one.  My fingers smell like orange juice after breaking it up.  Just take a whiff of this one, and you&#39;ll know where the name comes from (well, at least one of its parents).

VI just wrote my last review on Very Berry Haze vaping a bowl of this amazing stuff. So i definitely feel the sativa side of this 50/50. Happy, talkative, creative its all in that review. Pain relieved and nausea annihilated. Super satisfying munchies; I&#39;m finally allowed to eat and not feel nauseous and it is great. However when its time for bed Agent O has me ready for it as well, and offers a calm relaxing high from its Indica roots. When i ripped the vacuum seal on the bag the bud came in for the first time i was vaping on some Golden Goat and it was a scent explosion. This bud smells like straight citrus and oranges and is super sweet smelling. When i vaped it, it tasted a little nutty, kinda like macadamia, but after a while my whole tongue felt this zing of flavor like a lemon zest citrus kind of zing/tingle. Highly recommend Agent Orange. Especially for cancer and similar patients.

VI really like this strain. The buds are light green and have a medium density; almost fluffy. The smell of citrus, mainly tangerine-orange scent with a sage/some kind of spice wafts into your nose. The taste is sweet with an orange body and a citrusy aftertaste. The smoke is tasty and smooth; great uptake. The effect is that of a Sativa. Though rather than happy, I&#39;m more aware and alert. This is a great day strain!

VDoesn&#39;t hit me as hard as I would like it; however it&#39;s still a strong uplifter and kills that depression. It&#39;s great for asthma if you have a hard time breathing I&#39;ve been using cannabis to do marathons and sprints and it helps majorly, being able to just run without wheezing is blissful in it&#39;s self. It smells of strong...like bitter oranges and has a lighter aroma than most cannabis. For a dense bud it has lighter characteristics for stress, adhd and depression that comes on like a creeper but is light and doesn&#39;t stay too long. However it&#39;s a nice hybrid and treats my conditions mildly, but would be great for a first time vaper!

VThis made me reminiscent of all my favorite stoner movies. I don&#39;t usually ever get the munchies, but I totally did with this. I got a bit giggly. Happy. A little bit of an energy boost, but more of a &quot;stone&quot; than a &quot;high&quot;. It seams to hit pretty strong at first, then level out after a little while. Perfect strain for watching movies, hanging out with friends, or maybe going for walks.

VUplifting high, and comes on in 5-10 minutes after the first hit. Body relaxed and swinging. Everything is a dance, a sway. My mind goes all over the place one and I found it hard to focus on tasks save for one at a time. Body high sensitivity to movement and textures, how things feel. Tastes like peanut butter orange cookies. Citrus is almost too sharp on my lungs. Just one of those highs that I&#39;m finishing a couple nugs off to explore strains. Paranoia and sound sensitivity is also high.

V*Update below* Overall, this is a &quot;good&quot; strain. Here&#39;s how I feel on this strain: Uplifted, however there are many other strains that make you feel more uplifted than Agent Orange. You can still maintain an attention span while on this...you can run errands and do things around the house, BUT, there are other strains that do a much better job at it.  I&#39;ll only smoke Agent Orange again if someone else is buying...otherwise I&#39;ll choose something else.  It&#39;s not bad at all.  Just mediocre for medical grade.\u000a**UPDATE**\u000a- Since writing my original review, I have not smoked the remaining portion of Agent Orange. It sat in the original zip lock for nearly 2 months. I just smoked it again yesterday, and although it was very dry, it was an excellent experience.  It obviously continued to Cure over the past several weeks, and the high was significantly better this time around. In fact, it was a great high.  I felt energetic, uplifted, happy and my depression immediately improved. Only con, very red eyes and moderate paranoia. I would not rate this strain an even 4 out of 5.  \u000aThat being said, the particular batch I purchased should have been properly cured for another couple weeks post harvest to attain the desired affects. Curing for the proper amount of time is crucial.

VAnyone suffering from depression or anxiety, I highly recommend this. I&#39;m not a stoner. I don&#39;t smoke weed often at all. But agent orange got me through one of the most depressing times of my life. I&#39;ve suffered from depression and panic attacks for 30 years. Since 1st grade. I&#39;ve been on every pill you can think of. All the therapy available. And the only thing that helped was this. \u000aIt tasted good. I know that&#39;s not a big deal to some but with my anxiety, my taste is very sensitive and some rates will make me sick. This didn&#39;t. There was really no negatives to it, for me. I didn&#39;t get anxiety like I always did back when I smoked weed everyday. I was calm but productive. It helped get me out of bed when I didn&#39;t want to. I didn&#39;t get the paranoia. Just a little speedy buzz but not an overwhelming one. \u000aGreat strain.

VExcellent aroma will instantly lure you in, trust me. The taste is great and citricy too. Gets you thinking but at the same time allows you to chill, so you are just active enough but very relaxed and sedated feeling. Smoked a few well rolled joints of it at 4am in Southampton, NY while looking at the stars on the roof. Awesome experience, would recommend this strain to almost anyone.

VThis strain was an assault on my senses. The dank potency is strong enough to singe nose hairs. The buds were dense and a dark purple/maroon color. Fuzzy orange hairs give this bud a very appealing image. Wonderful taste left in the mouth and throat. I used this herb to start my day and I was left feeling up lifted and motivated, without a tiresome come down.\u000a

VI took this in a 10mg cookie and some gummy bear edibles. Here are some notes I took while under its effects: \u000aPhysically, I noticed the top of my legs, specifically the knees were very warm. I was acutely aware of the top of my head. It was extremely sensitive almost to the point my headset was bothersome. I thought often how it would feel to have a bag of ice on my head. \u000aMentally, I experienced time distortion. It was quite intriguing. Both short and long distortions. I perceived my thoughts were always getting distracted, but when I realized I had been distracted I wasn&#39;t able to tell how long I had been distracted nor what I had been distracted from. It took considerable time to recall what it was I had been think of just moments ago. \u000aAfter a while it turns mellow. You become less worried about what your thinking or what your feeling, you just want to be. And that feels nice. \u000aMy appetite on this is insane. Even when I know my stomach is full and eating more would be uncomfortable, I still crave food and my body doesn&#39;t react with the same disgust towards food that normally comes after overeating.   \u000aThe negatives for me: Crazy hunger, Dry mouth, Paranoia.

VThis tea smelling bud has that jack the ripper bud structure, and super dank nugs! Smells of tea and cheese not so much the orange citrius tastes like Tea and flower like not pungent or skunky at all very light and smooth. Vape lingers for a bit and stays in the air, So far not feeling anything suspicious creeper. Love the taste its so smooth hits my crown sharply. Nothing more than mint and happy little bit of head pressure, but its just so smooth never had anything this smooth except vanilla kush. Love how it hits my lungs and throat directly very interesting effects a very mellow high definitely a creeper. Great for those looking for an adventure and just to relax great for headaches and if you have pain all over your body Agent Orange is on the case.

V3/5 \u000a\u000aFound this to have similar effects to Jack Herer bar one considerable difference, it wasn&#39;t a clear high. Rather Agent Orange was like a heavy head high that made you feel happy and relaxed. \u000a\u000aThat being said I have a slight fogginess the next morning and other times when I smoked this and noticed I became very slow and unproductive. The smell was very fruity with earthy overtones and looked lovely with t&#39;s orange crystals. While it was an enjoyable strain ultimately I would save my money for something else. Life&#39;s to short to smoke average weed ;)\u000a\u000aRemember to take this review with a pinch of salt, every reviews subjective! #StayTuned #CGM

VIm not sure if I just got a bad spot or what but I was not impressed with Agent Orange at all. I bought 2 pre rolled and I smoked 1 completely alone and I would say I was just next to feeling the exact same as before smokin. could feel a small difference in my head but it was nothing. I am shocked. Worst I have had in years +. I dont know if I would be able to even give it another try. Very disapointed.

VIt smells a lot better than it taste. Seems to burn a little quicker than most. I enjoyed what citrus flavor it did have, but definitely expected more.

VThe aroma of this strain is earthy, with a pungent citrus kick to it. The taste sits on the tongue long after a blunt or joint has been sparked. Coming from someone with a rather high tolerance, I can say that the effects are somewhat long lasting--somewhere in the ballpark of about 2 hours. The munchies hit hard with this one, and you may find yourself grubbing away viciously.

VNot a strain I particularly enjoyed. Flavor was present and easily one of it&#39;s most enjoyable aspects, but overall it&#39;s potency and effects were just never on point for me.  It was mildly uplifting and provided a clear-headed high, but everything was just a bit too light.  Even at higher doses, it did not provide effects I&#39;d consider noteworthy.  I&#39;ve sampled this strain a few times now from different dispensaries and it has always left me feeling the same way.  Unless you are simply trying your way thru any strain you can get it or just enjoy very mild highs, I&#39;d advise you skip it.

VI think I got a bad batch of this because I love Orange Velvet strains or else I hate the Jack the Ripper part of the Hybrid . I took one hit and got an instant headache with initial pressure (I never get headaches), the worst cotton mouth with awful dry eye pain and food tasted terrible. I never had euphoria or felt any of the other claims. I am literally pitching it in the trash. Worst experience I&#39;ve had with MMJ flower.

VWhy would a strain be named something that has been related to thousands of deaths and health problems for thousands of our American Vietnam Veterans (even my father included which Agent Orange is responsible for his heart disease &amp; diabetes)... Pretty baffling that another name didn&#39;t come to mind?
