VI love this Indica. The current batch I&#39;m smoking was bought and grown by Lighthouse Organics in Billings Mt. (4 grams at $8 a gram on sale) This strain greets you like a fine wine with its pungent sweet smell, then when you crack these dense spungy buds the blueberry is released as if a burst berry itself - the smoke is heavy, tasting of cotton candy, but not overwhelmingly harsh which pars well with the effects of this nice Goldy Locks strain; just heavy enough, great for relaxation, sleep, anxiety, headaches, depression and so on. Just a beautiful Indica when grown right and this was grown right - Hats off

VI purchased an ounce of Blue Moonshine for $100 at a dispensary. I was already overtired from working double shifts three days in a row. Sleeping in after  my last shift of the week wasn\u2019t helping.  That day, I purchased an ounce and rolled a good-size joint.  Half-way through smoking it, I got motivated to clean my kitchen,  then I zonked out and napped for over an hour.  I woke up feeling  full of energy with some left over body/mind buzz. Then I went to the gym.  It\u2019s a good strain to recharge when a good sleep wouldn\u2019t melt away the over-tiredness from working long days.

VI&#39;ve had a higher powered strain known as shishkaberry, it displays the same characteristics as Shishka,  so I was a little cautious since Muscle Spasms and Tingly Are culprits for me to avoid. However taken lightly this strain is great for relaxing in a different way, but be warned I am a veteran smoker and this can knock you on your ass watch out for its overpowering body high. If your active its good for staying active, if you&#39;re tired sit and warm up to some happy memories. I recommend this to those who are heavy tolerance!

VI&#39;m not sure if this is the same strain, as mine was just called &quot;Moonshine&quot;. That being said, I LOVED this strain. So smooth going done had a sweet almost ginger snap flavour to it.

I had the budtender at the 420 spot pick it out as I was a bit overwhelmed with the choices.\u000a\u000aI of course chose a VERY strong indica but took it slow.\u000aTook 1 hit and it took about 2 minutes to hit.\u000aQuick ramp up to super high took about 15 minutes, then nice ride for about 50 minutes.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer.\u000a\u000aPros: Good for pain and relaxation that can help with sleep. Starts by relaxing the mind then spreads into the body. \u000a\u000aCons: While pull was normal, there was a little harshness on exhale at times. Some dry mouth and eyes.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Berry taste with hints of pine. Can make you giggly and sleepy.  Little case of the munchies. No real couch lock, unless you count the sleepyness factor.\u000a\u000aI would recommend if you need pain relief or relaxation. More of an afterwork/night time strain due to the effects.

VOne of the first strains I tried. Good at getting me relaxed. But as I came down from the effects I noticed recurring headaches. They were tolerable so I finished off the oz I was given. But always the same side effects. Personally, I will probably skip over this one next time. The high was great, lasting 2+ hours just enough time for my work commute and started to taper off as I began my day at work. If it wasn&#39;t for the headache afterwards. I&#39;d give this a 4 star.

VThis bud had a deeply earthy nose at first. I kept referring to it as the smell of my grandmother&#39;s basement. The earthy/grandma scent was consistent through the smoke. First 30 mins: Produced an incredibly body high. Extremely floaty, giggly, walking on the moon feeling. After 30 mins: zonked for the next hour. Keeps you coming back for more though. Recommended for a long weekend vacay or day at the beach type of thing.

VThis indica hybrid really delivers. Pungent, dark, citrusy. Pine and floral smoke combined for a really pleasant taste. This weed makes me feel like royalty. A real chest opener, Blue Moonshine is a great strain for yoga and bodywork. This flower makes me feel so revived and cleansed. Eating is a deliciously sensory experience. Sensual. Blue Moonshine allows you to tune in to the world in an upbeat way. Art is glorious, this is most definitely a museum and chill weed &#127774; The high is strong but always mellow. It finishes off strong, spacey, &amp; mildly psychedelic sending you into fitful slumber full of interesting dreams. My only complaint is that it gave me THE DRIEST MOUTH. The cotton mouth is so bad it almost makes this less quality.

VI have always been a fan of Blueberry then I went to All Greens Inc. and Blue Moonshine came HIGHLY recommended. I&#39;ve been in pain since 2008 (in five different places) constantly so when I find Good Medicine I stick to it. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do like variety as well. Blue Moonshine is now one of my favorites. I WILL be going back for more every month. I would give Blue Moonshine a rating of 5 out of 5 stars. (Very effective)

VThe only indica my husband and I gave liked so far. This gave us energy, extreme focus and motivation as well as helping with stress, depression and my PTSD. A song came on that we liked abs we danced for a full hour before realizing we weren&#39;t in a club! Very surprised this is an indica as those usually put me to sleep!

VThis is intense. Very strong indica. Tried it two different times and felt like I was way too high and got a bit paranoid in public. I know this strain is popular but probably for higher tolerances.
