VShe comes on like a high class professional strictly business will do things to you that you didn&#39;t know could happen with just cannabis, as well as look at you like yeah that&#39;s right that was me why am I not paid and gone yet. and surprisingly affordable, however these sativapower strains like these alot of people avoid due to haze head paranoia and heavy duty cerebral assault wich I happen to enjoy very much as I&#39;ve found that most south asian heavy Sativa&#39;s have a particular euphoria and sense of well being that  is only inherent in these strains I&#39;m thinkin due to more THCV however it relieves post traumatic stress like a Godsend for me also wrecks pain like a champ. taste on the draw it likened to the homemade berrywine pepper taste of monkeypaw but then the sweetness with spice and a touch of spicey penetrating fuel on the last lik and smooth on the throat heavy in the lungs expansion. On the exhale its citrispepperberry very nice complex transient terp profile IF CURED RIGHT I HAVE MINE RIGHT. I&#39;m a stickler for it mine is now couple months old still in glass but in the perfect zone right about now and wow let me tell ya a story about patience paying off as matter of fact she&#39;s gracing my garden now selected two extreme phenos and she really digs organics. I like this strain. I here and figure on about a 16 week flower the way I like to do it. so well see. Theyre baby&#39;s yet. been doin this all my life family thing, so I haven&#39;t found a strain I couldnt bring to at least hygrade so well see maybe she&#39;ll break me. what can ya do? I liked this strain enough to hunt it down first got it from a dispenso I&#39;d do it again. HATS OFF TO THE ENGINEERS NICE STRUCTURE SELECTION GUYS DOWN TO TWO PHENOS. LIKE I SED NICE JOB HATS OFF.

VAnxiety is at the back of my mind, like how alcohol gives you that carefree feeling which really helps in social situations. Best for smoking with friends or if you&#39;re going to a family function and looking to have fun without the alcohol. This strain also gives me a nice focused high, I can do paper work or play a game without the forgetfulness getting in the way. Great strain for someone looking to have a nice clear high without being bogged down with a heavy head.

VReally mental buzz with a focusing/energetic high. Would recommend for daytime use because there&#39;s minimal to no burn-out.

VI picked up an 1/8th of this for my first time smoking weed ever. It was a nice high that made me quite creative. But if you smoke too much you will be straight up couch locked for a good 2 hours. Even though the high was alright I would not buy it again.

Vmeh. i was really eager to try this - love haze, love thai - but this is a big meh. smelled great - very tropical fruity and slightly earthy - but tastes kinda gross and tarry. id pick it up again if the sample appeared a little more impressive, i want to love this...

VI&#39;m not normally into any Sativa&#39;s, bc I can feel anxious or too awake. Thai Haze though is a fun one.  I feel extra creative, and let&#39;s just say share with loved one wink wink lol
