VI have a low THC tolerance so this strain has a tendency to get me a little too high if I don&#39;t watch how much I&#39;m smoking. It&#39;s great for smoking and sinking into your couch while you wait for the pizza delivery to show up. It&#39;s a little hard to stay focused on something, it&#39;s a great strain to watch a comedy or outrageous youtube videos, nothing too complex. I wouldn&#39;t say I get the munchies, I just need something to do, so I have a tendency to eat a whole lot after I&#39;ve smoked this strain. The come-down can also leave me a little cranky and hungover feeling.

VI use marijuana to relieve multiple sclerosis symptoms, and because of the high CBD content in this strain it works super well. It completely stopped spasticity, muscle spasms, nerve pain and a bad headache. If you are medicating for pain and not looking for a stratospheric high, this is your strain.

VFrank&#39;s Gift indeed. \u000a\u000a           I chose this strain because if the 2:1 CBD|THC ratio and because it sounded like an off shoot of &quot; Ringo&#39;s Gift &quot; which is my favorite CBD Strain to date. \u000a\u000a       Frank&#39;s Gift smelled a little sour but not unpleasant and had a very light sage aroma. Although I know grows will vary , I must say - This was one of the most beautiful buds I had laid eyes on in awhile. Very dense and covered in that &quot;sugar&quot; some brown hairs coming off of it as well. It looked top shelf compared to other flower I had seen recently. \u000a\u000a       Franks gift is a very medicinal strain. For me the THC was definitely evident. It did not take me all the way into the clouds but I was certainly floating a bit. I was high but not &quot; too high &quot; . As a matter of fact I went downstairs afterwards and cooked dinner from scratch for the family. My body was very relaxed and so was my mind. I experienced a difficult day and my stress melted away along with my anger and anxiety about it. There was no paranoia and a mild optimism set in. I didn&#39;t feel energetic but not tired either. \u000a\u000aThis would be a good strain for somebody with anxiety, PTSD or someone who is struggling with anger issues. \u000a\u000aThis strain is a gift. One I would accept happily whenever I stumbled on it. Thank&#39;s frank !\u000a\u000a- Pineapple Scott

VThis strain produced a deep, focused high and allowed me to play video games with my wife without being mental. I&#39;m a huge fan of high CBD strains. This one definitely is among one of my top choices. Nice warm feeling across my chest, a nice slight daze (with no couchlock), I&#39;m able to focus and enjoy the buzz instead of being a drooling zombie for 2-3 hours. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone wanting to kickback and watch a good movie or chill, listening to music.

VWe&#39;re heavy smokers, averaging 6 grams a day, and we smoke to get high. I also suffer from a lot of anxiety, so I love finding a strain with some cbd. Frank&#39;s Gift is absolutely wonderful... my ladyfriend and I both get a little high, very relaxed, face melty and then, zzzzzz. It&#39;s one of our favorite bedtime smokes. Also great if I&#39;m anxious and want to keep a clear head. Just... great. Love it. As other reviewers have said, this may not be the best strain if you&#39;re used to pure cbd products, because it absolutely does have psychoactive effects.

VNice skunky smell.   Harsh exhale.  Immediately felt head buzzy.  Pain and anxiety melted away.  A lot of pain I endure from FMS everyday was gone.  I realized at that point my usual brain fog was lifted and I had no inflammation.  Why we prescribe opioids is beyond me.   This strain is the prototype for pain and anxiety relief.  I imagine it works for PTSD because I wasn\u2019t jumpy at all.  An all over sense of well being lasts for several hours.  Be careful if you\u2019re thc sensitive.   If you smoke enough it\u2019ll creep in and leave you couch locked.  This strain truly is a gift and I expect that it will become a popular pain relief choice.  Please grow more of this.   It\u2019s medicinally powerful.  Life changing.

VI absolutely love Frank&#39;s Gift. I live in Eugene, OR where my grower actually knows the guy that started this strain. They grow large amounts of it and I have recently started using it myself. I use Marijuana purely for medicinal purposes to treat Ankyloding Spondytis, Lupus, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I can&#39;t tolerate high THC during the daytime very well due to my intense fatigue. Franks Gift is a perfect daytime strain. it&#39;s relaxing, but not couch locked. it&#39;s pretty mellow, but I still feel a slight buzz. in a way, it almost gives me energy. CBD is also extremely beneficial for my anxiety and panic episodes. It feels like a warm blanket comforting me. I feel clear headed when using this strain -- something unusual to me, as I usually have brain fog and cognitive issues. It&#39;s a really lovely strain that I plan on using for the foreseeable future.

VFrank\u2019s gift is excellent for anxiety and pain. It\u2019s a strain I always keep in my medicine cabinet because it gives me pain relief without hindering my ability to work. I\u2019m usually a two-hitter-quitter with most flower, but it usually takes me about 7 or 8 hits of Frank\u2019s Gift, if not more, to hit a good level of pain and anxiety relief. Still, I like it better than most other medicinal strains.

VI was looking to buy Ringo\u2019s Gift to potentially treat my M&#233;ni&#232;re\u2019s disease when I accidentally bought Frank\u2019s Gift instead. The THC level was only 5% and the CBD\u2019s were off the charts. For that reason I used a whole lot of it and it hit me like a bomb. I have never experienced such a bizarre strain. I had wild mood swings, mild disorientation. The effects were strange and trippy in a way that I have never experienced. I felt like I had been sniffing paint fumes or drinking bottles of NyQuil. I cannot explain it but the high was strangely synthetic and medicinal. I had terrible anxiety for days afterwards and felt like my entire mind had been thrown out of alignment. One good thing is that it really gives you some serious sexual stamina although it is not particularly arousing on its own. I made edibles with this strain and the brownies were really harsh and spicy like someone had dumped a bunch of cayenne pepper into the mix. Maybe this stuff is good for treating cancer but I have no plans to try it again anytime soon. I think it is terrible! And it did nothing for my tinnitus.
