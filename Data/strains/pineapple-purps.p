VComforted my whole body and mind . It is its own blanket. The taste is pretty much par none. One of the best I ever had , if not THE. It&#39;s super duper sticky.. u don&#39;t feel me.. I mean reeeaally sticky like glue! The smoke is thick . I feel great!

VThis bud is so sticky, but I kept feeling like I had something caught in my throat every time I would vape this. It was super leafy for some reason, so I would love to try some better quality later on. &#128513;
