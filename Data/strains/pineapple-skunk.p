VPineapple skunk is great if you&#39;re having a lot of pain a lot of ADHD there is also a lot of stress and PTSD.I suggest this if you are having a lot of symptoms and your conditions are worsening by the second. Pineapple skunk is very fruity smelling and has a very rows in the leaf like the taste. It&#39;s also very Skunky fills the room. You will be coughing on this one but it will be a good one to some to relax, and mellow out to sleep perfect for those days when you don&#39;t feel like doing anything.

VThis strain is great for insomnia.  I didn&#39;t get any feeling of euphoria or giddiness that I expected based on the comments from the dispensary clerk I bought it from.  After just a few hits, I fell asleep almost immediately... and I slept really deeply.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for relieving anxiety/stress if you don&#39;t also want to go to bed right afterwards.

Cerebral effects come on as well, heady for a time, then relaxation, complex strain for sure.\u000a\u000aTake too much and this will put you to sleep, in a good floaty dreamy way... Thumbs Up.

VThis strain has been one of my favorites so far. Unfortunately I get panic attacks/anxiety frequently when smoking, even with indicas, so I had been searching for a while for something that would keep me calm but also give me an enjoyable high. I think I finally found that with this strain. I&#39;ve been smoking it almost every day for two weeks now and haven&#39;t experienced any anxiety or panic attacks at all, when before I&#39;d have an attack every time I&#39;d smoke. Makes me feel relaxed, lazy, and happy. Definitely recommend for people who have issues with smoking and anxiety. Haven&#39;t noticed any bad effects yet, it doesn&#39;t give me dry mouth or dry eyes at all either. Just an insane case of the munchies.

VSmoking on some potent shatter from Pure this fine Sunday! This is some seriously tasty concentrate! It&#39;s a beautiful amber honey color and soft yet stable. The dab rig was milky with vapor and the hit went down very smooth. The taste was very clean and terpy. Very tasty and coats the mouth. Upon inhale I got that serge of warmth and tinglyness you get from a phat hit of some high potency concentrate. Almost makes your head black out sometimes! :) This is a great tasting, strong hitting shatter. I would definitely recommend trying any of the Pure concentrates and especially the Pineapple Skunk! Love it!

VAs a medical user I scoffed a bit at the 15% thc but damn this hit hard. A little went a long way. Haven&#39;t had a sativa that had me this racy in a while. Wish I had the time to paint or something when I smoked this.

VHSO should be proud of this strain. Great genetics. Grows great, very strong pineapple/citrus sent. Sweet taste. Good mix between body and mind. Think they low balled the THC at 15% though... Great for med or rec.

VQuintessentially well balanced hybrid. It&#39;s got both. Euphoric body high with a friendly haze for your mind. Delicious flavor all the way through. A little sweetness in the aftertaste. One of our favorites.

VAn impressive bud all around. The color, trichomes, and red hairs give this strain visual appeal as does the smooth smell- pungent, but balanced. The smoke is also rather smooth and pleasant with effects that are relaxing, uplifting, calming, and perhaps even creative. It doesn&#39;t knock you out of your senses but the sensation is pleasantly noticeable. This may have been a 5-star review if it was not for the price (and I always evaluate the price when reviewing strains). I think the $20/gram I paid is a bit much and would say a fairer price would be around $15/gram.

VThis is some good ish! It is very similar to Cheese, just not as clear of a head. I also am pretty relaxed right now. Upon hit you can definitely taste the skunky type diesel flavor as it fills your lungs.  You hold for a bit, then breathe right out. I&#39;m basically a light-weigjt, but 1-3 hits should do the job if not accustomed like me to heavy smoking.  If you take 2 good (okayish hits, you get a head change. The 3rd somewhat big of a hit will mail things pop out into perspective.   There is somewhat of a sativa cerebral effect if you take too big of a hit. But otherwise, great strain :)

VThe other sturdy, inexpensive skunk that MW has to offer offers a body-high similar to you\u2019d get with Grapefruit Skunk or any relative in the OG Kush family. Pineapple Skunk is a good mixing indica. It mixes nicely with Goji and any other citrus-oriented strain including Star 51 and Critical Mass.
