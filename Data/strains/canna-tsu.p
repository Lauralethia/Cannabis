VI have been having the worst anxiety and panic attacks for 3 months every single day, I thought I might want to try a higher cbd to thc ratio and that&#39;s where I found canna-tsu. This strain has worked miracles that no other anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication can do. After the first bowl I felt a very mellow and euphoric sensation that has made these horrible panic attacks subside. Even when it has worn off you still feel at one and peaceful. The anxiety is horrible, I&#39;ve been experiencing shortness of breathe, dizzines, fainting spells, and confusion or anything else related to anxiety and panic attacks, this was ust my first day of trying it as well, but I 200 percent know that this is the right medication for me. A lot of experienced bud tenders have told me you need a little thc and cbd together to get the most therapeutic effects, I was nervous at first because even when I was smoking indica strains, it would not help my panic attacks, I have been doing A LOT of research on cbd and it definitely helps with anxiety and panic attacks.  I am just completely content and surprised that this strain can make me feel normal again. I highly recommend for anyone dealing with anxiety or any other illness that cbd can help treat to try this strain. It has been a gods blessing to feel good again.

VMy version was listed as 10% THC, 12% CBD.  Clear headed but stronger than expected.  Easy to relax on the couch and let the mind wander - or focus and get in the game - either way no big deal or switch between the two on the fly.  Would be a good intro to a newcomer.

VJust got this canna-tsu strain for my raging anxiety and panic attacks, and I can honestly say I can feel those horrible feelings melt away and ease into a calming, euphoric, creative and relaxing effect. The troubles that my anxiety has caused least for me was the shortness of breath, the dizziness and fainting spells, confusion afterwards.. But with this wonderful medicine all of these horrible feelings completely go AWAY. Normally it wouldn&#39;t have mattered that I was sticking to indica strains It would make it worse, but with the right thc:cbd ratio, this truly is a better alternative than anti-anxiety medication.

VThis strain has not been available in the Springs, so we did a run to Medicine Man Medical in Denver. We picked up an ounce since I not only vape, my husband makes me an Everclear tincture with an ounce of flower. Canna-Tsu has been my go-to flower for my temporal lobe epilepsy, severe back pain and Chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It has allowed me to go almost three weeks without a significant seizure, and it also helps my chronic back pain from stenosis and head trauma. As for my chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Canna-Tsu keeps my moods level and lets me sleep well at night. I do get some head lift and a small body buzz from it, but the medical assistance I get from it is the real prize. If you live with any chronic pain or neurological issues, this is the strain you are looking for!

VI have been smoking Canna-Tsu now for about a week, and so far it has been great! I have panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. I also have some gastrointestinal issues but nothing major. This strain does not send me into panic attacks, and was actually recommended by one of the clerks who has PTSD and she uses it quite a bit! I decided to give it a try and so far I am loving it. I don&#39;t like to get baked off my tush, so this is a really nice, mellow strain to smoke. My body feels calm, and I can just lay down and rest awhile.

VWow awesome strain. Canna-Tsu by liberty reach. Thc 0.84% cbd 21.23, total cannabinoid 26.13%. I\u2019ve had this the last 2 days and what a great cbd! Felt super warm in my chest, brain massage, slight temple pressure. Mind uplifting, depression compression, washed all the dishes (wifey is pleased). It\u2019s been about and 45 min I feel very relaxed, pain is gone, and my stomach is soothed. Looks like another night of pain free sleeping. Highly recommended. Oh and if there is anybody reading this that\u2019s afraid to try cannabis because of anxiety or a bad experience there is ABSOLUTELY nothing to be afraid of! If you knew how scared I was to try cannabis again after 20 years, how against cannabis I was, how it literally took me a year before I would even try it again. I\u2019m telling you, do not worry! Even if something does happen and you get anxiety or paranoid, it\u2019s not reality, it will pass, your stronger than you think you are. If your tired of the pills for pain, or pills for anxiety, or pills for ptsd, or whatever, try some cannabis.

VI&#39;m new to medical marijuana and this was the sending strain I  tried. I have been dealing with severe depression, anxiety, OCD and I smoked a bowl before heading out the door To hang out with some friends. I was feeling like my usual depressed, overly stressed self , but after one bowl I felt happy and content! I didn&#39;t over fixate on one thing for to long like I usually do. This put my head in a really calm place! I felt creative and motivated too! I didn&#39;t really even feel that paranoid like I did on Critical Mass. I also suffer from back and jaw pain. This took care of that as well.  It helped my muscles relax and I didn&#39;t feel tense like I usually do. Given I&#39;m new to all of this, I would definitely recommend this to someone just starting out. Good for both day and night!

VI was skeptical that it would be flavorful and aromatic since it technically didn\u2019t have a \u201chigh potency\u201d label from my Dispensary. Garden State Dispensary to be specific. It is aromatic and flavorful! I have a tough time finding strains that don\u2019t make me feel awkward and shy. That make me just want to stay away from folks that don\u2019t have a handle on smoking MM. This one is easy. Even my non smoker family member was interested and enjoyed it very much. This is someone that got turned off smoking over 10yrs ago. At the very least I\u2019d describe this as a very approachable strain for someone with a low tolerance. But still has enough of a punch that it is really is fun. I give it less than 5 Stars because I still haven\u2019t found a true 5 star strain in general! This is really great for a easy going medicinal day. Worth the $$.

VI&#39;m clear headed, peaceful &amp; pain free. Love it. I just started a month long break from thc. This strain has only .7 thc &amp; 18% cbd. It&#39;s working perfectly, to transition into that. I&#39;m a medical patient, but when my thinking starts getting cloudy I edit out the thc for awhile so I can reset. This strain has almost no thc but it is awesome all the same. I&#39;m in a good mood &amp; relaxed &amp; do not feel deprived of anything. When I&#39;m not on a break I often like to mix this strain or some cannatonic with thc dominant strains to balance it out &amp; it works great for that too

VPicked this up from Medicine Man medical in Denver. I live with epilepsy, PTSD and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. And in doing research my caregiver and I found that Canna-Tsu is highly recommended for those disorders. Yesterday I had major issues with depression and anger, and that triggered seizure aura&#39;s. I had three hits of Canna-Tsu on my Pax, and literally within minutes I was calming down and feeling more like my old self.  I have been using medical cannabis for two years now, and this is the first strain that has been this effective in relation to my disorders. I highly recommend, and hope that this wonderful strain appears in COS soon.

Though I&#39;m hitting it in the afternoon evening, I think this would be the top choice for a wake and bake. Nothing like a high THC high.. very nice mellow.

VWhat &quot;Canna Tsu&quot; about Canna Tsu?  Well I canna say a lot ;) by far my favorite high CBD strain, and overall favorite strain of 2016.  I have been dealing with anxiety symptoms recently, and moderate doses of the Canna Tsu seem to melt away all my tension.  Great, relaxing feeling of calmness, not too overpowering of a &quot;high&quot; unless extreme doses are taken.  Mentally clear enough to function in everyday life without the fear of a crippling anxiety attack.  Beautiful notes of what I describe as a &quot;moldy/funky citrus fruit&quot; scent followed by a mellow yet very sweet-earthy aroma.  Doesn&#39;t expand too much in the lungs or give insane cotton mouth. LOVE this strain!

VI love me some Canna-tsu. I don&#39;t get high from it, or the complications from more THC (like anxiety or paranoia), and it does help with migraines. I&#39;ve tried several other high CBD strains, but this is the only one I&#39;ve found that really works for me. However, I&#39;ve noticed that even if I vape this, I still need one hit of a higher THC strain for it to kick in and finally kill the headache (where just the THC alone doesn&#39;t do it). If you&#39;re taking CBD&#39;s for pain, I think it does take experimenting with the CBD/THC ratio to find your own level.  That said, I will always keep Canna-tsu in my medicine cabinet.

VI predominantly smoke higher CBD strains to deal with pain, anxiety, and the stress cause by both, and canna-tsu is one of the better strains I&#39;ve had at alleviating all three symptoms. Coming in at 9% CBD and 5% THC, this strain gives just enough of a psychoactive effect to really relax, but still be able to go about my business with a clear head. A bowl in the mid morning and I can feel my tension melt out of my body. Interestingly enough, not much aroma in the 3.5 grams I picked up, just a hint of a woodsy, earthy scent. Recommended.

VI\u2019ve tried this strain a couple of times now and I absolutely adore it! It really helped kick my migraine out. After three good hits on the Vaporizer and a very mild high that only lasted about 10 minutes what remained was just pain relief and focused energy to get stuff done.  It\u2019s also helped me with anxiety. I\u2019ve only used it on its own but am excited to try mixing it with other high THC strains to see how it helps them work. AC/DC is usually my go-to high CBD strain but this might just be my new favorite.

VVery relaxing, still quite mentally alert, a little sleepy. Mild munchies, vaped very smooth at 356* from a mighty. Caused moderate levels of Couchlock, but easy to snap out of if you get up. Made nose, and fingers which were cold, feel very cold. Pretty solid strain.

VThis was the first CBD strain I smoked and it was night an day compared to the indicas I used to go for. I smoke to treat anxiety/depression and PTSD, and the second I hit the canna-tsu, life didn&#39;t seem like some unwinnable game anymore. My mind cleared and I got the first good night&#39;s sleep I&#39;ve had in years. I highly recommend this for anxiety and PTSD.

VThis is a great strain for stress and pain. Produces a mild head high yet quiets an active mind while still leaving you alert and clear headed. \u000a\u000aIt was good on its own but I grinded it with Stephen Hawkings and it was great. Really took the pain management to the next level.\u000a\u000aVery happy with this on its own or as a base for mixing other strains.

VLove this one at night for insomnia, knocks out all your pain, and you forget that you are out of milk and eggs. It puts your mind on a temporary holiday. Lasts 3 to 4 hours. Definitely a couch or bed high! Be prepared!

VThis higher CBD strain was great for my pain and inflammation and left me with a clear head and just enough buzz from the little THC that it does have to enjoy my evening. This is a strain I will put at the top of my &quot;to be bought again&quot; list in the future. #420sweepstakes

VWhat do I think about this strain? I think this is one amazing strain.. If this strain was smoked by Donald Trump he would stop talking bad about people, open up to new ideas, and probably cut his wild hair because the effects of this herb would make him see the world through a peaceful lense... Let&#39;s not call this Strain Canna-Tsu lets call it Donald Trumps Trumpet.

VThis is the first flower I&#39;ve tried, so feel free to disregard this review. Comparing it to an edible, That Taffy, the repellent scent and taste leave a lot to be desired. I also did not get much of a body high or the same kind of euphoria I experienced with the taffy.
