VThis is a great daytime strain for treating those conditions which require a high THC content. It&#39;s effects I find are great at treating my anxiety without inducing unwanted paranoia or restlessness. Best avoided right before bed due to an initial stimulation eventually however it can leave me a tad sedated after the effects wear off.

VThis shit hits hard and fast. I tried it at a party with 7 others. I took two hits of this from a blunt and I was being sucked in and out of reality within 5 minutes. I wasn&#39;t very talkative as most processes were mental. I experienced lots of creativity with minor paranoia at parts. In the right setting this could be like a full on psychedelic trip if ypu smoked enough. By far the most powerful weed I have ever smoked. One of my mates said he saw hands coming out of the smoke from the smoke machine at the party. Another said he saw large holes in the floor that he had to avoid. With enough you begin to hallucinate a fair amount, basically. Not a strain for chilling out. Definitely a strain for people who like an intense ride similar to that of a small LSD trip just with your mind numbed a little. Two guys said it lasted for 9 hours and they only had 4 or 5 hits. I experienced it for about 5 hours and then fell asleep. Emotions ranved from deep and philosophical, to relaxed, slightly paranoid, insightful, euphoric and dayum the dry mouth is brutal. Make sure you take water because your tongue shrivels like a dick in Siberia. Memory loss is quite frequent. This is definitely for intermidiate to advanced smokers who enjoy being completely dominated by THC. If you smoke this as a beginner you will be paranoid and scared at how strong it is.\u000a\u000aEnjoy.\u000a

VA great strain for anyone who is looking for help curbing anxiety or stress and can also help to treat insomnia and difficulty falling asleep. The effects have strongly indica influence and therefore you may want to avoid it during times when you need to be productive as sleepiness and body relaxation  are common.

VStrain: Stardawg (Chem Dawg 4 / Tres Dawg cross)\u000aGrower: Pig Farms\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: Piney sour that is just magnified throughout the room as soon as the jar is cracked or the scissors hit the nug.\u000aLook: Big nugs. Light green, trimmed well.\u000aTaste: One nice Sour taste with layered pine and the taste of what the east coast cannabis tastes to me.\u000aRecommendation for medicine: Great day smoke but a little debilitating.

VHands down one of my favorite hybrids I&#39;ve tried.  It is perfect for daytime use - does not make me unable to function.  Not only that, but it is some really nice looking flower! It&#39;s a perfect mix of sativa/indica... relaxes me enough that I&#39;m not anxious yet leaves me focused and in a great productive mood. One of the hybrids I hope to keep on hand always. I suffer from ptsd and severe anxiety and this strain is perfect.

VI love this strain!  For my diagnoses of bipolar II, anxiety disorder, and general neuroses, this Stardawg strain is the ticket.  My mind is clear, but not racing, and I&#39;m able to focus on one task at a time.  This strain is beautiful with absolutely sparkly trichomes.  It almost looks as though there was a light snow because the crystals are so abundant.  I feel a calm euphoria and a sense of &quot;not being all over the map.&quot;  \u000a\u000aContrary to the overview of this strain, where it said that this strain is not available in Bakersfield, CA, which is where I&#39;m at,  Stardawg IS available at more than one collective in Bakersfield.  I got my Stardawg from The Imperial Roots, a delivery service, the best in my opinion.

This is the perfect strain for any goofy high day out or in.  You&#39;ll be left very relaxed, and happy, a slightly hazy high clearly sativa dominant.  I&#39;ve come to love chem&#39;s flavor and effects and this cut is no different.  10/10

VThe variety of Stardawg I smoke regularly is the prized &quot;Guava&quot; cut, frequently offered at Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers in downtown Colorado Springs. The smell is very similar to chem 4 but it has a stronger diesel smell and is a sativa dominant hybrid, making it ideal migraines and alsomood disorders, particularly bipolar disorder and anxiety. It enhances appetite and makes me less nauseous while making me feel better mentally. This strain would be good for the daytime as long as your duties arent too physical, but is really ideal for afternoon and evening and it is not a straight knockout so I recommend finding something else for troubles sleeping, this will help, but sleep is not this strains specialty. With the Guava my mind is fully active but my thoughts are more organized and reasonable than usual, making it easier to focus and get stuff done. I highly recommend both the &quot;Stardawg Guava&quot; and Natural Mystic in Co springs. They have a great selection of CBD flowers and extracts as well as some of the most consistently high quality hazes and kushes in the state. Try guava, facewreck haze, super lemon haze, girl scout cookies, honey boo boo and og kush! Their cut of tora bora has a 2:1 cbd thc ratio and is some of the finest natural pain medicine in the state and maybe the world

VLocation: Docs Apothecary (Northglenn)\u000aSmoking tool: small bong\u000aTolerance: Moderate (strong strains can still kick my ass but weak ones won&#39;t do much)\u000a\u000aThis is probably the most well rounded hybrid that I&#39;ve ever had. I would describe it as &quot;Energetic Couch Lock&quot; which is actually quite nice. Most hybrids would either be too much indica, causing me to be strongly couch locked and exhausted, or they won&#39;t have enough indica, causing me to miss out on the full body relaxation.\u000a\u000aStardawg, however, was very pleasant. I was more awake, talkative, giggly, and relaxed. The nice cerebral/sativa high was paired very well with a full body relaxation that still allowed me to stand up and move around.\u000a\u000aI will note, however, that this strain was noticeably strong. I saw reviews mentioning it&#39;s strength before smoking so I made sure to only have small bong hits. But even those small hits were noticeable so I will warn novice smokers to use caution with this strain. I also would not recommend planning for an active evening out with friends for this strain. Stick to a solid sativa for that. But if you want to really enjoy a funny movie or video games at home, Stardawg is one of the best so far!

VHands down my favorite strain. It relaxes you enough to rid of stress and anxiety, but you are still active. Stardawg doesn&#39;t make you want to melt into your couch and pass out, unless you&#39;re already that exhausted, of course. What it does is get you calm enough and euphoric to go about your day. It&#39;s best used with yoga, in my humble opinion. A couple of hits, followed by a good yoga session feels fantastic.

VThe first time I got to try StarDawg was in Ventura, CA back in 2010.  I was growing Pre98 Bubba, and had taken a sample to a friends house.  While there my friend said his buddy had just dropped off 1/2LB of this strain called StarDawg.  \u000a\u000aWe rolled a 4gram blunt and poured some tequila.  I don&#39;t remember much else.  \u000a\u000aStarDawg spoke to my soul.  So much I agreed to trade a cut of my beloved Pre98 Bubba for a few cuts of this StarDawg.\u000a\u000aLater I would learn the cut had come from Kyle Kushman, and within a year I was closing up shop on Pre98 Bubba and converting everything to StarDawg.  \u000a\u000aHow do you describe a room with a few thousand?  INTOXICATING.  Spicy Nag Champa incense.\u000a\u000aWith Pre98 Bubba I could guarantee an OZ on a plant.  With StarDawg at week 4 I could tell I already had way over an OZ.  She would go on to average 2.5 oz in a 3 gallon pot filled with coco.\u000a\u000aOnce cured it should smell sweet like sour diesel but then your nostrils get hit with extreme spicy, but with hints of mint or some would call it kind of Pine like Kosher Kush.  Basically most of that nag champa leaves out but a touch does remain.  You can find it once you grind them up and they haven&#39;t cured for a few months.\u000a\u000aI dedicated my medical growing career to this strain and changed many lives.  Only strain I ever grew that always had 50Lbs pre-sold.  Was universally loved between male &amp; female clients.\u000a\u000aI would go on to cross this strain with Tahoe OG, Chem-D, and finally Pre-98.  The best cross came from a cut I had called Chem-T.  I had crossed Chem-D with Tahoe OG, and called it Chem-T.  You got the weight of Chem-D with the effects of Tahoe.  Once crossed with Star Dawg the lemon smell went into over drive with raw spice.  Harbor Side was blown away.

VHands down my favorite strain. It relaxes you enough to rid of stress and anxiety, but you are still active. Stardawg doesn&#39;t make you want to melt into your couch and pass out, unless you&#39;re already that exhausted, of course. What it does is get you calm enough and euphoric to go about your day. It&#39;s best used with yoga, in my humble opinion. A couple of hits, followed by a good yoga session feels fantastic.

VThis is a great Sativa strain and as with Sativa dominance, it is best suited for daytime use and for treating those symptoms that require high THC content. Very good at treating my anxiety without inducing any unwanted paranoia. I would not take this prior to going to bed or a few hours before. However, when it wears off I do feel a bit sedated. It helps tremendously with my PTSD symptoms and will certainly get an extra meal in your belly so win-win!

Sativa dominant and functional but gives you enough spacey kick to make you know you are nice and high. Happy, balanced effects make this one to put in normal rotation.

After that I was on chill mode for another 5 hrs. This strain has some trippiness to it. I was amazed that weed could bring some of these sensations out.  Little scary but very exciting. The blunt was heaven in weed form. It was smooth and never harsh. If I could have handled it I would have done more than half. Grower did a great job. Even smoke aroma was pleasant. As the bud was dense and pretty. I wish I took picture but I was too excited to try it. Definitely must try!

Kick up your feet N&#39;chill as the high covers you like a warm blanket. Or keep on hit&#39;n hit for the head high cuz you&#39;ve been there way longer than him. And it fades quick. For that 3 star. Good mind chiller.

VI love Stardawg as it helped me overcome missing my anxiety medicine which I usually never miss.  On ocassion and ususally I get shakes and not feeling well when I miss my medicine.  This Stardawg took away all my shakes and unpleasant feelings.  So I want to have this on hand in case I ever miss my medication and when I am feeling anxious.  I would like to see a cartridge made of this stuff.  It really relieves anxiety,  which  is why I like Stardawg.

The buds are large and when squeezed it bounced right back, when grinding I smelled flowers, pine, and citrus. The following terpenes are Alpha Pinene, Beta Pinene, D-limonene, Linalool, Beta Myrcene, Alpha Humulene, Beta Caryophyllene. This flower I would recommend for those seeking pain relief, those who suffer with depression, anxiety, Gerd, auto immune disorders, ulcers, and nausea. (CRESCOLABS product)

The wax is a SWEET flavor sugar like sweet, the lift was on the Sativa side for it being a hybrid but was very euphoric and had me focused but a bit to anxious but perfect for those wanting a HYBRID lift with the indica body relaxation!

VI have sampled this a lot in recent months. One of the stronger strains you can smoke regularly. Very strong with a very active high, great for video games. Gives moderate mind fog however, meaning that games that require less thinking are best.\u000a\u000aThis is becoming one of the most widespread strains available in my area, and I can see why.

Gave me a lot of anxiety, made me shake, for the first half an hour all I could do was lay in bed and wait for the initial hit to pass; after it did pass it wasn&#39;t so bad, but not a high I&#39;d ever want to experience again. Picked up some much better Lemon Kush afterwards. Could well just be a one off though, so I&#39;ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

VStardawg really didn&#39;t sit well with me, personally. Gave me a lot of anxiety, made me shake, for the first half an hour all I could do was lay in bed and wait for the initial hit to pass; after it did pass it wasn&#39;t so bad, but not a high I&#39;d ever want to experience again. Picked up some much better Lemon Kush afterwards. Could well just be a one off though, so I&#39;ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

VI didn&#39;t find it so great for productivity, as in staying focused and getting stuff done, but in a word I would describe this strain as INSPIRING!  Took my thoughts interesting places and gave me a lot of ideas.  Saving the rest of mine for times when I seek inspiration.  It&#39;s not &quot;productive&quot; enough for me for daily use; I feel unfocused and lazy.  Smoking this in an environment that stimulated my creativity and imaginative thoughts was craaaazy good tho.

VI have sampled this a lot in recent months. One of the stronger strains you can smoke regularly. Very strong with a very active high, great for video games. Gives moderate mind fog however, meaning that games that require less thinking are best.\u000a\u000aThis is becoming one of the most widespread strains available in my area, and I can see why.

Vsmoked this strain for one of the first times I ever smoked weed and oh my!! Such intense feelings of euphoria and happiness! Never felt so uplifted in my life! I would definitely recommend this strain for someone going to a social smoking event due to the talkative and  good nature it provokes within the user.

VI smoked Stardawg by Rythm through my vape, and this strain made me super aware of my surroundings and behavior I had a nice focus that allowed me to relax and not become sleepy. Alleviated body pains and nerve pain. Inhale is strong. Exhale is almost smokey tasting. Oddly on the come down it made me a little jittery but exhausted. Might have been better to have smaller drags too. lol \u000a\u000a- Budtender Jess

VStardawg really didn&#39;t sit well with me, personally. Gave me a lot of anxiety, made me shake, for the first half an hour all I could do was lay in bed and wait for the initial hit to pass; after it did pass it wasn&#39;t so bad, but not a high I&#39;d ever want to experience again. Picked up some much better Lemon Kush afterwards. Could well just be a one off though, so I&#39;ll give it the benefit of the doubt.

So smooth to smoke and an instant relaxation mood sinks in immediately after, happy and euphoric feeling of content. Lovely nights sleep offered with this strain and felt aroused!! 5/5 all round top weed!!

VStardawg is a 250 ml cartridge from Cresco Labs. Very bright flavored with citrus and pine, plus very mild residual aroma so this one is good for discretion. My previous experience with dj short flo sativa didn&#39;t quite meet my relief needs, and getting back to this hybrid is awesome. The effects as listed are spot-on: happiness and uplifting feelings set in right away.

VBought a gram  of Stardawg from Puget Sound Marijuana in Lynnwood.  This specific strain was produced by &quot;Evergreen&quot;.  \u000a\u000aThe flower drifts between smelling like coffee, chocolate, black tea, and raw earth.   Me and my fiancee split a half ram joint.  The taste was relatively smooth, but forgettable.  The effects were immediate and I felt much more of the sativa part of this hybrid strain right off the bat.  Of the more potent strains that I&#39;ve tried, this hybrid provided the most cerebral high.  After an hour, there is very little body euphoria.   This Stardawg strain also made me hungry, so it would be great for someone needing an appetite stimulant.   Also made me feel super creative as soon as I took the last hit.\u000a\u000aGreat weed to smoke if you need to be clear headed, but creative and uninhibited.  Doesn&#39;t provide much pain relief, but should work well for anxiety related symptoms.

It&#39;s not &quot;productive&quot; enough for me for daily use; I feel unfocused and lazy.

VOK so I might be premature in this review since it is based on a single pre-roll but I was blown away. Got this as freebie from a dispensary I was visiting for the first time. Bartender picked it out for me to surprise me. I had come in looking for Sativas and this is a hybrid. Went home, fired it up, and was blown.\u000a\u000aI live in Las Vegas and this was 3 days after the Mandalay Bay tragedy. The joint got me high as hell but then I got super emotional and started crying over the week&#39;s events but it was exactly what I needed. I needed to grieve but my brain tends to lock things up and I keep my emotions bottled up. I mean I was so high and still happy yes was able to cry and grieve at the same time and get it out of my system. I think it was helping my brain achieve a chemical balance I needed.\u000a\u000aNo real munchies except a little very late in the cycle. Totally manageable.\u000a\u000aI can&#39;t wait to go back and get at least a quarter and see how this stuff performs over the longhaul but if it stays consistent, I could see this becoming one of, if not my primary go to daytime strain.

Nice, smooth inhale, with that earthy flavor on the exhale. Very uplifting, functional high/ Very nice sativa hybrid. Two bong rips and I was on my way to happily watering my plants.

VI&#39;ve had lots of fun with stardawg, however it is not my favorite strain because if the taste. I am not a fan of the chemical taste and smell. I prefer sweeter tastes and smells, however if you don&#39;t mind that, the effect is great. It gives you so much energy.

VThis is too much of a sative for me; the effects were more energetic. With that being said, this is a great daytime smoke. Felt motivated to get things done and get going for the day. Would not recommend to get unwind or go to sleep.

VThe strain is a fairly decent smoke with friends during a social occasion for example celebrating 4 20, yet if your not with friends it can cause you to become dizzy, lonely and will create a sense that you will never find a decent partner that likes the same strains you like ... yet it was a great smoke.

VSo I am biased. I vaped a lil of this weed smack in the middle of a cold, so I was already feeling shitty. Nonetheless, I vaped this thinking it would help relieve my headache (which it did temporarily) but I got a weird sense of haziness and confusion that I hated.  My pain doubled back an hour later and I didn&#39;t even have a giggly time.

VI am not a fan of this strain! The buds have a very odd appearance, and the taste is more chemical than anything. I didn&#39;t smoke enough to determine the effects as the taste was so unappealing (to my palate, anyway). :-/
