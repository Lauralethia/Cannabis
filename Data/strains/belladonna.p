VEh it wasnt the best in the world. I like their spoetnik #1 alot better than this: belladonna just didn&#39;t do it medicinally for me. The high was pretty trippy, but really not the most pleasurable effects. It brings with it a kind of prime evil bio sludge feel to the high and it does somewhat effect visual observations but its really a creepy type of high in my opinion and not very sativa leaning at all. I&#39;d say the effect was more like 60/40 indica leaning hybrid but without the indica body relaxation or the sativa euphoria thats normally in a 60/40 indica leaning hybrid strain like Critical, for example. This is probably due to the fact that there arent alot of THC crystals on the outside of belladonna in comparison to some of the strains ive seen..

VGreat strain! Really tasty bud, smells and tastes alot like peach!!! High yeilder, dense buds, and nice formation of the plant. For me it has more indica effects, not sativa as mentioned. Really strong body high, heavy couchlock effect. Overall great strain!

VBelladonna my dear!\u000aYou were so good last night, a beautiful combination of body relaxation and nice, consistent mind stimulation makes you perfect to enjoy any time of day. Your earthy buttery smell and outstanding orange hairs could make even the worst cotton mouth drool.\u000a\u000a9/10 Would recommend to a bud.

VPretty nice gentle strain; easy onset with a strong slow high; unusual flavour- smells like the cross it is, but the taste is very much its own.
