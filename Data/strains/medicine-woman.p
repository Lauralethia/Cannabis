VI really like this strain, really helped my body relax and a nice head high. I have chronic back pain, this really helps me. I take it at night and it helps me sleep all night.

VMedicine Woman: THC ? CBD ?\u000aFeeling of euphoria and creativity. Lackadaisical and happy. I feel I can either go for a run or lay back and watch a movie. Create the sistine chapel or write a novel. \u000aHeadaches are null and void which is a big deal since I get clusters! My hip feel absolutely wonderful. \u000a\u000aCons\u000aSlight Cotton mouth (but then what strains don&#39;t give you cotton mouth)

VThis one had me PAIN FREE but asleep 20 minutes after smoking. I&#39;d been smoking blackberry cream earlier on, which is an indica dominant strain but it was like these two strains were from the upside world haha. The sativa dominant put me down in short order, the indica (blackberry cream) made me really really happy &amp; relaxed but no couch lock or sleepiness. I loved them both, but for different reasons. This medicine woman one would be EXCELLENT for pain issues &amp; insomnia (at least for me) &amp; it&#39;s definitely some potent medicine. No anxiety at all. I was super content, not feeling any pain &amp; just wanted to crawl into bed &amp; catch up on some zzz&#39;s. But this is one I&#39;d put to the back of my stash to save for when I need powerful painkilling properties. It&#39;s definitely going to be my go to for that, without a doubt.

VMedicine Woman has great bag appeal and smells fantastic. I smoked a nice, fat jay and was able to still get work done.
