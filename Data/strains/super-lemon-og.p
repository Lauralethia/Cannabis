VI was disappointed by this strain. I hit a peak high in only 20-30 minutes and quickly mellowed out. Never felt much of a mind high, certainly more of a body high. It made me extremely dizzy. My smoke was unpleasantly harsh, possibly the harshest I&#39;ve had.\u000aOn the positives, the weed really relaxed me, I was giggly and very chatty. Good with others.\u000a4* Body, 2*Mind, 2.9* Potency (Out of 5*)

VFirst off... beautiful to look at under an 8x photo loop, and speaking of loop... I&#39;m looped. The smell is complex, rich, some petroleum hints, cep&#39;t earthier, more pine.. I could live in a forest of this, forever.. And oh baby, this mule has got some kick! Nice... I&#39;m a seasoned veteran, long years on the vap daily, plus an athlete... so lungs pull huge. This strain is so smooth. Nice body buzz, but the mind, untouched... no stupor, so for creative side of me... nice. Its why I even bother to review. Its the first strain in some time that&#39;s feels really nice and unique... and that&#39;s in high company..! Pun intended&#39;)... I&#39;m 20 minutes in and its still creeping, six pack of Guinness might have helped. All jokes aside, its a very sophisticated buzz... high class. What a nice balance... so Ill ride this for a bit and get a sense of time... then return, take a second vap drag... to finish the review.  (elapse time) Alright then, did some writing and then watched a couple episodes of Sponge Bob Square Pants..So the buzz, in the hour plus range.. Not bad for a pro.. Going back in to finish the grind. Second bake session picks up nicely, which is great, many strains cannot pick up where they left off. Not so here... I could easily go for a run, a walk, some X-Box, a nap... whatever, pretty open in the experience.  Oddly enough, this Super Lemon OG is a lot like Sponge Bob Square Pants, a tripped out good time all round. Always nice. Never mean. And knows what a true friend is...

VAlthough i had some problems with the taste (found it quite harsh when smoked with zig zag papers) but the effects make up for it. Intense effects to get you uplifted and more confident. I bought a nice amount of this strain when i visited the club and i found myself using it most when i knew i would be in social situations ( since it seemed to have worked amazingly with my anxiety/social anxiety)

VJust got 2 z of Super Lemon OG. 1 flower, 1 shatter. They both have an amazing dank floral/lemony/kushy smell and taste. The buds are green with a blueish tint and lots of yellow mixed in. The effects are very unique, giving a stronng mellowing body high, one that youd expect heavy couchlock to follow, but the haze genetics keep you from drifiting off. It was a high i had never felt before, and thats rare after smoking 15 years.(everyday, 2 to 5 new kinds a week, ive seen alot even in the anti weed state of NJ). The shatter was very nice, tasted unbelivable and the high was similar, but did weigh me down a bit more than the flower.

VTo say this stuff is stony would be an understatement. I keep losing my train of thought. Tingly body high, I feel couch locked, I could go to sleep but feel like staying up and reading is a fun option, too. Not my favorite strain. It&#39;s going to go on the &quot;You&#39;ll Do&quot; list, one of those strains you choose when your dispensary is out of everything you really wanted. I like it, it makes me cheerful, and I want to get lost in someone else&#39;s story. Also, I would NEVER smoke this before work. Just sayin&#39;...

VI got this from Portland Medicine Pot (Portland, OR), and was very pleased with the quality and effects.  Flower is dense and sticky with a nice lemony smell and taste (vaped).  Gave me a strong body high without making me too sleepy - perfect for painful, tense muscles.  Would not recommend for regular daytime use as it is rather relaxing, but it&#39;s excellent for evening use.  Also great if you want to take a nap during the day; I always wake up more refreshed when I use this!

VI just got this strain yesterday from Tweed and I was pretty excited to try it and man this strain does not dissapoint. It is an indica dominant hybride and you really feel the sedative effects right away but, its more of a euphoric classic heavy buzz with clear headedness. Very happy mood lifting strain I must say. anyone with any kind of anxiety ir depression should try this stuff. \u000avery lemony citrus taste and smell as well as smooth on the throat and lungs. going to be at the top of my 5 star list of amazing strains.

VBeing the 4th strain I&#39;ve ever tried, man I gotta tell ya, I did a lot of this. Probably more than I should&#39;ve. Now from a two-day experience of smoking this all day with a friend, I think I know a good amount about this strain to leave a review. (Btw I am not a regular stoner so I have no tolerance) The experience first started with me doing several hits of the pen which started fairly easy. Then as I did more, I began to cough. A cough that the strain gives you isn&#39;t very harsh to handle but once you start coughing, you should give it a quick break because continuing can make things go south. (At one point I did 5 hits without inhaling oxygen and I honestly wanted to die for a good 3 minutes). After 1-10 minutes, it starts with a slow but nice euphoria and/or body high like gravity has become slightly heavier. Then you will begin to feel the other effects like a creativity boost, possibly more energy, At low to medium doses this makes for a great time that is chill yet fun. You won&#39;t be couch locked though it might be a little bit more fun on the couch. Munchies isn&#39;t huge but it does happen. Again at low doses you can still function, your high is controllable and you can focus on specific things better. You could have a great time on your phone or space out, just depends on your mood which I love. Though this becomes much harder at higher doses, the higher the more psychedelic and in my opinion not very positive. Your vision will start to flicker and you will be able to imagine(not see but in your mind) weird patterns and fractals. In my experience, I started to see a series of photos, went to bed dreaming about them and woke up to them, still thinking about them. They aren&#39;t very memorable but they look extremely familiar. They are just random things like shapes and trees. Though I did remember my cousin became my uncle for a solid 5 minutes and then closed eye visuals and shit. Might sound cool but in my opinion was not fun. Do not overdo as it isn&#39;t very harsh but will ruin your night, and will leave you with a terrible hangover. Stick to a medium amount for a really great, euphoric high. Tastes pretty good, still prefer skywalker OG though. All in all would definitely do this again but I would avoid overdoing it.
