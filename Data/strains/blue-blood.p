Vso this stuff can be really, really potent. a couple months ago i tried an og blue cross that sent me into absolute outerspace everytime i smoked it! ive been smoking for 7 years and nothing has ever come close to the trippy effects. this stuff should really be looked into if you can aquire the pheno with 3:2 thc.cbd ratio. I think the other cannabinoids could have be a large factor in my perceived effects. my sample was not tested unfortunatly. so lets grow more

VLike that it was mellow and not harsh. The gentlemen who helped us at Green Valley Wellness in Talent was very nice and extremely helpful.  Recommended several different strains for anxiety and pain and I will defiantly be back for sure!!
