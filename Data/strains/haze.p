VThere is much debate as to wether or not Haze&#39;s original genotype still exists; I for one am a believer. Haze still has one last stronghold: New York City. The immense popularity of Haze in NYC  incentives farmers to plant haze despite the long flowering times and low yields associated with the variety. Haze is immediately recognizable by its uniquely spicy smell and taste accompanied by a speedy sub-psychedelic cerebral high that has never been replicated by any other haze variety. The closest extant strains to Original Haze are Neville&#39;s Haze and Panama Red.

VWITCH HAZE\u000aI&#39;ve been smoking &quot;1 is fun&quot; with my friend C.A recently (2-3 months). I&#39;ve really enjoyed myself and actually have experienced really profound, beautiful moments in my life. But.....Pink Haze AKA Witch Haze is and has been incorrectly advertised. This is currently my 2nd &quot;1 is fun&quot; with &quot;said strain&quot;.\u000aMy first experience caused me to question my mental health. I&#39;ve questioned many things in my life but never one so concerning. Long story short, my chihuahua told me inside jokes about my wife/his mom. Not funny when you&#39;re the only one holding a specific and particular chihuahua laughing at nothing or something but you don&#39;t actually know because you are now convinced that you are schizophrenic.........\u000aMy 2nd experience is currently happening, there are no chiuahuas but that doesn&#39;t mean the cat won&#39;t tell me things... Keep you posted\u000axo S

VI am someone who suffers from anxiety/depression/OCD and other health issues including some GI/digestive ailments and this strain is what the doctor ordered literally. No anxiety, just a nice even euphoric buzz and just real mellow high. Best strain ever for me it solves a lot of stress and anxiety related issues that other strains/rx meds don&#39;t and doesn&#39;t knock you out! And don&#39;t let the looks fool you the buds are a little looser than other strains out there and the smell is kind of grassy non invasive if not eve a little bit of a non weed smell even also but it gets the job done and well!! Its up there on my ratings chart with my OGK!

VPicked up a strain called &quot;hawiian haze&quot; at the local dispensary(as well as ak47, jack herrer, king kush, PK) and the haze was by far my favorite, unlike any previous strain i had tried, it left me with an overwhelming feeling of well being, psychadelic, almost a floating feeling, hard to explain, yet clear headed, thinking, and it was fairly long lasting, i am a daily smoker, and one joint lasted me over 6 hours(would re lite it and take a couple pulls and put it back out every couple hours or so), cured my back pain, and left me wanting more.... really tropical smell to it, some of the most smelly weed ive smoked, i put a half joint in the ashtray and it smelt so much i had to put it in a tupperware container. not as smelly when not burnt. ill be sure to pick up more the next time the dispensary gets it in. to date this was most likely my favorite strain i have tried. usually a kush smoker for pain and insomnia.

VThis review is on &#39;Santa Cruz&#39; Haze by Tj&#39;s Organic Provisions.  Eugene, OR.\u000a\u000aThe focal point of this strain for me was without a doubt the delicious sweet citrus terpene profile, similar to lemon heads candies.  This is a nice day time strain, positive thinking and cerebral effects lead the way.  While this batch tested at 23.47% THC it wasn&#39;t overly powerful but I believe that to be the strain.  This would be a nice choice if you want to stay medicated and awake but fully coherent.  8/10

VThis one embodies why I love cannabis. Creative, explosive, refreshing, elevating. My first experience with the straight haze was a handful of Pure Haze J\u2019s from Greenhouse in Amsterdam on arrival. I went back every day that week! It was the correlative of the experience and I\u2019ve smoked it ever since returning. I love all strains and experiences but this is one\u2019s special. Clearly, legendary for good reason.

V@reviewmaster &gt; \u201cI despise Haze with an absolute passion.\u201d\u000a\u000aRelax, it&#39;s not that serious. Cannabis is kinda like sex or pizza in that: when it&#39;s good, it&#39;s great; and when it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s still kinda good anyway. \u000a\u000a\u201cIt&#39;s flavor is less than what&#39;s to be desired as are the medicinal effects.\u201d &lt;-- for you. Personally, I love haze strains and much prefer an interesting headspace over a so-called \u201ccouch-lock\u201d high. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve been consuming cannabis for over 20 years now, and my theory is: the difference in effect from the opposite sides of the &quot;spectrum&quot; of cannabis high, if you will, simply isn&#39;t that profound. Yes, Haze is a sativa strain, but don&#39;t fool yourself into believing smoking Haze cannabis is anything at all like taking an actual stimulant compound, natural or man-made. Cannabis may at times, under the right circumstances (set, setting, subject, experience, tolerance all contribute here), act as a *mild* CNS stimulant, but it shouldn&#39;t be classified thusly for any taxonomical or practical purposes.\u000a\u000aTwo final thoughts: firstly, the haze strains I&#39;ve smoked, for example Super Silver Haze, taste wonderful to me, and I enjoy their effects as much as any other strain I&#39;ve smoked. Secondly, constructive criticism is fine, but please don&#39;t let yourself turn into an obnoxious weed snob. It&#39;s just not a good look.

The smell is very distinct, reminds me of a pair of leather shoes. The taste is hashy and earthy. The flowers were fluffy, sticky, dark green with flecks of purple. The high is very heady and stony.

VJust what I needed. I have not smoked for about a decade. I had pain, ADD, stomach Issues-IBS and fatigue my adrenal glands don&#39;t work anymore and was on many different pham meds. I made a decision that I would give natural a try. So far this stain has been good for me like the others have said it takes you to a enlightened happy place, my pain was gone and my stomach wasn&#39;t so intense anymore. I question myself whether this really worked but by late evening when the effects wore off I knew  that my pain was back my stomach muscles were cramping and I hadn&#39;t been so tired all day. I wanted to get medicated again but...you don&#39;t want to do this strain at night, you will be up. I did a small amount in a vape pen throughoutout the day since I was new to smoking again and easily paranoid, but in the small amounts I took no paranoia happened. Love this strain

VI tried many of the Haze hybrids,  like Amnesia, SSilver, SLemon, but first time just pure Haze. It became a fave.  The taste when vaped is truly like  candy, sweet and unique to Haze. Recognize it in other hybrids of her. The effects are cerebral yet that bit of indica,  keeps it from being too energetic. In fact its a very Hazey sativa,  LOL. Uplifting,  relaxing,  perfect for movies or gaming. Or hanging out. I love this strain.

VI am not an sativa fan, until now.   WOW! The original haze from Canna-Connoisers in Toronto is phenomenal.  I normally always smoke a gram at a time and I had to stop halfway through because the high was that amazing. I sat back and enjoyed it.   It was a happy and relaxed feeeling.  The bud was of excellent quality. This is a true sativa. I am so happy I followed the budtenders advice and tried it.  For me this sativa was relaxing and light, but I was also happy and this strain even made me crack a smile.  The taste was earthy and sweet, with hints of lemon or citrus and an overall herbal undertone.   This did not assist with pain, but did assist with my mood. I would suggest trying this if you are a daytime user looking for something enjoyable that wont make you tired.

VSmoked this for a period of a few weeks, out of joint, bowl, bong, and bubbler. Hits you quick, effects are not too hard but are very noticeable and turned into a great high. Unfortunately the effects don&#39;t last for a long period of time, only a few hours. To get the most out of this great strain, just smoke it bit by bit over the course of a few hours to get a good high going. Mangos can really help bring this strain out as well.

VGives a very nice relaxed and content high, definitely goes well with you somewhere to relax, very good night time strain for me. However, I was not a huge fan of the taste as it was a little too earthy for my liking. It also gave me quite a lot of anxiety and paranoia at points but overall not a terrible strain to be smoking.

VThis strain didn&#39;t have a strong scent to it like I hoped it would have. The trim job was also slacking a little and the medium sized nugs were dense to the touch. Once broken up it reminded me of a nice, fresh lemony scent. Although The effects didn&#39;t last to long for me after smoking this strain so I found myself smoking more &amp; more of it each time. I would gladly pass this strain up and look for something with stronger effects. seeing it is HAZE and it being so popular, maybe I would try it again in the future. \u2661 &amp; PEACE

VSativa &amp; creates a head-high. Hits you quickly; you will feel like your head&#39;s flying. Cause a bit of paranoia and anxiety at moments but is still very positive and happy. Relaxes the mind and definitely a strain recommended to newbies. Makes you tired and is very good to sleep off, but if not slept off, it may cause head aches. Kind of plain and &#39;hazey&#39; , with no fruitiness, but still a very nice &amp; original weed smell/taste. Could be a recommendation for those with depression and/or insomnia, but probably not the best on it&#39;s own for those with anxiety.

VBeen searching near and far for years, and about 15mins before the blizzard hit south jersey, i finally found it. Some orignal haze. A chance encounter with someone who had just harvested a indoor batch of orignal haze from clone. I was skeptical, but after catchin a pungent whiff in his driveway, i was excited. The buds were dusted with crystals and looked beefier than the haze i remember, but the smell was dead on. Catpissy lemony goodness. The long fluffy buds broke up easily and left a delicious pungent pissy taste in your nose with every hit. I was still not sure it was orignal haze, until the effects hit me, a rush of energitic euphoria covers your body and lifts your head off your neck. Your incredibly high, and clear headed at the same time. Walking outside had my eyes wide open taking in the bright colors. Definetly a classic.

VI fucking love haze. I am a skater and a musician and I find this strain really aids creativity and makes me super energetic. It is a very standard strain and it\u2019s maybe not worth ranting about which is why I have  given it four stars instead of five but it certainly deserves some praising. The taste is very earthy which I personally really like and I would recommend this strain to anybody who hasn\u2019t already tried it which honestly isn\u2019t many people. Everyone loves haze right hahaha.

Blue Dream is one of the most popular strains around, and to me it is a light-hearted yet potent strain deserving of its popularity. I compare it to good pop music. Super Silver Haze is a more hardcore cross, but Blue Dream is a reliable multi-use go-to for getting pretty high and happy and all that good stuff.

Being a lightweight, one joint and one bowl pack had me stoned, but we packed 4 bong packs 3 bowl packs and 3 joints. We were gone, i sat and ate a box of cheese-its for an hour and then was calling my friends different names. VERY strong strain, puts you right to sleep.

VWhen it comes to the actual high and medicinal benefits, haze is a 5 star strain. The reason I rate it a 3 is because I&#39;m all about taste. That being said I have a really picky taste. I found as a concentrate, it tasted very similar to MK Ultra which isn&#39;t even closely related. If you like that funky tangy unusual taste you will love it.

VThis strain gave me static hallucinations. Unlike an LSD or Mushroom hallucination where the hallucination is dynamic, changing, moving. Rather certain things; such as logs in a fire would appear to have a static non-moving image. I knew it was a log but I was seeing an intricate image on it that I knew was not really there. While that was enjoyable overall I found that this strain was far too trippy and emotionally unstable for me. I would not recommend it&#39;s use.

VI fucking love haze. I am a skater and a musician and I find this strain really aids creativity and makes me super energetic. It is a very standard strain and it\u2019s maybe not worth ranting about which is why I have  given it four stars instead of five but it certainly deserves some praising. The taste is very earthy which I personally really like and I would recommend this strain to anybody who hasn\u2019t already tried it which honestly isn\u2019t many people. Everyone loves haze right hahaha.

VI tried the Haze by Virtue Las Vegas and this is the second Sativa Ive tried and I really loved it. It gave me an instand head high but it wasnt overpowering. I did not get paronoid or anxious, which is a plus in my book. I actually sampled this strain and ended up purchasing it. I was relaxed but in a sense of Euphoria and it was amazing. It felt like the first time I smoked ever, which threw me for a loop because I was feeling great.

VHad some mids while in Amsterdam. It was a great, caffeine-like high. I felt super talkative and energetic. There was some anxiety there, but I was blazed (having that heart-racy feeling) and we got lost in the city.\u000a\u000aOn other days, smoked it while exploring outdoors. The high euphoric and energetic. It made me feel like a 12 year old while riding on bike trails. All of my typical joint pain faded. \u000a\u000aI would say be cautious if you get typical anxiety/paranoia with sativas. I had it under control, but I could see the high going south in certain doses or situations.\u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re looking for something to keep you awake, energetic, euphoric and giggly, Haze is a nice varietal.

VThey say OG Kush has the most recognizable and distinct smell and taste, but for me I can sniff out a good Haze cross from just as far. Blue Dream is one of the most popular strains around, and to me it is a light-hearted yet potent strain deserving of its popularity. I compare it to good pop music. Super Silver Haze is a more hardcore cross, but Blue Dream is a reliable multi-use go-to for getting pretty high and happy and all that good stuff.

VBeing from the UK, we only ever see Cheese. But I managed to get my hands on a half ounce of this stuff. Being a veteran Cheese smoker, the smell and taste were far beyond what I was expecting. \u000a\u000aI read a few reviews before I lit up and most people said it&#39;s very strong but I have to say that I ended up smoking twice as much as I normally would just to get high. \u000a\u000aOnce it hit me though I can say it was an enjoyable high, no couch lock like I&#39;m used to which was nice. In the mirror I looked noticeably higher than I normally do as well so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be using this too much during the day for work and such.

VI found it. This is my strain. Mostly for anxiety and depression. Because it obliterated it. It&#39;s very strong and am working on how much I should smoke. The stuff I got was only 13% THC so be careful. I also would say that this is a really strong one that new users could try it but be careful. If you are a new user you may want to try Super Silver Haze first. To put you on the right track.

VThis strain gave me static hallucinations. Unlike an LSD or Mushroom hallucination where the hallucination is dynamic, changing, moving. Rather certain things; such as logs in a fire would appear to have a static non-moving image. I knew it was a log but I was seeing an intricate image on it that I knew was not really there. While that was enjoyable overall I found that this strain was far too trippy and emotionally unstable for me. I would not recommend it&#39;s use.

We were gone, i sat and ate a box of cheese-its for an hour and then was calling my friends different names. VERY strong strain, puts you right to sleep.

VThis strain is a classic, and a mellow kind of high, which I enjoy during the daytime. It keeps me energized and happy, floating on cloud 9 without too much of a hard-hitting high. I&#39;m able to go through my everyday routine while smoking this strain with absolutely no drawbacks, except slight paranoia. It&#39;s more of a simple, classic strain, but I enjoy it tremendously.

VAmazing strain! I was immediately struck by the complex, pungent smell of this bud. I expected the taste to be similar and was not at all disappointed as I was met with one of the most distinct and individualistic flavors I have ever tasted (in general, not just bud). Adjectives I would use are spicy, sour and metallic, with dashes of peppermint and cinnamon. Even that barely approximates the bewildering taste of Haze! Highly recommended. High was potent but not overwhelming, pleasantly clear and full bodied. Not for kindergarten smokers!!!!

VI recently came across an Alaskan take on Haze called Ni kiski Haze and it blew my mind.. It was so overwhelmingly euphoric and then relaxing as the body high took over. It felt blissful but it was not get up and go bud. It is excellent if you want to melt happily into your sofa and watch a movie or listen to some good times. It worked well on pain as I have severe arthritis and it didn&#39;t make me raid the fridge. I wasn&#39;t sleepy, just completely relaxed and happy. If you are ever up north, we know a thing or two about the green.

I also highly recommend this for Smoking, Vaping, and to ingest as a Tea ! \u000aIf you find yourself a little spacey or too high or anxious just grab some Oral CBD Oil and or any other CBD product and it will balance out the affects of the THC.

The strain was bred to be a full-Sativa by the Haze brothers, but years and years of breeding this delicate strain has diluted the Sativa-dominance of  strain; however the Haze strain has always been, and will continue to be one of the more THC potent strains available.

VRusty Haze =Bubble n Squeek #1 F1 x Metal Haze\u000aMs Rusty is very enjoyable day time Sativa great morning starter for muscle spacisty and alertness.Picked up in Glendale AZ. 80/20 ratio just enough Indica to help with pain and tightness in back. Red Head Rusty seem&#39;s to have high CBN ratio as well the batch I picked up.\u000aTaste: Sweet/Silver/Grape/Haze pretty damn good underrated strain and out of the lime light do to her name.Ms Redhead Rusty is on point for sure.

V.. tried this first in Jersey. Bergenfield, just in case anyone is interested. anyway it is DEFINITELY DEFINITELY very potent. my uncle and I bought an 8th and I was on vacation for 5 days. lasted all five days and everyTime we smoked (twice a day, one mini blunt, half smoked each time). the high was tremendously deafening (in a good way).. very heavy. hard to concentrate. I had to drive my uncles BMW to a few places around town.. I was very focused. drove precisely perfect. went to the shores, took in the (so called) view. it&#39;s a very in depth, deep thought kind of nug. highly recommended if you ever come across it!

VNice but nothing special to be honest. I would rather prefer Hawaiian snow, Super Lemon Haze and Super Silver Haze cause they are stronger. If you like a smooth smoke with little buzz- this strain is it.

VShe smells leathery and densely herbaceous. Like a face full of sage. The smoke is rich in color and odor. The high is euphoric and cerebral, almost enchanting. This is some mystical stuff.

VI liked this strain OK. It did make me sleepy though. This strain is excellent if you&#39;re having trouble sleeping. Not much of a social type of high for me. \u000a\u000a

VThis weed has a very earthy and not as pungent smell to it. When inhaled, it will make you cough and it will taste like earth and coffee slightly. It will give you a head high that can lead to a head ache. 2.5/5 its okay

VHaze is a staple in the ny weed world, haze is one of the most common strains around, i enjoy it, but i dont think i really appreciate it because its so common, and the high doesnt really compare to that of alot of other shit that comes around, super fluffy thoooo, pb

VStain is OK, dense,hazey taste. The problem is this Veganic and organic statements, you can easily tell when marijauna is fertilizer burnt and this was. To even call your grass remotely clean or organic or Veganic &quot; IT SHOULD SIMPLY BURN WITH A WHITE ASH&quot;. Not barely burn with black unburned pot ashes, yuck it&#39;s all burning everyone&#39;s throat out and people are sick of it. It&#39;s the greedy growers that only care about money. Out of dozens of strains i&#39;ve tried from here that claimed to be Organic or veganic and only a couple were grown properly and burned and tasted right.
