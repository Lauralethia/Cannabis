VVaped it. This strain definitely makes you feel energetic and happy. Unlike the hybrids and indica, this sativa seemed to increase my focus making it easier to concentrate during conversations. There wasn&#39;t much of a body high and the come down didn&#39;t leave me  sleepy, but only slightly groggy.\u000aI&#39;ll update after I&#39;ve tried it as an edible.

VGreat sativa to smoke before the gym or something you need to get done. Earthy taste with a piney sweet smell. The high is a head high with a body high after. Great for a person with anxiety or nervousness or stress.

Vthis strain is very cerebral and straight to the dome. Sit back and wait after your first bong rip. it might be all you need to feel this strains full medicinal effects. very pretty bud and potent, the smell is that of sweet strawberry taffy

VMy friend introduced me to this strain and I can honestly say it has helped me think a little clearer and more logically. As far as taste goes, you can really hit the sweet notes if you burn long enough. The taste is smooth and soothing and it gives you almost this candied aftertaste.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s an uppity, so if you&#39;re feeling down or you want to get up and do something; indulge yourself to this treat!

VI&#39;m not a big fan of Sativa&#39;s but I must say that I was not let down by any amount, I got it for a the reason to help with the day to day and it did exactly as I hoped and expected by having the ability to cross reference reviews and lineage and the scientific footprint thing which is great to try to dial in to find the perfect bud for you. Super good bud.

Vone of the best strains I&#39;ve had to date, not recommended for beginners, it&#39;s had a very pungent fruity skunky smell. Very hard hitting after the first rip both bodily and cerebral. definitely a good daytime strand if you can handle yourself.

VQuick acting after smoke, awesome taste, earthy and herb like , makes you want to smoke another bowl  just from the those two aspects. Verbal clarity and talkative also right off the bat , and a great feeling of calm happiness with incentive to get things done . Will def be restocking this in my medicine &quot;pantry&quot;.
