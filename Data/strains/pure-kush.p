VThis is the perfect strain for indica users. Just perfect - gets your head into that space where problems don&#39;t exist and gravity&#39;s rules seem to break, and that&#39;s just for the head high. The body high is concentrated in the chest, from where it radiates slightly into the shoulders and neck. Mmm. It&#39;s also so wonderful at battling insomnia that it may as well be a pharmaceutical sleep aid only without the displeasure of dealing with big pharma. In my area (Detroit), I&#39;ve been able to find only one single dispensary that sells it: Puff Detroit on 8 Mile. They don&#39;t always have it in, which is a terrible pity because this is the sort of weed that all others should aspire to be. Beware, though - I use it just before sleep - doing otherwise will melt your brain as your attention span sinks to sub-zero levels. If you see this anywhere, or have a caregiver that is able to grow it, jump at the chance to get some!

VStrong for sure this smooth tasting indica has hints of lemon and skunk under its earthy tones. While the initial buzz goes to the brain the after effects are a soothing body relaxation making this an excellent pain relief choice. It also stimulates appetite and is perfect before bed

It&#39;s not just great for sedating and pain it&#39;s also great recreationally  to chill out and talk about weird crap with your friends.

VI work at a cannabis dispensary in in Oregon. I ALWAYS suggest this indica for my customers when they are looking for pain relief, munchies or sleep aid. GREAT for all 3! Did I mention that EVERY customer I suggest it to has come back and raves on how much they loved it? Try it for yourself. it&#39;s my favorite indica in our whole shop and ours isn&#39;t even on our top shelf. hope this helps

V5/5 - a Kush Lover&#39;s fine wine!\u000aPure Kush is one potent indica. Personal nug I picked up weighed in at 3.6 and was tested at 24% THC.\u000aA favorite of pain sufferers, Pure Kush\u2019s strength will leave you relaxed, buzzed, and mildly sedated as you ease away your pain effortlessly.\u000aThe &quot;kush\u201d aroma, is unlike any other, in that it is extremely pungent and skunky, beyond SFV, Platinum, OG, you name it. \u000aUpon first taste, it may have slightly sativa-like effects and create a pleasant pressure in the head and face. A mild state of euphoria, that&#39;s accompanied with head-heavy sensations. \u000aLooovvvveeee it! 5/5

VAnyone who likes indica strains has to give pure kush a try. Tasted like og kust to me as it is just a pure indica phenotype of og kush. Best of the bestfor pain, neaseu, and insomnia. The only othe pure indicas as strong and as effective on pain was grand daddy purp and Northern lights, maybee white widow as well. But pure kush is best strain for pain bar none.

VThe high with this strain was otherworldly. It starts with a pressure at the top of your head. It then melts/spreads to your face and then slowly adds a body high. REALLY skunky as well. It was almost in my tops with gg#4, Skywalker, and the edible high layers, but the dryness is no joke man. Extreme cotton mouth, and my eyes were so dry i could hear my eyelids dragging across them as I drink. It killed my pain, but i felt like the crypt keeper afterwards &#128514; still it was worth it. Just make sure you have nothing to do afterwards.

Vthis strain is very potent since I used only a tiny nugget to make a &#39;trinidad roll on&#39;. I experienced a &#39;head&#39; in about 3 minutes of smoking. The body feels very tingly and you feel very lazy. Dry mouth occurred very quickly and the hunger soon sets in. Closing your eyes makes you  feel very dizzy...... and i was glue to my bed for an hour before going into a deep sleep....very weird and scary dreams which led me to wake up and feel paranoid.

VI gave this a low rating, not because of it&#39;s strength but because of it&#39;s effect.  This is one of the hardest indicas I&#39;ve ever had.  After a very small amount, I couldn&#39;t move off my couch and needed to sleep.  And I did for about 10 hours.  There is nothing wrong with Pure Kush if you need sleep.  If you try this for anything more than that, you&#39;re on your own.

VPicked this up from my go to local store Jardin today along with the same companies (Green and Gold Supply) Sour Kosher (which is 5 star and I would gladly review but isn\u2019t listed here); grabbed an 1/8th if each.  I try and find something new to try every week if I can but everyone has staples, such as berry anything for me or old school Bubba; current favorite is Skunkberry. \u000a\u000aThis is my first time trying this strain and purchased it based off of reviews here and strain characteristics documented, however, they may have grown a more Sativa pheno this go around as I was left rather underwhelmed which is sad as the jar notes it as Limited Edition for them.  Hopefully not a forgotten edition as it has major potential. \u000a\u000aBag appeal on it is solid thought not a lot of trichomes but the buds are incredibly dense and hairs abundant so don\u2019t get me wrong this is far from bad.  The smell and flavor profile is also solid as soon as you open the jar with the classic kush smell to a tasty clean and earthy profile with a touch of that piney background.  Everything was 9/10 at this point. \u000a\u000aHowever, that is where I kind of just went \u2018meh\u2019.  I vaped one full bowl at 355, 365, 386, and 392 and let things linger.  Obviously the lower temperatures brought out the flavors, those terpene profiles and goodness and it did produce a decent high.  However the high left me wondering when it was going to kick in.  I would feel it behind the eyes as I was holding the vapor but it never really lasted.  \u000a\u000aThe high I did get was more just, yup, you\u2019re high.  As noted perhaps this was a bunk grow season and their next harvest will be better or perhaps it is better smoked but for vaping, meh.\u000a\u000a6/10 being generous, seemed like high school joints high.  Sorry to be blunt (puntastic) as I know these are local guys but trial and error is where it\u2019s at and look forward to re-reviewing this in the future.  I wish I could review your Sour Kosher on here because, damn, now that is on another level, a new solid favorite of mine.

VA.P.C.C. - 1/8th for $60.\u000a\u000aI watched Wall Street 2 on this. 2 homies and I sparked a blunt of this prior to the movie - this stuff tasted fantastic. It tasted, well, pure.\u000a\u000aIt lacks the pine-sol taste and smell of OG, but it makes up for it by carrying a rich, deep aroma that lingers in your nose. I don&#39;t remember too much about this weed, as I smoked this a week ago, but it was very good Kush.\u000a\u000aGreat for relaxing and unwinding. I would not smoke this before I hit up a club.

VThe Pure Kush I am evaluating I picked up from GreenHouse Centrum in Amsterdam, so that is the perspective this is based on.\u000a\u000aWhen I asked to see this strain, on immediate inspection there were smaller to medium-sized buds with specks of dark green on a whitish light-green background with very few orange stigmas. I smelled it, and that is what sealed the deal (aside from the fact that it was the most premium flower they had on their menu).\u000a\u000aOn closer visual inspection, I came to appreciate just how intricate this flower was. The first word that came to mind was, \u2018delicate\u2019 when considering the overall texture and character of this strain (or at least the batch I had). These were very soft flower buds that left trails of glistening trichomes everywhere they came into contact and were slightly dense, but still soft, and definitely sticky upon some seconds into manually grinding the flowers.\u000a\u000aSmell: pure\u2026 Kush. It has a smell that is, indeed, reminiscent of something that is the very bare backbone of all the Kush strains out there. Sweet, floral, creamy, nutty, spicy, incensy, peppery, very lightly like lavender and wood, the profile of this flower strain is complex yet offers a true expression of an aroma that can clearly be called a, \u2018parent\u2019 strain of all other Kushes even if this is merely the result of similarity of cellular/genetic aspects between strains leading to phenotypic similarities and overlap as opposed to an actual closer, familial genetic relation that can be mapped with respect to reasoning incorporating, \u2018family size\u2019 (i.e., coincidence vs. the result of being closely connected on a genetic lineage diagram). This is definitely what can be considered as an, \u2018Original\u2019.\u000a\u000aTaste: Kush, Kush, Kush: floral and sweet with a notable pungency and a mild hint of pine. Smooth, rich, full-bodied and pleasurable to inhale for sure \u2013 this is when some of the softness and creaminess comes through onto the palate, throat and down the airway. There is a definite kick on inhalation telling you this is notable flower being intaken. Exhalation highlights the creaminess and smoothness with floral notes and secondary sweetness with pungency.\u000a\u000aEffects: relaxing, calming, clean, full, deep, fully permeating, intense and persisting euphoric pleasure in small to moderate quantities. Sedative, markedly lingering and relentless, \u2018stone\u2019 in larger quantities. Though there is a milder cerebral component to this strain that lasts throughout the duration of its course-of-effect, one may find their entire body numb and that all aches and pains are completely relieved. I mention this because the level of efficacy I am describing, by my understanding, at least equals that of morphine without, obviously, the ramifications associated with opioids. One may or may not need to sit down upon intaking this strain; my thighs did get numb after a quarter of a gram, but I don\u2019t know if that would apply to everyone. Pure Kush is definitely a quality strain that I consider as one of the top contenders I have had to-date.\u000a\u000aOverall: a top-notch strain that, literally, makes my mouth water when I think of it. This is a flower that those with more grounding in Cannabis may be able to find a deeper appreciation for.\u000a\u000aWould I buy it again? By the kilogram.\u000a\u000aRecommend to Connoisseurs and Sommeliers? Yes! And to Sommeliers: could you please put more of this strain on the market(s)? I think this is definitely one that may be good to maintain as an, &#39;Original&#39; as well as do several renditions of as was and is the case with O.G. Kush..\u000a\u000aRecommend to first-timers and/or inexperienced consumers? Yes.

Vapor was pretty rough and astrigent.  Each person trying it coughed.  High was pretty middle of the road indica high -- body numbing, relaxing, spacey -- but I was expecting a little more effect after trying Bubba Kush the day before which blew my mind.

VThe strength of this strain is what makes it a paramount top shelf med. Like GDP this powerful Indica is not to be taken lightly. Wow. For me the effects are strong pain relief, couch-lock, sleepiness, and I make sure to have some munchies on hand. Great for insomnia. Wake and bake on this and by 10am you&#39;ve had a good day haha!Easy 5/5 give it a try you won&#39;t be disappointed.

VNot the most enjoyable kush out there in my opinion, but it&#39;s still a great generic strain to have around. Pure Kush has a piney, zesty smell to it, much like it&#39;s other kush cousins. It has frosty dense buds, and is a light green color. Pure Kush is great for winter, when arthritis is problematic and staying inside is a must. It will leave you highly relaxed but will leave you able to do things like cook or change the channel on the TV, as long as you don&#39;t smoke too much. Overall, Pure Kush is a basic but heavy high and is a good indica strain.

VPicked this up from my go to local store Jardin today along with the same companies (Green and Gold Supply) Sour Kosher (which is 5 star and I would gladly review but isn\u2019t listed here); grabbed an 1/8th if each.  I try and find something new to try every week if I can but everyone has staples, such as berry anything for me or old school Bubba; current favorite is Skunkberry. \u000a\u000aThis is my first time trying this strain and purchased it based off of reviews here and strain characteristics documented, however, they may have grown a more Sativa pheno this go around as I was left rather underwhelmed which is sad as the jar notes it as Limited Edition for them.  Hopefully not a forgotten edition as it has major potential. \u000a\u000aBag appeal on it is solid thought not a lot of trichomes but the buds are incredibly dense and hairs abundant so don\u2019t get me wrong this is far from bad.  The smell and flavor profile is also solid as soon as you open the jar with the classic kush smell to a tasty clean and earthy profile with a touch of that piney background.  Everything was 9/10 at this point. \u000a\u000aHowever, that is where I kind of just went \u2018meh\u2019.  I vaped one full bowl at 355, 365, 386, and 392 and let things linger.  Obviously the lower temperatures brought out the flavors, those terpene profiles and goodness and it did produce a decent high.  However the high left me wondering when it was going to kick in.  I would feel it behind the eyes as I was holding the vapor but it never really lasted.  \u000a\u000aThe high I did get was more just, yup, you\u2019re high.  As noted perhaps this was a bunk grow season and their next harvest will be better or perhaps it is better smoked but for vaping, meh.\u000a\u000a6/10 being generous, seemed like high school joints high.  Sorry to be blunt (puntastic) as I know these are local guys but trial and error is where it\u2019s at and look forward to re-reviewing this in the future.  I wish I could review your Sour Kosher on here because, damn, now that is on another level, a new solid favorite of mine.

VI gave this a low rating, not because of it&#39;s strength but because of it&#39;s effect.  This is one of the hardest indicas I&#39;ve ever had.  After a very small amount, I couldn&#39;t move off my couch and needed to sleep.  And I did for about 10 hours.  There is nothing wrong with Pure Kush if you need sleep.  If you try this for anything more than that, you&#39;re on your own.

VIt may just be an old batch, but it was super dry. I know the curing was done decently because the smoke was smooth and tasty, and the ash was white as well. I think the stem to flower ratio was a bit on the stemmy side. it could&#39;ve also just been handled a bit. It definitely had that mushy smell to it, real earthy and pungent with skunky undertones. the bud structure was of your typical indica structure, squat dense little nuggets. Good smoke for right before bed time.

VPicked some of this up recently.  Tight buds were mostly tan with muted green.  Aroma was piney and peppery with menthol.   Taste was like a clean fresh hay and grass.  Vapor was pretty rough and astrigent.  Each person trying it coughed.  High was pretty middle of the road indica high -- body numbing, relaxing, spacey -- but I was expecting a little more effect after trying Bubba Kush the day before which blew my mind.

Vthis is in top 3 kush strains. \u000a\u000awhen I was able to grow this strain out yields were FANTASTIC.  4 zips off of a 3 foot plant and 8 off a 4.5 foot plant. \u000a\u000athe buds are dense and sound like velcro when torn apart (at least when I grew it) and they reek of skunk and pine with a hint of tar.\u000a\u000aI have consumed this strain in every way imaginable and any way you go about it you will end up on the couch  (or bed) hungry as all Holy hell and wanting just one more toke before you take a nice long nap.\u000a\u000anot a strain to pass up.

VReally strong indica. It will punch you strongly, i promise. Don&#39;t smoke if you are a beginner, this weed does not forgive. Flowery bucket in the mouth, clear and woody (sandalo). Just for sleeping, or better, just to die in your bed without space/time consciousness. Enjoy the space, great with chill and instrumental music. This weed has something more than others, i can&#39;t explain but everything is perfect in a relative measure. Great hit, stay with God. :)

VThe Pure Kush I am evaluating I picked up from GreenHouse Centrum in Amsterdam, so that is the perspective this is based on.\u000a\u000aWhen I asked to see this strain, on immediate inspection there were smaller to medium-sized buds with specks of dark green on a whitish light-green background with very few orange stigmas. I smelled it, and that is what sealed the deal (aside from the fact that it was the most premium flower they had on their menu).\u000a\u000aOn closer visual inspection, I came to appreciate just how intricate this flower was. The first word that came to mind was, \u2018delicate\u2019 when considering the overall texture and character of this strain (or at least the batch I had). These were very soft flower buds that left trails of glistening trichomes everywhere they came into contact and were slightly dense, but still soft, and definitely sticky upon some seconds into manually grinding the flowers.\u000a\u000aSmell: pure\u2026 Kush. It has a smell that is, indeed, reminiscent of something that is the very bare backbone of all the Kush strains out there. Sweet, floral, creamy, nutty, spicy, incensy, peppery, very lightly like lavender and wood, the profile of this flower strain is complex yet offers a true expression of an aroma that can clearly be called a, \u2018parent\u2019 strain of all other Kushes even if this is merely the result of similarity of cellular/genetic aspects between strains leading to phenotypic similarities and overlap as opposed to an actual closer, familial genetic relation that can be mapped with respect to reasoning incorporating, \u2018family size\u2019 (i.e., coincidence vs. the result of being closely connected on a genetic lineage diagram). This is definitely what can be considered as an, \u2018Original\u2019.\u000a\u000aTaste: Kush, Kush, Kush: floral and sweet with a notable pungency and a mild hint of pine. Smooth, rich, full-bodied and pleasurable to inhale for sure \u2013 this is when some of the softness and creaminess comes through onto the palate, throat and down the airway. There is a definite kick on inhalation telling you this is notable flower being intaken. Exhalation highlights the creaminess and smoothness with floral notes and secondary sweetness with pungency.\u000a\u000aEffects: relaxing, calming, clean, full, deep, fully permeating, intense and persisting euphoric pleasure in small to moderate quantities. Sedative, markedly lingering and relentless, \u2018stone\u2019 in larger quantities. Though there is a milder cerebral component to this strain that lasts throughout the duration of its course-of-effect, one may find their entire body numb and that all aches and pains are completely relieved. I mention this because the level of efficacy I am describing, by my understanding, at least equals that of morphine without, obviously, the ramifications associated with opioids. One may or may not need to sit down upon intaking this strain; my thighs did get numb after a quarter of a gram, but I don\u2019t know if that would apply to everyone. Pure Kush is definitely a quality strain that I consider as one of the top contenders I have had to-date.\u000a\u000aOverall: a top-notch strain that, literally, makes my mouth water when I think of it. This is a flower that those with more grounding in Cannabis may be able to find a deeper appreciation for.\u000a\u000aWould I buy it again? By the kilogram.\u000a\u000aRecommend to Connoisseurs and Sommeliers? Yes! And to Sommeliers: could you please put more of this strain on the market(s)? I think this is definitely one that may be good to maintain as an, &#39;Original&#39; as well as do several renditions of as was and is the case with O.G. Kush..\u000a\u000aRecommend to first-timers and/or inexperienced consumers? Yes.

VA.P.C.C. - 1/8th for $60.\u000a\u000aI watched Wall Street 2 on this. 2 homies and I sparked a blunt of this prior to the movie - this stuff tasted fantastic. It tasted, well, pure.\u000a\u000aIt lacks the pine-sol taste and smell of OG, but it makes up for it by carrying a rich, deep aroma that lingers in your nose. I don&#39;t remember too much about this weed, as I smoked this a week ago, but it was very good Kush.\u000a\u000aGreat for relaxing and unwinding. I would not smoke this before I hit up a club.

VThis strain is amazing for anxiety and insomnia. It helps slow down your thought process while maintaining a slowly encompassing euphoric rush in your head, followed by your body. As soon as your mind starts slowing and clearing, your body starts to enter a tolerable couch lock while relieving any joint pains and aches.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t recommend making any plans for the rest of the day if you decide to try this out. It&#39;s not a sledge hammer high, but a slow lasting, yet potent high. It also gives you moderate munchies and read eyes. \u000a\u000aAn evening strain with a lot of medical benefits as well as providing a very classic euphoric high accompanying getting stoned. \u000a\u000aTaste: Through a vape, it&#39;s quite smooth and the slinky aroma isn&#39;t present in the taste. It&#39;s predominantly earthy with a hint of pine. The exhale can be smooth but can vary to a medium harshness. \u000a\u000aAppearance: Since it&#39;s a Kush, I was quite happy with the light vibrant tones of the leaves as it transitions to darker shades. The trichomes and kief that cover this bud make it seem as if it was generously powder coated. \u000a\u000aSmell: Pine/Skunky, but a tad earthy. Basically, it smells like weed, but pleasant enough for even the most virgin of noses.

VThis is definitely in my top five all time best indicas list. For starters, when using your grinder, you&#39;ll notice an intense amount of thick, cheesy, dusty broken down bud. I had a motorcycle accident a couple months ago, and instead of taking the pills, this strain has helped me like none other. The high is happy, euphoric, but not stoner lazy. I almost want to say it starts off like a sativa, but rather be jittery, you&#39;re chill but motivated and more willing to do things. You have to try this strain. Btw, im not a grower, strictly a daily smoker. \u000a\u000aPeace

VI grew this and harvested a bit early to get a bit of a sativa kick, and it&#39;s a very strong-smelling strain that delivers a fantastic behind-the-eyes high that lasts for hours. Harvesting it a bit early for that sativa kick helped, I could smoke and I wasn&#39;t totally locked down, but I still got the relaxed body high it normally provides.\u000a\u000aDefinitely worth a try!

VJust picked up some pure og today and looked up some more info: \u000aPure OG strain is a classic OG with a fresh fuel-like smell, smooth smoke, and great OG flavor. Pure OG is a San Fernando Valley (SFV) OG Kush F4 IBL (inbred line).\u000a\u000aAn IBL is a genetically homogeneous strain that grows uniformly from seed. When you cross two different IBL strains for the first time, it is called the F1 generation. When you cross two of the same F1 hybrid (inbreed), it is called the F2 generation. The process of selective inbreeding must continue at least until the F4 to stabilize the recurrently selected traits. When you cross two specimens of an IBL variety, you get more of the same, because an IBL is homozygous, or true breeding for particular traits.\u000a\u000aPure OG generally creates a body high that is relaxing and medicinal. Pure OG has higher CBD than THC equals a much heavier, sleepy type of high, that is good for a variety of medical problems.

VI&#39;m not functional right away after smoking this. I don&#39;t like driving on it unless I can chill for a bit. Safety First!\u000a\u000athat being said its a great long lasting high. I&#39;d suggest getting this for a Netflix marathon or gaming sesh. overall strong, tastes good and really gets the job done.
