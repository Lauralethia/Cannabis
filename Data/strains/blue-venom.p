Vblue venom completely surprised me. once I heard what it was bred from I needed to try it. my favorite part of vaping it was the frostiness after I exhale similar to ice queen, it&#39;s always refreshing. the smell has a very strong sweet and berry scent which I enjoy. I sometimes just sniff the jar just to smell that scent again. the high is relaxing and easily lulls you to sleep. this is more of a daytime flower, however from my experience if I do another bowl pack I start to get dizzy which is my least favorite side effect. one round is my preferred amount.\u000a

VVery likely the greatest high I&#39;ve ever had.\u000aIt doesn&#39;t kick in until about two minutes after inhale (through a bong with an ash catch and a perc), but my friends and I all agree that it&#39;s some of the best weed we&#39;ve ever had.\u000aFor me, the thing that distinguishes Blue Venom from all other weed is that after you smoke it you feel as if the place you are at that moment is exactly where you&#39;re supposed to be, and there&#39;s nowhere you&#39;d rather be then where you are at that moment.

VGood Meds. Rolls in slow, but hangs around for a while with right amount relaxation to kill the pain. But not to the point of couch lock. Higher doses can produce a mildly trancy effect, so beware of dosage. All around, great for use day or evening for normal activities around the house or sharing with other patients. Oh! A word before you dose.......have plenty of drinks ready, this is thirsty stuff.
