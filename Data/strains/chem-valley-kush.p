VChem Valley is a really nice sativa leaning strain that I picked up at Panacea on Sandy. It was a nice energy giver that made me feel really nice. I jumped up and cooked dinner and got ready for Agents of Shield. Smoked another bowl and had a great time escaping reality for a few. This is one of the nicest highs I&#39;ve had yet here in Portland.

Vgood strain for stress relief on the go. I was expecting a lil more of the kush in the taste but had more of a chemdawg taste... Which isn&#39;t a bad thing tho. The high is rather clear headed and productive without couchlock or paranoia for me. &#128513;

VEasily one of my favorite strains. Despite being an indica and having the #1 effect be sleepiness, I find this to be a very controllable high. If you smoke this and get up and get moving you&#39;ll get a ton of work done and have a bunch of fun while doing it, but if you sit down and just chill out then you&#39;ll get super sleepy and have the most peaceful sleep ever.

VThis is a Sativa-Dominant strain (85% Sativa - 15% Indica). This strain is a cross between: SFV OG and Chem Dawg (2 very potent strains). Strong aromas and tastes like lemon Pledge furniture polish will be noticed.  On a scale of 1-10 for potency, this should be about a 9.4. This strain should not be passed up. Very great!

VI&#39;m not a fan. I suffer from chronic migraines and other body pain issues and smoking CVK is like throwing lighter fluid on the fire. Its a very heavy stone and really amps up any pain I&#39;m having. And if I wasn&#39;t already in pain before smoking, there&#39;s a pretty good chance I will be after. I also seem to get a hangover from it. \u000a\u000aI smoked this for quite a while since it was very accessible for me before figuring out what was going on. The flavor is also kind of intense, but not in a good way. Its heavy on the tar and diesel flavor.\u000a\u000aOn a positive note, it pretty much obliterated any anxiety I might have.

VI&#39;m not a fan. I suffer from chronic migraines and other body pain issues and smoking CVK is like throwing lighter fluid on the fire. Its a very heavy stone and really amps up any pain I&#39;m having. And if I wasn&#39;t already in pain before smoking, there&#39;s a pretty good chance I will be after. I also seem to get a hangover from it. \u000a\u000aI smoked this for quite a while since it was very accessible for me before figuring out what was going on. The flavor is also kind of intense, but not in a good way. Its heavy on the tar and diesel flavor.\u000a\u000aOn a positive note, it pretty much obliterated any anxiety I might have.

VReal heavy hitter, very fragrant. Picked this up as a pre-roll and was ready for bed in no time! Great de-stresser.

VNot impressed, this was supposed to be a top shelf strain, and I sorely regret buying it. Possibly one of the least exciting strains I&#39;ve encountered. Pretty much did nothing for me.

VMore brown than green with an odd aftertaste, not unpleasent though. High lasts long enough if you just want to lay down for a bit but thats about it
