VI&#39;ve never tried the Lemon Alien Dawg before, but it sounded too fun to pass up!\u000a\u000a-Smell:  It has a nice earthy and skunky smell like good bud will, but it had a savory scent to it that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on but it makes it truly complex.\u000a\u000a-Look:  The buds appear to be a brighter green than normal until you realize that it is covered in trichomes.\u000a\u000a-Taste:  It has a great earthy and skunky taste with a little something extra that I can&#39;t put my finger on.  It leaves a refreshing taste on the palate, but I wouldn&#39;t say it had lemon notes\u000a\u000a-Feeling:  Right away, I feel a nice body buzz.  I also feel clarity in my mind despite obviously feeling the effects.\u000a\u000aConclusion:  Honestly, this was a plant that surprised me.  I was expecting okay herb and I honestly really enjoyed it.  If you love being active, I think you&#39;d enjoy this strain as well.

VThis is some of the most gorgeous trichome covered delicious looking bud I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of smoking. Upon opening the bag I was slapped in the face with a strong lemon smell with hints of sour. The buds themselves are literally covered in crystals as well as long red hairs. The high leans more toward Indica but definitely not a sedating high, more of a zone out to conspiracy theory videos on YouTube kind of high. First time smoking this strain, now forever one of my favorites.

VStrain: Lemon Alien Dawg\u000aTHC: Unknown\u000aCBD: Unknown\u000aGrower: Tom\u000aLocation found: OMMP trade at Freddy\u2019s parking lot\u000aDate acquired: 1.30.16\u000aWeight: 28.7g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: A slight Kush aroma with a hint of lemons. Neither are overwhelming but it is pleasant. \u000aLook: Good sized, solid nugs when squeezed they were dense. Oregon trim to the \u2018T.\u2019\u000aTaste: The Kush overruled the lemony smells. The lemons were still present in the first hit but for all the hyper lemon tasting strains out there, this was not a top tasting one. Enjoyable mix of flavors.\u000aRecommendation for medicine: It was good to slow the world down a bit. A good relaxing high that intensified as I moved on through the day. Moderately good for pain relief for me. I will be finding a better representation of this strain to give it a better shot!

VThis strain is fantastic. Pungent smell with lemon and hints of Chemdawg. When the nugs are broken apart the skunky smell becomes even more apparent revealing its Chemdawg and Lemon Kush genetics in the smell alone. Batch that I picked up is 26% CBD and 24% THC, very easy smoking out of both a dry pipe or bong. Strong lemon flavor when smoked with a subtle kush after taste that lingers in your nostrils. Very relaxed high that can accompany you on whatever activity you have planned,whether its being glued to your chair or goin for hiking trip.

VI have to give this strain 3 stars only because I believe that the growers that cultivated this strain dropped the ball. I\u2019ve tried this strain 3 different times and each time I\u2019ve had the same experience, a nice light high that makes me feel calm, relaxed, and focused. The problem is that when the high goes away, it happens suddenly like it\u2019s sucked out of me and it\u2019s very noticeable. Also the high has only lasted about 1hr or so which was also pretty disappointing as well. \u000aAgain I personally feel that my negative experiences were more due to how the strain was cultivated. I would love to try it again.

VSneaky quick high! Gorgeous,  frosty, sticky bud.\u000a Not tooo strong,  but just the right hit made me feel like I was in a 7up commercial in a great way. A lovely balance of body soothing indica which feels like a slo-motion time machine and the peachy keen sativa gives just enough delightful attitude boost without jitters or worries. If I could drink right now I&#39;d be pairing some gin and tonic with this bud for a delicious crossfade.
