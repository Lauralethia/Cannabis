VI tried Stardawg Guava several months ago and it&#39;s nice to see this strain on here now. This strain is a hybrid that definitely leans more sativa. Stardawg Guava has a diesel and earth like aroma. While the flavor is similar to the aroma, there is a gentle grassiness under all of it. I found her to to give me a mellow head high and became relaxed and sleepy when she started wearing out. Overall, a very good strain.

VDamn! Can&#39;t take it out of the bottle, The Smell: the top pops off to reveals a tar and pine smell very unique very different from everything I have ever smelled tar is very specific different than diesel, diesel has more a harsher tone.\u000aThe Effect &amp; Taste: Stardawg Guava kicks me in the face! Like a round house kick from Chuck Norris; heavy happy uplifting emotions like a rocketship blasting off into space like Team Rocket XD. Pine grass w/ that herbal taste tones of grass on the end notes. \u000aThe Structure: Crescendo-ing the top looks like the best mint green Christmas tree with a fox tail star at the top, snizap, crackled and pizzop off the bud docent budge the stem most respectful bud! \u000aHappy no longer depressed, very concentrating helps with glaucoma, ADHD, ADT, My Schizophrenia and mood disorders w/ Asthma, Scotopia (don&#39;t need shades to see), and learning language, I can understand my text better and psychology terms Desserts spelled backwards is stressed think about that for a second sugar causes more stress. Recommend for those that need energy too, really high THC 28%! Recommended for those that need something heavier than xxx.

VThis is a good strain for commercial growers looking for a high yield. I feel a head high, euphoria, and hunger. This strain would be good for something active like hiking as well as something like relaxing inside like watching Netflix. I can smell pine and fruit in the jar of buds. Trying this with a bong and hemp wick, I tasted chemical, tropical fruit, and a hint of diesel flavors. Overall, I would give this strain a 7.5 out of 10.

VI give it 5 stars bc I appreciate a euphoric feeling - this has potential to be either long lasting or temporary depending on doseage but another recommended Sativa for you to try - sweet &amp; light smoke with uplifting affects - award winna: &#39;12 Best Sativa [Denver Cannabis Cup]

VI&#39;m not sure if this is the same strain, but I got a batch of &quot;Guava Dawg&quot; and let me tell you, WOW. I was completely surprised by the way this just blew me back from one bong hit. Instantly medicating, instantly throws you into the stars. I&#39;d say it&#39;s a balance of sativa/indica, you can feel the energetic sativa effects, but way more on the indica side. It definitely turns into a deep body stone and gets you sleepy.

VThis is the only sativa that doesn&#39;t give me increased heart rate and anxiety, but it gives me the giggles and makes me feel great. Things are just funnier or I&#39;m in such a better mood that I laugh a lot on this. Tried as flower and live resin. This is a great sativa that&#39;s closer to an indica with the giggles.

VI was unsure about Stardawg Guava since I judged the book by its cover.  After sparking a fatty, I realized I really enjoyed Stardawg Guava and the smoothness.  It didn\u2019t bother my asthma and it was a clean and crisp bud that seems to be pretty potent.  Frosty nugs!
