VAmazing. Absolutely love this strain. It&#39;s not too harsh of a smoke that it irritates my asthma. Nice smooth hits. You really don&#39;t need much of this bud to lift your mood. Also helped me a ton with my anxiety.

VStrawberry Blue smells and tastes strongly of sweet, sweet berries. It is great for socializing, getting things done, and even sitting down to work on something creative. This strain offers great pain relief and a sort of calm energy. I&#39;m pretty sensitive to the heavier sativa leaning strains, but I experienced zero anxiety w/ Strawberry  Blue. Definitely recommend! &#128293;&#128165;&#128154;

VTastes strongly like a strawberry with lighter smooth exhale. Amazing color in this shatter from terpalicious extracts. Reminds me a bit of jack on the exhale but definitely a good mellow Head high great for beginners in my opinion. Very Terpy and good for most occasions as its not overpowering or couch locking.

VI didn&#39;t think too much of this the first few times I smoked it, but now I think it&#39;s one of my faves. It gives a nice chilled high, and I tend to have alot more focus and energy. Perfect for an afternoon smoke, or in the early evening. If I smoke it too late at night I have trouble shutting off my brain.

VI prefer lemon tasting sativas but this has a good fruity tastes. Seems to mellow me out well. Helps my mood nicely and increases my appetite which is rare. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s also a great aphrodisiac but I&#39;ve been sick and without a date for ten years so I&#39;m not a great judge.

VI gave it four stars a few months ago. ..buuuut it didn&#39;t get any better with the next few harvests. Look one indoor plant gives you 13 oz of good smells and taste but not strong enough to do much even if you get 15% thc and huge big 7 gram buds or bigger. ..so what if you can&#39;t feel it much why waste your time. ..I can find good tastes and smells and get high on better genetics. ...good color blues and covered in trics but got 15 percent on 1 and 8percent on another 12 on the one before ...just not likely to grow this again. ..tastes good tho

VGrew some of this and it came out amazing for outdoor and smelled like strawberries and unleaded gas(the gas smell you get while pumping gas that people seem to like for some reason). You cant stop smelling it once you get a whiff. It is possible some may not like the gassy smell  but mixed with that sweet berry it is a unique smelling dank. I imagine this strain indoor is pumping out some of the best bud available. I got a couple free seeds from herbie and i will be buying some as well. This is one to consider having in todays quality race.
