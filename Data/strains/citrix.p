VCitrix is a cross of LA Confidential and Grapefruit.\u000aStandard flower time is around 9-10 weeks but this phenotype was more like 11. It was a great strain to grow, it wasn&#39;t finicky, grew very quickly and had great side branching.\u000aThis plant yielded very heavy! loved it, would recommend it to just about anybody, it would be great for a beginner or a commercial cropper. I give it a 9/10 on the grow side!\u000a\u000aOpening the jar, right off the bat the smell is citrus, very citrus! Intense citrus with a pine background. A grapefruit type citrus with a hint of tangerine. \u000a\u000aFinished buds are solid, not rock hard more of a sativa style bud. This phenotype was very sativa dominant, 70% sativa 30% Indica. Very sticky and frosty.\u000a\u000aFlavor is very citrus on the inhale, on the exhale you get more of a pine skunky taste. Very nice lung expansion, definite potency. Sativa high up front, but smoking excess will turn the high into more of an Indica couch lock. Finished product 7.5/10.\u000a\u000aSee it reviewed at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8bl7PIiZVg

VI popped the bottle open and knew it was going to be something I&#39;d enjoy. When you first smell it, you get an intense fresh orange peel scent, then when you take that first hit it tastes sweet and earthy and on the exhale you get the taste in the back of your mouth of burnt orange peel and the taste that&#39;s left on your tongue leaves a numbness that only eating grapefruit usually gives from the bitterness. I was a little tired already when I smoked this for the first time so it was an uplifting high, I was talkative and then a calm came over my body and I fell asleep. It&#39;s a good strain to try for relaxation and pain.

VI\u2019ve been enjoying Citrix about 3-4 x per week for the last 3 months.

While I\u2019m. not yet an expert on flavor characteristics of strains, I can tell you that Citrix makes me laugh and feel happy.  A little bit of the munchies often occur.   This strain definitely intensifies arousal and I would recommend smoking a little with your significant other when you know you\u2019ll have a night alone!

VSo stoked for this. This is my first attempt at growing ever and wow... this strain delivers (so far)! I&#39;m almost 2 weeks into flowering AND I chose to main-line this plant... incredible. I went with 6 mains, which right now are each 14-15&quot; tall. I&#39;m guessing it will be close to 36&quot; tall and yield around 6-8oz&#39;s. This strain is growing exact as described, the internode growth is short and the buds are looking tasty. Stinks SOOO good! I will update after harvest!

VSuper smelly buds with an initial wreak of pine and a sweet after scent. I can&#39;t even describe the taste almost a diesel finish with an energetic head change. TOP NOTCH &#127797;

VThis was my first medicinal marijuana strain I used to combat anxiety and depression. It smelled citrusy and pleasant. The effect was of euphoria and uplifting. A nice buzz and relaxing.

VMabey I&#39;m over doing it 5 Star &#128556; but \u000aThis is a really good hybrid \u000aI love the feeling of not being tired but relaxed, and because it is a sativa dominate hybrid the blend together gives you great energy and focused and very uplifting a diffidently should try.

VThis gives you such a bubbly uplifted high. I always tend to get that relaxing tingle going down my head when it takes effect.

VI love this strain. It\u2019s really great for pain. Nice citrus flavor that\u2019s strong but not too overwhelming. This is my go to for my chronic foot pain.

VLike the name implies, such an intense citrus flavor that leads to an immediate heady buzz. Great for any time of the day and definitely one to look out for.
