VDream weed. I don&#39;t know why but when I smoke before bed I dream like crazy. Might be the most smoothing strain I&#39;ve smoked so far.

VLove this strain, very sedative, but kinda still makes you wanna talk. Great bed time smoke. Gorgeous when flower is broken up.

VFeel the affects straight away, felt super relaxed but make sure you have a drink because your mouth is gonna be dry af! Good for insomnia and have a tingle in every part of your body... had slight anxiety but apart for that, an overall great strain!
