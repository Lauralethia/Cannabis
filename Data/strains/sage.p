VI&#39;ve been waiting to write this review because I was a bit unsure about my thoughts on this strain.  I was instantly pleased after my second session of vaping of Sage. I was so lifted that I felt like I was a living breathing fucking TREE! Awesome!!! If you are suffering from just feeling out of control,  Sage may help you as it has for me.  I can really get deep into my meditation and peace of mind no matter how crazy my life might get. I can never go wrong with Sage, I am just so focused and content after taking it. The only time I have a negative effect from Sage is when I&#39;m exhausted or hungry/thirsty I get anxious to the point of anger but nothing aggressive just caveman restless angry if know what I mean LOL.

VEmotional burdens and stress have a gargantuan impact on physical pain. It&#39;s rare that you find a strain that can eliminate pain without knocking you out or nailing you to the couch.  S.A.G.E. works double duty for both issues, it&#39;s long lasting with the added mental clarity bonus. This is now my daytime go-to for joint and nerve pain.

VLeafly Reviews\u000a\u000aSAGE\u000aIn bud form, beautiful light green with dark green hues. The buds are small and fluffy, abundant light orange hairs coupled with cotton can&#39;t like frosting; almost spider web like!\u000a\u000aSmell is sage, wood, with a hit of diesel or &quot;soap&quot; as I call it.\u000a\u000aAfter busting in my Med+Tainer the &quot;soap&quot; smell was sweetly coupled with more sage. Diesel lovers will enjoy this smell along with the woody sage sent. Truly nothing I&#39;ve ever had before!\u000a\u000aI vaporized a half g in a Volcano Vape...After one bag I was hit with a noticeable amount of creativity and a solid uplifting happy state of mind.\u000a\u000aAfter my second bag of vapor I&#39;ve noticed I&#39;m complety concentrated and committed on my thoughts. This is a great day time, get work done flower! \u000a\u000aThird bag and a .7 joint later and I&#39;ve reached euphoria. The music I&#39;m listening to soothes my soul, my sore muscles are pain free and I have that perfect body buzz that leaves you refreshed. This is one superb, finely tuned plant.\u000a\u000a

VI have this awesome strain more than 10 years. My own selected mother is 7year old, because its one of few great strains for me and my head. SAGE have strong celebral effect .  Great to cure your stress, insomnia, pain, good appetite suppressant  with beautifful natural smell and taste. I recommend to people looking for a strong sativa effects

VIt&#39;s a thick high...everything around you is real dense/heavy. Colors have an almost overwhelming eye-catchingness. Laid back, distant body feel - yet oddly thrilling and energized resulting in a complex array of sensations. Extremely short attention...every little thing is impressive and dramatic. Feels like living in a movie. Squirmy tingliness in your gut. Very arousing! A straight up aphrodisiac. You can see your eye&#39;s framerate - it&#39;s very pulsing.

VExcellent buds, tight and the color of the hairs is a bright orange. The smell is strong and has a nice aroma to it. The effects are monstrous. It did me in (I am about 6&#39; 220 lbs.) left me numb in the arms and legs, and spinning for a while (I guess I over did it that time). But yeah, if your looking for a mind eraser, this is a great one to chill out and be quiet to. I only wish I had a bed around to go to sleep at the time. Thats what I remember of it.

VHoly shit. S.A.G.E. is AMAZING for PTSD, Depression, Nausea, Fatigue or anything of the like. This is NOT RECCOMENDED FOR ROOKIES. This will send a novice to his outer limits and really test how well you have your psyche holding together. This will give a pro, a moderately strong to strong HIGH FOR HOURS. It feels like drinking 4 strong cups of coffee with a moderate body buzz (most likely from the Afghani side of the genetics). This is my new favorite day time strain. Good luck trying to watch TV, this makes a great pre or post work out strain. Prepare for traveling through the atmosphere within the first minute of puffing. I ground mine down and loaded it into my Pax2. Full chamber on the 3rd heat setting. Flavor is definitely Sativa. Very spicy and earthy. Surprisingly near the end of the session, a sweeter flavor developed instead of degrading into something tasting not so desirable. Unique (good) taste, very strong happy, uplifted and creative head high that will produce a  light body high to help with aches and pains. This shit is perfect!

VHadn&#39;t smoked in a few months and my friend has his card. Great smoke smooth and not overpowering. The Sage really taste like something from the cabinet above the stove. Would go well with a nice beer and some italian food. Mellow, but strong buzz. I tend to get a bit overzealous for the occasional smoker and hit it like a pro. I get the negatives almost everytime but they don&#39;t last long. My thoughts were foggy but pain relief is good. Hangover is nonexistant. Woke clear headed and recalled every thought from the night before. Cotton mouth seems to plague these more potent strains. Keep some water near.

VMy number one. So I love with this plant. Some one on here said some thin like feeling crapy have some coffee and sage and it will fix your day first thing in the morning. And I agree fully. But there is an added bonus if you have a bit after dinner and you kick your boots off for the day, she will help you wind down for the day. SAGE is a girl that just know what you need and she can fix it. She&#39;s a smart one. All should try SAGE.

VA warm, buttery high. Incredibly euphoric mixed with peaceful resignedness. Soft across the board with a gleeful, childlike attentiveness. Pretty disconnected, fuzzy, and distant from your body. It takes forever to focus on anything, but vision is bright and smooth like plush leather. Impossibly short attention span makes even the smallest things super compelling. Potent high that lingers at a high intensity for an impressive while.\u000a\u000aI feel like a wood elf...or spiritually connected to a forest somehow.

VThis is a lot more exciting than Sativa Afghani Genetic Equilibrium sounds like it might be.  The euphoric Haze in this hybrid takes effect almost immediately, followed by a lasting full body relaxation from the &quot;strong Indica strain&quot;.  Gives excellent pain relief--the chronic pain in my leg from a herniated disc took a two-hour break after I smoked a bowl of SAGE.

VI just tried this for the 3rd time and finally decided to sit down and write this review. My first time, I didn&#39;t think too much of... 2nd time was better, but holy mackerel, the 3rd time was apparently a charm. 2 bingers and I was floating... no really... I was floating! I also measured about an 8.5 on the retard meter. Found myself going in and out of a room 36 six time, just to realize all I really wanted was beer. In any event... great smoke, and of course now I&#39;m out of this strain... which may be a good thing. A+++... except a little harsh on the lungs.

VOne hell of a strain. I just smoked quarter of a spliff and my mind is on overdrive. I generally smoke and listen to electro-chill music, it&#39;s insane. I feel like the music is being controlled by me, I can hear the music in my head perfectly and detect every single nuance. All sounds in the room are amplified and echoed.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m so aware of everything, I feel like I&#39;m taking everything in so much that it&#39;s confusing.\u000a\u000aDefinitely wouldn&#39;t recommend to those looking for a warm, snuggly sedative weed.

VSAGE reminds me of blueberry... very well balanced, relaxing but still delivers a head high. I find my attention span is great with SAGE... I can watch a movie, work on a project, take a hike, and I stay focused, interested, and capable. It does have a noticeable indica undercurrent, which makes it better for activities that don&#39;t require a lot of talking. I find it makes me almost serene, but rather quiet.

VAfter some intense research I bought this strain  to use for breeding but had to scrap the idea due to time and space constraints, but decided to grow the strain despite the long flowering time required(77 Days). \u000aI was not disappointed with the yield and the high was as advertised. AWESOME!!\u000aHard hitting with a nice clear head buzz soon followed by an uplifting and happy high. The body high from the Afghan influence is nice and clean with no couch lock.\u000aIf your a true cannabis connoisseur this strain is a must;.

VThis specific strain, obtained from Arizona Organix, known for their proprietary Papa&#39;s OG strain, caught my eye because it had a whopping 1.43% CBG.  For CBD, that&#39;s like actually a typical indica or even the lower end of CBD. But my budtender at AZ Organix was telling me much it helps IBS, ulcers, stomach pain or nausea in general, and I have HORRIBLE IBS-D.  It&#39;s only 14% THC ( I say only because papa&#39;s og last time I was in there clocked in at around 24%) and it gets me HIGHER than Papa&#39;s OG alot of times.  I think this is also due to the fact it does so well for my stomach. So I don&#39;t know if ALL Sage has high CBG, but if you can find some that does, you just found the golden ticket! seriously I am only going here from now on.  I would guess other high CBG strain&#39;s might be similar?  Most are like .01% or .03% cbg, this is 1.43% so its well over 10x how much is normally in weed an it is noticeable!  The best way I can describe it, is it was more like getting high in the begging, when I REALLY got high, and stuff really affected me and I had to be careful about smoking too much.... This crazy high thc wax or strains are fun and all but I get much more out of this.  It actually has a name, it&#39;s called the &quot;entourage effect&quot;.  Getting off subject here but I&#39;d like to see more cannabinoids  bred back into weed because of this.  GREAT stuff. And I&#39;ll admit I am definitely on the pickier side.

Expensive is the only word i could use to describe it. The high was amazing. I put on the album live in concert by wiz khalifa and currency and i felt amazing. Like i was just rich as fuck and i already made it. This weed was just elegant.

VThis strain has been a firm favourite where I live for many years. It&#39;s been one of the most easily sourced and it&#39;s easy to see why. I&#39;ve had this many times before and until last night hadn&#39;t had it for a few years due to the availability of blue cheese and haze. This though was an absolute beast, I shared a joint with my brother and at first it felt nothing but slowly over the course of 2 hours crept up on me becoming ever more potent as time elapsed. It delivered a powerful body high lime an indica would with a heavy cerebral high to accompany it. Lasting for around 3/4 hours this was great pain relief while also leaving the mind feeling creative and very chatty. Excellent strain and fantastic genetics 10/10

VNo initial complaints with this very nice Sativa as it stops Crohns cramps and pains.  Very typical of top Sativas with nice colors, relaxing if a bit jittery.  Big problem for me is the next day I simply can not get detail work done properly as I have a hangover from it.  For instance AK47 has zero hangover effect no matter how hard I use it the night before.  I wake up clearheaded after a good night&#39;s sleep.  But with SAGE simple math is painful as I can&#39;t concentrate the next day all day.  Bummer as I really like the high better than AK.

VSomething special. I\u2019ll kind of want to associate it with Sour Diesel for his special taste and aroma but soooo much better. An herb that can be appreciated in the morning accompanied by your regular cup of roasted beans and you will feel it\u2019s enlightenment, an enlightenment that\u2019s gonna take the stress away from the next task thrown at work, like meeting a new client, defending a big case in court, perfoming your first major surgery or just simply want to start creating something or start a chat.  An all day that can be turned into an all night with no adaptative difficulties at all. The more you smoke the more relax. Little shot because it\u2019s a high thc Strain but for the one that know there herb, Go for it. It takes a few minutes and then sofly to hardly kicks in. &#128077;&#128169;

VI love the smell of this strain, it&#39;s smells like Sage, or a type of Hash! The aroma that permeates the air in the surrounding environment is tantalizing to the senses and is a smell that I have never experienced, and I&#39;m very experinced an have had the luck to of tried many different strains an more weekly! This strain is a very good Choice for individuals that need to medicate during the day! It&#39;s very uplifting and helps tremendously with people like myself that have  (A.D.D.) and Sever Anxiety Disorders). \u000aThe other thing I liked was I got three female seeds in my Sac and that&#39;s really rare to find seeds with these Medical strains; which leaves me to believe that this plant may of been an auto-flowering strain, either way I&#39;m Happy to of received them..... I&#39;m going to cross this with Tangie!!!!!

VTaste-\u000aNot a particularly pleasant flavor for me. It&#39;s true to it&#39;s name, sage-like and woody. I know it&#39;s contradictory but I found it smooth and harsh; on the back of my palate the woody flavor was smooth, but up in my sinuses I was almost on the verge of needing to cough. \u000aPhysical-\u000aTook away my hip, lower back and neck pain. Took it way, not just took my mind off of it. I felt like getting up and doing something, had it not been so late. I didn&#39;t have any heaviness in my eyes at first but I&#39;d consider it a bit of a creeper. The longer I sat on the stone the more it built. Wasn&#39;t too heavy feeling. Didn&#39;t get the munchies, if anything it suppressed my appetite. \u000aMind-\u000aWhile I could get away with doing things, I wouldn&#39;t say I had the best focus. I talked to my cousin on the phone at one point, it was hard to remember to answer his questions. I would sort of get distracted and forget to actually verbalize my response once I thought it. I did some sketching while on this. It helped unlock my creativity but had I needed to do a more technical piece I may have struggled. I completely zoned out and ended up drawing some superior things.

VLoved the SAGE flower so much, I had to grab a gram of SAGE concentrate from The Clinic Colorado down on Colorado Boulevard in Denver, Colorado. I heated up my quartz trough until I saw red, when the temp gun read 700, I vaporized a .2 sized dab of this beautiful amber budder. Then I did it again... Two more times... SAGE pulled through again to impress me (my hat also goes off to The Lab for doing a great job of extracting this amazing budder). Very uplifting, happy, get up and dance to some music by yourself kind of medication. This strain is great for depression, PTSD, fatigue or just having a really good time!

Not the best, but this strain is better than a lot of others. I recommend it if your dispensary is selling. Also, didn&#39;t really give me the munchies, but it does give you an appetite. There are other strains that are more powerful in giving you the munchies.

VIt&#39;s awesome because it smells exactly like sage, and also kind of like peppermint. On the exhale you get a nice cooling menthol effect which is nice because most strains don&#39;t have that pleasant of an aftertaste. It&#39;s a very potent indica dominant, I would only recommend for nighttime use.

VThis cut is from Farmer J&#39;s in Washington State. This bud was cured very well and had a nice snap in your hand that released the great unique aroma from Sage. The smell and taste on the exhale is that of woody almost birch and that of well....sage...duh. I have yet to encounter a flower with the same unique great smell. The high from this strain is perfect for daytime use especially for outdoor activities. This is for a couple reasons. First, this strain obviously sativa dominant, is full of creative focus and uplifting effects. Sage also is not a face melter or produce couch lock in anyway. Also what makes it great for the day is it lasts a good 3-4 hours. This is coming from a daily smoker. Makes it nice for public outings. Now while a great sativa, sage also provides a nice chill body high that is very relaxing without the heavy sedating effects.

VThis strain is potent and super pungent. Sage has an earthy smell, very deep green look, and a very focused-energetic high. However it&#39;s also relaxing and good for pain.

VNormall, I don&#39;t go for Sativas as I prefer the pain-killing aspects of indicas for my Crohn&#39;s.  However, I notice that sativa strains do have a postive effect on my gut, and helped me back to normal bowel activity for a period.  Unfortunately, they can have the complete oppoisite effect, and also set of my TMJ and anxiety.  Sage seems to be really well-suited for me and my G.I. issues, and doesn&#39;t have the usual side effects I experience with Sativas.  I also will note it&#39;s a potent strain and I did not expect the effects to last so long.  Overall, a definite 1st choice when available.  The mild trainwreck smell and taste is also very pleasant.

VSAGE is a somewhat strong Sativa dominant strain that really hits you up in the head, relieving headaches, migraines and other health issues of the head. It really removes the &quot;fibro fog&quot; and helps me ease my symptoms of ADHD and inability to focus or concentrate. It helps me focus and I am able to perform some tasks; of course don&#39;t use this if you are driving, a pilot, etc.  It eases my depression, and eases my overall body pain and fatigue from fibromyalgia. It is also good to boost your THC levels if one has too much CBD in by heir system and need to balance things out. It is great to mix with hash and kief, anything high in CBD.

VThis Strain is Exceptional!!! I can&#39;t believe how *HIGH* just 2 oven packs on my vaporizer got me; I have an extremely high tolerance from smoking a lot of hash and it&#39;s a very rare for flower to even do anything but this really did the trick. I love how frosty the buds are (my pic is the one on the Raw tray) it&#39;s just covered in glistening trichomes.

VI  don&#39;t recommend this to anyone who smokes smh....smells like peppermint and basically does nothing but a small head rush. Looks an feels very bushy an hay like; but breaks up nicely in a grinder. Only way I could enjoy was when I mixed it with my fav, Blue Dream classic. All in all it acts as a form of hash or keef. I don&#39;t recommend smoking it alone; unless it&#39;s all you have.
