VIt puts an end to procrastination. Definitely a strain for the daytime when you have a lot to get done. Keeps you motivated even through the mundane. I am a light smoker and only take a few hits and it keeps me going for hours. The only negative I could find is I find myself getting irritated if I&#39;m not staying busy. It curbs my anxiety and stress.

VLove this strain. Good for pain, but great for depression/ anxiety/PTSD/bipolar in my opinion. Very energetic but not overwhelming. I haven&#39;t been able to leave my bed for the past week really because of all of the health issues that I listed above, I vaped this strain and I rode my bicycle, got my guitar out, and had an awesome afternoon instead of spending my day in bed, in a mental f***ing hell.

VCinderella&#39;s Dream is my new favorite strain. I find that it helps me focus on creative tasks while relieving anxiety. Love it for a good graphic design session during the day. \u000a\u000aBlue Dream was my favorite strain for years and is a parent of Cindy&#39;s Dream, which is why I love it. Similar, but better effects.

Vit&#39;s 10 am. first cup of coffee, morning meds including mood stabilizers and maximum dose adhd meds, followed with Cinderella dream. \u000a  I am bipolar, trying to find balance with current moods like a landing aircraft, hit &amp; miss, but almost there. unfortunately a current dip to level 8 depression. so I went looking for my emergency back up flavours, Head Cheese &amp; Gorilla Glue. They bring me an abundance of joy. I ALWAYS laugh. Neither were in stock. my lifelong nickname is K. Cind. Prin., so of course I&#39;ll try one of those,  the Lodi doddi was also recommended. \u000a  I&#39;ve listed my morning routine and Erie this because Cinderella had me in a nearly catatonic state. lucky my thumbs work. my thoughts have not cleared they are a touch worse. It is supposed to give energy, I can&#39;t get of the couch. now I have to find the energy to get dressed and go finds the good stuff fml ;)

VThis strain popped my weed cherry and I am glad it did! I&#39;ve loved this strain from day one, powerful high that just pulls your mind away to wherever you might fancy.\u000aAnother one to try to keep on stock at all times, she&#39;s got the power to turn a shitty night around and put you to bed happy, you need only let her.

VGreat daytime smoke. Very smooth, no harshness whatsoever. Its strong, but not overpowering in its high. It wont give you tons of energy, but there&#39;s No paranoia, or anxiousness here. This sativa dominant plant will leave you relaxed and inspired to get creative. Excellent strain for music events that don&#39;t require too much jumping around. Light and fluffy buds are covered in kief and have a fruity/tropical aroma with a sweet/eucalyptus taste in the terpine profile. This strain, although its not Indica-dominant, is great for pain management. It leaves you in a world of dreams and clearheaded. Some light purple hues once cracked, which gives a beautiful finish to this Blue Dream- hybrid! Fast becoming one of my favorite Sativa-dominant plants.

VA great strain for day or night. My batch was cured properly thanks to CBHS in Van City. Really spacey head high comes on fast and provides enough of a boost to go and get stuff done. In the evening, same head high but relaxed afterwards. Earthy but not overly potent smell. It tastes like good weed should.\u000a\u000aAs for pain, it doesn&#39;t quite silence it, but, like Jack Herer, it takes my mind off of it for a while.

VEverything it promises to be. Uplifting, slightly energizing, stress relieving, depression alleviating, mild pain relief. I am sensitive to sativa and while I love being stoned, I still enjoy  being  in control and able function in social settings. Cinderella&#39;s Dream affords me the medicinal value without any of the anxiety or paranoia I find in some sativa strains. I should note I am vaping this particular strain.

VMy new favorite strain. Similar effects as Blue Dream but a little more of a head high. Seems to last longer too. The buds are light green with a sweet taste and smooth smoke. Will definitely buy again.

VIt&#39;s ok. I&#39;m a fan of sativa dominant hybrids but this strain I have is a bit too heavy in the head. I like that it&#39;s so potent I only need a small amount to get blasted but the cerebral rush is a bit paralyzing.

VVery focused and I am in love with it. The uplift and focus is just what I was looking for to smoke before the gym. And no dank smell carries with me which is really nice since I&#39;m coming from the car into the gym.

VHard to believe this is my first time smoking Cinderella&#39;s Dream and I have no idea why except probably the Cinderella. Now that Tangie mothers need a break, my Bud Tender brought this and Lodi Dodi out. Not having my phone (and thus no Leafly App) I wasn&#39;t able to see which was going to be better for my crankiness so I went with Cinderella&#39;s Dream even knowing Cinex (one of the parents) was not one of my faves. Needless to say, this strain is up there as a good go-to backup.

VThis one was a bit different than the ones i usually prefer. Normally I go for something that&#39;ll make me really giggly.  by that measure, this was not a great strain for me. that bring said, i like the strain on it&#39;s own merits. it gets me feeling very happy, as well as giving me body tingles and a slight pressure at the templates.

Vpretty nice strain. It got along with me fairly well. It has some really solid green buds. when you grind it it looks like parsley. I only wish i wouldve got more. I would say this strain is happy, interested in media, and just all around good.
