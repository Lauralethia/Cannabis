VSmells and tastes amazing, pretty harsh though. Enjoyed it via a prerolled joint and it was harsh on the lungs but potent, very delicious, immediate head relief for anxiety and depression.

VThe buzz is strong with this strain. Not too bad on the paranoia to which I am prone. I&#39;ve typically been most satisfied with indicas but I like this strain a lot. Given the right surroundings, this could be the perfect night out smoke.

VFor me its a little bit harsh and citrusy, but sweet aftertaste. Lots of dryness,  but I have my water bottle with me. Feeling pretty light headed spacy head high, still able to be social tho

VVery mellow and smooth, both in high and in toke. TONS of little red hairs made it very distinguishable. Made me eat everything in the house while watching Star Trek, so it&#39;s pretty true to its name. Now if only I had more, I&#39;d love to make cannibutter out of this stuff. Excellent candidate for medibles if you want an endless munchy cycle. High kind of rolls on hills with peaks and valleys, but has lasted in excess of 3 hours now. Color me impressed.

VSmoke two hits of this and you&#39;ll be eating everything in the house while watching Star Trek. Smoke a whole bowl of this, even amongst a couple friends, and you&#39;ll turn super productive and creative. Both second and third times smoking a whole bowl, myself and housemates started cooking/cleaning/organizing, and that&#39;s something we NEVER do willingly.

VAside from having an awesome name... &quot;Space Jill&quot;, is a nice strain. One of my recent favorites. Just went back for another eighth yesterday after trying it for the first time. It&#39;s unique in that it doesn&#39;t make you sleepy. It is potent for sure, but makes you feel uplifted/giggly/talkative. Definitely a unique high, I love having this stuff in my stash.
