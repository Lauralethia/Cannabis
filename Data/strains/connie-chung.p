VThis version of this strain was grown by Western Cultured (Forrbidden Gardens) is called Cascade Connie. The nugs are super frosty your fingers get covered just by holding them. They have streaks of purple through the buds and have a fruity taste and smell to it. The high is pretty strong but you can still keep a convo. going. I pick this up at White Rabbit Cannabis and it has become one of the stains I always keep stocked. \u000a

VThe Connie strain i picked up is named Cascade Connie grown by Western Cultured( Forbidden Garden ).  Its a very stoney strain too.  The buds are super frosted with crystals with blue streaks through the buds.  The THC level is just over 20 % with a CBD reading of 0.4 %.   I picked this up at White Rabbit Cannabis so far every thing i got from there has been pretty good.

VThis strain does have a very earthy pungent smell to it and easy on the lungs upon exhale. The light green buds are very easy to break apart while its sticky and looks lightly frosted as well. The high is great and in my experience with this bud I start with a body high then the mind and Do be warned smoking this bud will cause you severe munchies so have Doritos near by and some water.
