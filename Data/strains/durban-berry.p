VIt&#39;s a peaceful, sunny day kind of feeling without any negative side effects. A clear head and a big smile; this is the gatekeeper you have been waiting for. No tonic buzz or slumbery euphoria; just a good head for what come&#39;s your way.

VTastes earthy and spicy. I did not find hints of berry in the taste or aroma. The high is not very powerful at all, but it is relaxing and I found it good for anxiety. I prefer this strain for mornings because it takes the edge off aches, pains, and depression, but not strong enough to cause couch lock or sleep. This is a strain is also good for relief while still maintaining a focus.

VVery nice head buzz with some body effects. What stood out most is the taste--very fruity, but more of a lemony/grapefruit taste. Almost like a Tom Collins mix taste. It made my jaw and teeth feel very relaxed and warm. Very relaxing without making you super sleepy.

VI love it! It makes me feel 100% relaxed, but to the point where it doesn\u2019t make me sleepy BUT I could still sleep if I wanted to and like a baby. It\u2019s also a good body high. I literally felt like I was floating. I recommend 10/10.

VTried this one in wax form in the rig. Great taste and a nice heady high. Unfortunately my tolerance is as such that I have to reapply every hour. I don&#39;t mind, because Durban Berry taste great and is a fun.

VI typically rate strains based on smell and taste and I rarely give 5 stars. This strain is going down as one of my favorites.  I would recommend this to everybody and anybody. The sweet sweet berry smell, that stays around long after the exhale.

VOkay, I&#39;ve gotta say. This has to be the best bud that I&#39;ve smoked in a while. Having smoked with my best friend this right after a fight with him, it was the best help in diffusing the argument. Restoring both our moods to beyond happy and enabling both of us to talk it out while keeping us focused on the real stuff. \u000a\u000aIt tastes amazing through and through. This strain is staying in my group of favorites! &#128077;

VDurban Berry has a good sativa kick for the 1st hour that then leads to a good indica feel. You become both uplifted and relaxed. Easily one of the best hybrids I&#39;ve had.

VPicked up some bud to try. A friend and I shared a J and enjoyed the effects of this strain. Durban Berry gives a nice clear headed high with no racy feeling to it, I really like that. It did give me a happy feel, not giggly, just happy. It has a nice small bud that has beautiful orange hair through it. It has a nice pine smell.
