VThe Blue Mystic I attained from Nirvana was harvested in 8 weeks.  10% Amber 50/50 cloudy to clear trichomes.  It was amazingly soft in texture and smooth going down.  I noticed a clarity and a happiness in the high.

VThis was quite possibly the best strain I&#39;ve ever smoked. Had it in Holland along with countless other strains, but everything else we smoked ended up being compared to BM&#39;s mystical appeal. It was euphoric, super chilled out, psychedelic (audio and visual distortions were lush), and well balanced. I felt whole and more connected with my body and inner-self. Life seemed to glow and resonate beauty making everything was feel like it was going to be alright. Will never forget how this weed changed my life. Nothing will ever be the same. It was as if the stars were all aligning in terms of my point in life, ambitions, friends nad location. It brought me closer to....... no I WAS the present moment. Blue Mystic was a undoubtedly force for good in my life.

VI got Blue Mystic due to the reviews on Leafly and it did not dissapoint!  Much like the effects of Plat GSC or Blue Dream... a very nice body and head high, a little more on the sativa side which is great for socializing or being with your sweetie.  Hubby and i got the giggles for a bit.  This strain is very uplifting and will help bring you out of any bad feelings or depression.  A top 10 for me for sure!

VGrew this from an autoflower from Nirvana; from seed to harvest it was about sixty three days or so. It gives off an odd sour citrusy scent; like canned lemons that are slightly past their prime. The high is primarily a head high with a slight body stone, but in large doses (e.g. a gravity bong) it will really... mess... you... up. I mean, marked inability to focus, concentrate, or even understand Spongebob. All in all a good time.

VThis strain is short strain in size and flower time and has a beautiful sweet blueberry skunk smell.  With long trichomes and a typically indica appearance it&#39;s a great strain if space is an issue.  When placed in a bag it makes a ripping sound when removed that&#39;s how sticky it can get especially if stressed two weeks before harvest by splitting the main stem.  This strain is a great one because if taken early the high starts with an indica couch lock stone briefly then transitions into a more functional hybrid type high. And if taken late well don&#39;t make too many plans great for a movie night.  I would consider this strain best for depression and not pain. Also like Dj short preaches a good flush is mandatory to get the best flavors from this Terrapin rich strain. I really enjoy nirvana&#39;s version but when crossed to Mandela&#39;s Far Out blue mystic becomes a whole different type of blueberry experience.

VOMG! Love this strain. First, it&#39;s got a great taste. Blueberry-ish if I could pinpoint. The high is smooth, gives me a bit of energy and ends with a decent appetite and relaxed mood.

Vfriend grew this from Nirvana and it is some of the best bud ive had. i usually dont like indicas but this gives you a nice body high with  a happy disposition. got 2.2 ounces from 2 plants 16 inches tall. one plant was a dark green with burnt orange hairs super sticky  and smelled like blueberries. other smaller  plant was light green frosty and lighter hairs  and a creamy cheese smell. same strain so maybe it was a pheno but both were excelllent tasting. dried for 5-7 days and cured for 20-30 days. longer the better for this baby. flowers in 9-11 weeks\u000a

Kinda harsh on the throat but very skunky blueberries taste. Very dank smell good bag appeal with the coverage of tricomes and bluish tints on the sticky dense nugz. Ps the man who grew this gave me shit about testing so that says fuck off to me. But it looks great and I did talk his wife into testing . Ya for patience and understanding of human nature. Changed a mind today thanks to cannabis.

VIt&#39;s a good high, at first you get paranoid as s**t but you get over it quick as you get used to it. When you close your eyes you see many creative pictures in your head. It&#39;s sort of trippy and hallucinogenic, but in a good way. If your sleepy you will get even sleepier.

The girl was 3 weeks pregnant and when she got high then admitted to it. (Why she was smoking with a baby astounds me) Also she got real cosy with me and she wanted the you know... So yeah this strain saved me from having to be the false dad to a crazy persons baby that&#39;s the plus. The downside is that strain sucks for pain. No word of a lie I faced 3 grams and was still in pain. I was just very high and in pain, only thing that works is real pain meds. Not saying it&#39;s bad weed cuz it isn&#39;t all I&#39;m saying is that you should probably just take the perks after a surgery the shit isn&#39;t as magical as I thought. Sill fire.\u000a

VVery smooth. Flavor is pleasant but nothing to brag about. The high reminds me a lot of Blue Widow without the extra punch. At least the pheno I had provides a 60/40 blend if indica/sativa a high.  Great strain for beginners. No very impressive for this long time smoker. would be good for chilling,light pain relief and naps.

V3/5 for smell \u000aA very nice caramelly berry sweet smell on one of the phenos. Sweet skunky aromas from the other phenos. Nice smell but subtle rather than an intense or pungrnt aroma.\u000a\u000a4/5 for taste\u000aEarthy hashy taste definatly flavoursome\u000a\u000a4/5 for high\u000aHard hitting indica high. Full body relaxation. Relaxed mind. Warming couchlock. Penatrating deep tissue massage!\u000a\u000aOverall i liked this strain. The bud sizes were nice. Yeild was fair. High was excellent. However the aromas were not enough to consider running this strain again.
