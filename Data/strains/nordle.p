VSmooth and calming, high in CBD.  This stuff smells like turkish delight (walnuts and sugar and fruit) and gives a light, pleasant stone.  Its pretty easy on the mind; I thought it was weak at first but the CBD effect is fabulous.

VAs a &quot;beginner&quot; again, not having regularly smoked in 19 years, this is the best!!  I&#39;ve been trying a lot of strains over the past 4 months and keeping a journal. I need relief from endometriosis, anxiety, depression, and migraines.  I am a mom of 3 so my days are very busy so I need to be clear - headed and sharp. I did not feel high after smoking this, I just feel better!  My mind is focused, my body doesn&#39;t hurt, and I am feeling a migraine that I woke up with slowly dissipate.  I tired Nordle yesterday as well and had one of my best days in years!  I was more mindful, patient, at ease, optimistic, calm, and confident that I may actually beat this depression that&#39;s been hanging overhead.  Moms, this one&#39;s worth a try most definitely. I can become very paranoid and anxious when using cannabis and that led to almost 20 years of avoiding this medicine. If you&#39;re hesitant, try one puff of this and you&#39;ll be glad yoy did. I&#39;ve had the epiphany that I had been doing it all wrong by over-consuming or smoking heavy indicas my entire life until now.

VWhat an awesome strain for chronic pain. Absolutely love it - I was worried about it&#39;s low THC content since, weirdly, I have a lot of luck with pain relief in high THC strains, but this stuff is fantastic. It doesn&#39;t get me as high as others, unsurprisingly, but the pain relief is A+. I suffer from both nerve and joint pain; it helps the joint pain more than the nerve pain but it&#39;s still effective.

VThis strain is found as &quot;Argyle&quot; from Tweed (Canadian grower).  Low in both THC and CBD, this is helpful as a daytime remedy for my anxiety.  Other strains with low THC sometimes have a higher CBD content which leaves me feeling irritable.  Vaping is my delivery method of choice. The initial &quot;high&quot; wears off after about an hour and I can focus to get things done.

VI see here that people are talking about CBD Nordle from CBD Crew, so I will review that. Just Nordle, as it says on the header, is a pure THC strain from Mr.nice, witch is one of the parents in the CBD Nordle. \u000a\u000aI love the CBD Nordle ( and the normal one to! )  great to grow easy and fast flowering.  Nice indica effect with the calming CBD, I all around love it.  For a sativa lover, maybe a bit more &quot;stoned&quot; than  they prefer.  Great for medical use, making oils, raw capsules etc.  good for pain relief, back pain, menstrual pain etc.

VI enjoy this star in very much. I use it upon waking generally I vape it. I find it has a very low smell and taste great. Its very calming but also allows me to stay active and feel energized. It helps me best with anxiety and stress. Also has a secondary effect on pain.\u000aI give it a 4 because it busts up very fluffy and I prefer to smoke and vape more a substantial looking grind because usually it won&#39;t go out as often and has better air flow.
