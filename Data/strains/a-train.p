VI was pretty sick when I tried this strain.  I remember it seeming to help with nausea.  I recall it to be very potent for sexual arousal.  I can&#39;t give an accurate rating, but I will try this strain again.

Vthe laughter brought about by just a few hits leaves you with a stomach ache and tear-stained cheeks!  A-train is the quintessential &quot;stoner&quot; bud-- it gives the smoker a euphoric head high and then works itself out on the back side by finishing with a relaxed body stoned feeling.  Make sure to have a thirst quenching beverage and some tasty treats by your side because the A-Train will leave your mouth feeling like the Atacama and your brain telling you... &quot; I&#39;m starving&quot;!

VSweet Spicey smell, pretty Stoney.Creeper this one, took awhile for the buzz to kick in, but when it did it was great. Both body and mind were equally stoned. Pain relief was really good, Felt like I could just fall asleep, but instead I went for a walk. Pain relief lasted about 2 hours. The high kinda went for about 3. I only burned a 1/4 gram.  I would buy this again,

VI tried A-Train for the first time the night my Bf got arrested, It looked great lots of crystals, good amount of trichomes, smells great, hits hard not very smooth, def makes u cough, but once I became stoned My anxiety was terrible! My whole face was twitching due to muscle spasms from my anxiety. My teeth would chatter like I was cold, but I wasn&#39;t. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all... It was hell for me. I continued to smoke more that wk and it had similar effects just not that severe, but tolerable. Anyone with anxiety, or having a stressful night stay clear of this strain until ur calm and in a very positive relaxed state of mind.

VGot a sample of this and it&#39;s pretty good what I expected. The buds are dense and frosted soft and sticky smell is amazing. The high is awesome very euphoric buzz on the brain very tingly feeling really does bring back memories of being stoned with the friends before class ole time stoned feeling. Pungent earthy woody harshness kinda spicy to the mouth and expanding sensation to make you cough a little. I like a lot will buy again
