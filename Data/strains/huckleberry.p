VI generally like this strain , Illinois strain tested at 21% THC . it&#39;s a tad above average like 3.5/5 . It has a strange taste like no other cannabis I&#39;ve tried , not a bad taste per se but def it&#39;s own flavor. It&#39;s a hybrid that is just about 50:50 , don&#39;t expect to be couch locked or up and giggle . U will be neither . U most likely will be somewhere in the middle , mellow and calm

VSet and setting- Aggravated arthritis from a physical 3 days. \u000aSuper packed bowl, vaped it to dark brown. \u000aHeadphones, a couch, and trippy music. Closed my eyes and saw every musical texture. Later, frequent moments of confusion and semi focused writing with lots of typos. \u000a\u000aAt higher doses the high is great, but still only provided  *moderate pain relief*. There are far better strains in that regard.\u000a\u000aLarge buds, seemed moist and somewhat sticky. Sweet smelling and tasting, very fruity, especially the first couple of tokes.  A bit &quot;up&quot;, wanted things for my mind to do do.

VVery Pleasant taste and bouquet. The high is quite happy with an emphasis on the Sativa &quot;laughy-taffy&quot; affects..! Absolutely, NO anxiety or &quot;Sativa-Hyper&quot; affect at all.  In fact,  it is quite helpful to my anxiety, and more closely resembles an &quot;Indica&quot; effect.  On a pain alleviating scale I&#39;d have to say that it brought my pain levels down to a 3 - 2 which is great for severe low back or leg pain conditions..!  I&#39;ve tried many, many strains and this is a memorable strain for sure..!  Yay..!

VHuckleberry is an indica-dominant strain that has all the qualities an indica should. Although not particularly heavy, this strain is relaxed and centered.  While smoking this strain, I could feel my mind slowing down. This is one of those strains where the mental and physical effects are basically identical. A very comfortable high, this strain would be great for kicking back and relaxing. Those looking to use cannabis medicinally may find this strain helpful for relieving stress, insomnia, anxiety, pain and nausea.  Remembering that Huckleberry will sedate the mind a bit, I would recommend this strain only be used when productivity is not a priority

VWOW!!! This bud is the shizznizzle!! The terpenes are just out of control. One of the most flavorful and aroma packed flowers that i have had the pleasure of smoking. And such a pretty bud too. from the moment you open the jar you had me.  A +.  10/10!!

VWoah! I need to be careful with this strain. If you think too much, it can set you off into a feeling of paranoia and anxiety. That&#39;s why a star is gone. Besides that, the more time passes the easier and less cerebral the effects are. I did feel a tingle rush down from the top of my head to my legs. The hit from this one is very different and will collect to your lungs like a diesel/chemical and somewhat make you have small coughs (Depending on how hard you hit it).

It feels deceivingly clear-minded.\u000a\u000aYou feel cool, mature. Nothing fazes you. It has a distant body stone. Thoughts are inordinately loud.
