It was the end of the day, couldn&#39;t get much smell from the sample, but I took the tenders word. mistake, always should trust my nose. But unfortunately they really didn&#39;t have anything else that smells good. open the sealed bag to the wonderful Aroma of freshly mowed grass. I want rate the high cuz I didn&#39;t smoke enough of it to really find out. I&#39;m really a flavor chaser. And this does not have it. At least this example from this dispensary, I&#39;m sure other people do a much better job of it.
