VUW is one of the finest, damn near pure indicas available, and without a doubt my favorite genetically &quot;purple&quot; strain (I say genetically to distinguish between strains that assume a purple coloration naturally as part of their genetics and those that are only compelled to purple through a &quot;cold shock&quot; during growth). UW has the same flowery, rose-like odor and flavor characteristic of other big purple strains (e.g. GDP, Purple Urkel, God&#39;s Gift, etc.) but complements it with a huge bouquet of pungent-yet-sweet berry and earth flavors. It&#39;s something you have you experience to fully appreciate and its a big part of why this strain is most definitely a 5-star strain. The other part, of course, is the high. UW knocks you flat with a warm, all-encompassing, deeply narcotic stone that will take the edge off of anything. Pain, stress, anything....and for my money there is just no better treatment for insomnia than this strain. If you ever come across it, get as much as you can because this is top shelf recreation and medicine.

VMy experience with &quot;UW Purp&quot; is pretty true to the Leafly description. It&#39;s a solid Indica high. As one other reviewer noted, UW is a late hitter. I found myself really feeling it about an hour after smoking. I would definitely recommend UW for those looking to relax and unwind w/ an Indica strain. It fit the bill for me. I enjoy Sativa dominant hybrids more for daytime use, but use UW for nighttime and/or lazy days.

VI tried UW Purp based on advice from a friend in the biz who listed it in his top 3 strains. I needed a good indica for relaxing in the evening. UW fit the bill. It is what I remember from good weed back in the day - chill, pungent, and sedative. A nice break from the Sativa dominant hybrids. If you&#39;re looking for a prototypical indica, you can&#39;t go wrong with UW Purp

It was a great night cap to just hanging out, enjoying a tv program with a little conversation.\u000a\u000aVery soothing and grounding. Definitely makes you super tired if you cross the smoke point, and gave me terrible cotton mouth. But it look a lot of smoking to get me there.\u000a\u000aVery very nice indica and I can see why so many people are asking for it and coming back again for this strain!

VMy favorite indica strain! So relaxing, and a nice sweet purple flavor. The color is not always purple, sometimes it looks kind of gray in color. It&#39;s the best indica strain on the planet.

VI got some UW Purple from Dawgstar. Great strain for nighttime. It works well for my ADD. Stong indicas help my brain slow down so I can focus on one thing at a time. Having just finished off an 8th I found worthy of review. Very good presentation but i feel somewhat lacking terpenewise. Smoked well.

VExtremely dense bud, had a qtr that looked like an 1/8.  Purple hues everywhere.  Smells decent somewhat floral.  This strain is great for pain and insomnia, serious indica traits.  This would be the perfect strain for a hangover,  will put you comfortably to sleep after a night of hardcore partying.

VI vaped some UW Purple last night.  Only had two or three pulls from a volcano bag.  I made it about 20 minutes into Harry Potter: The Half Blood Prince and I was out!  This is the most sedative strain I have experienced to date.  Knocked my lights out.  I also experienced a mild body-high and some relaxation, but it was lacking the &quot;rolling on the floor in tears&quot; uncontrollable laughter that I enjoy.  If you want something that will put you to sleep, give this a puff.  If you want to be able to stay awake for a while and enjoy laughing until it hurts, then you should consider a different strain.

VNot bad. Not bad at all. Its definitely helping me get thrust this night of body pain without resorting to typical pharmaceuticals for chronic pain which is something im working hard to avoid. Ive been more impressed with other indicas than Uw.  Which is why I give it 3 stars. However like I said it seems to be just enough to get me by as a chronic pain. Sufferer. Give it a try. Everyone reacts very differently to the different strains I think.

VI&#39;ve put off this review because I&#39;ve had a hard time remembering this strain. For me - the closest that I can equate the feeling from this one is Percocet. After about 30 minutes of general silly feeling, it hits me like a Mack truck. Full body tingling, warm, sinking into the bed feeling. Very hard to think, yet very easy to get sucked into bad thoughts. Each hit (about 30 minutes apart) comes with it&#39;s own wave. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t help with my insomnia, but it does deal with pain (post ACL replacement surgery) just as well as Percocet. \u000a\u000aAs for sleep - I seem to be the only one that doesn&#39;t sleep with this. All of my friends that have tried it seem to fall asleep within 45 minutes. I guess I&#39;m just broken.

VI&#39;m a total indica fan my most recent stain was violets delight strain which is currently number one on my list. This one is up there also very frosty light dense bud. I didn&#39;t try the strain alone I put some ice hash with a medium size bowl of this UW and got a really nice locked in cerebral and intense body high very intense which I believe was mostly the hash also. I&#39;m going to try UW on its on and see about the over all effects. But first Impression wide, the bud looks amazing smells totally danked out. Worth a dispensary run.

VHave not done reviews in some time and compelled to do so as I was a little disappointed in this strain.  Purchased it as I had read it was a good night time, insomnia strain. Uh, no - when I smoke bowl after bowl at 3 am and all I get is a dry throat - its not doing its job.  Maybe this particular batch was just too low in potency (15% THC) but the same potency of other strains (9 Pound Hammer or Animal Cookies) will knock me out.  Its rare I don&#39;t even want to finish an eighth and feel like giving it away - but I don&#39;t even want to finish this particular purchase.
