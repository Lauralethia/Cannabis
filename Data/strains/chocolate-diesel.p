VThis is an A+ plus daytime strain. Great taste, very uplifting and not too hazy head high. Be careful smoking at night though if you want some sleep! I tried it for the first time at night and it made my mind race and I was spooked by a stain on my back patio that I thought was a giant spider. But on a sunny Saturday morning it&#39;s the bomb.com

VI love this strain. It&#39;s nice and sticky so it doesn&#39;t burn too fast. It taste really good and it gets me going when I got shit to do. I&#39;ve never bought the same strain as many times and as consecutively as I have this and the Sunset Sherbert by Twisted Sisters. Ive been smoking on this for two months! Bud Hut has kept it stocked for a minute. &#128156;&#128156;&#128156;&#128156;

VThis is a really well balanced and strong sativa. Possibly the most well balanced one I&#39;ve tried. Does have a chocolate scent but the diesel skunk belies it&#39;s roots. Nice everyday strain if you can find it.

VI absolutely LOVE this strain. It gives a nutty aftertaste. I was TERRIFIED to try this strain because I have really bad anxiety and saw how bad the &quot;paranoia&quot; is rated on here. Shockingly enough It&#39;s one of the best strains I&#39;ve had for daytime use. Im able to cook and clean everyday without my back pain and I&#39;m able to mellow out but still have energy with my kids. It helps a lot during that time of the month lol

Vpicked some up today at cannabis and glass in spokane wa. tested at 29.4 thc, buds have a somewhat immature, stemmy look about it. very pleasant pine/citrus aroma. like all flower purchased legally in WA state in the last couple of years, it was somewhat dry and crumbly (thanks a lot guys). quite impressive from the first hit, I&#39;m feeling quite mellow at the moment. potent enough for those with a high tolerance to thc (39 year toker myself) it gives me a relaxed yet energized mentally, if that makes any sense. your mileage may vary.

VI am not totally into Sativas, but I did enjoy this strain for its terp and aesthetic properties.  The eighth I received was well cured and the bud was huge and weighed three grams.  Skunk and diesel are very prominent in taste and smell.
