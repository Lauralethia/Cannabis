VI love this strain but sadly it&#39;s not available anywhere in CO.  I would drive to any point in this state to find this one of a kind strain of Indica Cannabis.  I&#39;ve tried so many others that were supposedly &#39;as good&#39; or &#39;the same&#39; and nothing compares.  There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s sold in Pharmacies in Holland and is bought by thousands of medical patients.  Seems Colorado dispensaries only care about money and not the patient since Big Bang is so sedating.  Guess I&#39;ll have to grow it myself.

VWith indica dominant genetics (70% indica 30% sativa) consisting of Skunk, Northern Lights, El Nino, and Haze this beautiful cannabis does not disappoint one bit. Light green heavily crystallized buds with orange-brown hairs. Great strain for anxiety and pain. Effects smoothly creep up on you starting in the head taking away anxiety and stress. An extremely relaxing, warming full body buzz then kicks in and lasts for 2+ hours that does very well on pain. Anti-anxiety effects linger past the 2 hour mark. Really starting to dig this strain for daytime as it wont cause sleepiness in moderate doses.

V\u000a\u000aDon&#39;t get fooled by the name... This is just a good strain but not excellent. Unless you fuck alot with indicas, maybe that way you&#39;ll appreciate Big Bang more than I did.\u000a\u000aGood flavor, friendly with throat it doesn&#39;t burn your throat at all.\u000a\u000aMedium High, not the greatest of all but still very relaxing and stressless. You can get paranoid at times too...\u000a\u000aNot very smelly nor skunky... it smells sweet and tastes like some sort of fruit or flower.\u000a\u000aA little couch-locking, but not too much.\u000a\u000aJust a good strain to smoke when you are alone and wanna chill playing some games or watching T.V\u000a\u000aYou&#39;ll be very thoughtful and a little curious after baking Big Bang.\u000a\u000a
