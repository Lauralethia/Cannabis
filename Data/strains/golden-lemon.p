VI smoked a .5g preroll shortly after leaving the dispensary.  Having a very high tolerance for flower, I\u2019m always on the lookout for strains, usually indica or indica-dominant strains that hit me fast and hard and doesn\u2019t leave me ready to light up again in 15 minutes.  What really amazed me was that I felt this intense cerebral high after smoking only a 1/4 of the preroll.  I\u2019ve smoked many 1 gram prerolls to the face before so this was a welcome surprise. This was one of three that I wanted after browsing the menu online before going to Patriot Care. I wish I bought this strain in an 1/8 instead of just a preroll.  I will be looking for Golden Lemons whenever I\u2019m at Patriot.   Highly recommend but new smokers go slow.

V&#127925;She wore lemon&#127926;\u000a\u000aMethod of Consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Taste! Wow! Lemon/Citrus flavor is very pleasant. Uplifting, slightly euphoric. Puts a smile on your face. Relaxing. \u000a\u000aCons: Dry Mouth. \u000a\u000aDraw/Taste: Normal draw and exhale. Strong Lemon/Citrus on both inhale and exhale. \u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Great socal strain. Ok for some minor pain, but fantastic for improving your mood. Uplifting. Little heady at times, but not unpleasant. Relaxing.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain not only for the taste, but if your looking for uplifting relaxation.

VGreat high; very euphoric/relaxing, almost psychedelic. Definitely brings me back to the days when I first started smoking. However beware the cotton mouth lol! I\u2019d highly recommend Golden Lemon for any connoisseur smokers (like myself). For those of you new to marijuana approach this strain with caution as it is very potent

VClean, clear. Mild level of distraction. Good uplifter. Keeps energy up. You can engage in conversation. Zero paranoia or anxiety. I would say it is smooth rather than psychoactive. Has some level of lightness to it, at higher doses it might induce giggles. Makes you happy.

VThis strain was the first I had in quite a while. I hadn&#39;t smoked in over 8 years, so I wanted something a bit in the middle ground. Good, euphoric sativa feels with a relaxing body high, everything I love about being high all in one go. Got into some fun chats as well as relaxed on the couch and felt my whole body just relax! \u000a\u000aTaste and scent before and during smoking this one was so lemony and citrusy.\u000a\u000aDefinitely recommended for people who don&#39;t like the anxious-feeling they get from other strains.

VThis is my second review as I had not mentioned the pain relieving side to this strain. I have post arthritic pain in both feet. More specific calcanus and talus bone arthritis to the point I can only walk 3 miles and after that I\u2019m in pulsating pain for the next 2 nights. I good hit of this and my pain was nowhere to be found! It\u2019s like they are numbly floating. The head high is high on that scale, the most I have experienced to date. This strain is definitely a strain for pain IMO. In search of the best so this is my highest rating to date giving it a 4.9 because I know I haven\u2019t smoked the best of the best.

VGreat euphoric strain taking advantage of both of its seriously fantastic parents. I agree with another reviewer on the short duration of the high, but the come down is somewhat smooth and actually pretty great. I actually grew this, and out of the four different strains in the grow, this one was just a BEAST. Wild stretching, amazingly heavy feeding and MEGA yields is the name of the game here. Had to super crop the hell out of this lady, but still grew like madness. In all, great hybrid, and wow. That is a YIELD!

VWow.  This in a live resin from Giddy Up is killer.  Not trying to name drop, but being specific.  I\u2019ve tried the shatter...it\u2019s good, but doesn\u2019t compare to a live resin golden lemons.  Music is uplifted.  Great enthused mood, relaxed body high.  Dabbing.  Decent length of a high as well.  It probably is indica dominant, but not by much as described...how true.  No tweaked Sativa feeling...but the just the good part of the Sativa high.  My favorite to date and I\u2019ve tried many.  Writing in the damn zone!

VDefinitely a cash crop plant nice rock hard buds that are light green and fiery red hairs and covered in trichomes even grown outdoors. Very pungent out of 2 phenos one was more indica dom and flowered quicker and had more of a kushy smell with hints of lemon and the other pheno was more Sativa dom and took longer to finish flowering but was way more lemony and skunk smelling. They both were grown from seed the indica dom was 10 ft tall and the Sativa dom hit 14 ft maybe even taller would highly recommend this strain for connoisseurs and cash crop growers alike as it\u2019s a heavy yielder and puts out primo nug

VThis is a truly fine strain. Its beauty and aroma make her stand out from the crowd. I recommend vaping with this strain, you want your consumption pure as possible so the delicious taste can flourish. The high is surely more indica-dominant but its not nearly a complete couch lock or anything like that. Its relaxing, soothing and quite powerful. A good amount consumed will lead to a wonderful body tingle while giving your head a wonderful, deep breath. For those with dry mouth, may I suggest a simple vodka soda with lime twist or splash of Fresca. Enjoy!
