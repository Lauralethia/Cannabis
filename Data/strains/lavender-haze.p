VAs purples go , I really loved this . Purps or anything skunky is what I go for . This is a great strain that I&#39;ve gotten time and time again and I really do enjoy smoking it when I have it it tastes amazing as well and for me a total creeper high.

Va bit more relaxed than i was shooting for, but I tend to need more energizing strains to not pass out. taste was nice. I took it slow, and it still hit me hard.

VI like the taste, It&#39;s fairly relaxing and helps a bit with my pain. It also provided me with a little more energy than usual. Overall I enjoyed this strain.

VI get my Lavender Haze in pre-rolls from the Novel Tree in Bellevue, WA and it has become my favorite and go-to! I agree with the info on this page, it makes me feel happy and I can get a lot done. I feel like it helps me think abstractly so it&#39;s great for writing, art projects, daydreaming, or making laundry seem fun. I absolutely love the lavender-y smell and floral taste. It&#39;s relaxing and energizing at the same time. I especially love these pre-rolls that I get because they have a long crutch so it doesn&#39;t burn close to your fingers, AND they burn evenly so you can easily take a puff or two at a time and put it out if you don&#39;t want to smoke the whole thing at once. I usually take 1-3 hits when I&#39;m home and it&#39;s time to relax so I love how easy it is to put-out &amp; relight these. They have a sturdy plastic container that keeps all the smells in so that&#39;s coo. I think the price is decent, 3 for $20. \u000aDry eyes, but totally worth it. \u000aI just checked and they&#39;re made by Puffin Farm btw. Definitely recommend if you&#39;re a lavender-lover like me!
