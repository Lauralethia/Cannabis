VThis is the only strain I can smoke and be 100% certain things will get done. I smoke other strains for pre-chore energy--like Alpha Blue or Stella Blue--but they don&#39;t come with a guarantee I&#39;ll stay on task. Tillamook Strawberry is FOCUSED. I can smoke a couple of hours before work, and even if I haven&#39;t totally sobered up, I know I&#39;m cool. I look and act sober and am actually capable of thinking clearly despite often still being comfortably high. It&#39;s terrific.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s sativa-heavy, and it can trigger the sativa-induced anxiety I&#39;m prone to, but the one time it happened to any significant degree, it wasn&#39;t paralyzing. I felt a little miserable but still totally mellow, and combatted it by tackling chores. In a few minutes I was in a great mood and I got a ton of stuff done.  Did I mention it&#39;s focused?\u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re concentrating on things, you feel mostly sober, but with a lovely, gentle body high. If you chill and let yourself go, your mind will drift into bliss.\u000a\u000aI can&#39;t recommend it enough.

VVery smooth texture. Cant taste the sweet that it describes. But it burns really nice. I got mega sleepy on it. My mom said my eyes were strawberry red. But my eyes went heavy. Then i went down for the count. All in all. A good weed for me to use before bed.

VA very pleasant strain to chief on. This strain is very mood softening and is a great all day smoke. Provides some nice relaxation coupled with a clear focus. The buds are long, frosty, and compact. The color is a limey green with amber and yellow calyxes. The smell was a nutty sweet vanilla. The taste is sweet and woody, with the slightest bit of kush flavor. This hard to come by lady is an absolute pleasure to experience.

VThis Tillamook Strawberry is light at first and then speeds up a little into a smooth ride. Nice cruise with an old friend when you just need to sit back, relax, and melt the wrinkles of worry of your face. It will hold your hand and stroke your hair while telling you that everything is going to be okay. She will quickly yet gentle run over your anxiety speed bumps. However, you&#39;ll be a wallflower when the beats drop heavy from the radio.

VIt entices you with a subtly sweet smell; smooth inhale and smooth exhale. The remaining taste of diesel left in my mouth and nose feels too heavy and strong.
