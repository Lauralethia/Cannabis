VWhat can be said about the Yeti..first it taste amazing,earthy and fruity. Smokes so very smoothly even with monster rips no coughing for me. The smoke is very dense and smooth with a great taste after the inhale. The high was so nice to sit through..lay through lol. You should feel the head high ( creative and comprehensive) the body  high was pure indica goodness. Your body feels like your floating in up and down waves. It is an amazing strain worth the try!

VThis strain. Bigfoot definitely decided to make it nice on the body and mind. Excellent couch-lock effects. No anxiety, just a feeling that you put something great into your body. Got this from dawgstar in a solventless vape pen. Very bad for late night IT work. Do not use this strain when on call. Good for sleep but make sure you have no obligations. Five stars.

VLove the Yeti for a nice relaxing evening. Hits hard and fast. Be prepared to be in bed shortly. \u000aI can say since trying this blend, my sleep has been much deeper and dreams more vivid. Really just zonks you out. Aches and pains right out the door. \u000a\u000aBeautiful flower, with a strange taste. But not unpleasant. Big, fluffy/dense (just the perfect mix) buds from this plant.

VCopped a G of live resin of this Yeti OG from Elevated Extracts about a week ago. Good medicine is very hard to come by where I live and finding live resin of this quality is even more rare. I smoke mostly flower so take from this what you will. In regards to my tolerance. \u000a\u000aI have major depression, ptsd and really bad anxiety attacks. Just really had a chance to sit down and take a decent size dab of this Yeti OG after about 5 days after I got it. The flavor is fruity and light. But honestly I couldn&#39;t really care less about the taste.\u000a\u000aBut the effects, my god this might be the best Indica or stain in general I&#39;ve had I a while. The high is definitely stoney but it&#39;s definitely not a couch locker either and I&#39;m not terribly tired. I feel very functional and more importantly I feel relived...of everything! There&#39;s definitely some cerebral/sativa like effects here too.\u000a\u000aI think the combination of the high thc and cbd definitely are to thank for that and I would 100% recommend this strain on a medial level for the aforementioned conditions and probably a lot more too. \u000a\u000a5/5

VThe $20 quarter special at the Gift Shop this Friday was Yeti Og,&#160;it&#39;s what&#39;s in my bong this Caturday, and it&#39;s delightful! While it only tested at 16.60% THC, it got a whopping .87% CBD, which is high for regular flower. &#160;It&#39;s labeled a 70/30 indica and I would agree with this. &#160;Love the body high from the CBD and I do feel relaxed. &#160; Plus it smells and tastes like ripe skunky orange mint. &#160;I think of an exotic cocktail of blood oranges garnished with mint leaves and rimmed with sugar...\u000a\u000aI&#39;m bummed I didn&#39;t get any seeds out of this cheap quarter, because I&#39;d love to grow this one (I purposefully buy cheap quarters for the seeds). &#160;\u000a\u000aI will enjoy this strain yeti-gain and again.
