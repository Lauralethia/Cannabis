VI\u2019ve tried everything to help with my insomnia and nothing has worked nearly as well as this amazing strain. 30 mins after smoking it and you\u2019re sleeping like a baby. A MUST Have!

VI am currently enjoying a pure CO2 extract of Cascadia Kush in a vape cartridge by Optimum Extracts of WA.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m a low tolerance, occasional smoker, so it only takes 2-3 puffs off the vape for this strain to kick in.  Not sure how long effects last;  I have been taking this before bed, so I am asleep by the time it wears off.  But, I will say that I have been sleeping very well and awakening refreshed.\u000a\u000aSo far, I have found this strain to be rather cerebral (a bit of out-of-body introspection), even a bit psychedelic (hearing voices in the HVAC system), but definitely relaxing after I ease in to the weirdness.  I&#39;ve been told that kushes tend toward the psychedelic, so this strain might support that theory.

VThis strain is beautiful and dark, like the bio-region it&#39;s named after. \u000aIt&#39;s strong though, a little goes a long way. This strain is shapeshifter, shifting with the users set and setting from session to session. I have experienced, from the same batch a range between feeling supremely relaxing and serene moments while doing yoga, to having the biggest panic attack of my life, during a time when my intuition was desperately trying to deliver me an urgent message about my personal safety that I was trying my hardest to tune out. Some might call this pot paranoia. But I&#39;ve experienced cannabis enhanced paranoia and this was real, visceral fear, not my mind running away from me with anxiety.  It&#39;s possible this strain saved my life, that time.
