VI am 1 1/2 bowls in and I am sooooo fucking giddy!! Hehe I almost always smoke alone. But this strain makes me feel like there\u2019s a party in my apartment! I am a 24/7 stoner wake n bake everyday. So my tolerance is high. Not a novice strain kinda feel like I\u2019m floating.

Vgreat hybrid very cerberal high but still makes feel calm and faded like a indica.The taste is  sour and sweet with a hint of citrus. The buds are really green and not too dense. The smell is the best smells like green apple candy.

VAlien Sour Apple sounded like a mutt bud to me. When i first saw it i noticed it looked very healthy, with nice floral/fruity smell. sativa nugs, the hairs were yellow/pink, very nice to look at. The flavor was pretty nice, exhale and you get a taste of sweet fruityness with a slight sour apple finish. The high oddly enough lifts you like a sativa, only to drop you on your head about 45mins in and leave you in slug mode.
