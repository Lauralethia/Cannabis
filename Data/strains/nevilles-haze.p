VI picked up and O of what the person claimed was this, for 4/20. Very excited to be able to smoke it all day without wanting to pass out. Smoked about a gram of it already and it&#39;s very potent, the scent is strong lemon and diesel, taste is earthy, spicy, a true haze. As my girl friend and I both put it, this bud takes you to a different place than most any other buds do. \u000a

VI had never heard of this strain until my buddy handed me a massive quantity and told me to stick my face in it and inhale deeply. I instantly fell in love as I do with all the different Haze&#39;s..it&#39;s safe to say that I&#39;m a Hazy kinda person ;] It absolutely stinks, deeply and thoroughly. The high is pleasantly mellow, deep [like the smell], leaving you with the [sometimes dreaded] burn-out effect. This strain does what I need it to. Hungry, happy, sleepy ;D

VThis is a very powerful smoke. The taste is terrible, but on the plus side it doesn&#39;t take much. I can only relate my first experience of this strain to that of mushrooms. I heard subtle noises all around me, my mind would race, and every time I closed my eyes I saw techno color images swirling about. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for a novice. My only thoughts on the reviews which stated this to be a weak smoke are that it probably wasn&#39;t grown right. This is a long flowering strain, and I could see someone getting fed up and not allowing it to finish properly.

VI must say that I was not impressed by it. A very clear head high, I felt very focused and able to do everything normal. It was like you feel the sensation in your head but you are still there a bit behind the eyes, deeper in your head. It is hard to describe. I felt a bit tingly in my fingers and talking was the best thing to do on this strain. However, like I said some other haze hybrids are stronger and last longer.

VNeville&#39;s Haze is an above-average Haze strain, with effects that lean toward the weightless cerebral kind, which I&#39;m told are redolent of the earlier Haze varieties. The particular strain that I tried was one that was crossed with a variety called &quot;citrus haze,&quot; which combine to create a highly pleasant lime flavor, which with the natural lemony flavor of Neville&#39;s Haze makes for delicious vapor bag and smoke. I find it to inspire racing thoughts and a brooding reflectiveness, which might not make it the best for anxiety or those looking for euphoria and relaxation.

VIt&#39;s very rare that I come across a strain I absolutely dislike to the fullest, and unfortunately this strain falls in that category. Neville&#39;s Haze did not look like the greatest bud, a sativa-like plant structure that looked and felt way too light and fluffy. I did like the scent, as it was presented with hints of sweetness and flowers. And upon exhale I did taste a bit of of that fuel/diesel flavor. I guess it definitely acts as a sativa by making you feel a bit &quot;wired&quot;. You are motivated to work and can go about doing any task, even going to the gym for exercise! It still felt a bit different compared to other sativas I have tried, and I soon realized why. Every single time I&#39;m burning out after smoking Neville&#39;s Haze (around 2 hours after the initial smoke), I am hit with the most crippling anxiety. It isn&#39;t much of paranoia (although there is still a bit of that as well) but the actual feeling of anxiety is overwhelming. And it happened 9/10 times with this strain. This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you shouldn&#39;t try it! \u000a\u000aLook: 2/5 \u000aScent: 5/5 \u000aHigh: 4/5\u000aBurnout: 1/5\u000aOverall: 1/5

VHad so much caffeine that I hit the ceiling in an I-wonder-if-my-heartbeat-is-infringing-on-Krewella-copyrights kind of way. This evened me out again.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ll update this review in more favorable circumstances.

VWasn&#39;t happy with her growth characteristics, but she does clone extremely well. I also read that she is hard to flower. That was not my experience. I grew 2 of these, one in soil, one in hydro. The hydro had too many issues and I eventually made clones out of her. Clones only took about a week to show massive amounts of root structure, was very pleased with that. The plant I grew in soil was 8 weeks old when I placed her in my flowering room. Within 4 days I had buds starting. That was 3 days ago, and she now has bud structure along most of her branches.

VThis review may not stay here only because I tested NV out last night and it put me to sleep. It may have been that I was running around for 9.5 hours at work and was already exhausted by the time I got home but I&#39;m not the biggest fan so far. I&#39;m going to give it another try when I&#39;m Not so exhausted and hopefully I&#39;ll notice a difference but so far not a big fan :(. although I did get pretty hungry and ate a huge bowl of pasta which probably wasn&#39;t a good thing but the worst part was the &quot;hangover the next morning. I slept in super late (day off no biggie) but I hate that groggy exhausted feeling the next day. I&#39;m hoping the next time I try it I won&#39;t get that feeling again. Looking for something that doesn&#39;t make me so tired and groggy in the morning as well as right after I&#39;ve smoked it. \u000aAlso side note: may have been because I smoked too much since I&#39;m not a big smoker. Wanting to try or different strains to see how motivated/ productive I can be with migraine relief but no hangover feeling the next day!  Wish me luck.
