VI got a little anxious at first,  but as time went on i became incredibly relaxed and focused.  The munchies were real, and so was the dry mouth,  but not enough to bother me. You might want to do this during the morning or early afternoon,  I had trouble sleeping for awhile but that was to be expected. Felt very happy and talkative.  Would be great for pain relief.

VPicked up some jacks dream yesterday an 8th of it.  The nugs are pretty bug and so dense! Those fiery orange hairs are just beautiful and are all over the bud. Not really too much visible thc but once i bust the bud open all ta beauty showed. The high is almost as if your not high but you know something is happening. (Well at least thats what i got the first few puffs from my pipe. But today. I took some huge puffs and totally got he full effects. Its really heady but super clear. I did get a little paranoia and slight anxiety but im learning to get through that. But it did pass after a while of me distracting myself with chores. I felt nice and relaxed and more tolerable to stupid shit. Id say this is a good strain but pace yourself

VDude, this strain is dope. Not very strong, you can definitely smoke this all day. But a nice boost of energy with a mellow body and head buzz. You smoke this in the morning before running errands but also very good for when you want to kick back and play video games. Pretty good flavor, berry like with an undertone of wood. Only four stars due to the short high

VDude, this strain is dope. Not very strong, I can smoke this all day and I did. Great burst of energy with a mellow head and body tingle. This is the kind of strain you smoke in the morning before running errands. But also great if you wanna kick back and play some video games. Great flavor, very berry like. Only four stars due to it being such a short high

VThis strain makes you dull and nothing else. Same was felt by 3 of my friends. How can this be a sativa hybrid when all it does is make you lethargic.
