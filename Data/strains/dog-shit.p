VThis strain smells exactly like dog shit. But the high is decent enough. Typical Sativa high, once burned the smell isn&#39;t too bad. The taste is alright. I really enjoy fruity and earthy buds, but overall I think the high was about equivalent to other sativas.

VI wasn&#39;t a huge fan of this - shouldn&#39;t have been too surprised either. Enjoyed via a J, the smoke was harsh and the high wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. Got the gram for 8 bucks though. So there&#39;s that.

VDoesnt taste really good, but when it comes to the feeling, I felt relaxed and in a really good mood, kinda difficult to control too, but really good if you have insomnia... when I got home from my friends house, as soon as I touched my bed, K.O hahaha. Not the best, but good.

VF\u2019d me up man. This thing is no joke. \u000aDid a bong rip right before a school dance, fell asleep on my food at Pizza Hut (the guys take the girls out to dinner before dances), drove around town in my beat down Jeep that had NO heat in the middle of winter AND ONE HEADLIGHT WAS OUT. Anyways, made it to the school dance next I\u2019m home sleeping. When I wake up I PEE THE FREAKING BED GUYS! I was 18. Take this if you want a good trip.

VA new favorite grown by an old friend.  Happiness and energy while being relaxed at the same time.  26% thc on mine.  This is no doubt a late afternoon delight.  The only negative for some might be increased appetite.  I&#39;m too skinny to care luckily.  I have heard this strain was popular in Oregon throughput the 80s.

VDon&#39;t be turned off by the name. Dog poo offers a very happy high with little sparks of social energy and the propensity for munchies in high doses. Smell is strong, taste is pungent with berry undertones.

VThis strain was incredibly easy to grow. It was very resistant to all diseases. Grown under 600 watt LED and organically. During veg it definitely smelled of dog shit but quickly turned into a very sweet and sour fruity smell. The taste is very smooth and the high is all around great. I definitely recommend this strain to new growers and people dealing with heavy stress

VDefinetly reminiscent to its name. The earthy flavor was strong in this strain. The ending flavor also tended to be as mentioned above. Very stinky sticky and icky. By icky I mean super dope. Overall I enjoyed the uplifting high and appreciated the flavors. &#128538;&#128168;\u000a

Vwe have another form of animal extremist although this one of a different sort. Dog Shit is a Sativa dominant hybrid that is well known for its aroma, and taste which, as you can probably guess, strongly resembles dog feces. Made from Purple Zacatecas, crossed with Columbian Gold, Cambodian, and Afghani this strain, if you can get over the taste and smell, has a very relaxing and creative vibe associated with it. Energy and euphoria are also known to accompany this potent strain, but for most, the smell is just a little too much to handle.
