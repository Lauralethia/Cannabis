Vone of the Planetary strains\u000aPicked up half a gram of this at Zen OC in Garden Grove.\u000aIt was the weekend so i decided to pick up this strain as Wax, boy was I glad I made this choice, although I do not believe Zen had this as a flower.\u000aWax: Tan with mix of darkk deep green. Crumbly and easy to work on a dabber. \u000aSmell: Earthy, hint of citrus, and sharp OG.\u000aTaste: A fat dab of this resulted in a mouthful of FLAVOR! tasty fresh dank OG, with a couple lemon drops thrown into the obvious Earthy taste. \u000aOverall: A blob of this and I was instantly medicated from head to toe.., second blob lead to smiles, giggles, and shitting rainbows, third dab got me thinking if i should have took a third dab...not too many thoughts followed that.

VThis strand has a strong dirt, earth, woody taste to it, very earthy. It&#39;s not a bad taste but it&#39;s that great either. This is not a cougher strain but the high was pretty amazing. This strain has a very strong OG taste, HEAVY body high. Rating 8.8 out of 10.

VVery weed-smelling weed; incredibly hoppy. The entire room smells like a frosty IPA, though without the bitterness. Anvery smooth, relaxing high that slides up your shoulders and finishes behind your eyes, illiciting a dopey grin and a ravenous appetite. Wears off very quickly, leaving a profound sense of everythibg-id-awesomeness.

VI did not care for this at all. Firstly, the high isn&#39;t potent at all - I couldn&#39;t even feel like I had been smoking, even two bowls in. Secondly, it gave me a headache immediately, and it only intensified as the come-down continued. To top it off, this strain gave me massive paranoia which ramped up my anxiety ten-fold.

VHoly F***! I&#39;d been seeing this strain at my local club for a while now, but passed it up until today.  It smelled very earthy (the name haha) and I had to buy some.  Immediately I felt a strong cerebral head buzz and a mild but still dense body high.  Reminds me of my earlier smoking days when all strains would knock me out.  No headaches like some other strains give too

VEarth OG is a very natural and woody strain. Stemming from Sour Diesel, and Ghost OG. This Flower has great medicinal properties. Great for Depression, sleep , and appetite control, this strain can be smoked throughout the day without having the &quot;overly &quot;medicated&quot; feeling.

VI really liked this. I mixed it with J1, so I can&#39;t say how much of this review is due to the earth og, but I&#39;ll try. I was a bit shaky but overall felt physically comfortable. Headache pain relieved by the high, but came back around the comedown, but I can&#39;t blame the weed for that. Very focused, can laugh, can write and take time to be introverted, more appreciative, calmer, floating. Felt fine to sit and watch a few TV shows, but I could have also read a book or studied for pharmacology.

Vearth OG in a blueberry swisher\u000a   strawberry flavors tended to show over blueberry, but with deep, heavy earthy undertones that trailed with quick heavyset coughs ranging Almost until ur next hit which compressed the undertones. A sharp paranoid episode occurred right after. heart beat slightly raced. after applying a control, Hunger became more evident which applied to a deep charge to my endocannabinoid glands forcing more hormones to make. tiredness trailed along with slight dopeyness.

Vlike one of the other reviews...  I too am an indica smoker.  I have gotten paranoid/anxious with weed in the  past.  Now I only smoke Indica.  This Hybrid hits you hard the first hit you take a hit(body/head).  But the head high will go away quite quickly.  The Body high is extremely relaxing and will knock u out.  It is a very pleasant high.  \u000aPS...  I&#39;m a Skywalker (indica) smoker..  this is a nice change of pace.
