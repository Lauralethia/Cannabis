VI am not usually a marijuana connoisseur, so this review is a bit different from others. I suffer from chronic migraines and hate taking the prescription meds I have bc of the side effects. I bought the Woody strain to smoke in a vape, and it TOTALLY gets rid of my migraines with 2 or 3 hits/pulls. It\u2019s a miracle for me. I don\u2019t like the taste of it, but I don\u2019t care. This is a gift from the heavens!!

VTonight was the first time for me using both a Co2 oil in a vape pen and the strain Woody Kush.  The oil has a very earthy flavor (even tasted it when I got a spot on my finger figuring how to load to pen), hence the name, almost like &quot;American Spirit&quot; tobacco, but with a cannabis twang at the end. Nice feeling of &quot;everything settling down&quot;,  perfect end to a long day. Still have some energy to do stuff, but I can hear my bed calling my name

Hard on the inhale,definite wood smell as it burns but a pleasant pine taste on the exhale. Not a one-hitter quitter but it will put u to sleep after u medicate.
