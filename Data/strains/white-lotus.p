VIt come is after a 15 minute delay and clouds your senses. Sticks around for about an hour of munchies then eases its tender grasp over your head. The after effects of the high will linger but only after an hour or so of smoking. \u000a\u000a

VWowie zowie!! I smoked a small bowl of this strain for the first time yesterday and it was completely amazing! I&#39;d had a few things in my place go tits up in the last few days and had just gotten the news that it was going to be another few days before things could be fixed. I also had only gotten 6 hours sleep in the previous 2 days, so I really needed something exactly like this. After a couple of tokes of this, I was giddy, happy, laughing at everything, and then I was off to bed and slept for a very long time. This is the best strain I&#39;ve smoked in a very long time. I highly recommend it!

VUpdating my review.  Only sometimes causes nerve pain.  Other times causes tinnitus.  However, it smells and tastes like incense and that alone is worth occasionally indulging.

VThis one is a little tough for me.  I think I&#39;m sticking with a 3.8 score.  The reason is that it made my mood worse.  However, it worked wonderfully for the inflammation, so it is definitely good medicine.  I definitely encourage others to try it - just because it made my mood worse, doesn&#39;t mean it will for everyone, and the medical value it holds certainly outweigh the mood problem possibilities, especially if they smoke something else for mood afterward.

VWhen grown correctly, White Lotus is an amazing night-time medicinal! Growers have ruined White Lotus by making a 50/50 Indica/Sativa ratio, when the ratio no matter what is supposed to be Indica Dominant! I know White Lotus is indeed a hybrid, but when grown improperly and not put into medicinal concentrates for like fifteen bucks for summer like from the Local Root or the K Mart a GREAT IDEA GUY&#39;S DO IT for the WA SNO CO Area! I know Fruit of the Root know&#39;s it is Indica Dominant and the reason I continue to emphasize this important detail: because White Lotus DOES HAVE A HEALING CHEMICAL IN IT WHEN PRODUCED PRIMARILY INDICA! Unfortunately growers need to realize this, and it is the same thing for Purple Buddha that Green Rush could never figure out that you must grow the Purps has Mendocino Purple only being PRIMARILY INDICA! I can honestly testify that BOTH White Lotus and Purple Buddha DO in-fact treat: TBI from the military (for me it was USMC the head injury occurred) but for other injured soldiers (even for those whom are POW) it can curate brain deformities and other SERIOUS brain injures making it a BIG sell for the K Mart or The Local Root or the Millennium Extract that produces a Day-Time TBI Medicine Pink Buddha, but from all the 4,000 Plus buds, these 3 buds are the ONLY thing effective in treating TBI PLEASE PUT IN CONCENTRATE WA SNOCO WE LOVE SNO CO AND WA!

VI don&#39;t know what you guys were smoking but the White Lotus I got from a certain someone demolished my brain. I could do all the basic functions but the rest of my brain was an add on I didn&#39;t quite have the money to pay for if you know what I&#39;m saying... Best strain I&#39;ve ever had the fortune to huff ... Oh and not to mention the munchies.... Holy H Christ I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off the fridge
