VFor the cannabis fanatic going after a smoking experience focused on flavor, Guava Kush is what you&#39;re looking for. It&#39;s sweet, tropical flavors are strong and just overall delicious. But, considering this is a sativa (the Guava Kush I got from my dispensary was measured at 85/15 sativa dominant), this isn&#39;t a strain that you would smoke during the day. It makes you extremely sleepy during the high. This is not a pick me up sativa whatsoever. I give it a 3 star rating because of it&#39;s flavor and the fact that it gives you a good smoking experience, but the fact that it has such a strong sativa lineage, makes it kind of misleading. \u000a\u000aKeep this strain to lazy Sundays or mixing with a heavy hitting sweet flavored indica for right before bed.

But soon I notices I just wasn\u2019t getting it, at all. It was weird but all I get is a very faint buzz. I had to end up smoking(vaping) my Key Lime Pie that I had a lil off.

Its helping immensely with my anxiety and depression and stress. I feel mellow. Relaxed. Kinda acrid with an underlying sweet tone to it. The draw is good. Won&#39;t slaughter your lungs.

VI wanted to try a new hybrid so I decided to Try the Guava Strain.  I was not impressed. The effects were not effective. I felt a buzz, but it was a really short one.  Their are other strains more effective Everyone has their own preference, each strain affects people differently. This may work for you, but there&#39;s better options. \u000a\u000aThe interesting thing about this strain is it literally tasted and smelled like White Guava.
