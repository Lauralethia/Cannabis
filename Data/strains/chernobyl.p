Vthis is my newest and most favorite strain , because of what it has done for not just one but multiple problems , first it was suggested that I try this strain for its ability to calm me from my anxiety, but then I noticed that my headaches ,and diabetes were under control as well as minor aches and pains .\u000a the smoke is like a thick yet mellow drift of pine wood burning and a smell that triggers you memory centre and reminds you of a quick joint behind the back stop in high school, it tastes like a  mouthful of lemon heads and lime mike and ikes, if flushed correctly the taste is so strong it will stay with the bowl till suck through.\u000achernobyl takes about 30 seconds to 3 minutes to take effect , the unbearable feeling of lightness ,super floaty, no more worries , and yet the feeling of great ability and accomplishment can accompany all the medical benefits mentioned before, I have heard reports of immediate relief from migraines and other pains .\u000a As I said before this is my favorite strain and I suggest you try and find this one if you need relief from lifes doldrums.

VThis strain fits me to the T! I would like to elaborate more on the strength rating I had given. I would give it a 10 if there was a rating for the duration of time one feels medicated. Chernobyl sets me up at an 8 and i&#39;m at 8 for about 2-3 hours if the conditions are right. I have anxiety issues and Chernobyl helps me get to to a good place both physically and mentally, making what would be difficult and nerve racking tasks, painless and peaceful. While medicated, my brain feels like it has a shell of numbness around it and my eyes drop just a tad...not much but I feel it and the pressure is lifted from my temples and it is like stress and all worries are at peace with me.  I can accomplish tasks of any nature or I can chill out and watch a movie because this strain is versatile and does not give me &quot;stony&quot; moments but rather great focus and mind expansion along with a long stroll of a body buzz that is never pushy but always there. Fantastic strain and I would recommend to any sativa/hybrid lover world wide!!!

VFor a while, I smoked or vaped this at night or in the afternoon, when I had nothing left to do all day. I can say that while I could do all my homework completely stoned on this stuff, it didn&#39;t seem all that &quot;fun&quot; at first compared to some other strains. However, I can now say that I think I know what Chernobyl&#39;s high is best for.. A college student&#39;s wake-n-bake. It&#39;s a great active high as long as you don&#39;t have to drive, and it makes everything more interesting and even allows me to focus MORE in lectures than I do sober.

VFirst time with this strain, ever!  Wow, I absolutely love it!  Definitely more sativa dominant as I don&#39;t feel much fatigue so I&#39;d say a definite 60/40 up to 75/25 leaning sativa.  The high is sharp and seems to come and go.  It helps a lot with focus, it&#39;s almost like drinking 2-3 cups of coffee.  It helps with my focus problems. \u000a\u000aExcellent  day time medicine but high doesn&#39;t last long until you rip one REALLY fat one then you&#39;ll be PS-welded for a few hours and will wonder, whoa, time flew, man!  I absolutely love this strain and has put my Jack Herrer as main day time medicine.\u000a\u000aSmoking too much made me anxious and tired.  Amateur tokers may get paranoid if too much is taken but is overall a very social but mellow high.\u000a\u000aI have MS and it nearly eliminates any involuntary movements.\u000a\u000aDefinitely in my top 3 hybrids.

Vvery potent strain testing at 25% THC. the effects of just a couple hits can sometimes be overwhelming for those who do not have a tolerance. the buds and leaves are covered in crystals and turn very beautiful colors when let go longer in flower. it is not a big yielder and tends to stretch. i prefer to lst in veg.  you wont get the biggest nugs, but you will still probably have to prop the heavy branches up with poles later in flower. it normally does not have much flavor but there is a lime pheno. dont go too heavy on the nutrients.

VSelected Chernobyl as one of two clones purchased for my first grow which was outdoors and started in July which is a little late, but with just basic soil and miracle grow, I ended up with a very potent 4oz+ plant. Everyone including myself is surprised at the quality so I definitely recommend this strain to first time growers as it wasnt very picky and handled temperatures from 100F down to the mid 30s by harvest time with no trouble.

VI&#39;ve had a few smokes with Chernobyl and it is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  Like the amazing strain Green Crack, Chernobyl also suffers from an off-putting name.  Don&#39;t get hung up on the nomenclature, and give this a try.  After smoking a few bowls of Chernobyl, I felt immense waves of positive energy and gratitude flood over me.  I had mental clarity and insight to think through some heavy stuff that had been weighing me down. Depression and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) were alleviated and I had energy to do my daily exercise and meditation. Even after my high wore off, the rest of my day was amazing.  I felt balanced and harmonious with the earth and my fellow beings.  Chernobyl will always be welcome in my stash.

VChernobyl&#39;s effects are pharmaceutical grade, minus the bad side effects, and a lot more rapid onset.  It works beautifully for anxiety, depression, pain, and muscle spasms.  I have Lupus, anxiety disorder, and depression issues.  This strain is a godsend for daytime, not leaving the drowsiness, after the high.  I feel very focused, calm, and tension free, in  mind, and body too.  Not a heavy stony effect, good for days that are more fast paced.

VChernobyl is a staple for our patients and for us personally. One of the few we always keep handy. Great day time med, allows you to keep going about your business. Strong for muscle and joint pain. Also great for headaches. Grows beautifully, flowers in 8-9 weeks. Isn&#39;t an overly hungry strain to grow, so not as expensive for nutrients.  Very picturesque!

VThis is one of those rare strains where you never want it to run out, it hits so smooth and tasty, consistently. You never fade to the trichomes on the Chernobyl plant, whereas other buds you may grow accustomed to their high, this is not the case with C4! I have grown this plant and it makes unique leaf patterns unlike other hybrids, part of the leaf has a light yellow hue and the other a nice green, and its not a sign of lack of nutrition, it is the phenotype. What a blessed strain this one is, more Sativa dominant with its alert causing rush. But beware just because its alert does not mean it is NOT DISTRACTING!!! You may have every intention of doing something (like walking) and just have two left feet all because of the potency of this strain. It will have you laughing instead of walking, and thinking creatively two steps ahead of yourself, and then thinking, OMG I was supposed to do to XYZ today!

It worked great for pain, nausea, insomnia, headaches, and it makes you hungry. I felt comfortably numb and happy. Not really sedating, but relaxing. I also noticed how clear my mind was. I was creative, surprising myself! I use the bong, my preferred method.

VSmells and tastes exactly like lime Fun Dip.  The buds smelled so good, I wanted to eat them.  Two hits from small pipe was all I needed to get pretty high.  My first thought was &#39;thank god I don&#39;t have to drive right now, I&#39;d be screwed&#39;.  Once I got over the paranoia, I developed a need to explore, so I wandered to Fisherman&#39;s Wharf.  Bad idea, but the confused tourists were more lost than I, so I put up with the crowds in a state of bliss.  I was so high at one point that I was almost hit by a cable car, fun times.  This did nothing for my nerve pain, but that was to be expected.  The head buzz was so much fun, I forgot about any pain.  I highly recommend Chernobyl.

VOverall I gave the Chernobyl a 7 based on the fact that the high is really short, generously I&#39;d say around 70 minutes long. The high is great though, erased pain and any/all cares I had within 15 seconds of exhaling my first hit. I would highly recommend this strain to anyone looking to relax and ease pain. Great for a day of video games/movies/tv/etc...I would recommend getting another strain along with the Chernobyl; as I said, relatively shorter high, ands I also noticed that I became quickly tolerant to the Chernobyl&#39;s effects so I&#39;d recommend getting something to go along with the Chernobyl...say maybe Blue Dream...?

VWhen I packed Chernobyl into my zongroller, I was happy when the first hit delivered that strong, amazing limonine taste. Once the lemon zing hits your palete, a strong lime accent denotes the finish. I have noticed that the Chernobyl I smoked in Denver was actually higher in Trans b-ocimene generally in flavor profile. The buds were indoor and very tight, very crisp as well. The Moss Crossing Chernobyl nugs are much better than what I had smoked prior. These nugs are truer to form, and grow with a more vibrant orange, and slight golden tint. The Limonine hit me first, and It&#39;s anti-depressant effects came to me quickly.  Due to my ADHD, I ingest this strain prior to sleeping; many instead would ingest it in the early day. I am very fond of this strain, and would certainly purchase it once again.

VWOW!  what attracted me to this strain was, I read that it was good for those cursed with anxiety problems.  and for me, it did indeed help immensely!  I didn&#39;t feel so &quot;on edge&quot; the way I had been feeling. really helped me to chill out.

VIf you planted a pine tree and it had super sap dank lemon sunshine inside, then you&#39;d have Chernobyl (21.3% THC/3.38% CBD).

VWhen I packed Chernobyl into my zongroller, I was happy when the first hit delivered that strong, amazing limonine taste. Once the lemon zing hits your palete, a strong lime accent denotes the finish. I have noticed that the Chernobyl I smoked in Denver was actually higher in Trans b-ocimene generally in flavor profile. The buds were indoor and very tight, very crisp as well. The Moss Crossing Chernobyl nugs are much better than what I had smoked prior. These nugs are truer to form, and grow with a more vibrant orange, and slight golden tint. The Limonine hit me first, and It&#39;s anti-depressant effects came to me quickly.  Due to my ADHD, I ingest this strain prior to sleeping; many instead would ingest it in the early day. I am very fond of this strain, and would certainly purchase it once again.

VMood:  Wednesday 3pm. I have some organizing to do, but not motivated i would rather lay in bed and watch mind numbing TV. Seeing as it\u2019s only 3 pm right now I can\u2019t go to sleep yet. \u000aAfter smoking: I bought this in Seattle Wa from puffin farms, it was EVFO Dab.  Seriously amazing daytime strain when you want to do something but still chill.  The energy creeps up like a little nudge, your mind has ideas and you feel extremely focused on what you are doing, exactly what\u2019s happening now. No anxiety, no paranoia. I feel relaxed , I have the \u201cmental energy\u201d to organize, the physical jolt I needed  and I\u2019m hella focused. \u000aI would totally smoke this again. ENJOY!!!!

VMood:  Wednesday 3pm. I have some organizing to do, but not motivated i would rather lay in bed and watch mind numbing TV. Seeing as it\u2019s only 3 pm right now I can\u2019t go to sleep yet. \u000aAfter smoking: I bought this in Seattle Wa from puffin farms, it was EVFO Dab.  Seriously amazing daytime strain when you want to do something but still chill.  The energy creeps up like a little nudge, your mind has ideas and you feel extremely focused on what you are doing, exactly what\u2019s happening now. No anxiety, no paranoia. I feel relaxed , I have the \u201cmental energy\u201d to organize, the physical jolt I needed  and I\u2019m hella focused. \u000aI would totally smoke this again. ENJOY!!!!

VAmazing. Cures my anxiety and is one of the few strains I can be productive on without even thinking about it. Amazing bud structure and trichomes on this strain as well as an amazing scent and taste. A good mixture of sweet and citrus smell and taste. Leans significantly more sativa than indica.

VWhen I packed Chernobyl into my zongroller, I was happy when the first hit delivered that strong, amazing limonine taste. Once the lemon zing hits your palete, a strong lime accent denotes the finish. I have noticed that the Chernobyl I smoked in Denver was actually higher in Trans b-ocimene generally in flavor profile. The buds were indoor and very tight, very crisp as well. The Moss Crossing Chernobyl nugs are much better than what I had smoked prior. These nugs are truer to form, and grow with a more vibrant orange, and slight golden tint. The Limonine hit me first, and It&#39;s anti-depressant effects came to me quickly.  Due to my ADHD, I ingest this strain prior to sleeping; many instead would ingest it in the early day. I am very fond of this strain, and would certainly purchase it once again.

VIf you planted a pine tree and it had super sap dank lemon sunshine inside, then you&#39;d have Chernobyl (21.3% THC/3.38% CBD). Amazing taste, thick smoke that lingers in the air and makes the room smell awesome. Gorgeous and frosty bud. \u000a\u000aSativas usually give me anxiety but this doesn&#39;t. The best way to describe the feeling after smoking it is &quot;whoa, I feel relieved&quot;. All my stress and worry is gone but I can function totally fine and get things done. Makes me smile. Perfect for wake and bake. Also helps with nausea and gives me some much needed munchies. \u000a\u000aOverall this is one of the best strains I&#39;ve ever had.

VI&#39;ll be a little conservative with my rating as I&#39;m a recently reactivated smoker and have a low tolerance. Buds looked very nice and healthy, had a fruity smell (like sherbet). I was feeling pretty down when I medicated and this picked me right up. Spent a lovely day outside near a lake. Great trip.

VFirst timer with this strain. Broad and leafy style buds with a strong earthy scent. The high comes on rather quickly and produces a giggly energetic response. It allowed me tune down the peripheral sharpness yet still feel that euphoric glee while allowing my mind to appreciate the smaller details of life at any given moment. The high has a smooth taper-off effect that didn&#39;t leave me feeling depleted afterwards. In fact, the mellow uplifting response continues to be felt far past the cerebral buzz phase. A very clean high and recommended for whatever comes your way during the day.

VThe batch I tried was labeled as the &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; Chernobyl pheno. Very nice looking buds, a lighter green, compact and dense, but grind very nicely. Powered the first hit to the point of coughing on purpose, then went moderate on the next two. The pungent presence of Jack the Ripper is unmistakeable, but the other strains balance and level off the Jack very nicely. Pleasant, very relaxing buzz. Cerebral, but not in a &quot;zone out&quot; way. When I&#39;m done here, my daily chores will not suffer procrastination. Despite CBDs clocking in at 1.18%, I don&#39;t find this to be a big pain-reliever, but good to help you forget you&#39;re in pain to begin with. Giving it four stars due to the limitations of the rating system, but I&#39;d rather give it 4.5.

VI was also concerned to find out this strain was a sativa, but this strain was actually helped me consider that some sativa are  better for my mental and physical health than a lot of indicas. chernobyl made me happy, and uplifted, and got rid of my social anxiety.

VThis amazing hybrid offers so much medically while simultaneously knocking me on my ass in one hit. It&#39;s smooth, social, and funny, just like that jerk you liked in high school. Except this one won&#39;t dump you in front of his drunk and laughing jock friends. Chernobyl is much more a charmer, and makes you feel warm and at home. Curl up with a good book, a cat, or some hilarious YouTube videos, because this is one to take home like a soulmate.

And I love the smell of citrus this gives us, it&#39;s really overpowering but in a good way! The smell alone will get you a bit excited for the high as you tell yourself, &quot;this is going to be fun!&quot;. And fun it was my friends! Cerebral focused high that puts you in a very good mood, relaxed state, and uplifted spirit. Doesn&#39;t leave you feeling like crap after a couple hours. You can do many things with strain from gaming to art to socializing. Actually I believe this strain would be perfect to face social anxiety, it can really work wonders in a moderate amount. On top of it all, even though it is sativa-dominant, I was easily able to sleep an hour or two after the smoke!\u000a\u000aLook: 5/5\u000aScent: 5/5 (super citrus)\u000aHigh: 5/5\u000aBurnout: 5/5\u000aOverall: 5/5

I arrived at one of my favorite dispenserys and asked the budtender to show me something new, he showed me three or four strains befor I was show what I call &quot;Megaton&quot;. The bud itself is very spongy in density and is coated in trecombs. The smoke taste of lime and lemon sherbet and it goes down smooth.  For a birthday batch I was really impressed and surprised. will defently be one if my new go to strains. -Budsey.

VWhen I packed Chernobyl into my zongroller, I was happy when the first hit delivered that strong, amazing limonine taste. Once the lemon zing hits your palete, a strong lime accent denotes the finish. I have noticed that the Chernobyl I smoked in Denver was actually higher in Trans b-ocimene generally in flavor profile. The buds were indoor and very tight, very crisp as well. The Moss Crossing Chernobyl nugs are much better than what I had smoked prior. These nugs are truer to form, and grow with a more vibrant orange, and slight golden tint. The Limonine hit me first, and It&#39;s anti-depressant effects came to me quickly.  Due to my ADHD, I ingest this strain prior to sleeping; many instead would ingest it in the early day. I am very fond of this strain, and would certainly purchase it once again.

VI&#39;ve tried many strains in hopes that one would give me that &#39;first times trying weed&#39; sort-of-high...None really got me there until I tried this. Despite the intimidating name, it&#39;s one of the most relaxed, uplifting highs I&#39;ve ever felt...A quality strain that&#39;s good for both chillin&#39; alone with music or a hobby, or hanging out with friends or even strangers. It&#39;s that good. I found myself laughing a lot too without even mixing it with alcohol or other stimulants. Great, great strain. The little I have left glowing on a pedestal like the scene with the golden idol head from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

This is a super fun strain to smoke, from its delicious flavor and aromas to the creative happy vibe that the flower creates. As a sativa dominant hybrid, this strain medicinally excels at pain management, depression mitigation, fatigue, stress management, headaches, inflammation and digestive issues.

Under the small lights, the bud glistened and its a nice citrus smell to it.\u000a\u000aI rolled the smallest pinner ive eve rolled and shared with a friend. The effects were amazing especially on a cold Sunday afternoon where all we wanted to do was chill. I felt alert but relaxed. Nothing mattered in the world and we were stuck in heavy traffic for an hour. Long lasting cerebral effects without the heavy munchies.. felt medicated for 3 hrs!

VThis was my first time trying flower after being a weekly edible user and this strain is definitely not my cup of tea. The high was quite a roller coaster ride. It started pretty slow, with the first effects being a heavy and loose feeling body high. This moved into my head and made me a bit foggy. However, at about an hour in I suddenly got nausea, a racing heart, and some anxiety, which kinda ruined what had been a pretty good ride thus far.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m definitely going to give it another try when I&#39;ve got some more experience, but so far it&#39;s definitely not something I see myself getting more of.

The first dab of this explosive strain blew me away not with potency but taste. The potency level is accurately described as tame but still not recomended for anyone unfamiliar with the cerebral buzz of &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;Jack crosses&quot;. I can see myself in the future keeping at least a gram of this strain on hand for very active days requiring a little focus and stress relief.

VI was also concerned to find out this strain was a sativa, but this strain was actually helped me consider that some sativa are  better for my mental and physical health than a lot of indicas. chernobyl made me happy, and uplifted, and got rid of my social anxiety.

The intensity got of te buzz got higher couldn&#39;t really get together what was going on and ten BOOM!!! fucking stone extremely carefree and relaxed the energy behind it was amazing!!! AMAZING. Eventually all comes to a and end as it came down it left me in a very uplifted mode extremely happy and relax I wasn&#39;t super energize but felt like I could just keep on going but also I would have random zoning out time.

VA catching name for a catching strain. With an impressive amount of trichomes resembling nuclear fallout, this sativa-dominant bud delivers with a euphoric experience which is not too overpowering. I have enjoyed smoking this strain while working on my computer this past week, and I ultimately believe it is ideal for those who want a quality buzz while still remaining functional. The smoke is smooth, the smell is subtle, and sensations endure for a decent amount of time... and that&#39;s why this strain misses a 5 star rating. With an intense of name such as this, not living up to the expected hype is a slight disappointment. While I would certainly reccommend this strain, it is not &quot;atomic bud&quot;. Fair price: $15/gram.

VFor me, this was definitely a sativa dominant, slow burn and nice effects. it won&#39;t couch lock you, but kills pain fairly well. the taste was the only thing I didn&#39;t care for, it&#39;s a very clean, limey taste with a strange linger after the initial hit. I would recommend it to medical patients who want a good balance of pain killing and a nice cerebral stimulation.

VThe batch I tried was labeled as the &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; Chernobyl pheno. Very nice looking buds, a lighter green, compact and dense, but grind very nicely. Powered the first hit to the point of coughing on purpose, then went moderate on the next two. The pungent presence of Jack the Ripper is unmistakeable, but the other strains balance and level off the Jack very nicely. Pleasant, very relaxing buzz. Cerebral, but not in a &quot;zone out&quot; way. When I&#39;m done here, my daily chores will not suffer procrastination. Despite CBDs clocking in at 1.18%, I don&#39;t find this to be a big pain-reliever, but good to help you forget you&#39;re in pain to begin with. Giving it four stars due to the limitations of the rating system, but I&#39;d rather give it 4.5.

VFirst timer with this strain. Broad and leafy style buds with a strong earthy scent. The high comes on rather quickly and produces a giggly energetic response. It allowed me tune down the peripheral sharpness yet still feel that euphoric glee while allowing my mind to appreciate the smaller details of life at any given moment. The high has a smooth taper-off effect that didn&#39;t leave me feeling depleted afterwards. In fact, the mellow uplifting response continues to be felt far past the cerebral buzz phase. A very clean high and recommended for whatever comes your way during the day.

VChernobyl, or in my case &#39;Slymer&#39; (from family strain? as far as I could find) through my Vaporizer was smooth sailing... I used 365&#39; temp and tend to tread lightly into new strains and I also just prefer to ease into the effects. That said, Chernobyl was smooth and after 3-5 light draws and I found a heady high with some decent clarity still present. Appreciated the lime and earth flavors that were balanced and smooth. I feel there is at least another level to the strain if you wanted to &#39;turn up the heat&#39;... probably a much more heady high that rolls into a deeper mellow-out on the backend.. as it stands to me, solid 4 star strain (5 to me is for truly unique strains grown to perfection) Recommended..

VThis smoke hit immediately, with a stronger touch on the cerebral / sativa side. While on the other hand the body high is very nice but doesn&#39;t seem to come thru as strong. I would recommend this smoke for daytime or even during work. I found it to be great for motivation, anxiety and stress. The smell and taste of the strain transfer nicely with a sweet lemon lime pastry type flavor. Others have compared it to a lime Slurpee. The buds were dense and tight.

The high is great for daytime use, uplifting and slightly energetic. The buzz did not last long enough for me though, about one hour. The flowers looked pretty with a silver sheen over purple calyxes. If you see it, give ger a try. THC 19.8% CBD .1%

VDefinitely a great strain for any artist in my personal opinion or even a writer suffering from Writers-Block as it really spiked a great deal of creativity, clear-minded,  uplifting hybrid effect.  Neither the Indica or the Sativa aspect of this strain dominates. Seems to me it&#39;s one of the most balanced hybrids I&#39;ve yet to try. Flavor way a bit like a papaya with not a of something else I was never able to be my tqste-buds to come up with a name for it, unique for sure. Excellent hybrid for any novice &amp; up smoker or taken with caution.
