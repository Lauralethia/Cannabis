VAt first smell it&#39;s strong pine with what smells to me like orange zest or citrus . Once I grind it the skunk gets strong in this one. Seriously smooth and strong enough to pass on the second bowl. Thank you to my friends at Tru Med for the suggestion.

VA True OG for the OG seeking bud lover. A very stinky and distinctive smell of pine and skittles and everything about that kush stench once you open the jar. This flower burns beautifully white ash and tastes delicious until the last toke. Bong was my weapon of choice.

VI love powerhouse strains!!! Supermax OG is a must for insomniacs, people with eating problems, or overall pain management. It lives up to its Supermax name with a high THC content (around 23% in Az), these buds are frosty, sticky, and reek of that lovely OG stank on steroids!!

VBought this from The Evergreen Market in Auburn, wanted to try something new and don&#39;t typically like hybrids, more indica than anything else. Got home and loaded a bowl, i enjoyed the small sized nugs because the fit perfectly in my piece. Taste was really earthy but the high floored me. It was a little stonier in the head than i typically like but the body high was really great too. Found it a good option while i stream games, it relaxes me in the body but i stay alert in the head.

VSupermax og is so good, leafly is about to add a supermax og symbol to the right of the fifth star for this cultivar. \u000aSmoking buds of Supermax og by blue roots in wa feels and has me react like a dab. This reminds me of super potent kind home grown. Really good weed is sticky. It&#39;s so good, it&#39;s slightly oily. Terps list at 3.6% to 4.3%. THC 23.3% and up. Dispensaries go through this so quick, if it ain&#39;t world of weed in Tacoma holding a constant stock of it. Supermax og is so good I had to write another review on it.
