VVERY fun mental high.  I was so absolutely entertained by my immediate surroundings and felt very creative and intense.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was an anti-social high, and coming down was an unpleasant experience.  When the medication wore off, I felt grumpy and ravenous.  This would be great for a solitary weekend of contemplation, reading, writing, and exploring.  Make sure you have room and space to walk around, because it&#39;s an energizing high.

VI fell in love with this strain and can&#39;t wait till its back I&#39;m my local shop.  I found this to be a very uplifting smoke, from the energy buzz, the clarity of mind to the ignited creative power I couldn&#39;t get enough and it seems others agreed as it seemed to sell out quickly. The only downside was it did have a diesel taste to it which I&#39;m not a fan but the lemony citrus notes in it did help balance that out a bit.

VA very nice all-around noontime smoke. It has a pleasant clean grassy odor, and a mild flavor. It&#39;s mellow on the lungs, too. Although it has a high potency for a sativa, and tested at 20.1% THC, it doesn&#39;t leave me feeling sedated.

It makes you + anything seem super interesting. I can watch reruns of a show I&#39;ve seen 100 times and watch it like it&#39;s the first, amazed by all the tiny details. It is uplifting and sometimes feels almost psychedelic. I&#39;d say great for a day in only because it can make you lose your bearings a little bit.

VGreat strain prior to exercise. Energetic and the exertion from the exercise keeps your head grounded through the euphoria.

VThis is the sativa strain that&#39;s perfect for indica lovers that like the heavy stone...but without feeling super tired. TBH the name actually put my off because I&#39;m not a big fan of the Nightmare Christmas thing (hides in corner) but I&#39;m glad I tried it! I&#39;ll be getting some again next time it&#39;s in

VGreat for a morning and afternoon  smoke. Although it certainly can put me to sleep, it is not nearly as satisfying as others for a night time smoke. You&#39;ll definitely feel its effects, but won&#39;t be blazed with this strand.

VI really like this one. \u000aI can smoke this without getting horrible muscle tension\u000aIt also gets me doing things at home after work. I only smoke a small amount, just enough for a good hit from a bong..\u000aAnd there is no problem going to sleep.

VExcellent! All the terpenes I expected were there, the earthy lemon citrus of the Jack Herrer and the Diesel and Grapefruit taste of the Romulan. This is the only example of this strain in Orange County, so I believe this Dispensary should keep this strain and I look forward to watching the grow improve over time.

VSticky Icky flower. My fingers were sticky even after I washed them 30 minutes after the fact. I haven&#39;t seen bud this beautiful in years and I live in Seatle. Stoney as shit also. It reminded me of the high I use to get when I first toked up.

VBeing a huge fan of Nightmare Before Christmas I scored up a gram from Third Day my new go to local dispensary just for there fun of it. Brandon the Budtender said you&#39;ll like it for your back pain. Did I ever the sweet and pungent tasted like a well crafted IPA when drawn thru my Haze V3. The pain relief coupled with an energetic focus allowed me to clean my entire loft. A great Saturday afternoon strain.
