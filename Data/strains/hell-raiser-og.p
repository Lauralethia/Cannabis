VThis is my favorite strain as I am a neophyte in the medical cannabis world. This will is a great day time sativa. I feel that the effects last about 4 hours maybe more. I can still be myself. Pain is reduced a little. Stress, anxietyb and depression gets quieted down. I say this greatly helps common conditions like the ones I mentioned, though it may not totally eradicate anything. This makes life more manageable with not fetting drowsy.

VIt has the potential to be my go-to-strain for mid day vaping.  Its not quite a wake-and-bake, more like a pre luncher.  Its not super kushy, hits of lemon and musky but a very neutral flavor.  We called this shit Chronic growing up. Almost a perfect mid day picker upper. My flower was grown great, lots of resin and sticky brittle nugs. The cracking sound when I broke it down was something to see and hear.  I think the thc fairy visited all over this one. Shes been good to me. Very happy camper vaping. Bye bye now.

VHell Raiser OG\u000a\u000aLineage: Fire OG x Face Off OG (Bx1)\u000a\u000aWhat can I say it glistens under the normal flashlight on my iPhone. The Fire OG cutting by OG Raskal had already made a name for itself, so ThaDocta of Archive Seeds bred his Face Off OG with this esteemed specimen to create a next generation of Kush Hybrids. One of the best strains of 2014, hard and heavy caked in trichs! A must have for any veteran.
