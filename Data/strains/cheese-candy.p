VIncredibly stinky. I don&#39;t get a fruity smell from this strain, but more pungent and sour. The buds are also kinda small, albeit very dense. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars. The high is super mellow and relaxing. Give Cheese Candy a try, especially if you like super stinky bud!

VThis was an interesting strain but I really enjoyed it. I&#39;ve never smoked a cheese before so idk if that&#39;s why the smoke tasted different, but it was a taste I really enjoyed. Probably one of my favorite. I was also a little worried because I didn&#39;t want the munchies. But I actually didn&#39;t get any munchies. I&#39;ve been having a lot of GI pain lately and swiftly took all that pain away and I had no hunger. I felt very uplifted and happy and very talkative. I got in bed and sang to my wife. Haha. Overall. I thoroughly enjoyed this strain. It helped me relax and took away pain. It wasn&#39;t super strong on the thc, but it took me blissfully away to help relax. It also went straight to my eyes and I could start to feel myself drifting away. Definitely worth trying.

After I smoked half a bowl, I got so paranoid that I couldn&#39;t remember if I&#39;d driven home from work or took the train, it really freaked me out.  The taste was pungent, true to the name.  I passed out about an hour after enjoying Cheese Candy, not sure if it is really that potent or if I should have tried something else for the first time.

VA nice smooth and relaxing strain, but I would say it smells more musky like cat p*s* than cheesy and I mean that in the best possible way. maybe its the skunk side of it who knows but i&#39;ve had this strain many times(N.E. England) and it always smells the same and its always really nice.

VI picked up a gram of this, grown by Doc Croc, harvested 9/18/2016, consumed sometime in late January, 2017. There are no notes on the package regarding pesticides or grow location, but doccroc.net states that they use no pesticides and grow everything hydroponically with a perlite/coco mixed media. The smell was sweet, cheesy, and pungent, all of which carried over to the taste. As far as the high is concerned, I&#39;ve had much better. While I&#39;m usually a huge fan of Doc Croc&#39;s products, this one was forgettable. Apparently Cheese Candy just isn&#39;t for me, but at least it tastes better than Trainwreck.

VThis strain is great. Perfect for just a &quot;go to&quot; on a busy day. It&#39;s pretty clear headed after the first hour or so, and doesn&#39;t make me tired at all while still calming. Eases my anxiety even if I have some and go to work. Great strain, not the best for intense socializing or task-based situations where you have to recall information on the fly, but would we wanna smoke for that anyways??
