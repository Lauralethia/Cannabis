VGot this strain because I couldn\u2019t find LA soda in stock where I live and it frustrates me!\u000aOh my goodness the taste of this strain. I\u2019m not usually super snobby about smell or taste in weed because it all kind of tastes the same, but this one has me coming back for the same reason I did for LA Soda. \u000a\u000aYou can really taste the soda/cola as you exhale and it is orgasmic. The black cherry lingers on the inside of your nose and tongue and keeps you wanting one more taste. \u000aThe high is very cerebral and light while being relaxing.

VI was highly disappointed in this strain.  I am a Crohn&#39;s patient who also has a moderate injury to his neck (c3-c5).  I tend to need high cbd or high Thc delta 9 to get the relief I so desperately need. This strain looked great, tasted good but did nothing for relief.  I found it lacking in potency and medical benefit.

VTightly clustered bud with a mass of brilliant orange hairs, frosted almost white in spots with bright green throughout. Light sweet odor that isn&#39;t overpowering. The ground herb is slightly grainy similar to Dutch Treat. Vaped 0.4g on Low in a Pax by Ploom. Very smooth sweet taste that becomes earthy and soda-like in the back of the throat. Great for daytime or pre-bedtime. I tried this after dinner and ended up staying up a few hours, but when I did go to bed my body was very relaxed and my usual pain had subsided so I was able to sink right into the sheets and fall asleep in no time flat. Awoke the next morning feeling refreshed. Small increase in appetite. Definitely recommend for anyone that wants to mellow out but not get knocked out or couch-locked.

VGTI RYTHM Black Cherry Soda Pen - Took 4 puffs and Instantly feel a body and mind relaxation is definitely more in the body which is really great relaxes you from head to toe. Allows your mind to relax your eyes get heavy and you really feel chill at the center of everything and at peace truly a perfect hybrid for those who usually stay away from strains that may make them anxious this is the screen that will not do that for you hopefully as it has been a great strain for me very medicating very strong and the taste is out of this world.

VI&#39;d definitely recommend this to people whom might have a love-hate relationship with cannabis as far as anxiety goes. Was a little concerned being a hybrid that it might trigger more anxiety than most indicas, but this certainly feels like a more indica leaning hybrid. At average doses its not all that powerful -- quite relaxing -- but I did get a bit of couch lock at higher doses.

VI love the nose opening the jar, it fully lives up to the name. Lots of vapor at 400 degrees in the PAX. This guy hits heavy with a pretty pronounced head high and a strong body high. What I wasn&#39;t expecting was the problem solving I was able to do while reflecting on tasks that I did prior during the day, so I&#39;d say that there&#39;s some creative juice in there for sure. The body high was great for relaxing at the end of the day, however, some of the mental effects get the mind revving which isn&#39;t quite what I want right before bed.

VOne of the tastiest strains I&#39;ve ever vaped. Has a sweet, cherry taste. It&#39;s effects start pretty instantly, with a buzz that bubbles in your head and makes you feel pleasantly uplifted and chill. Effects were confined to my head, and I believe it&#39;s more of a sativa. This strain had the most unique appearance ever, with dark purple, almost black leaves that make it difficult to tell if your bowl is ash or bud! Good for sharing.

It&#39;s effects start pretty instantly, with a buzz that bubbles in your head and makes you feel pleasantly uplifted and chill. Effects were confined to my head, and I believe it&#39;s more of a sativa. This strain had the most unique appearance ever, with dark purple, almost black leaves that make it difficult to tell if your bowl is ash or bud! Good for sharing.

VSmells just like black cherry soda and just the name itself had always intrigued me before I&#39;d tried it . It&#39;s Covered in crystals, some light colored and some darkish brown. Unusually dark purple leaves and dark green nugs drenched in thc, very thick and sticky buds. Strong as fuck aroma , smells of pine and a sweet cherry/bubblegum scent. Tastes smooth and not really like soda at least with the batch I got it tastes more like cotton candy. Nice Stoney high, couch locking but also cerebral

I slept like a baby.\u000a\u000aHelps with chronic pain? Oh yeah.

Felt great all day.\u000a\u000aAnxiety?

VFizz on the tip of my tongue after every sweet berry flavored puff on this sparkly purple flower.  No complaints at all on this strain just maybe a heads up that it is hard to keep around.  Visually unique being a darker purple hue that glistens with crystals makes for appealing eye candy.  Curiosity easily can lead to handling the flower which puts out a light honeysuckle mixed with baby diaper dookie odor growing considerably stronger with fondling.  Of course once the old factory senses of any pothead is engaged with such dank splendor a tasting is sure to follow.  \u000a\u000aWith such a mellow dreamlike high that isn&#39;t so heavy on the eyelids it is beyond easy to make Black Cherry Soda an all day, every day, all the time strain.  Love that fizzy feeling in my tongue, maybe it is psychosomatic, but I like it \u2764

V\u000aExcellent strain. A definite favorite that hit better than dozens before it. At first sight there&#39;s clearly a dark tint to the bud and upon closer inspection it looks dipped in purple. Smells like its name, quite a bit actually. The high is where it&#39;s at though. The batch I had from Kaleafa in Portland had me very upbeat, somewhat energized but also quite focused on whatever I put my attention to. Some cerebral, many thoughts of motivation and enjoying the simple. Not a hint of sedation, actually keeps you up as I&#39;m always surprised at how late it is when indulging in this sweet beast.

Listening to your favorite music while schmokin this strain is highly recommended, as you\u2019ll focus on all the intricate melodies with much intent.  Black cherry soda lasts a relatively good amount of time and towards the end, You receive a wave of mental and visual clarity. I highly recommend this strain, for sure in my top 10.

My joint smelled yummy, the smoke was yummy, the taste was beyond yummy. Again first time I&#39;ve tasted sweet fruity weed before. I though lemon haze was the go to sweet bud but nope. This surpasses Candyland AND Fruity Loops. \u000a\u000a No debate on looking at different bud cause if you want sweet. Get some. \u000a\u000aThe high was gentle at first. Maybe 10-15 mins before I got some slight buzz but 30 mins... Get in your sweet(comfy)spot cause a train is gonna hit you. In 25 secs it went from gentle to peeling my eyes open to keep convesation. \u000a\u000aCotton mouth was a factor is this chill sesh tbh.

VI got a 400ml &quot;Clean Concentrates&quot; Solvent Less oil cartridge yesterday. It is undeniably the best tasting concentrate I have ever had the pleasure of smoking. To me, I get tastes of Pink old fashioned bubble gum, cotton candy and black berries. It also takes a bit to come on but when it dose it stays around for awhile. Knicks out pain and insomnia, very creative at the same time, its just a wounderful and flavorful straun to smoke from concentrate. I didn&#39;t care fir the flower but that could have been because if how it was grown, cured, etc. Getting more for sure!

VI would consider this strain an advanced smokers strain. I smoked one bowl outta my water pipe with a clean bowl. I&#39;m currently in the midst of round two with a new batch of ground up green in the bowl. This strain will get you extremely roasted. That&#39;s why I advise you be an advanced smoker. The look of the bud was green it didn&#39;t have any purple like the photos in this profile. But the taste and aromatic smell were definitely there. That being said I highly recommend this strain. I&#39;m adding this one as one of my favorites as this was a first time trying it.

I&#39;m adding this one as one of my favorites as this was a first time trying it.

VBlack Cherry is not a Sativa or an Indica, but rather cannabis Ruderalis. However it shares many characteristics with a sativa strain. Uplifting, energetic, and euphoric. The plant won&#39;t produce much flower, but the flavor is unlike anything else! It feel like im cheifing on a bag of grape jolly ranchers

VPicked up an eighth of this, grown by The Happy Crowd. Definitely a tighter, less resinous bud than some of the others I&#39;m used to smoking, but not dry. It grinds well, seems to have added a nice little layer to my kief catcher, and smokes well through a cheap bong. The smell was sweet and earthy, with a berry background and a sharp, fizzy little soda note at the front. The taste is sweet and soda-ish.\u000a\u000aThe first thing that I noticed was the headache I&#39;d been nursing for several hours disappeared, and my jaw stopped aching, as all of my muscles relaxed just enough to stop straining, without locking me to the couch or making movement difficult. I spent the morning cleaning and vacuuming, moving furniture around, bending and straightening, etc.; so I was sore all over, and just one small bowl has really knocked all of that soreness off. Then the hunger hit.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d recommend Bcs for pain relief patients who want to stay clear-headed and active. If you&#39;re looking for something to spark the creative process, though, you probably want to look elsewhere. I just wish I could get a stronger high off of it.

VI open the bag and take a sniff of this Black Cherry Soda. It&#39;s earthy and sweet. After I grind and pack it in my bowl, it smells a bit sweeter, kind of like a root beer. When I take a puff I can taste a sweet, berry note. \u000a\u000aIt feels like a fizzy, bubbly, tingle creeping up my spine, through my shoulders, down my arms and into my fingertips. The weight of the world is lifted. I feel the urge to stretch my arms up over my head and twist side to side. I find myself doing yoga poses instead of writing this review and... it feels great. I don&#39;t typically go for body highs, but this would be nice when feeling tense or after a night of dancing. Not very cerebral. Relaxed, but not sleepy. I could still be social.  Nice hybrid.

To me, I get tastes of Pink old fashioned bubble gum, cotton candy and black berries. It also takes a bit to come on but when it dose it stays around for awhile. Knicks out pain and insomnia, very creative at the same time, its just a wounderful and flavorful straun to smoke from concentrate. I didn&#39;t care fir the flower but that could have been because if how it was grown, cured, etc. Getting more for sure!

My joint smelled yummy, the smoke was yummy, the taste was beyond yummy. Again first time I&#39;ve tasted sweet fruity weed before. I though lemon haze was the go to sweet bud but nope. This surpasses Candyland AND Fruity Loops. \u000a\u000a No debate on looking at different bud cause if you want sweet. Get some. \u000a\u000aThe high was gentle at first. Maybe 10-15 mins before I got some slight buzz but 30 mins... Get in your sweet(comfy)spot cause a train is gonna hit you. In 25 secs it went from gentle to peeling my eyes open to keep convesation. \u000a\u000aCotton mouth was a factor is this chill sesh tbh.

VI would consider this strain an advanced smokers strain. I smoked one bowl outta my water pipe with a clean bowl. I&#39;m currently in the midst of round two with a new batch of ground up green in the bowl. This strain will get you extremely roasted. That&#39;s why I advise you be an advanced smoker. The look of the bud was green it didn&#39;t have any purple like the photos in this profile. But the taste and aromatic smell were definitely there. That being said I highly recommend this strain. I&#39;m adding this one as one of my favorites as this was a first time trying it.

V\u000aExcellent strain. A definite favorite that hit better than dozens before it. At first sight there&#39;s clearly a dark tint to the bud and upon closer inspection it looks dipped in purple. Smells like its name, quite a bit actually. The high is where it&#39;s at though. The batch I had from Kaleafa in Portland had me very upbeat, somewhat energized but also quite focused on whatever I put my attention to. Some cerebral, many thoughts of motivation and enjoying the simple. Not a hint of sedation, actually keeps you up as I&#39;m always surprised at how late it is when indulging in this sweet beast.

VThe most wonderful strain you can find. \u000a    The main reason I smoke is for depression. Severe depression, that makes my body ache, my energy low, sleep difficult, my perspective all distorted and most importantly, makes my gut feeling feel like there is no hope.\u000a    Indicas normally are my go-to for depression because they counteract the negative gut feeling as opposed to a head high.  \u000a    What makes this my absolute favorite strain, is that, the balance between head high and body high is perfectly in balance. There is no intense hit after you smoke, no intense stoney haze, and no intense come down. It&#39;s all smooth. This strain did not make me sleepy, or did not make anxiety worse with a fast heartbeat.\u000a      Instead, I felt extremely joyous. I felt grateful for life. I felt peaceful, like I did when I was a child. \u000a    The bonus is the taste- to die for. \u000a    Smoke this for depression!!!! The best medicine of all!!!!!!!

VWhat a lovely little strain. Sticky buds, visually impressive, a lovely potent scent, and strong effects that are satisfying. Mild harsh finish, a flowery and slightly sweet aftertaste. Effects are especially felt, both physically and mentally, within the confines and circumference of the head. The high and peak does build up over time, with peak effects for me reaching around the 40 minute mark, so a mild, but near moderate creeper. I would recommend this strain to artists, gamers, or people wanting to be more social. It&#39;s quite an uplifting strain, it&#39;s uniquely calming for a hybrid and great for pain relief.

VWith a vibrant green leaf hiding inside the nugs a deep and very noticeable purple hue that stretches from the bud to the stem. Very noticeable trichome production where I could see the many bulbous crystals make the flower look &quot;carbonated.&quot; Very sweet berry smell with a nice hash and pine aroma when pinched or ground. The taste comes best through a standard glass spoon pipe or joint with its very sharp flavors almost reminiscent of Chemdawg or Cherry Pie. Smoke was very smooth, started feeling initial come on within seconds of blowing out the first toke. Long lasting heavy hitting hybrid that in high doses tends to numb the body and mind. Few hits is all it takes and this is coming from a veteran/daily chronic smoker, the potency doesn&#39;t mess around! All around a very beautiful example of bud physically and a tasty and very noticeable high when smoked, a definite recommendation.

VStrong high. It&#39;s a good energy one with some body relaxation but not sedating at all. Happy mood comes, and stress melts away on this. Lasts a little longer too than most strains, and I recommend for day time use, or morning if you like, due to the energy this strain gives. \u000aMain medical use for this is fighting fatigue and depression with its happy energy effects. This is a great option for a pain and headache medication if you a looking for something that won&#39;t make you sedated or drowsy.
