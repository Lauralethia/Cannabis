VI&#39;ve been growing this strain for over a year now. Picked up a cutting from a local dispensary. Hindu Skunk is a pleasure to grow; relatively quick finisher with big, dense, sugar coated buds. The dried buds don&#39;t smell very skunky to me. More of a light floral or fruity aroma with hints of spice. Hindu Skunk never disappoints. The first inhale goes straight to the dome, sending you soaring.  Just when you think you are going to be too high, it levels off and keeps you in an up, euphoric space free of anxiety. Great daytime activity smoke; super high yet functional. Of the dozen or so strains I grow, this is my girlfriend and her friend&#39;s favorite. They both have issues with anxiety when smoking some strains, not with the Hindu Skunk.

VOne of my top 10 favorite strains.  Beautiful flower, well manicured, I donated to Blossom Delivery and they delivered the bomb medicine.  I&#39;m treating my bipolar medicinally through cannabis and this one is great to calm me down when I&#39;m too anxious or manic.  Lovely lovely and relaxing.  A couple hits (i have high tolerance) is enough to do the trick, too many hits and I fall asleep-which is never a bad thing for me.

VI give it a 9/10 *high bud to stem keeps it from 10/10*\u000a\u000aIt has that perfect slightly indica dominant 60/40 high which i really like for adhd. The smell is amazingly similar to hindu kush but after squeezing the nugs or at least after exhale you can taste that cheesy skunk smell from the cross which gives it a nice light sativa buzz. A bit stony for a wake n bake imo, but for anything else its great stuff. Downsides are the high bud/stem ratio.\u000a\u000aOverall, this strain is an amazing hybrid cross of 2 very well respected and renowned strains.

Vfirst strain i tried once i got my medical referral. smelled skunky with a hint of that Hindu Kush tangy sweetness. tasted fruity with a hint of that skunky-ness. the smoke was slightly harsh, but feels good in the lungs and excellent on the exhale. \u000a\u000athis strain kept me uppity. i felt really creative and read a whole textbook all week about the basics of barbell training. good for just  a gram of dank meds. \u000a\u000amuscle spasms in my lumbar area came to a dead halt as the cannabis strain showed them who&#39;s boss. helped with anxiety and pain in my lower back. \u000a\u000atowards the end of the medicines effect, i got a little dizzy and my mouth was dry like mad. but who cares, my lower back was a little pain free.\u000a

VBurns little quick to my liking, but overall a good clean high that&#39;s not overwhelming but definitely won&#39;t let you down. Would recommend for use when going out and about your day. It definitely doesn&#39;t drag you down and allows you to be medicated without being obvious if that&#39;s important to you.

VI smoked this when I was snowboarding with a few friends. We were smoking OG Rascal along with some God Bud. My friend didn&#39;t tell me he loaded a bowl of this in my mini bong until after it hit me. I felt everything around me was just so much nicer and I&#39;m not sure if this makes a difference but maybe the high altitude made the high better? Regardless, it is an amazing strain and I highly recommend it.

VI&#39;ve been growing this strain for over a year now. Picked up a cutting from a local dispensary. Hindu Skunk is a pleasure to grow; relatively quick finisher with big, dense, sugar coated buds. The dried buds don&#39;t smell very skunky to me. More of a light floral or fruity aroma with hints of spice. Hindu Skunk never disappoints. The first inhale goes straight to the dome, sending you soaring.  Just when you think you are going to be too high, it levels off and keeps you in an up, euphoric space free of anxiety. Great daytime activity smoke; super high yet functional. Of the dozen or so strains I grow, this is my girlfriend and her friend&#39;s favorite. They both have issues with anxiety when smoking some strains, not with the Hindu Skunk.

VI give it a 9/10 *high bud to stem keeps it from 10/10*\u000a\u000aIt has that perfect slightly indica dominant 60/40 high which i really like for adhd. The smell is amazingly similar to hindu kush but after squeezing the nugs or at least after exhale you can taste that cheesy skunk smell from the cross which gives it a nice light sativa buzz. A bit stony for a wake n bake imo, but for anything else its great stuff. Downsides are the high bud/stem ratio.\u000a\u000aOverall, this strain is an amazing hybrid cross of 2 very well respected and renowned strains.

VI tried this for the first time tonight.  This is HEAVY on the smell. I decided to smoke this instead of vaping it, so it was stuck to my clothes and hair.\u000aI really like this strain.  It gave me a nice body high, and relaxed me.  I will purchase again.

VThe best description I can give for Hindu Skunk would be similar to the taste of sweet, blue flavored rock candy with a hint of earthiness all rolled into 1. The nugs are dense with various  lime green colors and a light orange hue coming from the pistils. This strain works well for both day &amp; nighttime users. The smell of H.K. is not crazy strong, so luckily your able to carry your meds around where ever you go.  Perfect way to start your week, so Go pick some up from your local dispensary! \u000a\u2661\u2661\u2661&amp;PEACE....
