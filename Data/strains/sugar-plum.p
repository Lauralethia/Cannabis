VWe get few few sativas in new jersey. got a qp of this (legit) and man is it fire. Very cerebral, euphoric high.No drowsieness or couchlock at all. Yet it does produce a slight body high along eith the mental effects. Antsyness and anxiety were a little high at 1st, but after smoking it a few times its become one of my favorite strains

Not even ten minutes in and all traces of pain are gone, complete relaxation while alert and ready to interact. It&#39;s the best combination because I have the body relaxation of an indica with the energetic alertness of a sativa. \u000aDefinitely some body tingles and warmth here and there. I only got a gram of this at the shop and now I&#39;m gonna have to get some more. \u000aI imagine this will make gaming fun. \u000aSweet flavor, cool vapor and wonderful scent. \u000aEnjoy &#128571;

VI got some seeds of Sugar Plum from StoneyGirl giveaways in Portland when pot became legal in Oregon last July. I&#39;m a rookie so decided to grow it in a simple water culture system (hydro) in a cabinet. Out of 2 seeds, got one female. Here&#39;s what my calendar log says: Aug. 12 - plant cracked seed; Aug. 13 - sprout; Aug. 31 - trim top; Sept. 13 - transition to 12/12 with partial bulb switch to red; Oct. 4 - first buds start; Oct. 18 - sugar hairs at top; Dec. 3 - flush chem; Dec. 10 - water only; Dec. 20 - Harvest - cloudy trichs. Has a nice purplish tint w/ tons of crystals. Buds were a little airy and small but that was probably my fault due to slightly high humidity and temps. Got 1-1/2 quart mason jars out of it, but 25% were popcorns. I think it could of flowerered just a little longer before I flushed. Very perfumy taste and smell. Huge creeper high, mostly mental and munchies extreme (never had such munchies); but small body high. However, the relaxing effect and mellow come down are nice. I hope to cross it with some Sweet Lafeyette soon to add a body high and call it Sweet Plum :) Maybe it will put some skunk back into it. Can&#39;t test with such a small amount, but the high is comparable to lower 20s THC and I can definitely tell there&#39;s a decent % of CBD in it.

VI&#39;m normally a heavy indication user, as I hv a lot of anxiety &amp; pain issues. A lot of Sativas just make me feel panic. Not this one! I did some art, then a nice tingle of relaxation hit. I slept so, so good, will buy more for sure

VI got this from deep water botanicals. sugar plum is a very hard quick hitting sativa. I never tried this before I bought this 2 gram bag. and I fell for her head over heels. this by far my favorite strain for about 2 weeks now.   The smell is really sweet almost candy like. very nice and subtle. the taste is sweet and earthy. the high is very strong and very quick to hit it&#39;s peak. after about the third exhale I&#39;m already high and continuing to climb. really pleasant. the high last at least three and a half hours and is amazing the entire time. it doens&#39;t do much for the body but your head feels wonderful. it&#39;s 100% sativa and all effects show that.the high is very clear and focused, a little mentel slow down if you to consume to much. but still isn&#39;t unpleasant.  all in all this is probably one of the best sativas that I&#39;ve tried. your very up and euphoric, ready to go. the flowers are a little more fluffy then I like but still a great strain from a very good grower. pick this up for sure. I hope you&#39;ll enjoy it as much as I have. just a all around great strain.

VTried this strain in concentrate, it hits hard. Very instant cerebral high that easily turns into giggles. High lasts pretty long and keeps you held there until finally coming down into a lethargic sleepiness. Nice mellow taste but increases appetite like crazy. Overall a killer strain with great thc levels.

V10%Indica/90%Sativa. \u000a1st Place, 2003 Oregon Medical Cannabis Award Winner. \u000a   Sugar Plum is a cross between Berkeley Blues and a Hawaiian Haze Plum. The flavor is complex the deep tropical flavor of the Haze Plum comes through first with the earthy Berkeley Blues bottom note clearly coming through the finish.\u000a   Nice and happy feeling. *Was PMS&#39;ing when 1st tried -7/19/13.

VMagical sativa. Great energy/creative buzz and lots of euphoria from this strain. Earthy smell and sweet taste left me feeling heavy all over and behind the eyes. Great for working in a chair and Sativa nature makes it an easy one to get around on. Overall, great parent strains yield a top shelf Sativa and scores 5/5 for me. Try it out, taste is wonderful!
