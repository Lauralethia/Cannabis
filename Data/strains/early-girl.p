VI thought this strain was pretty good. Got me pretty damn high for the little amount I did and the bud wasnt even in that good condition. It was just strong. It was a nice relaxed mellow high, but didnt make you sleepy that made me incredibly happy. Plus music sounds incredible on this strain and it makes you think pretty deep on topics.

VThis stuff will get your really high, but will make you feel really depressed if you like sativas. It&#39;s a solid sleep aid, but it doesn&#39;t have a mellow come down and you really have to sleep it off. The biggest thing I don&#39;t like about it is that it makes me space out and get really slow

VI picked up a g of Early Girl today, I gotta say it was beautiful looking, and the smell &amp; taste was even better!! I would definitely recommend stopping by your favorite fast food joint, or pick up some munchies at the store because you&#39;re going to have a raging case of eat everything!! then smoke a phatty &amp; repeat,,,, enjoy!!!

Vgreat strain to combat stress and to help unwind  after a tough day. Very aromatic, smelled of citrus fruits and a vanilla/sweet smell. Overall great strain, helped with minor pain and stress, no anxiety or paranoia. Like the highlight said a great strain for new comers, good for stress, nothing over the top.
