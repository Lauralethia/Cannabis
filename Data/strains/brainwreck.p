VFirst off, it is well named!  Just 3 hits of vape, and my mind was in a blender. Not as good as Trainwreck for pain but is a pretty good distraction. Perfect about 15 minutes before soaking your pains away in hot water. Music was nice..... when i could pay attention to it ;-)

VMellow high, good for having conversations and getting things done around the house. No paranoia or anxiety as you get with most H/S dominate strains. Perfect for Sunday mornings.

VI&#39;ve been smoking many different strains lately and Brainwreck stands out from the pack. I went for a mellow hike and came across a huge old oak tree. My thoughts became a storm in my head. When did this tree start growing?  What has this tree witnessed during its long life time? Did Miami hunting parties pass by this giant? This flower will make you spend some quality time in your head. It&#39;s perfect for insight and mental release. Smoke this and exercise your gray matter.
