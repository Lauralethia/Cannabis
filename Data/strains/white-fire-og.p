VVery positive results for nausea &amp; lack of appetite, as well as excellent for chronic pain reduction.\u000a\u000aSuggested by the dispensary budtender, White Fire is now on my &quot;go to&quot; list.  Good delivery through a Magic Flight Box in the evening and reinforcement toke (smoke) before bed, this strain made me relaxed, content, and hungry.  I also experienced mental stimulation, which could have escalated to creative if I&#39;d chosen to go there, as well as physical arousal.  In fact, from my experience, this strain provides possibilities for either/both physical dominant or mental dominent effects, depending on the user&#39;s mood.  This strain gave me a really dry mouth, so hydrate yourself well through the day and merely use H2O as an evening swish if you&#39;re using for nighttime sleep, or you&#39;ll be up for the loo through the night!\u000aThe vape and smoke were sweet tasting &amp; pretty easy - not harsh.  White Fire OG is definitely a creeper, so IMHO new users should be patient and wait 10 - 15 minutes after their first inhalations before rehitting.\u000aHighly recommended!

VI have a very hard time finding strains that work for me I&#39;ve literally tried everything including edibles (which have literally no effect on me no matter how much I take) I&#39;ve even had strong strains like gods gift have absolutely no effect on me no matter how much I smoked. BUT! this strain is the best I&#39;ve ever smoked. After maybe 2 hits I am instantly in a good mood. I also suffer from anxiety and this smoke seriously took the edge off. Gave me energy and made me social ( which never happens after I smoke ha) I&#39;m also a very heavy smoker. I highly recommend this to anyone who is stressed or anxious all the time. This shit makes you feel normal but happy/no worries and head energy haze type feeling. I love white fire OG

VAfter smoking for over 30 years when I saw this flower my jaw dropped . My fav strain by far. The bud structure is typical of og strains, tight , dense, but with wifi the buds are straight white . Thc content 26.8% . It&#39;s by far the most potent strain I&#39;ve smoked (not thc content wise, overall &quot;high&quot;)and the most beautiful. Like always it all depends how the flower was grown , etc. but if your blessed enough to stumble across this it&#39;s a must buy- it&#39;s a very difficult strain to grow so chances are if you do see it , it will be masterfully done

VI went home and ground up the Wi-Fi OG and it really smelled like super-sweet grape and with earthy undertones as well, like when it rains in the Arizona desert. I took a medium-heavy puff through my water-pipe and let me tell you this is a heavy hitter for a non-seasoned smoker. I clenched my shirt with one hand, and the exhale left me to shiver. The mindset I had changed to \u201cfeeling like my teeth were plastic\u201d. Yes, I know, it didn&#39;t make sense. The next morning I smoked some and my arms felt super light in weight, my OCD lightened up, and I was ready to get some errands done!! This one makes me have very heightened creative ideas, and I almost could swear it may have had very mild psychedelic properties like brightening light and making colors vivid in high doses.

VWow.  Interesting high.  A rarely come across a strain that I feel has equal sativa/indica effects, but this does seem to be 50%-50%.  I became hyper alert in a weird relaxed way and found myself going in and out of sharp focus to.....completely loosing focus.  Gives you that wonderful floaty feeling where it feels blissful just to walk around.  It&#39;s fun too.  You can&#39;t stop smiling.  Pretty intense, even for me as a 50 year user, of my love, sweet sweet cannabis.

V&#128065;&#128293; WiFi O.G. from Cannabiotix is a potent hybrid that will take away your pain and put you in a very good mood. The pungent, sour, earthy smell has that very familiar O.G. goodness to it. The trichomes are pretty insane. Overall this is a solid strain for anytime use, and especially great for winding down after a long day. This is not my favorite O.G., but it is one that I will definitely be purchasing again! Limonene: 4.03 mg/g, Myrcene: 3.89 mg/g, Linalool: 1.02 mg/g, Pinene: 1.01 mg/g and Caryophyllene: 0.69 mg/g.

VThis strain really takes over -- a sativa-dominant high that keeps you in the &quot;zone&quot; for a long time. You can take whatever route you decide, and it will enhance it. It gives you the mind space to be active, but the stone is so hard-hitting that you prefer to just chill. Not couch lock, but just you will become blissfully drifting off to sleep if you want. If you prefer to watch a movie, do something fun, listen to music, or eat, you will also really enjoy it. A very likeable strain.

Vi bought this strain from my uncle because i ran out and had 5 bucks. i smelled it and i could just smell that pungent, woody scent. i got to smoking and i noticed that the flavour of the hit really depends on where you took the piece from. i noticed the sweet tasty, almost like candy, was very dominant in the middle while the more sour and dry tastes were at the end. the effects are quite nice, i am having the nice twitches i get when i have a head high. i can still fully function (as i have displayed in writing this nice and detailed review), and i am having fun times. i can&#39;t wait to order some of this myself. thank you.\u000a-ThatLightWeight

In larger doses I find it makes my thoughts wander a lot, and makes my body buzz with an almost narcotic effect. \u000a\u000aI use this strain for depression, caffeine crashes and doing menial tasks like cleaning and dishes. Makes down time stuff like listening to podcasts and playing video games a little more fun. Also has positive effects on libido.

VAfter vaping this strain I found it more of a sativa dominate strain rather than indica, so if you&#39;re out looking for a balanced hybrid this isn&#39;t it. This strain will also have the affect of keeping you awake! I like to emphasize &quot;awake&quot; due to one event that me and my buddy had actually vaped some of this strain around maybe 2:00 am, which was a horrible mistake because we were awake until 6:00 am. But in all fairness we should&#39;ve been more aware of that before hand since the strain was so high in THC, I think it was somewhere in-between 28% and 30%, which is high if you didn&#39;t know. White Fire OG is definitely 5 stars for its effects and I would probably compare it to something like 2 morning coffees, it will give you a tingling sensation and may make you do some very unnoticeable twitching.

VThis strain was amazing. smelling real earthy and pungent, no doubt is it a potent strain. One hit had me giggling and euphoric. .8 in a joint was very potent for me, and i usually smoke a gram or more for my pains. Main effects hitting me first were: -giggles and decrease in depression and anger, -a chuckling body buzz followed by a cloudy head high, -no more headaches, -fatigue was definitely out, -crazy happiness leaving you grinning and laughing for no reason at all. All pain was diminished. Also, did great for my insomnia, i was out all evening until morning, waking up euphoric and happy with a cloudy head high still! Definitely top flower, potent; downside to this was some headaches, and major anxiety as it was totally an unexpected real high. But, good strain definitely fire.

VThis strain is a personal favorite of mine. I smoked white fire OG in bob Marley rolling paper and I got next level high. One thing about this hybrid strain is while you are smoking you will feel more of a head high but after you smoke and you lay down the head high will slowly fade away and you will feel a strong heavy body high. White Fire OG tastes very sweet and earthy and is good for loss of appetite or if you are feeling down and need a boost to get you through the day. You WILL get the munchies when smoking this strain.

Normal draw and exhale. \u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Good for day or really anytime relaxation/relief. Agree with another reviewer, (also with Crohns), great strain for GI issues. No real couch lock. Could help with appetite, but no real munchies.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this strain for relaxation and pain relief, especially for those with Crohns or other GI issues.

Very calming, very potent, care free, giggily, uplifting, happy and creative. Just make sure you pace yourself, since it is VERY potent. You can use this weed to crash on the couch and watch TV or be active and go hiking outdoors. Its an all around type of strain. Definitely one of the finest gas out there.

VA moderately strong high that lasts about 2 and a half hours. The high itself is &#39;buzzy&#39; and relaxed, but unfortunately for me, the Sativa part way over takes everything and gives me mad anxiety which I also feel hung over the next day, unless I smoke again. Beautiful buds that are super pungent with a wickedly powerful permeating odor. The only downfall to the buds is that they are so chocked full of crystals, they&#39;re annoyingly sticky, so much so to the point that it will instantly gum up your grinder, scissors, finger tips, you name it. Keep some hand sanitizer close, breaks down the sticky &#39;gumminess\u200b&#39; right away. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars only for the fact that this strain is not compatible with my body chemistry but other then that, it gets you really stoned!

VI tend to smoke sativas as I&#39;m a daily smoker. I&#39;ve been experiencing a lot of anxiety over the past few months and this is AMAZING at chilling me out. It&#39;s a clear high that also puts me in zen mode. I&#39;ve smoked a lot of strains and I&#39;m ridiculously happy with this delicious bud. OGs can be heavy but this hybrid nails the best qualities of each. love it, will be buying more asap.

VWiFi takes about 10 mins to kick in. Its a roller coaster of events for about 30 mins once you start to feel the high. It will give you a head high, came back down like the high is over, then go back up high. By the time the 30 mins hits, your head high levels out to a constant calming high. Then the body high happens and you feel do relaxed or ready to do a bunch of shit. Its the best high Ive ever had. I hope it stays around or make it even better with another strain.

Smelled like I was smoking an incense, reminiscent of sandlewood. I could really taste and feel the Kush in there. Also, it was very strong. I took one hit and it hit me so be easy. Overall I really liked it, just remember not to smoke it before bed lol.

VDefinitely in my top 3 favorite, if not my most favorite. Super relaxing but it does not knock your ass out on the couch. You can sense the sativa dominance instantly. Very calming, very potent, care free, giggily, uplifting, happy and creative. Just make sure you pace yourself, since it is VERY potent. You can use this weed to crash on the couch and watch TV or be active and go hiking outdoors. Its an all around type of strain. Definitely one of the finest gas out there.

VA moderately strong high that lasts about 2 and a half hours. The high itself is &#39;buzzy&#39; and relaxed, but unfortunately for me, the Sativa part way over takes everything and gives me mad anxiety which I also feel hung over the next day, unless I smoke again. Beautiful buds that are super pungent with a wickedly powerful permeating odor. The only downfall to the buds is that they are so chocked full of crystals, they&#39;re annoyingly sticky, so much so to the point that it will instantly gum up your grinder, scissors, finger tips, you name it. Keep some hand sanitizer close, breaks down the sticky &#39;gumminess\u200b&#39; right away. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars only for the fact that this strain is not compatible with my body chemistry but other then that, it gets you really stoned!

VVaped a full herbalizer balloon with a heat setting of 375. Within a minute I had a pretty intense head buzz which then traveled to the rest of my body. It seemed to have a creeping effect... it took about a half hour before the intensity peaked. This strain created a very active mind and I spent a good amount of time philosophizing. Not bad, but I&#39;d say if you have anxiety be careful with this one.

Smooth relaxed body high. Euphoria. Mentally you work at full capacity meaning you still have your wits, and as an advisor, this proved to be a positive daytime smoke to calm muscles and anxiety while also preforming at high levels professionally. Smooth pulls through a bowl, only smoked flower, haven\u2019t made food or tried other forms of intake.

Very clear, light golden yellow color, and looked almost exactly like wet sugar. Melted light yellow too. Almost looked like a nug run, definitely popcorn used at least.\u000a&gt; a 60% sativa dominant cross with awesome linneage, this strain reaches 30% thc; this THC packed strain is doused in white trychomes, and loaded with sticky terps.\u000aLook [9.5/10]\u000aTaste [9.5/10]\u000aSmell [9/10]\u000aLinneage [9/10]\u000aHigh [9/10]\u000a46/50

VI just got a nice taster batch of WiFi og.  I was hesitant at 1st since I am not a fan of Sativas or sativa dominant hybrids.  Boy was I wrong.  \u000a\u000aFor me WiFi og is the perfect sunny day strain.  Especially if you have things to do or are wanting an active high that makes everything work at 1000G Speed.  \u000a\u000aFor me, your mind and body go into this fun high tuned buzz.  I was good to go after only 3-5 tokes on a mini cone of this.  At first the high can be described as speedy and heady, but totally in control.  You may notice that this strain will make you more active and talkative at first, but don\u2019t get me wrong smoke enough, like me, and you\u2019ll have no trouble taking a nap &#128564;.  \u000a\u000aI\u2019m definitely going to grab a bigger batch of this on my next trip to the dispensary.

VI really like this strain. I bought it to use during the day, however, because of the high THC content, it did make me somewhat drowsy.  It is a great high, very uplifting and happy.  Not quite couch lock but not super motivating.  I would recommend this strain nice relaxing, feel-good high.  Hope this helps.  cheers!

VA moderately strong high that lasts about 2 and a half hours. The high itself is &#39;buzzy&#39; and relaxed, but unfortunately for me, the Sativa part way over takes everything and gives me mad anxiety which I also feel hung over the next day, unless I smoke again. Beautiful buds that are super pungent with a wickedly powerful permeating odor. The only downfall to the buds is that they are so chocked full of crystals, they&#39;re annoyingly sticky, so much so to the point that it will instantly gum up your grinder, scissors, finger tips, you name it. Keep some hand sanitizer close, breaks down the sticky &#39;gumminess\u200b&#39; right away. I&#39;m giving this 4 stars only for the fact that this strain is not compatible with my body chemistry but other then that, it gets you really stoned!

VI tend to smoke sativas as I&#39;m a daily smoker. I&#39;ve been experiencing a lot of anxiety over the past few months and this is AMAZING at chilling me out. It&#39;s a clear high that also puts me in zen mode. I&#39;ve smoked a lot of strains and I&#39;m ridiculously happy with this delicious bud.

VWOW!  Someone hit this nail square on the head!  Nice  thick, crispy, frosted leaves and airy buds makes this an easy flower to prep for the bowl.  This strain really brings home the goods.  The Sativa component will keep the creative juices flowing while the Indica is telling you to chill.  White Fire OG is a heavy, high THC strain.  Stock up when you find it.

VIt was a cold night..actually it really is cold as fuck in Oakley,  Ca.\u000aAnyways, purchased this from a local grower...Boy oh boy I had heard good things bout this strain,  so I stopped by the local AmPm and purchased a 3 for 99 cents Splitarillos Sweet OG.\u000aRolled up a nice one and went into the cold to enjoy the nice cold ass air while smoking this sweet smelling herb. \u000aAfter a nice block, I decided to turn around and make my way back home...that is when I felt this nice relaxation come over me...I warmed up alil and returned inside to grab a water and watch TV. As of now, I&#39;m pretty much relaxed and my legs are numbish...laying on a couch. not sleepy though,  am aware and awake.\u000aI love this feeling. Great body high...nice head high...not to powerful.\u000aBest of both Hybrids.

Vso I picked some of this up it was outdoor lightdef. I thought it would be to light for me. it said it was 22% thc 0.09 CBD so why not. I got home and gave it to my wife. Bad idea she hit it said it was smooth and sweet. so she smoked the hole gram nugg I gave her. 15 minutes later she said I need water and a chicken sandwich.  I laughed and made her food. as I was cooking I heard whistling coming from the living room. I walked in and my wife was getting down whistling the theme from Steam Boar Willy. The old Mickey mouse cartoon. I asked if she was OK and she said I need to eat and go to sleep my hand is a purse I can&#39;t find my hand. I laughed again and wnet and smoked a single nugg no more than a .3 I then returned to check on my wife and she had finished her dinner and fell asleep. The good kind mouth open drool and incoherent rambling. I wish I was a light weight. I am on my third session tonight it is indeed sweet as hell and so smooth.

I was easily bored when looking for something to watch on TV. I suggest going for a walk or something stimulating. One time I smoked too much and my memory did start to skip a little.

VI love WiFi for a bedtime smoke on rough days. It\u2019s a smooth ride that evolves over time, and for me is almost entirely in the head. First it gives me the little burst of energy I need to finish getting ready for bed; then it makes me drowsy once I\u2019m there. Mood-wise, it calms, uplifts, and chases out anxiety. A star strain and not bad tasting either :-)

On the down part of the high though, I felt some anxiety and depression (not regular symptoms I have). So overall this was functional but not helpful to me. Strain 22 of 100.

VA great uplifter when you need something happy with a little more energy.I love how dense these little pine trees are smells like a chemical cleaner and lemons very interesting smell. This strains lasts for more than 3 hours for me, pain is melting along with a relaxed sleeping factor. This strain is great for tinnitus, headaches, depression, pain, insomnia, fibromyalgia, OCD, Ant&#39;s and of course ADHD/ADT this is great its earthy and woody flavored vape vis just awesome deadhead, critical ssh, and now White Fire OG is just a great to have a trio, but I am still on the search for the best strain medicine for me and maybe others.

The taste is that of a classic piney OG, tastes identical to pink kush. Have water cause it does dry your mouth.

Still some muscle pain, but not like permanent muscle spasms (just from falling on my ass snowboarding).  Don\u2019t know if it would help with that... PTSD homies? Don\u2019t know, sorry.  Anxiety?

VStrain was a decent one, not the heat I&#39;ve ever had but not the worst. Buds are a dense Christmas tree looking buds that are a light green with darker green and a frosting of white trichomes. The high comes on after a few minutes and is very clear headed with a lazy body high to it. It gave me some mental energy, and the desire to do things yet offset that with a lazy body high to it (not couch-locking, just lazy-inducing.)

VAll around a very stoney strain. I prefer a much more upper happy energetic uplifting high. This strain for me was very relaxing and had only a slight sativa side for me despite its 60:40 Sativa leaning ratio. overall a decent strain if you just like doing nothing all day, which i dont like. Almost to lazy to even play video games, just watch youtube all day.

VI&#39;m not sure how to categorize this Strain because it is UNUSUAL in so many ways:\u000a\u000aIt smells very...weird. It&#39;s impossible to describe but I&#39;ll try: Bad, Burnt, Earthy, Smelly. \u000a\u000aGround flowers are still smelly but sticky-ish and creamy-oid \u000a\u000aFLOWERS don&#39;t &quot;hit hard&quot; at first \u000aInhale is &quot;less than average&quot; tasting if I&#39;m being nice, yuck, straight ash.\u000a\u000aExhale is Magic Show time staring you. More similar to a fog machine or a car tailpipe than to just human Jagger lips.\u000a\u000aThis is a ONE BOWL STRAIN !!!\u000a(My Full Dose is 2 bowls of flower, with this, there is no need, \u000aespecially since it &quot;creeps&quot; and the best is yet to come! \u000a\u000aThis strain is a very POTENT strain with High amounts THC &amp; lots of visible TRICHOMES. And normally these attributes are best suited for experienced RECREATIONAL patients who are familiar with high THC strains\u000aHOWEVER \u000aThis may also be a very healing\u000aMEDICAL STRAIN !!!\u000aWhy?\u000aIt doesn&#39;t not cause paranoia nor anxiety !!!\u000aAnd it does this without any cbd worth mentioning and with a high thc count which normally makes certain people uncomfortable include myself but this strain somehow manages a SATIVA high with a muscle relaxing warm feeling with no anxiety.\u000aBut I will be honest, I wish the &quot;head-high&quot; was even higher, I&#39;m guessing that whatever is blocking the &quot;anxiety pot molecule&quot; is also in cahoots with whoever is blocking the &quot;White Rabbit Effect&quot; a tad but hey isn&#39;t the point of a HYBRID to blend the crazy thoughts with clear thoughts and an active body with a relaxed body and everyone wins \u000a\u000aI think this should be called the Mark Messier Strain because it&#39;s ugly but look at all those awards \u000a\u000aThe cons are that you won&#39;t win any friends with the aroma, nor inhale, and GOOD LUCK hiding the 15 gallons of smoke from Momma Dukes. \u000a\u000aBut this may be a strain than almost everyone can use, taste be damned, and we can get some life saving THC in high doses without paranoia !\u000a\u000aMaking this Strain best suited not as flower but otherwise. MEDICAL Patients should be aware that HIGH THC Strains exist that do NOT cause anxiety. And companies and individuals that make Tinctures, Edibles, Patches, etc need to be aware of this plants unusual properties and utilize them in medicines

VThis strain has been my social salvation and I propose a name change to &quot;The Boss OG&quot;. The strain itself is easily the prettiest strain I&#39;ve ever seen, perfect layer of white trichomes cover every part of the buds. The smoke is smooth with a small taste of earthy sourness. The effects are perfect for me because I suffer from a lot of social anxiety that is exacerbated in situations that are unfamiliar (recently moved to Denver, Everything is unfamiliar). WiFi takes all that away, and I literally go from afraid social wallflower to the life of the party aka &quot;The Boss&quot;. Seriously I mean like a little social maestro is sitting at the controls of my brain. I would recommend low doses though, too much of this gave me headaches on the come down and made my fight or flight reflex spike in social settings. At home this was perfect for my aggression regulation issues, I was able to sit down and play with my puppy for about an hour and a half without stopping. Highly recommended for anxiety sufferers! Remember though just a dab will do ya!

My anxiety is eased within minutes and I feel a tingly sensation in my foot. A fast hitting cerebral high with medicinal indica effects that relieve pain and stimulate energy. An overall long lasting high with medicinal benefits and a unique experience. Would recommend for a good Sunday toke to watch a sports game or a favorite show/movie.

If you need to get up or be social this strain is probably the best, not a couch locker but its just enough to have the effects.\u000a White fire #3 is more of a cerebral high than euphoric. Found myself vibing to music more than i normally do. \u000a If you haven&#39;t tried white favor, do yourself a favor and try it.

VI&#39;ve been saving a nug of this for months and now smoking it I&#39;m remembering how great it is.  The terpine profile is metallic, spicy, peppery, diesel-like and menthol scent on the end.  The buds I have are cured wonderfully and there isn&#39;t any hint of chlorophyll.

VI bought this strain hoping for more trip-like high. It didn&#39;t quite deliver that for me, but others that I smoked it with had very good effects. Even people prone to paranoia had a great experience and we had some really great back-porch discussions.\u000a\u000aFor me, the high was quite cerebral, but a bit short-lived and didn&#39;t quite match what I was expecting, but I was probably expecting too much, it is just weed after all :)\u000a\u000aI will buy more of this, to give away as gifts!

Great cooking strain because it gets your mind goin to whip up something delicious. I made some spicy kimchi soup on this strain and it tasted like the restaurant stuff. Figuring it out twice- impossible. Overall a good head stone, just don&#39;t do too much unless you wanna trip balls and giggle at dumb shit.

I was easily bored when looking for something to watch on TV. I suggest going for a walk or something stimulating. One time I smoked too much and my memory did start to skip a little. But in like 15 minutes everything was back to being enjoyable.

VI felt productive, lifted yet relaxed, and experienced an escalator high (I just kept going up and up and up...). Tasted like a semi-sweet menthol, clean and weedy. On the down part of the high though, I felt some anxiety and depression (not regular symptoms I have). So overall this was functional but not helpful to me. Strain 22 of 100.

VGot a g of this along with God\u2019s Gift under the suggestion of the lovely lady helping me out that day.  My method of consumption was via nectar collector.  I go on Leafly and see it\u2019s a 60% Sativa hybrid.... I tend to stick with straight indicas, as sativa hybrids and sativas send my thoughts into a frenzy and I get really paranoid.  I thought well what doesn\u2019t kill you, makes you stranger... love it.  No racy, weird, negative thoughts.  Head feels relaxed, same with my body.  Still some muscle pain, but not like permanent muscle spasms (just from falling on my ass snowboarding).  Don\u2019t know if it would help with that... PTSD homies? Don\u2019t know, sorry.  Anxiety? Yeah I don\u2019t feel anxious, like I said no weird thoughts.  Appetite increased for sure!  Libido? Yeah.  Bipolar grandiose thoughts? Negative.  Must say, I\u2019m really surprised by this strain, it pretty much knocks out my list of bs.  Hope it does the same for y\u2019all!

VThis is, quite simply, the best strain I have ever had, in any form.  Just so happens I ran across this in flowers, and I was sampling strains on a recent trip to Durango.  The first time I just crammed enough into a one-hitter for myself, and holy crap!  It only took that one little bowl to know this strain was special.  The buds are dense, tightly packed, resiny beauties, covered with tiny sparkly white crystals.  The smoke is smoother than most for me, as I tend to cough with smoke a bit.  But this smoke became smooth and gentle as soon as you figured out how to best inhale and enjoy the beauty.  The taste is minty cool to me.  Three hits and I&#39;m good.  A few hits every now and then and I was happy and carefree the whole day!   Gotta try!

VInitial effect is similar to the pressure produced by Headband but behind the eyes.  Freddy&#39;s Fuego grow is a bit racy but tempered by a slight body buzz in the mid section.  Tastes like Sour D and White Widow to me even though the lineage provided by Leafly says otherwise.

VWhite Fire is funny for me because it is a strain never desired, always a last choice, and almost begrudgingly brought home.  Yet every time there is fabulous &quot;Go Get Em&#39; positive buzz that is always a winner.  Can&#39;t go wrong when the head change is independent allowing for the user to choose.  Behind door #1 (paired with snacks) this strain takes a laid back mellow mood with giggles, daydreaming out loud to another stoned confidant, or alone head on pillow slowing pulse.  Door #2 (paired with coffee or tea) allows for getting shit done, exercising, great sex out loud with another stoned lover, or alone head on pillow erotically raising pulse.\u000a\u000aWouldn&#39;t doubt if they coined the term &quot;Head Change&quot; after this strain.  Truly will turn that frown upside down which for some of us is just the small nudge needed to keep S.A.D at bay.  Wintertime can be rough in the grey, soggy muck called Oregon yet the positive, uplifting energy passed on from the plant works wonders.  In my head WIFI OG will always be pushed back to last in line even with such \u000a stealth game changing abilities.  The sniff out of jar. Flavor. Terpenes.  At first impression  it lacked these elements with boredom stamped on my memory highway.\u000a\u000aWhen they say first impressions are everything in this case that theory is proved correct.  Having smoked this strain a shit ton, more fingers &amp; toes than most humans have my feelings have evolved.  Knowing the parents as I do now it makes sense.  The White being super stony usually with outrageous %&#39;s yet of almost no flavor.  My comparison is to tofu in that it can be mixed with other foods or WIFI with other strains blending to taste similar but amp up the THC.  Fire OG also is not super bold in the ol factory department albeit having a better profile, but to me homoginized to that lemon Pledge smell.\u000a\u000aBoth roots of lineage give off stellar highs and are beautiful to look at for different reasons.  White has a massive amount of crystals while Fire is like a quality tapestry of foresty greens interwoven with an overabundance of fire red hairs.  Which does make for some good looking flower that I have learned really shows off the terpenes it has when smoked in a joint.  It seems all the flavor saves itself down at the bottom 2nd half of joint in all that resin &amp; oil build up.  Usually it is the other way around with the butt end tasting like ass.\u000a\u000aSo now there is no doubt it will still be the last strain before going without herb for the night.  Yet the eye roll &amp; sigh will only be out of habit for as quick as a doobie can be rolled there will be nothing but irie gratitude.  Door #1 or Door #2???  After 20 minutes of deep thought Door #3 is the winner =)

VStrain was a decent one, not the heat I&#39;ve ever had but not the worst. Buds are a dense Christmas tree looking buds that are a light green with darker green and a frosting of white trichomes. The high comes on after a few minutes and is very clear headed with a lazy body high to it. It gave me some mental energy, and the desire to do things yet offset that with a lazy body high to it (not couch-locking, just lazy-inducing.)

The taste is that of a classic piney OG, tastes identical to pink kush. Have water cause it does dry your mouth.

Bad idea she hit it said it was smooth and sweet. so she smoked the hole gram nugg I gave her. 15 minutes later she said I need water and a chicken sandwich.  I laughed and made her food. as I was cooking I heard whistling coming from the living room. I walked in and my wife was getting down whistling the theme from Steam Boar Willy. The old Mickey mouse cartoon. I asked if she was OK and she said I need to eat and go to sleep my hand is a purse I can&#39;t find my hand. I laughed again and wnet and smoked a single nugg no more than a .3 I then returned to check on my wife and she had finished her dinner and fell asleep.

VThese little popcorn nugs are crusty, white with a tint of green &amp; fire hairs that are pervasive throughout the nug.  Upon inhalation,  this sativa dominant strain goes straight to the head, energizing the mind and kicking in some nice euphoric benefit for a quick energy boost. I enjoy this flower for daytime consumption.  THC levels are higher in this one, so be prepared if you decide to consume.

VThe first 30 minutes of my day tend to determine the path of the rest of it... If it starts in negativity, it stays there. So I make a ritual of greeting each day, fresh and new. Each day deserves its own reverence; its own beauty. Take a deep breath; and if you&#39;re wise, you&#39;re taking a deep breath of White Fire OG.\u000a\u000aThis hard-hitting flower will knock your wake-and-bake into next week. One bowl seemed to burn forever, and the potency was consistent from start to finish.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of start to finish, White Fire OG helped me finally get the mind to finish multiple unfinished tasks... The sign of a strain I won&#39;t be parting with anytime soon. Love weed as I may, productivity is the standard I hold the best strains to. Sativas can overwork my overly active mind... Strains like White Fire keep your head up while keeping you kicked back. \u000a\u000aWhat more could a girl ask for?\u000a\u000aFire acquired from Underground Meds

A good smoke which doesn&#39;t dictate the rest of your day for you, if you feel to chill it will allow you to do so quite comfortably however off you have stuff to do then it will provide focus and clarity in that task without stripping you of the energy to crack on with it. Very tasty kushy earthy fuel flavor. #420sweepstakes

I would say I&#39;m a seasoned smoker and this actually got me to where I wanted to be in only half a blunt. It has a very cerebral high and has me focused as I&#39;m writing this review. I&#39;d give this strain a 10/10 but would definitely not recommend this for new smokers.

It kills any stress I&#39;m feeling, and makes me feel really good about life, even on bad days. I would recommend this to anybody who prefers a fun, silly high.

This strains lasts for more than 3 hours for me, pain is melting along with a relaxed sleeping factor. This strain is great for tinnitus, headaches, depression, pain, insomnia, fibromyalgia, OCD, Ant&#39;s and of course ADHD/ADT this is great its earthy and woody flavored vape vis just awesome deadhead, critical ssh, and now White Fire OG is just a great to have a trio, but I am still on the search for the best strain medicine for me and maybe others.

VVery sweet-tasting, and one of the strongest &quot;daytime&quot; buzzes you could ask for, but no edge at all. In fact it&#39;s so strong that I don&#39;t recommend smoking it; use a vape, or it&#39;ll go to your head more than you might be ready for. It&#39;s so strong that the store I got it from classified it as a pure indica; I had to tell them it was a 60% sativa.

After getting to my pot dealers house I notice the last jar he pulls out of his strain library was &quot;White Fire OG&quot; So I bought a quarter oz. of that and am now writing this review to tell all of you that this is a very great smoke and for being in Washington, having a referral for medical cannabis (being able to access many varieties of bud and not having to pay a shitty tax and being able to have these plants without getting shafted by that judge), this is by far up in my top 5 favorite strains as of now. 5/5\u000a-Kj

VFirst time using this strain after having a few experiences with both The White and Fire OG. Used some potent Shatter concentrate rated at  82% THC .8.% CBD .4% CBN. Used my new Source Orb 4 which prefer over their e-nail which i use from time to time cuz its just so clean n easy.\u000aAnyway to the good stuff.. i had just woken up about 20 min before and when i took the first hit i felt a strong tingly lightness flow through my body. While i was packing in a rice size dab before i could hit the fire button i felt a pleasantly uplifting euphoria close my eyes and just couldn&#39;t stop smiling. Took 2 more dabs by the time i met up with my friends i was on cloud 9. Not super lazy stoned but more super happy funny stoned. The one thing i noticed was that everything was excessively funny. So this is really a perfect socializing, get your day going, or night started type of strain. I wouldn&#39;t use this if I&#39;m just sitting around doing nothing i think it would make my ADD go nuts so I&#39;m glad I was out.\u000aYou need the right strain for a good time this is it!!

VWhite Fire OG is a potent hybrid that lets you feel the effects of both its sativa and indica genetics. I recommend it mainly for experienced users, as the effects may be too powerful for the uninitiated. It&#39;s what we OG tokers call &quot;one-hit-shit&quot;. I was also able to get a big ball of finger hash just from grinding up half an ounce. In other words, it&#39;s the &quot;sticky-icky&quot; (more OG toker terminology).

The exhale tasted a little more sour/citrus and dry, though still enjoyable. \u000aThis is a fast acting, cerebral high that will be followed up with a nice relaxing body effect.

VSuper great strain. Had a pretty quick onset. Hit through a bong thrice and had a nice heady eye buzz which lasted a good 30 min. After that I fell into a euphoric relaxation that dosnt glue you to the couch too hard. Makes conversation easy. Made my anxiety heighten but only a few instances I smoked this strain. Tastes earthy and the smell is super pungent. Smells like outside

Knocks out back and neck pain, gets me hungry and helps me sleep a solid 7 to 8hrs! Instead of 4hrs at a time. Ine of my favorite OG&#39;s also one of the strongest. Must have and I reccomend it!

I deal with chronic pain due to a brain surgery I had about 6 years ago, &amp; I also broke my back motorcycle racing prior to the tumor. and currently experiencing intense shopping I have a bad tooth. I was in such horrible pain last night and let me tell you, this beautiful plant, took away my pain, especially the one in my jaw. and slowly loved me to sleep. this stuff is so enjoyable I can smoke it during the day or the evening, keep my pain tolerance levels at bay, I do have a slight bit of dry mouth like a 4 of 10 not anything big on the munchies so no real negative side effects this may be one of my new favorites&#128548;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;

VTaste is excellent. Spicy and a citrus flavor which is hard to pin down. Body feel from the Fire OG in this takes a while to come on but very relaxing when it does. The White side is not too wound up but keeps you going during the day. This strains parents The White and Fire OG are synergistic. White Fire is much more effective than either alone. It is one of those strains if well grown I would always keep a stash.

VI am currently vaping this strain via the Jetty E-juice CO2 oil ... mixed 2 parts carrier (PG, VG, PEG 400, etc.) to one part CO2 oil.   Vaping it this way is about 90% body high, very little cerebral.  I can vape quite a bit and not feel like I&#39;m too stoned, whatever.  Very much in control, but quite buzzed.   I tried not to over dilute the oil, but would probably dilute closer to one to one next time. \u000a\u000aThis is good if like me you don&#39;t want to get completely ripped, as I am doing this more for the medical aspect.  But then it&#39;s probably not good for folks looking to get complacent baked.  \u000a

VThis is, hands down, my least favorite strain. I find the high to be way too cloudy and heavy, but without the euphoria or relaxation. It incites more paranoia with the heaviness - and I should note, I&#39;ve been a daily smoker for 10 years now. This is one of the only strains that&#39;ll make me feel genuinely uncomfortable. \u000a\u000aThat&#39;s my experience - and in all fairness, it also could have been a lower quality batch from the dispensary.

VThis was a beautiful strain, tastes great and the fade lasted a while, i blazed it taking a walk in the morning and it smoked so slowly and evenly

VI am pretty Dam high right now. Really good fat nugs. Only thing I noticed is the nugs aren&#39;t that dense. I&#39;m still pretty new to smoking tho... So I&#39;m not sure if just some weed is like that.. But anyways I get a sweet/diesel taste Haha.. And I like it!! So yea it&#39;s really nice. Highly recommend!

VThis has a cool chill buzz to it. Its not so intense that you get confused or easily distracted. Great social weed.
