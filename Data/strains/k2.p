VIt&#39;s been a long time before I ran into this strain. Always good reviews about this weed. Very strong strain and fulfilled all the expectations. Extremely dense buds with a nice smell. Covered in small, detailed hairs and looks promising. Strong buzzing feeling with great body high. Taste is pretty good. Good for relaxation but prepare to get your ass kicked by this one.

VVery piney, with a good strong Indica buzz, and nice smell. The taste is an even stronger pinene flavoring, and only has minimal hints of limonine. Very good for those who like their herbs to smell like trees. It&#39;s lineage is good and strong, Hindu Kush x White Widow, and I do enjoy both those strains from time to time.

VCompact mostly dark green buds, smell is not really clear or heavily present. The taste is hard to define as well, a bit earthy and woody, leaving a burning sensation at the top of the throat, wich is also the only real spot for cottonmouth. The effects are &#39;just chill&#39;, they&#39;re not heavy or overpowering, I can easily have two spliffs of this and not feel paranoid or completely couchlocked. Which is typical for this strain. I consider it a true hybrid. The body has a slight tingling sensation and the mind is relaxed but not too clouded. A bit of time dostortion sets in later on, but leaves you capable of getting stuff done. Thus K2 might be an excellent daytime medication for some, but since I use recreationally I&#39;m not sure it would kill pain or relax muscles as much as you need. At higher doses slight CEV&#39;s, and it does help you relax your mind to fall asleep, instead of punching you out like stronger types do. It&#39;s the balance, more than the strength of the effects and my personal preference that make me rate this 4 stars.

VSmoked this stuff a while back out of my pipe, to me it was no different than the regular shit but the high lasted somewhat longer. Real earthy taste with a real strong smell. The smell was sort of misleading in a way, maybe I just picked up a crappy batch of this stuff but overall this strain is somewhat decent.

VI paid $35 for an eighth  on special and it was well worth it.  I smoked a bowl of this strain a few minutes after waking to increase my appetite and reduce nausea.  My nausea quickly disappeared which allowed me to get ready for work with no set backs and I was ready for breakfast 30 minutes later (breakfast can be a task with my symptoms).\u000aThe K2 made me feel happy relaxed and I felt a pretty standard appetite increase.  It did not make me sleepy but it was not a sativa dominant &#39;focus&#39; high either.\u000a\u000aI also enjoyed this throughout the day on my day off!

VI just fell in love with this strain. I have severe anxious problems and this is answer for my problems. Makes me very giggly, relaxed and slightly euphoric. Deep headspace, like said earlier.\u000a\u000aVery mellow and fruity smell!\u000a Actual high is mellow but kind of anxious, if i smoke only one bowl.\u000aBut in higher amounts it makes me feel good and relaxed. My anxiousness is gone thanks to this lovely strain.

VIf you smoke a gram with a friend or to yourself it will feel great. If you smoke like a bow or two you will get the following. I got excited, because of the white widow. Sure it got me moving, but I was paranoid of my actions and/or what I was going to say. The hindu kush will get you an appetite, but i found myself not liking the food i usually enjoy when high off of other indicas. It isn&#39;t bad. I just prefer other strains for better results.
