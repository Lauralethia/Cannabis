VWhen I first fell in love with pot it was Sour D that brought me in. I thought there could be no better bud on earth than that, and before Sour D I was never all that interested in pot. Over the years I have found some strains that were to me slightly better. But nothing Compared to the goat. This strain is a powerhouse of anti nausea, anti pain, and anti depression/anxiety, while keeping me up better than coffee I usually stay up till 5:30 in the morning on it. Not to mention my fiance who suffers from severe depression, when she smokes this its cured 100%, and life becomes instantly joyous again for her after it hits. This stuff is what weed should be, what growers should aspire too when they make new strains. I prefer a vaporizer but its good any way you hit it.

VThis is a perfect medicating strain for me. The Golden Goat has to be one of my new favorites, and I recommend it to anyone who can get the correct genetics. The flavor is fruity and top notch, and the high is absolutely top shelf. the nugs were medium sized and pretty dense, also quite stanky. The high is really heady but relaxing and stress relieving to the max. A great strain to chill out with.

VPURE FIRE.  Golden Goat has a distinct, incredibly rich smell of sugary soda pop syrup in cans that have been heating in the sun. It smells sweet, floral, cotton candy like, and it also has a gentle &quot;pine tree&quot; scent dimension. Taking just a couple hits produces a SLAMMING strong high that leaves your head disoriented and almost makes it hard to talk for a few minutes. The initial rushes mellows out and becomes sustainably euphoric and energizing,  but you can feel just the perfect amount of the Romulan (indica) in it also... producing an undertone of a subtle body high and pronounced pain relief. A couple of his and my fibromyalgia pain would be GONE for at least 2 hours.  \u000aGreat weed for yoga - as it gives you energy and takes the edgy of discomfort off of stretching -  and daytime use. Has a slightly &quot;golden&quot; hue and is avalanched with trichomes. 10/10. \u000a

VGolden Goat, is the best day time smoke ever!  I don&#39;t mind the taste produced from vaping.  My grumpy morning mood is no more after a few hits of the vape first thing, or shortly after my feet touch the ground.  I have energy to want to stay busy, and my mind is clear and focused!  Anxiety level is not an issue at all with Golden G.!  It&#39;s the best A.D.D med ever!  I keep up with it all day and then cool down with a good Indi at night.  I don&#39;t feel the need for a nap at all on Golden G.  It&#39;s keeps my battery going, and going!  I don&#39;t get the hella munchies with this strain, but when I do eat, I savor every bite.  Yummm. Viva la Golden Goat!

VWow!!! I think I&#39;ve finally found the perfect sativa. GG potent (25% thc claimed) gave me the perfect high. Motivated, creative, energetic, happy yet able to maintain. I was able to actually get &quot;stoned&quot; without increasing my anxiety, in fact reliving it.  This is rare for me. One good hit does it for me, so it&#39;s economical as well. A+ strain in my opinion.

VI love this near perfect hybrid. The sativa effects come on almost immediately and then eventually the indica elements start to appear. The high is a great combination of mind and body.\u000a\u000aGolden Goat is great for nearly any occasion. It doesn&#39;t matter if you want to be social or alone this will do the trick. Versatility is the key with this one. Don&#39;t miss it if you have the chance.

VMy roommate and I are fairly new to smoking, but to celebrate the end of the semester we decided to pick up 3gs of golden goat. The first thing I noticed about this strain was how pretty it was. I prefer to break weed down with my fingers and this was, by far, my favorite strain to break apart. The combs behind the leaves were insane and filled with crystals. We had 2 joints and 2 blunts ready to go, so we left the front door of our dorm building and walked around the neighborhoods. Smoking this strain was insanely fun, her and I usually get a little paranoid, but no paranoia came along with this strain. All of our worries dripped away (especially helpful for the end of the semester). Her and I totally felt euphoria on the strain\u2014definitely one of the happiest highs I&#39;ve ever felt. I totally recommend this strain I loved it. Only possible issue would be is my roommate felt a little dizzy on our walk back to the dorm.

VSeven Clover&#39;s Golden Goat is sweetness. The uplifting, euphoric mix up you receive from smoking this &#128015;GOAT strain is unreal. The taste is very definitive. A mostly sweet but slightly spicy but all the way appealing. Although hybrid, this strain is seemingly more heavier on the sativa side giving it a great rush of energy &amp; you can&#39;t help but wanting to smile. This strain over all is a day time meditators best friend. I high ly suggest you get this strain. &amp; thank you Seven Clover for this tasty bud!

VI have not had the pleasure recently, of smoking anything that is really &quot;5 Stars&quot;, but Golden Goat is probably more accurately at 4.75, and that is exceptional for a hybrid.\u000a\u000aEveryone and their experiences are unique... lots of variables.  That said, hybrids of today are potent but lack the subtlety of the old landraces, in my opinion and as a general rule.  Present day strains hit hard and fast, and their Indica and Sativa components can be felt almost distinctly rather than perfectly melded.\u000a\u000aGolden Goat is an excellent example of a well blended hybrid.  The high is energetic, racey, cerebral and it is natural to be productive, creative and happy.  It is a 65/35 Sativa/Indica mix of Hawaiian Romulan (potent Indica) and Island Sweet Skunk (Sativa mother), so the body effects are definite and strong but do not detract and in fact, are a superb enhancement.\u000a\u000aThe full effects are long lasting and here&#39;s the kicker... No crash!  The first time I smoked it, the high lasted from morning to night, and never did I feel sleepy or lazy... very stoned but cleared headed and clear eyed.  The high fades so incrementally that unless one is constantly &quot;medicating&quot;, you will notice the high even the next day.\u000a\u000aHaving read many reviews, I tend to gloss over the look, feel, smell, taste descriptions because while those things are fun to discuss and aesthetically pleasing, they do not inform my opinion nearly as much as the effects.\u000a\u000aOnce I discovered it, I went back and bought as much as I could.... even though they were down to grams.  And that&#39;s the name of that tune.\u000a\u000aOn my scale, Golden Goat is Moby Tripper weed.

VI normally don&#39;t like to post my opinion online, but I thought it would be a shame for this strain to go unrecognized.  I found this to be a great mood-lifter.  With a light to moderate usage of this strain, my wife and I both felt our cares melt away.  We did get a bit giggly (something I enjoy but others might not), but it mellowed out to a functional high while still retaining that happy, contented feeling.  I recommend this strain for anxiety/depression/PMS.

VThis flower is best described as being a combination of sweet, sour, and spicy, with a tropical fruit flavor with an out of package flower that will quickly have you drooling as it permeates the surrounding air. \u000aEffects are strong and felt from head to toe, lasting about 1-2 hours.\u000aIf you need to get things done, then this flower is for you.\u000aGolden Goat has many attributes to like but the one that I particularity take more of are its calming effect on my right side Spasticity (arm &amp; leg muscle stiffness and tone) due to a TBI, it makes my Spasticity becomes minimal.\u000aMy thought processes become heightened and remain quite clear. It is so very easy to focus on many given tasks throughout the day, rest and relaxation will not be accomplished.  \u000aYou are good to go for whatever crosses your path. \u000aThis is my go to flower and Botanico MMJ is my go dispensary .\u000aIt is the Boanico house strain which make it even more awesome because the next reliable one is just like the other ones. and it becomes that old friend you cherish.  Life isn\u2019t so harsh when medicating with Golden Goat.\u000a\u000aCan&#39;t say enough good about this dispensary or strain!\u000a~Life Is Good in Colorado Where It&#39;s Good To Be &quot;Green&quot;.

I&#39;ve been enjoying this awesome strain for a few days, mostly afternoon/early evening smoking for anxiety/depression/PTSD. The flavor is subtle and sweet, and very easy on the throat. The effects are fast and intense, starting with a clear-and-focused mental high, coupled with a mellow body buzz. Anxiety and depression vanish, replaced by a serene, calm, and sensuous euphoria. This is fantastic for when I want to relax but still need to function. HIGHLY recommended for PTSD/anxiety/depression.

It&#39;s a clean high, doesn&#39;t drag you down at all but, at least for me, it&#39;s very relaxing. Golden Goat is euphoric, happy, makes you feel calm and capable.

VI have been dying to get my hands on this strain as I knew the story of its heritage and it is combination of all my favorite strains!!! This is my \u201cPineapple Express\u201d if this strain and that strain had a baby and this other strain and that other strain had a baby and THEN those two babies had a baby...THAT would be Golden Goat, lol...it did NOT disappoint, very unique taste and very stereotypical sativa effects which are delightful! You can taste the skunk and Hawaiian throughout the experience-I\u2019m not an idol worshipper but this golden calf could change my views!!! Maybe my fav to date...that\u2019s a big designation for me...

Vthere&#39;s just no way that nobody can&#39;t like the strain! Even after one bowl of that, you get a euphoric head, body high that keeps you in an uplifted and energized/euphoric mood throughout the entire Buzz of it and it keeps getting repeated if you smoke a little bit more each time to maintain it throughout your day!

VI picked this strain up from The Source in Las Vegas. It was grown and cultivated by Flora Vega, whos products I have been pleased with in the past. I gravitated towards this strain due to it testing high in the terpenoid profiles I was looking for to help relieve my chronic back pain amongst some other medical aliments. This strain tested with: a Terpinolene at 16.8mg/g  (antibacterialand anti-insomnia), B Caryophyllene at 11mg/g (an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antidepressant, and a anxiolytic), and B Myrcene at 9.8 mg/g (an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antispasmodic, and is known to allow more absorption of cannabinoids by the brain).\u000aThe appearance is a beautiful green with rosey gold pistol covered in sugary trichomes. The aroma is a sweet citric mentholated pine. It smoked out smoothly, with a sImilar taste to how it smells. The ash turned white, which indicated to me it was high quality and lacked residual moisture.\u000aIt left me feeling cerebrally balanced, social, relaxed, while still upbeat. It helped elevate some of my pain, but I would not recommend it for just pain management needs. It is definitely a strain I will keep in my cannabis cupboard for social, upbeat, higher energy, and creative moments.\u000aGive it a try, great for the times you want the sativa feel without the paranoia. It also has so many other beautiful properties, including anticancer, anti-proliferative, anti-mutagenic, and antipsychotic. Hope you found this helpful! \u000a~Trippy Gingy~

VI thought I liked Indicas for their relaxing properties, but Golden Goat and Strawberry Cough have proven otherwise. Golden Goat didn&#39;t make my muscles feel heavy, or weak in the knees, which some indicas do (and I dislike very much). Instead, symptoms of depression and irritability were gone in minutes, replaced by a cheerful, non-intrusive euphoria and a desire to explore creative avenues of expression. It really just turns a bad night into a great night. I consider myself a lightweight, and this never made me feel like I was hovering over an abyss of anxiety like, say, Death Star did. Overall, my new favorite, Strawberry Cough being a close second.

VRan out of Sour D last night so I went into my Shake (hash) bag and found a bunch of little GG nuggs. I haven&#39;t smoked this in about two months and forgot how much I liked this bud. Took Kaya for a good 45 min walk while smoking &quot;The Goat&quot;.... Was so happy and comfy being outside on a perfect 80 degree summer Sunday(Bruins Ceremony before the Sox game).I felt like I was hearing each individual bird chirp from all around me. GG def enhances colors and sound...You know that feeling of getting used to a strains effects when that&#39;s all you&#39;ve been smoking for 3 weeks?? It was so good to smoke this again..forgot how much I really like this strain and how I took it for granted.. Baaahahahahahaha!!!!

VGolden Goat is a smooth, strong strain that I would like to smoke again as a concentrate, seeing as that is my preferred method and I enjoyed the flower so much. \u000a\u000aThe only thing I would change is to dilute it with some sort of flavoring in a vaporizer so that I am able to  make it last a little longer and see if it makes me even more productive. While smoking Golden Goat and after, I found my hands to be useful tools, getting housework and other chores done more easily. For me, the effects are a great mix of mellow and movement.

This is THE perfect business time weed.  \u000aIt&#39;s too indica of a hybrid for what I was looking for (it was listed as a Sativa where I bought it and I was expecting something to get me moving)... Very couch-locky, and absolutely insane munchies with this one (I&#39;m trying to diet, man!). I&#39;ve smoked it on lunch breaks on very stressful days, and while it&#39;s not super ideal for customer interactions and hustle, I&#39;m incredibly friendly and not worried about a damn thing. \u000aIf you&#39;re looking for a more solid up-and-at-em sativa, look elsewhere, but GG is nothing to spit at. &#128154;

Vadvised by the budtender that it&#39;s sativa dom, I went without a pure sativa and gave golden goat a whirl. it isn&#39;t going to have you tripping balls, it isn&#39;t going to knock you out...I wouldn&#39;t even call it an &quot;enhancement&quot; strain. rather, I was mildly (then not so mildly after scarfing a tostada) elevated. the worries of the previous (shit ass) week vanished, I was smiling and sociable, but not goofy high. this would be a great strain for someone that just wants to feel &quot;better&quot; and not necessarily go on a euphoric rollercoaster ride.

VUsing an oil cartridge form of this strain. This strain has an immediate impact and I know it&#39;s working every time. Focus can be intense and you&#39;ll forget the context in which you&#39;re doing things. It doesn&#39;t necessarily keep me productive as it&#39;s sort of relaxing, but I have no problem getting simple tasks done. Pairs great with caffeine as it amplifies the euphoria. Not a ton of creativity ensues, but there&#39;s some there. On this strain I find I&#39;m driven more by instinct and impulse, but can have self control if necessary. Don&#39;t really get the munchies. In fact, sometimes the opposite happens and I don&#39;t eat for hours. May be a great post workout/protein shake strain. Food does taste better.

VTruly a wonderful strain. Beautifully balanced hybrid. This is strong medicine and the indica effects are felt heavily - pain relief, stress, anxiety, but are not sedative/couch locky like some indicas, and the sativa cross provides a nice clear cerebral high. Perfect for those who need some pain/anxiety relief but still need to retain focus. Day or nighttime appropriate. Also good for nausea, cramps, bipolar, and headaches.

VTruly a wonderful strain. Beautifully balanced hybrid. This is strong medicine and the indica effects are felt heavily - pain relief, stress, anxiety, but are not sedative/couch locky like some indicas, and the sativa cross provides a nice clear cerebral high. Perfect for those who need some pain/anxiety relief but still need to retain focus. Day or nighttime appropriate. Also good for nausea, cramps, bipolar, and headaches.

VLocation: Lightshade on Sheridan \u000aTHC: Unknown\u000aCBD: Unknown \u000aTHC-A: 19.21%\u000a\u000aAdditional Notes: I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of its smell, but wanted to try something different and am glad I did! \u000a\u000aAppearance Rating: 4.25\u000aAppearance Description: The Golden Goat were cultivated with great care and quality. They&#39;re a muted green color with several pinkish orange hairs. The well developed trichromes cover the flower. Unfortunately, the manciure job was not the best and the trimmer left more leaf on the buds than I would care to see. \u000a\u000aTaste Rating: 4.25\u000aTaste Description: As stated in other reviews, I&#39;m not huge into the flavor of Jack Herer or Train Wreck which is what this strain reminds me of - Especially the smell. The taste was slightly different than expected; I got hints of lemon and pine with sweet hints of fruit. It was very unique and although it still isn&#39;t my favorite, it was enjoyable. \u000a\u000aEffects Rating: 5.00 \u000aEffects Description: This is a very, very strong Sativa leaning strain. Within a couple minutes, you can feel the energized high hit you. The high sets in quick and comes on strong, so I&#39;d caution low tolerance and new users to go slow. I did almost start getting some anxiety from this strain, but as soon as I became active it washed away.\u000a\u000aOverall Rating: 4.50 (Rounded to 5)\u000aOverall Summary: I wanted something different and definitely found it with this strain. The high, if it sounds like the type you&#39;re into, is the real star here. If you enjoy the flavor of Jacks and Wrecks more than I do, then you&#39;ll definitely be pleased. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m Keith Von Fraichen ... You Keep On Fraiching

VExcellent sativa that uplifts your mood without knocking you out. It makes me clearheaded but I do find myself getting a little more sidetracked by following fleeting thoughts. This can be a good thing as I often find myself still being productive, tackling tasks that I had been mentally avoiding/procrastinating. Some body effects too \u2013 could see this being good for pain relief and relaxation. Makes your day feel/appear just a little bit brighter.

VIt tastes and smells soooooooooooo good... The nugs I got were great size but not very dense, not a big deal. It was cured well and broke up into a TASTY JAR OF GOODNESS! I keep finding myself having these moments where I slide open the drawer, pull out the jar and pop the lid just to soak it up for a few seconds... Actually more like minutes because this stuff is some of the most potent stuff around. The smell lingers longer than most other strains, so if you&#39;re worried about being discreet or trying to conceal you might be up poop creek. Even my Smoke Buddy can&#39;t tame all of the Golden Goat goodness! I&#39;d say this is a winner for those looking for an AMAZING tasting smoke that benefits those needing it for mood elevation, depression, stress, etc... Your typical sativa stuff, just exceptional quality. The 1/8th I got was from AZ Organix and had around 24% THC. Out the door for under $40. That&#39;s a steal for this top notch strain. Golden Goat is worth a shot so try it if you can!

VUsing an oil cartridge form of this strain. This strain has an immediate impact and I know it&#39;s working every time. Focus can be intense and you&#39;ll forget the context in which you&#39;re doing things. It doesn&#39;t necessarily keep me productive as it&#39;s sort of relaxing, but I have no problem getting simple tasks done. Pairs great with caffeine as it amplifies the euphoria. Not a ton of creativity ensues, but there&#39;s some there. On this strain I find I&#39;m driven more by instinct and impulse, but can have self control if necessary. Don&#39;t really get the munchies. In fact, sometimes the opposite happens and I don&#39;t eat for hours. May be a great post workout/protein shake strain. Food does taste better.

However, I remember trying to watch tv, and not being able to focus, thus causing me to become anxious. So I would like to try it again and maybe go out and do something.

VI picked up some of the &quot; Golden Goat &quot; strain from Zoey&#39;s at the MMJ Market at the Lax Lounge in Phoenix, Az on Sunday 03  22 2015. 1st off the Buds are very impressive,  all identical, pretty much, which is a good sign of a knowledgeable grower,  I was not be let down..   The light, lime green, dense nug structure is ideal, low firewood, lots of veg, and the smell is simply out of the world, I was almost buzzed by just opening the Jar. Honestly,    I went to get some GSC, or OGIESEL, but when I saw and smelled the Goat, I knew I found what I was looking for. The white frost on the light green  buds made for great bag appeal, the smell is amazing, totally organic, soil grown, top notch, IMO Cannabis Cup caliber bud for sure, if you have a chance to get your paws on some of this top shelf flower, then consider yourself lucky and enjoy.      Take Care fellow med users.

VFor me, Golden Goat feels like a good hybrid for about an hour, give or take, depending on how much I consume. \u000a\u000aAt the tail end of the high, I fall hard and fast into a debilitating sleep. The naps aren&#39;t long, but when I wake up I feel refreshed. \u000a\u000aThe effects were a pleasant surprise. I can use it to get through my wife&#39;s honey do lists, and still take a refreshing nap afterwards. \u000a\u000aAgain, this is how Golden Goat affects me.

I don\u2019t know about you, but I will be looking at the test dates from now on. 7 month old product and it could be older than that when it was tested. Unacceptable. Make some tincture or other concentrates please. (It did release a burst of \u2018Why I bought it in the first place\u2019 when the scissors cut the bud--spicy tropical candy smell).\u000aLook: Not the best representation but not too shabby on looks alone. Dense dark nugs, covered in curled up dark orange hairs.  \u000aTaste: The Sweet Island Skunk was tropically present (with some nose burn). It was a nice spicy taste. I will be seeking this strain in a much more recently loved strain...from a different dispensary. My world is not allowing cannabis to be like candy on a rack--that others go through, handle, open, touch and smell. \u000aRecommendation for medicine: Will redo this strain and section of this strain when I find a fair representation of such fine genetics.

VI purchased 2 Golden Mini J&#39;s (as well as some other lovelies) from High Country Healing in Silverthorne and wasn&#39;t disappointed.  Very smooth pulls from this mini joint along with a pleasant, earthy taste.  The onset of the buzz was incredibly fast and lasted for several hours due to the 20%+ thc content.  Honestly can&#39;t say I&#39;d pass this strain up the next time I&#39;m visiting.

VThis strain is my single favorite, unlike all others its highs get better with time whereas all my other favorites diminish after a while of smoking them. Some may not like her, if not I don&#39;t think pot should be your drug of choice.

It is one of the only strains that have been great every time, no matter where I buy it.

VIt was shortly after 4pm when I decided to put down my day job and contribute to my never ending quest to find gourmet cannabis. Todays subject matter, Golden Goat. After a few puffs I felt at peace and had an appetite that was increasing by the moment. A local Mexican restaurant two blocks down the road came to mind and the next thing I knew a friendly waiter was handing me a burrito, a chicken enchilada and a beef tamale. As I was eating dinner, it occurred to me that people knew the temperature of the air inside the home but not the water temperature, and what about the gallons  of water used and what was the quality of the water and the air. I thought it was brilliant idea and started drawing my new hydro electric thermostat. After I designed and drafted an isometric drawing of it on a napkin, I gave the waiter a nice tip and walked out happy...Light can travel around the entire planet nine times every second , it took me longer than that to walk back the two blocks in the snow, but my heart mind and soul were warm. Keep them buds reaching for the stars L&#39;Eagle.

Delicious. Other than taste and smell, and a general sense of well-being (laughed a lot, made jokes, focused on trivial things.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t try multi-tasking on it though: can&#39;t remember ten minutes ago and there is definitely a time vacuum buried somewhere in the middle of these buds.

V\u2022 Very excited to see this on menu board at &#39;my happy place&#39;, as it&#39;s on the list of strains I must try! True to description, Golden Goat&#39;s flavors are a spectacle for taste buds: sweet, sour &amp; SPpiiiicCY!\u000aThis oil concentrate (which is crossed w/Ghost OG) from Advanced Grow Labs clocks in at 60.9% &amp; is a lovely, honey-color.. And while it&#39;s true I&#39;m enjoying the all around- &#39;lovely&#39; of this indica-leaning hybrid, I believe this one may be best for MMJ-newbies for its&#39; cerebral-lack of intensity &amp; general &quot;warming&quot; nature of this one.. feels like (a numbing of) my pain, stress, anxiety are blanketed with a cozy, comfy, 4 \u2b50\ufe0f (golden) goat &#128016; hug! \u2022

Vvery nice head high love the way it looks and taste. great bud for sitting back and watching a movie or doing some light work on the computer. Although i don&#39;t enjoy sativias too often this hybrid is nice. i 100% love the look, the hairs look like their just blanketing the bud and consuming it. The smell is clean and fresh, love it.

VAs I pop open the container of this pain clinic I&#39;m a start to see very cloudy yellow dusted buttds. Golden goat has a very citrus and lime smell to them along with a hint of Pine and sage. Golden goat to me is more like a piece of pie or a cup of chai tea it&#39;s not as strong as coughing but it gives me the nice mellow relaxed mood that I used to enjoy but these food types.Golden goat gives you a boost of you for sensation that will slowly coming your body then comes in a Nother sensation of darkness Stone key tones and very lemon lime taste as well it&#39;s still very pungent and I don&#39;t think I could do this constantly as it does cause a lot of dry mouth the dry eyes aren&#39;t too bad but there&#39;s a little bit of dizziness. I would say golden goat is great when you&#39;re looking for not too much of a burst of energy but not too relaxing at the same time it&#39;s great for nausea pain stress PTSD ADD ADHD depression and of course ADT if you&#39;re experiencing stress and anxiety this is also going to take for this as well I would rate this train four out of five just because the pungent this is too much. Otherwise great strain.

VPicked up 1/8 of this strain last time I was in Denver Relief, as soon as they opened the jar I knew I needed to try it and was not disappointed at all. Safe to say the best golden goat I&#39;ve had so far. It made for a productive weekend.  It has a lavender like taste and an uplifting energetic/talkative high. I would definitely purchase again.

This strain is no creeper, it hits hard &amp; fast with a giddy euphoria paired with ultimate cashed eyes.  This batch from GreenHouse was 19% THC, 1.5+ THCV.  Stellar strain &amp; harvest!

VQuickly became one of my favorite strains right from the first time I tried it. Really reminds me of some old school dank flowers. The buds are fat and long. They have a nice coating of orange and almost pinkish calyxes. The smell is like a lemon candy and a little piney. The taste is awesome citrus and sandalwood is what I get. Smooth as can be. This strain made me very happy, uplifted, and focused. Enjoyable as hell. A very nice sativa dominant hybrid. Not for beginners.

VThis was the third strain I ever smoked. It smells of a sweet-cutrus-y type smell. Not quite as citrus or pine as, say, juicy fruit. Also not as sweet as a strong indica like blackwater. A nice blend of both worlds. Sweet citrus. The high is an insanely giggly happy strain. Like, the kind of strain to make you sit and shoot the sh*t and laugh uncontrollably at dumb stuff. Euphoric. Definitely recommend for someone struggling with something like depression. Gr8 strain

VA really solid sativa-dominant hybrid. It has a nice smell, that is a bit tropical. It came in large, fluffy nugs. That were light green, with almost pink tricomes. This strain is felt by both the mind &amp; body. I have really liked Hawaiian in the past, and really enjoy Golden Goat as well!

VAmazing Strain, smells exactly how it sounds. It calmed me down. Like a Indica but this strain is 100% Sativa. This is a really good strain for the mind. I felt as if my mind was more clear than it had been in a while. If I was into meditation I would defiantly medicate with this before hand.  Great strain if you want to just relax.

VI&#39;m not a regular smoker, so this may not be a representative review but I found this waaaay too strong. It was recommended to me for social anxiety and depression--I specified to the budtender that I wanted something that wouldn&#39;t induce paranoia or racing thoughts. The first time I smoked it, I had a couple puffs and felt mellow eventually, though it came on strong initially and  wigged me out a little. The second time, I took three hits and I was tripping balls for 2-3 hours: dizzy, paranoid, and way, way too high. I was freaked out enough to text friends to talk me off the proverbial ledge. Maybe this strain is good for seasoned smokers as it sounds like lots of people are happy with it, but those with a low tolerance should go easy with this stuff.\u000a\u000a On the plus side, both times I&#39;ve smoked it I&#39;ve felt more relaxed the following day.

Took three hits and was knocked on the couch for the rest of the night. \u000aEven though it is primarily sativa, the first few times I smoked it, it felt more sativa and put me right to sleep.

I made me paranoid, but I don&#39;t know how much of that paranoia was the strain or how much of it was me.  In the future, I will probably only buy this strain if there&#39;s no other sativa left in the dispensary.  If I had only tried this one I might have liked it but I tried several others and this one was the weakest.  Didn&#39;t give me the creative energy (I have a creative job and needed this boost) or euphoria some of the others gave me.

VGreat day time strain! Especially for those with pain related medical conditions.\u000a\u000aThe effects aren&#39;t overwhelming and makes for a great choice should you find yourself in need of relief when you have to be social afterwards. \u000a\u000aOverall...I definitely like it a lot! But nothing mind-blowing or unique about it. 3/5 overall. For my pain relief, id say its more like a 4/5 though\u000a\u000aAside from the taste....which is absolutely delicious on the exhale!.

VI&#39;ve been smoking a very mature (amber) sample of Golden Goat and really enjoy the high - nice mix of active head high and a relaxing body high. Unlike some other sativa hybrids, Golden Goat has enough of a body high that I never smoke it if I need to get up and get anything done. \u000a\u000aPretty much impossible to multitask on this one. \u000a\u000aGolden Goat has a rich spicy pine-nut smell with a hint of citrus peel. The pine comes through more in the taste but the earthy undertones of the pine-nut comes through here too.

VThe flowers smell very unique! It reminds me of Durban Poison.  I like the smell for how different it is, and at the same time I don&#39;t like how it &quot;clashes &quot;. The flower was a golden green color with a &#39;orange&#39; color hairs. Lots of trichomes on the buds for sure! I smoked small bowls each session (1-3 hits dry pipe). The high set in fast, and for me I found myself being lazy after the first hour. If I wasn&#39;t watching movies on the couch I was probably asleep. I enjoyed the strain. Not exactly what I was looking for,  but a solid strain none the less.

VLog this stuff. Great anytime sativa to lighten the mood. Very functional and the aroma is inviting. I would describe it as very sweet and floral almost lavender like with a tiny hint of sour musky citrus ammonia in there. The ammonia smell is nothing to worry about. It&#39;s a smell I&#39;ve had in several strains such as Cat Piss and Sugar Cookie. The buds are very sticky and moss like with very long hairs. Almost looks like tufts of armpit hair sticking out the nugs. Always gets my creative juices flowing.

It was and still is the most refreshing, strong fruity smelling bud I have ever smelled. Smell is what I go off to try it. This strain if grown right is strong and dense and keeps you feeling good for about 2 hours. But it will make you want to jam out to music and maybe even dance. My friend told me.. Anyways if you are stressed or waking up this is great. It is a day time use or party smoke for me. It helps me eat in the mornings too since I have a bad stomach.

VThe Golden Goat I picked up is really good and I&#39;d get it again.  Dense, good piney flavor, burns slow and is really potent.  One hit and the stone lasted a couple hours.  Had noticeable relief to sore muscles (difficult to explain and my muscles feel light and happy) &amp; the head stone is great for watching movies or just hanging out. There was about a ten minute stretch when I felt a little paranoid but it wasn&#39;t unmanageable.  I haven&#39;t had Romulen before but I bet it is good too. The Island Sweet Skunk is excellent and it&#39;s obvious in this Golden Goat.  TGS gets it right, try it.

Vwelllll..... my particular cuts Hawaiian parent had the smell locked down. This GO smelled like you were standing on a cliff above a waterfall on a small island surrounded by beautiful islamd women all wearing flowers around their necks.  smoke wasn&#39;t too harsh and the bud held its flavor all the way through exhale. I&#39;m really stoned but comfy as dad&#39;s recliner.  not necessarily couch locked but definitely content with chilling with the dog and jamming out. I&#39;m not paranoid and I feel like I could eat a race horse AND it&#39;s jocky. My head seems to but floating smoothly from thought to thought instead of them colliding together. I get really anxious but this strain has me worry free and happy with life. Overall a great stain that I would make a great smoke for in the afternoon after when you want to relax but aren&#39;t ready to go to bed

VSo golden goat is a more stoney strain. I had a sativa the other day (purp Nepalese I believe) that was a MUCH different sativa stone. Golden goat gives you a crazy head high at around 22% THC. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re thinking, and sometimes you think twice about what you just said. I&#39;m high at the coffee cafe writing this now. Hah! Golden goat is a really fun strain for outdoor activities because colours are super bright. Euphoria for me is intense when I&#39;m outside on this strain. I find golden goat is probably a favourite among indica dominant users who are fond of that stoney feeling. (Such as myself) definitely give this strain a try. It is not good for pain though.

VThis stuff smells awesome, Its like a mix of fresh cut grass and orange rinds. Lots of orange hairs weave throughout the buds, its almost like pulling apart cotton rather than breaking apart, but, overall it breaks up decent. Nice crystals dot the leaf close to the steam when you do tear it apart. Burns great, I definitely coughed, you feel something right away. Nothing crazy at first but after about 15 min in you start feeling effects hard, felt euphoric, happy, giggly, talkative, no pain (definitely would not drive), but still felt like I could get stuff done. After about a hour my eyes are heavy, but I&#39;m not tired, slight headache (could be from hacking my brains out) but defiantly alert and attentive (typing this up now). Would highly recommend this strain to anyone who stress, anger issues, or just feeling down. Will bring you right back up!

VOk - this is what I&#39;ve been looking for! Where do I even begin? It smelled like fresh peaches right out of the bag. The nugs are dense, sticky, and don&#39;t want to break apart. They look light green with mango coloured hairs and plenty of trichomes. When smoked it tasted again like peaches, lemon, with notes of chili peppers and sweet, tropical flavors. Very smooth smoke, does in and out easy. Instant effects! Eyes droop, stupid smile, stare off into distance, you get my drift haha. I feel amazing. Instant happiness, focus and euphoria! This is the one for me. May you enjoy it too!

VSkinny, long, conical, with crazy amounts of rust and red hairs, and in massive rust and red clusters.  Very pretty.  After 2, a little coughing, enhanced it a bit.  Immediately behind the eyes, very very mellow full body buzz, a little upper mouth numbness.  After three, full head high, blurry vision, very blurry vision, a little wobbly, kind of euphoric, but a more comical high.  I think it would work well in social situations for people who are anxious but also have a smartass side to them.  I could see enjoying a very comical internal dialogue and laughing at myself while out in public. Fairly pain free but not completely.  It definitely has a alert quality to it while still being heavy behind the eyes and also makes you really loose feeling.  In Turbo2 mode, crazy behind the eyes, full body buzz, immediate numb tong and slurred speech.  Still alert but a bit drunk feeling is the best way to describe it.  In Turbo3 mode very very hyper and energetic, but difficult to talk coherently.  This would be a great artists high as you stay inside your project with some music playing and create effectively without distraction, all with a creative and loose persona.  Best description, a creative wine buzz of sorts.

VHOLY SHIT! I picked up a bag of this in Ann Arbor last night from a dispensary. I got home early from work today and figured I give it a try. It was advertised as 27.3% THC, I figured it was best to ease into it. I packed the ol one hitter up and took two hits and set it down. 10 minutes later I was STONED! The next 3 hours were nothing but video games and cheetos. I will definitely have to dial it back if I want to do anything, cause this hits hard. It&#39;s great! Euphoric, uplifting, and mellow.

The smell is fantastic! I love the citrus/tropical smell. The taste is just as wonderful. \u000aI got mine buds at Native Roots in CO and I highly (ha) recommend them! Consistent quality.

VBesides being a beautiful flower, this strain in the form of the dog walkers is just the right size and comes in a nice tin which I have reused countless times (winning!). I personally would like to see the dog walker in a flower/kief/wax combo and I hope my request reaches those in power (hint ,hint). Other than that I would truly recommend Golden Goat and dog walker(s) for a nice energetic pain relief with no drag and just the right amount of product..

VThe Golden Goat caught my eye on our shelves because of its incredible smell. It is a sweet tropical fruity, juicy joy to behold. Especially intriguing are its genetics, with a Romulan parent bringing beautiful calm Indica genetics to the table combined with Island sweet skunk and Hawaiian sativas produce a really tasty murderously balanced sativa dominant hybrid that is a joy to smoke at any time of the day. Just alter your dosage accordingly. ;)

VA really solid sativa-dominant hybrid. It has a nice smell, that is a bit tropical. It came in large, fluffy nugs. That were light green, with almost pink tricomes. This strain is felt by both the mind &amp; body. I have really liked Hawaiian in the past, and really enjoy Golden Goat as well!

VThis was the third strain I ever smoked. It smells of a sweet-cutrus-y type smell. Not quite as citrus or pine as, say, juicy fruit. Also not as sweet as a strong indica like blackwater. A nice blend of both worlds. Sweet citrus. The high is an insanely giggly happy strain. Like, the kind of strain to make you sit and shoot the sh*t and laugh uncontrollably at dumb stuff. Euphoric. Definitely recommend for someone struggling with something like depression. Gr8 strain

VWhile visiting Colorado, I asked a bud tender for a high sativa and ended up with Golden Goat. I was pretty skeptical because of the name, but oh my goodness! Golden Goat is by far my favorite stain ever now. It tastes like flowers and happiness in the best way possible. Golden goat is a great wake and bake kinda strain, it makes my thoughts and attitude so positive. I sat by the river and smoked a joint and was mesmerized by the colors of the river and the beauty of the mountains. I can\u2019t wait to visit again and experience more Golden Goat happiness.

VThis strain freaked me the fuck out and got me to the point of severe physical and mental discomort almost every time, just using regular dispensary bud. Maybe because I&#39;ve just started smoking the strong sativas, but nothing has been as unpleasant as this one. It caused me to get trapped in some very scary places in my head and it was just strange, almost like a bad psychedelic trip. It did, however, have a few moments where it completely cleared every thought out of my head and relaxed me.

VGreat pain relief from pins and needles nerve pain. Those suffering from painful numbness (yes, I know that this is an oxymoron) this is one of the strains I find most effective. The mind buzz is a nice distractor from pain as well. For those with the super rare CIDP this may be one of the most potent allies to free us from the grips of chronic pain. Flower and tincture work equally well. Try them together to combat a flare up of symptoms.

I made me paranoid, but I don&#39;t know how much of that paranoia was the strain or how much of it was me.  In the future, I will probably only buy this strain if there&#39;s no other sativa left in the dispensary.  If I had only tried this one I might have liked it but I tried several others and this one was the weakest.  Didn&#39;t give me the creative energy (I have a creative job and needed this boost) or euphoria some of the others gave me.

VI really like this one! I don&#39;t feel like it gives the energy that a pure sativa does, but it will get you going! Didn&#39;t have a lot of munchies, but I did get thirsty without much cotton mouth. Nice upper head high with moderate pain relief. Not a huge pain killer though. Did help with focus and motivation!

VPurchased this strain in The Clear vape version. Delicious inhale and smooth exhale. The taste is more on the cannabis side. Took three hits and was knocked on the couch for the rest of the night. \u000aEven though it is primarily sativa, the first few times I smoked it, it felt more sativa and put me right to sleep. Smoked it a couple times during the day and it kept me awake yet relaxed. \u000aDefinitely recommend this strain if you&#39;re going to be relaxing on your day off.

VI&#39;m not a regular smoker, so this may not be a representative review but I found this waaaay too strong. It was recommended to me for social anxiety and depression--I specified to the budtender that I wanted something that wouldn&#39;t induce paranoia or racing thoughts. The first time I smoked it, I had a couple puffs and felt mellow eventually, though it came on strong initially and  wigged me out a little. The second time, I took three hits and I was tripping balls for 2-3 hours: dizzy, paranoid, and way, way too high. I was freaked out enough to text friends to talk me off the proverbial ledge. Maybe this strain is good for seasoned smokers as it sounds like lots of people are happy with it, but those with a low tolerance should go easy with this stuff.\u000a\u000a On the plus side, both times I&#39;ve smoked it I&#39;ve felt more relaxed the following day.

VNot the best looking strain but has an amazing sour fruity-citrus scent and taste that make this a must try. Potent and sticky, reminds me a lot of some Diesel crosses I&#39;ve tried, a bit racy with a strong head rush at first but mostly just an uplifted happy effect after that. Great daytime option for sure. 4.5/5.

VI have already given this a review but I want to add new information based on more experience. I&#39;m actually high on it right now and am motivated to write.\u000a\u000aI felt the sweet skunk effects first, lasted about 10 minutes. A very clear energetic focused and positive head high. Now the Romulan hits me, with great force yet smooth relaxing effect. My worries are swept away as the head high turns fuzzy, laughy, silly, fun, happy. I feel GREAT. This is a real mood lifter. I&#39;m relaxed, calm, and energetic at the same time. Euphoria...what do I mean by the word? Something wordless, perhaps ineffable - yet it&#39;s like a stream of yellow light pulsing through my head. The light carries a thick joyous ethereal energy that is out of this world. Yet I&#39;m still here very much in control of myself and how I appear. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m usually anxious. I&#39;m prone to worry. Some pot can make me paranoid. Oh no! But now? I laugh. I laugh at anxiety, its a funny thing really. I feel too that I can tell what it really is, what the roots of this anxiety are. Yet I didn&#39;t intentionally introspect. This was a laughing revelation, my unconscious ejaculated wisdom. \u000a\u000aWhether you are a Sativa or an Indica fan, I really recommend trying this!

VCerebral. Cramps body, muscles begin to want to do something (very nice feeling). Music sounds amazing. Perfect both for relaxing with YOGA and HARDCORE WORKOUT. Heightens your pain tolerance and you can push yourself way farther. Maybe too far, so you must watch out not to get a cardiac arrest while working out. Opens up your lungs and makes you want to breath in all the air in the world. Enhances smells and tastes.  If you eat, the taste will be very good and you might want more, but DOESN&#39;T really make you hungry.  This along with the fact that it makes you want to move, makes you thirsty and heightens your pain tolerance, this strain is  a perfect strain for working out, but could be really dangerous by pushing you too far. Sobers you up when drinking alcohol and makes you wanna drink more, which can lead to over intake of alcohol. Makes you philosophical and open for deep conversations. Makes you a bit Paranoid!!!! Effect lasts long and might help going into  a deep sleep but only after you work all that THC out. If you worked out you will fall asleep right away, if no workout - your activated, but not used muscles might keep you awake for awhile. Also might make you stay awake for awhile due to paranoia (thinking if you locked the door and etc.). Great feeling of freshness in the morning. Overall: perfect powerfull strain. Small doses recommended

VLog this stuff. Great anytime sativa to lighten the mood. Very functional and the aroma is inviting. I would describe it as very sweet and floral almost lavender like with a tiny hint of sour musky citrus ammonia in there. The ammonia smell is nothing to worry about. It&#39;s a smell I&#39;ve had in several strains such as Cat Piss and Sugar Cookie. The buds are very sticky and moss like with very long hairs. Almost looks like tufts of armpit hair sticking out the nugs. Always gets my creative juices flowing.

VI picked up some of this &quot;ear wax&quot; hash yesterday at the dispensary, and all I can say is WOW. This is great medicine! It gives me a warm, energetic buzz that really gets me thinking and helps me be more creative. This is probably the smoothest smoking hash I&#39;ve had. The only down side is that this outstanding high only lasts about a hour, but that could have something to do with tolerance. This helps  with depression and anxiety, but doesn&#39;t really have any analgesic properties for me. But I&#39;m definitely on the lookout for some of these seeds!

VNot my fave. \u000aPurchased in CO, was told it was an intense Sativa. \u000aWell, if you have been to the stores in CO you know that most don&#39;t sell the product in bubble packs, but rather in cap containers, and you can&#39;t see the product. Where as in WA most comes in bubble pack and you can see what you are getting. \u000aSo I get home with my &quot;intense&quot; sativa, golden goat.\u000aIt&#39;s brown. It smells like dirt a bit. \u000aBook by it&#39;s color.... not me!\u000aBut sadly, this strain did not live up to it&#39;s hype. It was weak for a seasoned smoker. Too much toke to gain a consistent medicated state.

VI&#39;ve been smoking the strain for pretty good while its only one that doesn&#39;t give me a headache so far which is great because all the others that I&#39;ve tried have. Does anyone know why the some will give you headaches? And are there certain ones that are known for  giving headaches?  Overall I don&#39;t really feel like it helps my pain and probably distracts me a little. I&#39;m pretty sure that it has not helped me with focusing because I have an issues with that but I also think I have other stuff going on. But I like the strain it doesn&#39;t choke me  i&#39;m not constantly coughing which could be a factor in the headaches also.  Now that I think of it I always coughed with the others !

VI didn&#39;t even smoke it again yet.  Its just seriously has me on my ass for whatever reason.  I mean i have the like mind lock type feeling of an indica where my mind can&#39;t leave a curtain subject like the confidential cheese does to me or the kosher kush did to me. BUT! I have the energetic, talkative, creative feeling of my favorite strong sativa like durban poison and sour diesel.  I don&#39;t know how they did it but this little hybrid has be straight fucked.

VSo, upon my first trip to Denver to check out what life in a truly &quot;free&quot; society is like, the folks at Sweet Leaf were raving about this strain so I partook of a quarter.   \u000a\u000aShort buzz, not that pleasant of a taste, and a high that can best be described as a &quot;downer&quot;. In other words, very introspective to the point of making one completely reevaluate their life so, unless you have no burden of regret that you carry with you like a backpack with bowling balls in it, this strain just may depress the absolute fuck out of you.\u000a\u000aFiguring maybe it was just me, I shared with a few friends. At current count four out of six who I blessed with cones have sworn to never touch the stuff again for the very reason I described.\u000a\u000aAs a caregiver and medical user who has experienced many strains over the past three years, this is the first I&#39;ve encountered to achieve such a non-pleasant effect.\u000a\u000aWhy two stars and not zero, you ask? I dunno, guess I didn&#39;t wanna be &quot;that guy&quot; who left a zero-star review on bud.

It causes Ignatius to speak in the third person and open all doors and windows. \u000a\u000aGolden Goat should be smoked, ingested, or vaped, outdoors, where there this little made-made interaction.

VAfter taking an almost three month break from smoking everything, I made one fatal flaw, DO NOT try to dab like you did three months ago. I will say I thoroughly enjoyed the taste, the smell, and the general sense of euphoria but then like I do with most Sativa dominants I get trapped inside my head and sometimes not for the better. The paranoia was so bad I caused myself to have a panic attack which then meant I needed a nap. But after waking up from the nap and realizing that everything was okay I didn&#39;t feel so bad anymore. Will I dab this again? Yes, you can count on it. Will I make a rookie mistake like I did ever again? Hell No.\u000a\u000aSide Note: \u000aNext time I smoke this I will probably try to find the flower, sometimes the extracts can be just a tad too much.

VOpen the can and you get a strong whiff of fresh lemon Sol and fresh greenery. Very fragrant aromatic smells. the look of the bud is a beautiful light green pigment with heavy crystals covering the nugs all over. Light orange pistols shoot throughout the nugs to give it a exotic look. definitely a treat, for a sativa lover. high comes on strong and lasts, energy buzz and a bit of headiness as you think about things calmly. nice smoke

VOl Skool grown Outdoor organic Golden Goat. Terpene rich and kissed by the rays of the sun. Great all day smoke. Keeps you focused and alert. Happy. I cant tell you how many times my coffee has gotten cold because the caffeine desire was quenched.Starts with that pungent skunky musky taste .. a tribute to its skunk genetics. A flash of citrus here an there reminds you this strain has some hawaiian love built in. The spice from the romulan not too bad.. like I said grown outdoors and kissed by the sun..something to be said for the old ways :)

V3 / 5  Acquired from The Medicine Man in Cortez, CO. This strain was smoked with a pipe for the most part and in different locations. Used this while skiing at Big Bear... which was very enjoyable. That being said I was mixing this with edibles as well so memory is a bit fuzzy and hard to distinguish between them. That being said, great strain for active users or outdoor adventures as its not too strong and allows for control over limbs etc. It made me feel happy, light and warm. Would get this weed again only to make outdoor events more enjoyable as it allowed for &quot;sharpened sensory awareness that can bring out the best of any activity&quot;.\u000a\u000aRemember to take this review with a pinch of salt, every reviews subjective! #StayTuned #CGM

VSour desil has always been my go to medication. After reading reviews on golden goat, I thought it would be perfect for me. Uuuuh noooope! At 1st It gives a \u201chappy feel good\u201d kind of high. after about 2hours gives a major \u201cdowner crash\u201d feeling. It\u2019s similar to a crystal meth high. Bad bad bad!! I\u2019m saying this because 10 yrs ago I was a recovering meth addict. The feelings this strain gave me were too bazar and kinda scary.

VThis is my favorite strain that they carry here. It is a wonderful functional high for me, great for still being able to get stuff done.

VThis strain is good for stress relief, especially while sitting outside. It\u2019s also great for sitting and catching up on a show. However, it tastes and smells so indescribably bad, like an old dirty taxi; it is just terrible. So much so that I\u2019m writing my first marijuana review ever, because I feel like the people must know!!! I thought it was just me, so I let a friend try and he choked for like ten minutes. I smoked it from a vape cartridge by The Clear. So bad.
