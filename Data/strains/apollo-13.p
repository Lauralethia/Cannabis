VHad a decent dark ish sample of Apollo 13 a few months ago. great day time sativa for creative types - writers, painters, mudicians. a very active creative high, albeit short lived. Taste was a typical earthy spice associated with many peppery flavored sativas. I&#39;m an indica guy, but I also play guitar and write songs and this strain has a significant boost in th he creative energy after it is consumed. Looking at it from that perspective, it is one of my favorite sativas along with Durban Poison and Lambs Bread.

VThe Apollo 13 strain is generally one of my favorites, but this sample wasn&#39;t the greatest representative.  The taste was green, and maybe not completely flushed.  It was a creeper that, to me, had more of the heavy indica feel than a sativa.  I got a little bit silly, but overall felt slightly warm and sedated.

Great for a walk, hike, bike ride, fishing, sporting event.   I found it more conducive to walking the dogs and being solo as there is a bit of paranoia with this med.  It is great for hanging with others who are medicated, but I found it a bit too much for hanging out with those who may be in same frame of mind.   This stuff makes me want to get things done.

VApollo 13 is a cross between Brothers Grimm Genius mother and Brothers Grimm P75 father. This Sativa leaves you with an uplifting, psychedelic, high and it certainly packs a floaty punch!

VI find Apollo 13 to be far more sativa in its effects - not much in the way of body buzz.  But, what a great sativa.  You truly do go way up into orbit....then get in trouble?  Tastes like an Earl Grey tea when vaped.  A really uplifting sativa and the effects last for a couple hours.

VFirst strain I ever had that smelled fruity (and damn it tasted as good as they smell) and I&#39;ve been smoking for 20 years, blew my mind. The nuggets were super dank so it made them tough to grind but that&#39;s a non issue for me. Great balance between the effects of sativa and indica that give way to more of a chill indica effect after some time. This is a strain I will absolutely buy again!

VI&#39;ve been smoking for 15 years and this is (for me) a very average strain. I didn&#39;t much like high. Short-lived--maybe an hour and a half to two--and nothing too special. Though I am an Indica dominant fan (and I enjoy some sativas, too), this strain left me feeling anxious, &quot;blurry/foggy,&quot; unfocused, a little paranoid (the more you consume, the more paranoia), a headache and the munchies, followed by the case of the &quot;blahs&quot; (in other words, a flattening effect on emotions). It created for me a &quot;dull&quot; mindset; very distractable, and not a good strain if you&#39;re planning on being productive. You can tell it is mainly a sativa because there&#39;s a noticeable in congruency between the body and mind high--almost no body sensations associated with CBDs and CBNs). Again, these are my own personal subjective experiences. I have tried it a few times, at different times of day (because time of day does play a role in the effects of any given strain) using a vaporizer, and the effects are still disappointing and minuscule. Take into consideration that I am a seasoned smoker with a relatively high tolerance. If you live sativas that imbibe a social, energetic, fidgety high, you will like it. If you like one with balanced effects, find a different strain.

VWow, like a double shot of espresso without the jitters!  This stuff is a great day time med.  this helps me get up and out of the house.  Great for a walk, hike, bike ride, fishing, sporting event.   I found it more conducive to walking the dogs and being solo as there is a bit of paranoia with this med.  It is great for hanging with others who are medicated, but I found it a bit too much for hanging out with those who may be in same frame of mind.   This stuff makes me want to get things done.

VThe Apollo 13 strain is generally one of my favorites, but this sample wasn&#39;t the greatest representative.  The taste was green, and maybe not completely flushed.
