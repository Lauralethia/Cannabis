VOne of the more tame purples I&#39;ve ever had.  Smell is similar to a guiness beer, with a very mellow taste that had some spicey overtones.  Mild body high with warmth and tingly feelings at joints and larger muscles- similar to some of the cbd indica strains.  Worked well with my aches, pains, and nerve issues.  Very functional, focused, non-couchlock experience- took 10 mins to set in fully, lasted 75 mins.  Def recommend to anyone with pain who also enjoys the low head high indicas.

VGood for pain and sleeping, relaxing enough so that you&#39;ll become deep in thought as you fall asleep. Moderate body high that was euphoric enough to notice.\u000a\u000aOne problem with this strain is every time I smoked it before sleeping, I would have very strange seems that would sometimes wake me up.\u000a\u000aOther than that it&#39;s a decent strain for relaxing/pain.
