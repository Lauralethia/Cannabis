VThis is a really good road trip strain. The music is euphoric, probably good for a novice smoker. This would help a notice somewhat test the waters with Indica.

VI enjoyed a nice relaxing high without feeling too much appetite, not too sleepy overall. Very pleasant, able to focus on tasks with ease.

VThis stuff kicks my ass to sleep. It&#39;s crazy. I would definitely recommend this for insomniacs. Such dense, crystal coats nugs. Must be the most crystally weed I have ever seen, come to think of it... gassy, earthy smell... gorgeous bag appeal \u000a\u000aIf you are a seasoned smoker, or a novice who wants to fly to the moon, give Kraken a try! Great for relaxing before bed, about an hour into the buzz of total relaxation your eyes will start to close on themselves... smoke it when you DONT have to go to work the next day cause this stuff knocks you out solid. \u000a\u000aExcellent for body pain as well.  I smoked a big bowl of it once and it was the only time that I felt any anxiety on the strain, cause I was so damn high and couldn&#39;t feel my body anymore. Potent stuff!

VGreat relaxing strain, perfect when you have a lot of stress, headaches and stuff. Very smooth, very slow high, never too much, perfect for board games night or even work in creative projects. One of my favourites.

Vaffects come in quick. a total sense of relaxation, especially behind the eyes and in the head. although a real potent indica i havent felt the urge to sleep, just relax and chill on the couch.

VThis strain will give you the munchies!!! I&#39;m eating way too much right now. I felt a bit paranoid at one point, but quickly died down. I started wanting to expand my knowledge and wanted to know the meaning behind everything. A great strain if you want to be more creative and focus also!

VVery buttery, especially on the aftertaste. Made my legs numb. The body stone, anxiety and stress relief is incredible. Took a pretty tiny dab too so I would likely be passed out if I took a normal sized one.

V3.75/5 \u000aI finally found this strain after I heard a ton of people raving over it. When I got it I was so ready to get ripped off a bowl or two but it didn&#39;t happen. It tastes great, smokes amazing but doesn&#39;t have a very high thc content. \u000aIdk I could have a higher tolerance right now.
