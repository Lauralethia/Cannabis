VWOW.... let me just say don&#39;t let the name turn you off. Picked up an 8th at a whopping 35.5% . The bud is nice, dense and a medium forest green. Then it looks like some bud gnomes came up and sprayed it with silly string and crystals. Truly a great bud not too flashy but you know its solid. The inhale is surprisingly smooth and mild as far as taste. The exhale is pungent kind of like a good IPA beer. It hit my eyes first kind of like wearing a headband. After 5 mins it settled into a nice euphoric social trance played along to the musical genre of progressive pop nougat. Haha out of this world man!

VSo, being a lover of stinky cheeses IRL the thought of a &quot;cheese&quot; strain has had me intrigued since I started smoking for real 2 years ago. Had the chance to pick a gram up today after reading the reviews here and I&#39;m glad I did.\u000a\u000aAlthough the aroma wasn&#39;t super intense at the dispensary, once I got it home and took a good whiff from the container, my goodness! The pine is dominant but the spicy cheese is unmistakeable (and amazing). Nice, perfectly cured, dense forest green nugs interspersed with red and orange calyxes, all dusted with trichs. Smoked from 12&quot; beaker bong... Flavor is similar to scent, mild pine with a hint of the cheese up front. TBH I was a little disappointed, maybe I had built it up too much in my mind, UNTIL I licked my lips, took a deep breath and had a sip of water. Cheese!!!!! Pretty wild.\u000a\u000aHigh is a lil slow to set in...tingly and euphoric head change, followed shortly after by full body tingles, which continue as the head change expands. Pretty happy and hungry right now...also, dry mouth is a real thing with the Cheese. No anxiety or paranoia to speak of, however. Feels like this would be a solid wake and bake, and/or social activity strain.\u000a\u000aAll in all a novel and pleasant med. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll make my regular rotation... but it&#39;s a solid strain and worth a try.

VThis strain has a super strong cheesy smell.  Stuck my nose in the packet and \u201cHoly Moly\u201d it smells like limburger. Not too harsh when taking a hit off the bong either, with a non-descript skunky taste in and out.  It gives a very good body high, but also enough of a head high to watch some complex TV series on SyFy.  My body tried to leg lock me, but my mind wouldn\u2019t let it.  It\u2019s a great early evening smoke.  Good for lots of interesting conversation with like-minded folks.

VThis one certainly lives up to it&#39;s name because of it&#39;s remarkably unique taste and it&#39;s effects primarily because 707 is already a top 5 strain for me.  The flavor is incredibly different.  It tastes like parmesan cheese but it&#39;s not the same.  Like some exotic relative of parmesan.  The taste lingered and then it disappeared, only to reappear as I was snacking on chicken strips some time later.  Pretty cool.  This is a very euphoric and relaxing strain and I&#39;d buy it again without hesitation.

VAlright, let me just start off and say that the batch I got from my dispensary had a high percentage of THC. But then again, Head Cheese always has a high percentage of THC. But what blew me away is that the batch I got had 55mg of MERCYNE, WHAT. The buds I got where super big too. Now, let&#39;s start with the review on this amazing strain. The smell was phenomenal. It had a very pungent, earthy and cheesy smell. To sum it all up, it smelled DANK. So I decide to try this strain out with my gravity bong. Boy did it hit me like a train. It had very Earthy flavors, very &quot;diesel&quot; like too. It was fairly smooth on the exhale as well. Now, the high, damn! I felt like my head was melting like cheese, so was my body. This put my body in a sedative state while my brain felt like air. My favorite hybrid strain. This strain is #1. If you haven&#39;t tried Head Cheese before, then you&#39;re definitely missing out and I definitely 100% recommend you try this strain out for yourself.

VA very complex strain in terms of smell,taste and effect.With that said H.C. is an absolute beauty!A very piney,cheesy,citrus smelling/tasting dense bud frosted yellow and covered in thc.I picked up a quarter oz. in Vegas before i left for my job in Utah for the weekend and wish i had got more.I have never before had such a strong totally dick in the dirt buzz and been so locked in and focused at the same time.To the credit of this particular batch of 27% thc the Myrcene levels are 48! Incredible bud to wake and bake or just whenever.Even though its sativa dominant it will kick your ass so be careful and pick it up if you see it.Im a bud snob and have been smoking for 25 years and have not been a fan of cheeses but this and blueberry cheese are the exception.

VThis one was honestly a disappointment. It was listed at my dispensary as 29.9% THC and had the hefty premium (higher than top shelf) $35 for an 1/8 price tag.\u000a\u000aIt was the strongest sativa listed and I expected more but all I got was the same feeling from smoking &#39;mid&#39;.\u000a\u000aThis strain makes me weary of buying sativas. I guess I&#39;ll have to stick to the &#39;confusing&#39; hybrids or the sleepy indicas.\u000a\u000aOn the plus side, if you&#39;re looking for a &#39;daytime&#39; high where it doesn&#39;t bake you then go for it. Maybe this should be a trainer w33d.

VI really like this strain for post work energy and invigoration. The initial hit washes over your face, or the blood vessels anyways, causing a warming and tingling effect in the cheeks and lips. Pain that was previously existing melts away and fades into the buzzing after about 5-7 minutes, which is very good for me seeing as I skate a mile from Russel and Grand Canyon every day after working 6 hours walking the entire time in a high intensity restaurant environment. This hybrid blocks the pain receptors in my feet and legs while skating, while inhibiting energy and a sense of just having downed a coffee.

VThis one certainly lives up to it&#39;s name because of it&#39;s remarkably unique taste and it&#39;s effects primarily because 707 is already a top 5 strain for me.  The flavor is incredibly different.  It tastes like parmesan cheese but it&#39;s not the same.  Like some exotic relative of parmesan.  The taste lingered and then it disappeared, only to reappear as I was snacking on chicken strips some time later.  Pretty cool.  This is a very euphoric and relaxing strain and I&#39;d buy it again without hesitation.

The taste is similar to the aroma, followed by very quick onset of effects for this medicine. The high has a prominent cerebral effect, mixed with a powerful euphoria and energy that is very uplifting. A flood of relaxation tops of this delicious strain, overall making it a daytime preferred strain, that can work wonders at night for sleep as well.

VDecent uplifting cerebral high, dry eyes.  Not too much hunger or dry mouth.  Made me want to dance to everything - would be great for a night out at the club!  \u000a\u000aWould rate 5 stars, except not a particularly potent high.

VSweet to the nose and a mild cheese undertone beneath it upon further nose-spection. Olive green and covered in itty bitty white crystals with spiky orange hairs. \u000aIn just two bowls I was already feeling completely uplifted  on a rocket ship feeling and ready to go out for an adventure  with friends or do some drawing alone in my room with music solo. I also felt like my sense of humor was brought out of the closet with this strain and I had many giggles too, as cheese is a good strain to laugh on I&#39;m glad this cheese hybrid still has inherited that trait.

VThis one was honestly a disappointment. It was listed at my dispensary as 29.9% THC and had the hefty premium (higher than top shelf) $35 for an 1/8 price tag.\u000a\u000aIt was the strongest sativa listed and I expected more but all I got was the same feeling from smoking &#39;mid&#39;.\u000a\u000aThis strain makes me weary of buying sativas. I guess I&#39;ll have to stick to the &#39;confusing&#39; hybrids or the sleepy indicas.\u000a\u000aOn the plus side, if you&#39;re looking for a &#39;daytime&#39; high where it doesn&#39;t bake you then go for it. Maybe this should be a trainer w33d.

About 45 minutes it always seems to lay me out. let&#39;s not forget about the smell, one of the most pungent strains out there, it&#39;s like a mix of blue cheese dressing with a hint of Pine cone thrown in there. if you want to end your night about 3 or 4 hours sooner This is definitely a knocker!
