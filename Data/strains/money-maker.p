VVery strong indica completely couched us, this was a very euphoric and giggly high, that made us question reality and whether or not we were actually awake or if it was a lucid dream. Not recommended if work or societal interactions are in your near future. Smoke it and watch a movie because that&#39;s all your brain will manage.

VThis will cure your anorexia. ..Just kidding, I&#39;m not a doctor. Or anorexic for that matter. Amazing indica. Full on relaxation except for the slight discomfort brought on by a stomach that just.. can&#39;t.. fit.. any.. more. Good night&#39;s sleep guaranteed as well. First time giving five stars as the batch was exceptionally good quality as well.

VGives great clear-headed hight, no paranoia! very nice all arounder.. Could go for a walk with dog or just stay home meditating or watching movie. This gives you a good vibes and relieves stress, making everything beyond normal. \u000aIt hits relatively slow but knocks you out for about 10 min after and last under an hour.

VTop Indica. It hits you super hard and will lock you to the couch, super stone with this one. Perfect for at home after work chilling on the couch with a movie and plenty of munch. My eyes got super heavy and my mind slowly faded into a daze. Super relaxing and euphoric. I didn&#39;t want to move.\u000a\u000aThe bud smells real good and grinds up nicely. No feelings of paranoia or anxious thoughts. A new favourite for me. \u000a\u000acouch&gt;

VI  picked this strain to help with chronic back pain.  After my first indoor hydro grow it really amazed me with its production.  Really stout colas that will require some support so plan ahead.  This strain has allowed me to cut the amount of pain meds I have to take to 1/3 the dosage I had to use before using cannabis-great results.

VI decided to try this strain for pain relief.  I started 5 plants in my closet hydro setup and they just thrived.  I ended up making some clones for a friend but she couldn&#39;t safely plant them-one is now over 9&#39; tall and has HUGE colas.  Excellent choice for pain and helps me relax.
