VAfter signing up for an account, I came to review Ambrosia because it is my favorite strain over the past 50-100 I&#39;ve tried.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s my #1. I don&#39;t have any now, nor for a few months, so I don&#39;t remember the exact qualities, but an overall beautiful taste and excellent sativa high with comfortable body buzz comes to mind. Also, it kept me going at night without every making me tired, every joint another 30 mins of work, that&#39;s my favorite type... creativity in a spliff.

VLiked this one a lot, found it quite woodsy and sticky. Smoked a couple times with great results, a pretty intense high, lasts a long time. Made me very energetic and happy, couldn&#39;t wipe the smile off my face, then slowly trails off into a lovely hazy state. However, I would be careful if you are prone to anxiety freak-outs, I smoked a LOT of this one night and had a bad time. That is my fault though, this is a wonderful trippy strain and it made me laugh quite a lot! Enjoy it

VA great strain to vape if you want to have a staring contest with your cat. Seriously; you think you know your cat pretty well, but if you really lock eyes with the creature and allow the mind-meld to sluice on through, you realize you don&#39;t know shit about what&#39;s going on in that furry little feline head, and you fully grok that all this time you&#39;ve been sharing your house with a little four footed alien. \u000a\u000aOh and this strain also gives some serious cottonmouth, so make sure to have some cold fizzy water on hand.

Is my &quot;go to&quot; outside of the straight indicas that I prefer.\u000a\u000aCLARIFICATION - My review is for the Ambrosia offered by JAHnetics in the SF Bay Area.  It is a cross between Super Lemon Haze and Blueberry Yum Yums. Only realized this difference after more strain details were posted here.

VDefinitely one of my favourite strains. Citrus smell, and faint citrus, strong earthy, piny taste.\u000aThe First few puffs are quite rough, but the end of the roach tastes delicious. Almost instant high, moderate appetite. High lasts for about 45 minutes, then a peace of mind for 15-20, finishing off without a low. About 1-1.5 hours after smoking, you&#39;re back to sober like a Sasquatch. Great for public, almost no anxiety, no visual effects/changes to face.
