VJust smoked Godfather OG for the first time on my new vaporizer. Only smoked about a pea sized bud and I&#39;m really medicated right now. Reminds me of the high Grandaddy Purps gives but this is stronger and a little more euphoric. The gram I bought is 23% thc, which is strong to me. The bud smelled really nice. And was very dank smelling. It smelled sweet and a tad spicy. Smelled pretty grapey to me. I feel pretty sedated but pretty focused at the same time. I&#39;m having no problem writing this at the moment. Very nice and chill head high with a slight lazy body buzz. Eyes feel heavy. I think when smoking the right amount this will be a very good insomnia strain. I also feel very calm and at peace. Very comfortable is how I would describe how this strain will make you feel. Colors seem to be popping and light is brighter. Very nice indica night time strain. I rate this a solid 4.5 for now.

VIve been a steady smoker for over a year. Taking big hits. All that good stuff. Recently had 2 panic attacks in a row going from Tahoe - Blue Dream.\u000aAt first i thought it was because i was on medication. Second time it happened and i wasnt on anything. Third panic attack i was under no influence. I tried CBD products and little amounts of THC here and there. But i had chest pains and weird feelings. Basically everything was in my head (i went to the doctors both times and i was perfectly fine)\u000aOverall. I started working on my doses and when i came across this one. Ive taken higher hits than any other strain. with Godfather OG it gave me a very good head high which i prefer but it doesnt get my mind fixed on another attack. Its an uplifting feeling in my experience so far. Couch locked just enough. But for my situation i think i found the strain to build my confidence in smoking again  and get my head out of the panic mode.

No wonder why it won the Best Indica in a recent Cannabis Cup !\u000a\u000aThis indica blend of OO XXX x Alpha OG which retains its Kushiness., and has a superior wine grape. taste to it very akin to an Old Vine Zinfandel grapes \u000a\u000aThis is one of the longest lasting indica stains I have ever had in my 47 years of Medical Cannabis use !!!\u000a\u000aI highly recommend it to anyone interested in OG mixed strains !!!
