VI have Chronic Fatigue, and this is the most energizing strain I have ever had. After just a few hits, I feel much better and suddenly have the motivation to do things! This strain smells AMAZING, and it is energizing without making you foggy-headed.\u000a\u000aA great strain for wake n baking, because you\u2019ll have a productive start to the day. Also fantastic for afternoon smoking and creative endeavors.\u000a\u000aI am a sativa lover and this is my new favorite sativa.

Vsmoked a high CBD 1g pre-roll from Flow Kana. very light psychoactive effects but it&#39;s doing wonders in the pain relief department. feels like a body massage and a cuppa chamomile, not a &quot;stoney&quot; strain.

VIf I do anything more than a small buzz from this strain, I push myself without thinking and I talk so much that after the high wears off, my nausea, pain, fatigue, and headaches come back, and they can even be seen if you smoke an entire bowl of this (which is relative to every person, obviously). It will dry you out, it will give you headaches and you will feel nauseated if you walk around too much. However, this is only my experience. It tastes amazing in a dab, and I felt amazing when I did two kief dabs of In The Pines with a friend. It keeps you focused and your surroundings become in tune with all your senses. It gives you a heightened state of mind with an, unfortunately, very easy line to cross that could make your time not as enjoyable when just smoking flower. But I do suggest trying small doses and waiting for highs to kick in. Your sense of touch and sight get extremely heightened; but for me, that makes it easier to hallucinate due to my psychosis.

VThe name of this strain had me awaiting a conifer tree fresh spruce or pine smell.  Totally different pine!!  The kind with an apple on the end of it so instead of wintery I changed my tune to tropical.  Easy mistake having enjoyed another sativa dominant strain called &quot;Pine Drop&quot; just the day before it was an easy mix up. \u000a\u000aThe slightly fruity notes were faint &amp; meshed into the predominant  flavor which reminded me of dried grass or hay very nicely,  Although not the exact same flavor there was a strong reminder of Hefeweizen with a lemon.  Sweet tart fruit vaguely skimming the surface of a smooth grain.  \u000a\u000aThis strain threw a second curve ball when expecting a sativa head buzz.  It was not that way for me at all though and I suspect the CBD content had something to do with that.  Did not notice that this flower had a decent amount of CBD so was pleasantly suprised.  \u000a\u000aThe buzz was mellow and with no real expectations or plans it was nice to ride this high out.  Was a little on the spacier side with lots of great ideas coming my way as I strolled home.  Full of thoughts galore with a huge epiphany coming to a crescendo at my front door.  A 2 hour walk In The Pines and wouldn&#39;t ya&#39;ll know the next morning when out of the pines couldn&#39;t remember any of it =)

A great happy feeling at first, then comes laser sharp focus for 10 minuets, then comes a bit of dizziness, then comes muscle relaxation that makes you want to do nothing.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s an OK strain..I wouldn&#39;t use it for any serious activity beyond laundry.

I have tried lots of strains of all 3 types n this is my all time favorite especially for morning n dat use. My paralyzed stomach pain n symptoms disappear after 2 -3 puffs .

VIf you have add/adhd this is the strain for you. Super focused and clear headed  high that is very sativa. It also is a great strain for treating pain without any sedation. Also good for mild depression.This strain is a 1 to 1 meaning that it has an almost equal amount of cbd to thc rratio. This gives you a very mild psychoactive high. I would recommend this weed for anytime you want to feel high, but without much of the usual inebriation that weed can bring. 10/10 strain!

VExcellent strain for chronic pain. It also gives a nice touch of energy wrapped in a blanket of focus and readiness. It&#39;s pretty calm on the mental side, but you can definitely tell it&#39;s there. Great for an early afternoon started on a Saturday with things to do, but relaxation after. I would suggest the strain leaves you with a feeling of excitement. Glad I got an ounce of this particular strain, that&#39;s for sure.
