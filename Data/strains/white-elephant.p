VHuge dense nugs, with light powder coating. a light fragrance. first time I smoked it, within five minutes I felt the high creep up and wrap me up in a euphoric blanket. Forgot about everything I needed to do. Never fails to put me right to sleep if I let it. only down side I get chronic dry mouth. sometimes 5 cups of water still won&#39;t do. all in all I recommend for those under stress or deep depression.

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings -- Brand: 420 Natural USA\u000aStrain: White Elephant\u000aBalanced Hybrid--\u000aPotency Analysis: TTL 21.8% THC 17.53% CBD 0.142%--Cost: $15/gram\u000a--The smell on this is a complex bouquet.  There&#39;s a sweetness and a woody piney texture to it.  The afterscent is very floral and a slight muted citrus.  This pot comes apart great, and the citrus and floral both got quite a bit more expansive.\u000a--\u000aFrom the first kiss of flame, there&#39;s a great sweetness.  The inhale is very mellow.  Throughout the smoke is a woodiness that&#39;s just really pleasant - Mrs. Ent says it&#39;s specifically a pine taste to her.  The rest of it is sweetness and on the exhale a bit of the floral bouquet comes through and the mellow continues.  Even after an exceptionally, absurdly large puff it was still very mellow.\u000a--\u000aThe high on this is exceptionally balanced.  It&#39;s uplifting and kind around the eyes.  Lots of great mental clarity here, and it definitely holds through on the headache-relief, as attested to by Mrs. Ent.  She absolutely loves the effect on this, because it&#39;s balanced and the body effect is restful but not sleepy.  \u000a--\u000aWhite Elephant is a great all around smoke.  When you think of the smell, the texture, the flavor, the effects both mental and body, this is true Stoner Weed.

VI grabbed this strain the other day along with some Crack Extreme and I have to say, I liked this strain alot better. It is for sure a creeper so give it some time to kick in. I rolled a nice joint of it and put it out half way through. Thinking I wasn&#39;t that high yet (I have been smoking quick hitting strains like GSC lately) I naturally got a little dissapointed.. Boy was I ever wrong! 15 mins into it I get hit with a slight head high then slammed by Ric Flair with an intense body high. It was perfect! Slight euphoria along side it. Only downside is the taste. It smells really pungent which is great but it tastes sort of chemicaly. Not really a fan of the taste but the body high is so worth it. I&#39;ve only really gotten such body high results from eddibles/certain strains before this. Grade A strain for me.

VIt&#39;s a great mellow high that got me talking, laughing and thinking a lot. Got a bit couchlocked but was still able to do chores. Got a bit thirsty but no munchies. One of my favorites for sure.
