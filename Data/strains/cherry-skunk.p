VGreat cherry flavor with that skunky taste. It hits you almost instantly, kinda like a Trainwreck. Definitely more of a Sativa, I don&#39;t really get much productive done, but I focus intently on little tasks (like Leafly reviews and my mac and cheese perfection). I like this strain a lot, I&#39;ve had 3 or 4 people tell me now it&#39;s pretty bomb.

VGives energy and an uplifting high.  Good for mood, moderate pain relief and focus.  The high isn&#39;t overpowering, so Cherry Skunk is a good choice for daytime medicine.  Smokes nice and smooth.  Even though this is an indica-dominant hybrid, the high is more cerebral than body.

VI use this one at night to sleep. At first, it&#39;s a cerebral rush that&#39;s overall very pleasant and drifty, as well as almost instant pain and anxiety relief that just keeps getting better as the mibutes go by, without my being aware of it. (Time I mean. I can&#39;t decide if time speeds up or slows down for me.) This effect takes less than 5 minutes to kick in. Within 20 minutes I&#39;m too stoned to have any sort of useful conversation, but I&#39;m at the beginning of my journey and have almost zero tolerance. By the 20 min. mark, I&#39;m completely relaxed, mellow, and ready to sleep. There are days where I have to take 2 hits rather than 1, but I&#39;m also an insomniac. Once I&#39;m out, I get a solid 5 hours of sleep before I have to decide if I need a second hit or not.
