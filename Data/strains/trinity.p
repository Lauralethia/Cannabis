VWow. I went to make a cup of coffee and it took me 3 or 4 trips to the kitchen as I kept forgetting about it. I was really into what I was researching and just kept forgetting.  I wanted to go out but decided it would be in my best interest not to drive for a while. I am impressed with the depth and length of the high. I don&#39;t want to call it a stone, but I sure enjoy it.

VTrinity is an old school clone only variety that gained traction in Eugene OR. Named after the county were the original bag seed was scored, also known as TC. Surprisingly there is little to zero Sativa in this very squat wide leafed Indica variety. Once lost to generational cloning new stock has emerged from potentially tissue cultured stock. Seed breeders Hermetic Genetics are bringing back-crossed varietals to market late this season. Trinity has a heavy Kush-Skunk like flavor that leaves hints of soil and forest humus on the palate. Grown properly she produces THC percentages in the high 20&#39;s with 29% not being uncommon.\u000a

VOne of the finest strains I have tried. Big, dense buds. Awesome piney notes from the vaporizer. The buzz is uplifting yet relaxed, and definitely a creeper as other reviewers have said.

VI&#39;m smoking on the Trinity Lavender sub-strain and I have to say it&#39;s one of the best smokes i&#39;ve had in a while! Trinity offers a solid focused and almost psychedelic experience and lavender pulls it into a solid hybrid space that&#39;s not at all sleepy or couch glue. It feels more like getting out of a sauna, a mellow fresh and relaxed feeling all over your body. This strain stands out to me for good day time use, hiking, cleaning, even work since it&#39;s so mild as a psychoactive yet still heady.

VIn the name of the Father, The Son, and the Holy Ghost, I think I met the new sativa of my dreams!  Tonite I picked up a Select Strains cartridge (my favorite brand) of Trinity, which tested at 76.90% THC 1.04% CBD . It tastes like NOTHING I&#39;ve had before, like plum sake. In fact since I&#39;m taking tomorrow off to be in my pool in the 90+ degree weather I&#39;m going to go to the Asian grocery store 2 blocks from me to pick up some plum sake to go with Trinity tomorrow!\u000a\u000aThis is the PERFECT strain for artists and creativity! While I was out in my pool I was seeing in 3D magnified, and the colors of the leaves really popped out and I felt so in tune with Nature. I like this so much I may go back tomorrow and buy another one so that I will be sure and have this for awhile, holy fuck this is good.\u000a\u000aIf you want a cerebral high that takes you on a different intellectual and creative plane, this is it. It tastes great and unique, and its high is unforgettable.

VI picked up an 1/8 of Trinity at a dispensary in Denver for the first time today. Smoked about a gram to myself and was pretty impressed. This is a very relaxing strain, and gives you a &quot;zoned out&quot; feeling afterwards. I am a heavy smoker so I would definitely recommended this strain to anyone, regardless of tolerance.

VA very lovely smelling strain, you will think skunk all the way, but the high is a really calming, stress &amp; anxiety reliever, but didn&#39;t make me curl up on the couch for a few hours.  I actually went out and put up the xmas lights and then headed to work, so a pretty damn good strain.  The only flaw I have with it, is the taste, not bad, but nothing like the smell would indicate.  It is a bit peppery and hashy in flavor.

VI smoked this strain almost exclusively for over 10 years when I lived in the Midwest. In college, I was in a community of connoisseurs so I tried many strains while I was exploring which ones I liked best. Once I came across Trinity, I knew I had found my #1 bud! As a musician and audio engineer, I liked this strain for its more cerebral than body buzz and I could stay focused throughout but still feel relaxed. I would partake in some others from time to time to change it up but this was my favorite bud for many years. It&#39;s not so easy to find where I&#39;m at now but I&#39;m still looking!

VMeh...\u000aOnly 2 noticeable effects. Uplifted and happy. No noticeable negative effects. Smells like lemons, wood, and a hint of soil. Taste is aroma. Look is tight dense dull green and beige semi frosty nugs. Dark red thin numerous hairs. This review reflects trinity, not much going on.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend for beginners, or the first toke of a wake and bake session.

Effects last bout 3 hours which I have found is typical amoung most strains I&#39;ve tried since getting my card in 9/2013. Highly recommend this strain &amp; this dispernsary.

VI&#39;m in LOVE! This strain is simply INCREDIBLE... I love the euphoric head rush I get after smoking some. It&#39;s a great &quot;get up and go&quot; strain; perfect for mornings. The most appealing thing about this strain for me however is that despite giving me a very strong, energizing, arousing Sativa effect; I don&#39;t get any Anxiety or Paranoia! That&#39;s a MUST FOR ME; as I have an anxiety disorder which some strong Sativa strains worsen. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this but; I think Trinity just ousted Super Silver Haze as my favorite Sativa. A MUST TRY!

VI had to reload on sativa and I wanted to try something new, the budtender told me this was a great daytime strain and the THC level was where I wanted to be. When he showed me the jar it was the end of the run and it was just small shotgun sized nugs. According to him this was how it grew out and YES sometimes weed does grow like this.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say it was dry as a bone but has some frost on the flower looking at it through the scope. Did a bong hit  and it hits hard and fast! The exhale is spicy, peppery a bit. As for flavor there really isn&#39;t much, this is not one of those fruity sativas you read about on here.\u000a\u000aAs for the high it does not send me into space land but more so &quot; hey, let&#39;s do something here&quot; productive! remember it hit&#39;s fast and hard so a 5 minute sit down for it to settle in might be needed. I just wish the flower was nicer looking

A slight tightness in the head a lil past the eyes but I&#39;m no Sativa novice. \u000aSlightly more talkative.  \u000aUplifted might watch some t.v or listen to some music before work. I think the relaxed effect may outdo the energizing effect for me which is kinda why I chose it but no big deal I got some Green Crack that will give me that get up and go.

VThis is a great energizing and uplifting sativa strain. Great for the morning however may induce some anxiety; so take it slow and easy, especially with concentrates.

Vmy favorite strain by far. found it on accident. it was very euphoric with still having a focus mind. I would recommend  this to anyone that wants to be amazed how well balanced the high is.

VThe Bake Shop was providing this strain for 10 bucks a gram or 15 for 2 grams. It&#39;s a good deal. It tastes a little rough but it&#39;s a solid day time/productive weed.

VDid not @ all enjoy the experience. Which was a bummer cuz I always enjoy the meds from this dispensary. Did not @ all help with my migraine; actually made it worse. Helped with nausea. Obviously still stressed cuz I was still in pain. Head high nice but not too strong. Nice, clean piney vape. Will not be getting this strain again. :-(

VCompletely ignore the first review I wrote, I CLEARLY confused this with Harlequin.  Trinity was a big disappointment.  Nothing distinguishing or special about this strain at all.  Will NEVER buy again.
