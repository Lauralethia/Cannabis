VLooks: Nice leafy nuggets with lots of short little hairs, very green and perhaps it was cropped to soon.\u000a\u000aSmell: Rich earthy soil mixed with laundry detergent. Very floral scented witha touch of balck licorice and grape Fanta.\u000a\u000aTaste: pretty easy inhale with a semi harsh exhale. Light taste of a boquet of fresh cut sping flowers. \u000a\u000aOverall: Instant body high with a creeper to the head. I felt tingly and focused with just two hits. I later became intorspective and alert while haveing a scalp massage.

VI like this strain when my girlfriend starts harping on me for smoking too often.  It gets me in a quiet and relaxed state where I still act mostly myself.  This one does blank out your short term memory during its peak so don&#39;t plan on doing anything that requires any amount of focus.   It also makes it easier to not worry about hitting the snooze button a few extra times the next morning, so not recommend if you have important meetings the next day.

VI love grape crush. When its completely cured it smells like a grape now&amp;later candy. Its siper easy to trim and sell. In fact, once you get someone to try/buy it that&#39;s all they want! I had an incredible Lavender Queen seed and it turned out PHENOMINAL mix half grape crush in a joint and WOW what a goofy happy high. Staight stupid stoned. Like the first time you ever smoked. If its hard for you to get high grape crush is the best. A huge bud will have one short stem its all bud.

VHeavy hitting indica. This strain is a bit of a creeper. But she sets in pretty hard. The high was long lasting and sleepy. Excellent for pain relief. I definitely felt the heaviness behind the eyes and across the forehead. As for the flowers, they were actually kind of fluffy for an indica. But sticky as hell. They were dark green with touches of amber and purple. The aroma was mildly earthy and sweet. The taste is sweet with a bit of hashiness. Not recommended for a daytime smoke.

The flowers were absolutely beautiful dominated with purple and rust colored leafage. Great for pain reduction and left an overall sense of well being. I prefer sativa over indica strains generally and it was hybrid .60 indica and .40 sativa. This hybrid is definitely going to reside in the medicine chest.

VI thought that this was an amazing and very creative strain. It had few side effects and didn&#39;t make me want to go to sleep but have fun instead while staying calm. This is a strong strain at the same time and I wouldn&#39;t recommend for beginner smokers, it effected me pretty strongly so I can only imagine

VI&#39;ve smoked this a few times and I&#39;m not too impressed. It does help with the pain, and it makes me sleepy, but it also makes my mind race and gives me a little bit of anxiety so even though I&#39;m tired, I stay awake. Taste is nice (tastes like grapes), just wish this were a better strain overall.

VHonestly.. it&#39;s alright. If I could I&#39;d give it 3 1/2 not 4. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with it it&#39;s just not my style. It takes a while to kick in, and in my case it was quite a subtle high. This is most likely because I didn&#39;t smoke too much of it. This is a good strain for just.. doing things normally, but still getting a little high.

VTraditionally a heavyweight motivation krushing, kouch locking, munchies inducing Indica, this Grape Krusher fell flat on its face. Cultivated by innovators over at Pruf Cultivar in Portland, Or, procured at the wet dream dispensary of modernist consumers worldwide, Serra. The bag appeal was exemplary with a flavor profile of the most elegant prison toilet wine. Combining a corpulent mouthfeel, a mild aftertaste of used Hubba Bubba, this Grape Krusher failed to impress.

V3rd worst strain I&#39;ve tried in Colorado. I&#39;ve tried over 125 strains. Bottom 5%. It&#39;s an OUTDOOR Indica with only 14% THC (with is acceptable in many other strains) however Grape Krush is AWFUL on the throat. VERY Harsh inhale and exhale. If you know my reviews you know I do not discourage any strain if the patient cannot find any other strain. Assuming this is all you have access to and you need some relief, then go ahead, be my guest. Although an Indica it will NOT let you sleep immediately afterwards, nor is the head high a pleasant one. The high is a little frustrating, zero head scalping yet slight nervousness and dry throat. I&#39;d call it regs, but there are no seeds and it doesn&#39;t smell like brick weed. It&#39;s dry and in the Indica &quot;grass&quot; family. This will NOT impress anyone. I personally will never buy again. However if you are like me and sometimes want a lower THC strain, I&#39;ll recommend plenty that are 15% or under yet they will taste better and you&#39;ll feel better, strains like Blue Dream (there I said it) or Luca Brasa x Sour Diesel (also from LivWell). I LOVE LivWell and this is the ONLY strain from them that I&#39;ll never buy again. I ended up buying papers and rolled a bunch of joints for homeless people...1st guy I gave one to, was SO excited, he smelled it and say &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot; he lit it and hit it and threw it on the highway and said &quot;What the Fuck dude&quot; so.... Save your money. The homegrown we smoked in &#39;97 in Appalachia was WAY better than this. I don&#39;t buy the &quot;Oregon Blueberry&quot; parentage. And don&#39;t you buy it, stay away, I&#39;m 100% that LivWell will discontinue growing it. It&#39;s a live and learn thing. But I&#39;m not knocking them, happy with everything else I&#39;ve tried there. Not sure where the love for GK comes from in these other reviews. Best use is in tricking someone into hitting it. \u000a1.5 Stars
