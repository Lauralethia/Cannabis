Vi got an oz of Maui yesterday, first thing you notice is the amazing smell that truly reminds you of a tropical island. sweet and sour sharp pungent fruityness, but after breaking the nugs up, a sharp biting diesel smell comes out(reminds me of Chemdawg or Hogsbreath). The combo of pungent tropical fruit and deathly weed B.O is really unique and awsome. The tastes mirrors the smell,starting fruity and finishing with the diesel. The flowers were bright green with either pink or fire red hairs and lots of trichs, denser than i would have guessed. The high takes a minute to kick in, alot of people would write it off as weak too quickly. but after 5mins or so it becomes very head heavy, your body gets tingly but no weight at all to the high,which is great for daytime. no fear of couchlock no matter how much you smoke,but in high doses brain fog kicks in and its hard to focus. diddnt have trouble sleeping after smokin it all night and never felt jittery. one of the best daytime strains ive ever smoked, super functional and enjoyable, and the flavor profile is one of my favs now.

I smoked it all weekend and went all over my small town seeking adventures during the day, and going to kickbacks at night. make me extremely talkative and social. this strain is great for partying and hanging around with friends. not a good strain for sleep or body pain, but I have chronic migraines and usually any bud I smoke helps ease my migraines, and Maui is no exception.

V-BLACK BELT BUD- This may not be Maui-Waui, but it&#39;s more than halfway there, fer sure. This sativa has a nice light, but dank, plant-like earthy flavor that is just terrific. this is definitely a nice &#39;clear-head&#39; smoke, meaning I can do what I need to do without worrying about the pain OR being &#39;out of it&#39;.

VI recommend this for those who have a medium to heavy tolerance. One of the Maui strains are some very rare lineage if you can obtain some of this strain. Small buds very leafy and green, loose not compact buds almost looks like a hermaphrodite bud. I call strains like this legendary because its simple, its not touched by man but mother nature alone, thats incredible; because mother nature gave us everything and more. Its a &quot;creeper&quot; for the effect, so take a time out here and there, its easy to become over medicated.  The only reason why this is not five stars, it&#39;s the effect its over powering, great for lowering my tolerance if needed, but when I haven&#39;t eaten and my moods/emotions are out of control I can&#39;t take a strain like this only for mild to medium cases. See my other reviews for higher medication purposes. flowery musky very diesel like.

VI got the Indica version. I thought the guy didn&#39;t know what he was talking about at first but there is one. Calm, very relaxing high. I feel fine doing nothing type of mood. Didnt seem like the strongest strand but I&#39;m not much of an indica guy

VThought this sativa would be bright and heady, but instead it kept me at a steady, semi-high not unlike just waking up in the morning.  You know, when you&#39;re rested but not doing anything yet.  The scent is strong and pleasant and tastes fresh going in, but upon exhalation had a definite chemical taste/scent.  One friend compared it to roach spray.  Coupled with the lack of definitive sensation/result, it&#39;s not a strain I&#39;ll try again.

VI love this strain.  Probably because its not too over powerful so I like to smoke when I need to relax, or get all the crazy things spinning in my head.  Basically I got this strain with my last few dollars, and even got the scraps! I can imagine when I go back to Canna RX to get more.\u000a\u000aThe next day after i got it from Canna RX, my neighbor told me someone smashed my whole window in.  I saw it, ran inside and threw up. THIS is when I first tried Maui. \u000a\u000aThank you Canna RX for giving me the scraps for a great price because you knew I really have no money for another 9 days.\u000a\u000aSo...usually EVERYTIME I smoke a strain, it somehow always changes for me. I don&#39;t know why. But this strain of (scraps!), makes me get the belly laughs. After seeing my car and getting sick, then smoke a bowl of Maui....OMG!  I said out loud to myself &quot;THANK YOU MAUI &amp; CannaRX!!! I was laughing for a while.  Everything seemed to entertain me..everything!\u000a\u000aI think I&#39;ve said enough. If you just need to forget a little and get out of anger or depression, Maui is my answer now.

VGot the Maui/Cheese hybrid at PARC in Phoenix, they tell you should only be used at night.  LOL probably because the only feeling you&#39;ll get from it is a feeling of tiredness and that&#39;s about it with a headache for good measure.  Would steer clear of this combo unless you have extra money to give away to dispensaries. THC was supposed to be like 20+% THC, NOT even close, maybe 2%.
