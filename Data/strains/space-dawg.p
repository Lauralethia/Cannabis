VThis is some forreal bomb ars indica! I was contemplating purchasing this strain just because of the name, but good googooly moogooly this strain is Juiceeeeee, ha ha. On a serious note, I suffer from neck pain and left shoulder pain from a bad muscle strain playing Pool, within the first  minutes of smoking a firmly tightened joint, I immediately feel the tension lifting up and I&#39;m able to type reviews like such! A great strain for pain and Relaxation. Thank you for your time -Naetoven

VSpace dawg is the perfect chill weed. It relaxes both your body and mind. \u000aThis weed offers great meditative purposes as well, the kind where you just relax and think about really deep shit.

VBest indica dominant strain I\u2019ve had.  Vaporized in a Flowermate v5.0s.  Produced far more vapor than other strains I have had.  I was able to revape a few times on a single fill of my Flowermate.\u000a\u000aFlavor best described as sweet fresh cut grass, I do not mean this in a negative way, the flavor is by no means unpleasant.

VThis is probably the most aptly named strain I have come across. I vaped about 1/4 gram and proceeded to stare at my aquarium for about 10 mins before I realized I was even doing it. It&#39;s not spacey in a heavy stoned way but more in a clean soft way that just let&#39;s your mind wander. A lot of strains that have this kind of mind wandering effect make me a little anxious and stressed ( running all the things I need to do over in my head until it stresses me out ). This strain definitely does not do this to me, it&#39;s very mellow and pleasant. I could see how this strain might not be a good choice if you need to drive anywhere but I still feel pretty functional.

VSpace Dawg is great for chilling out and listening to music or playing video games. A potent indica with a piney, fruity aroma, Space Dawg&#39;s powerful body high melted my anxiety and depression. Not my go-to for sleep (Yoda OG wins out in that category), I prefer the Dawg for its euphoric and relaxing effects. Definitely a unique strain with diverse range of ancestors, you should definitely try this one before you knock it.
