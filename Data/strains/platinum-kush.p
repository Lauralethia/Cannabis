VFor Recreational:\u000a\u000aThis silky silver dream is a good one. Ladies and gentleman strap your seat belts, it&#39;s going to be a great ride. This one of a kind bud features a tingly numbing sensation throughout your body, at first more prominent in the lips. I smoked this with a joint, rolled by yours truly. It is a very pungent smell, while smoking you inhale lots of sweet/earthy aromas that are none too harsh. I love all bud flavors. This one is definitely not as harsh as some other strains. After a couple hits, the sweet aroma starts to poor and it makes it very easy to finish off the joint. Flavor 10/10\u000aIt is a great high, giggly and you will experience a feel good mood.\u000a\u000aMedicinal: This particular strain has a good amount of CBD. Great for bodily aches and pains. \u000aDepression: if you are in a episode of depression, this bud will definitely lift your spirits. Please note, that some strains may worsen or not even improve your mood. However for MDD, I highly recommend this strain as it works well for me. Personally. \u000a\u000aOverall:\u000a\u000aGreat flavor, great effects, it is definitely worth a try. &#128522;\u000a

VThis strain is amazing for anxiety, it calms and stabilizes you. But for fucks sake, yum! Smells good, tastes so exquisite, and feels blissful. I struggle with debilitating anxiety, and I can&#39;t thank this strain enough for helping me through it.\u000a\u000aDescription:\u000a\u000aLooks - Good green, orange hairs, shiny with an excess of trichromes, solid, and beautiful.\u000a\u000aSmell - Like the sun, if the sun was a flower, and that flower smelled like weed.\u000a\u000aTaste - Juicy, warm, and delicious\u000a\u000aEffects - Thoughtful, and calm. I perceive more than I thought possible on this, but be prepared to not come close to articulating said thoughts. You can concentrate, but you&#39;re going to be to lazy to do so.\u000a\u000aBuzz - Long... You forget you&#39;re still buzzed\u000a\u000aTravel - Smooth and sharp incline, a little slow. Peak: could be longer. But it more than makes up for the short peak with the lengthy and smooth decline. Long timespan.

VAn amazing clear-headed stress-relief buzz!  Minimal psychoactive effects, maximum relaxation and focus.  You could *almost* go to work and be quick-witted while on this indica strain.\u000a\u000aSlight bit of creeper effect when vaped in a DaVince Ascent at 360F; effects became noticeable after about 5-10 mins.  \u000a\u000aNo paranoia, no increase in heart rate, very relaxed and calming effect.\u000a\u000aDefinitely recommended for medicinal use, and for vape users who are looking to be highly functional and clear-headed while still feeling the warmth of a 420 glow!\u000a\u000aNote: my eyes did get quite red on this indica, so use Visine or some other vasoconstrictor if you plan to be around non-420 people.

VI always get this strain when it comes around because it gets you that strong almost bubba kushy indica high but though you&#39;re just as stoned from the bubba(a lot of ppl&#39;s fave)you retain a clear-headedness n a completely lucid thought process plus it gives me motivation without any uncomfortable speediness anxiety or heart racing)im bi-polar with PTSD m debilitating anxiet with no Appetite n strains such as cherry pie n gdaddy purp do it to me [heart racing feel paranoid less relaxed than before smoking ]if that helps anyone comprehend better)with a clear high I don&#39;t get locked on the couch with the clarity of thought of a pure sativa &quot;great work weed&quot; I would call it, whereas strong indicas (especially kushes n sour diesel) make me wanna eat a lot then call into work cuz I get into &quot;just don&#39;t rly feel like doing shit&quot; mode whereas some platinum kush will get you eating n actually psyched to go to a shitty job without the uncomfortability that comes with some energetic strains..this ones in my top ten which also contains crazy as balls strains like sfv og , super lemon haze (lemonSKUNKxsupersilverhaze), grand queen purple, blackberry n blackberry kush and blue dream, haze (sometimes I like classics) and super sour d (super silver hazexsour diesel (yet I can&#39;t even move off the last strain the super sour is the definition of couch lock to the extreme And grand queen purple, (nothing like granddaddy Purp- I think any quality of that strain is just inferior)if you can believe it, I smoke a lot of shatter n the feeling you smoke too much n too quick is actually very uncomfortable because you get so stoned (with the grand queen purple)n seem to never stop coming up(I&#39;m a heavy 14 year smoker n the grand queen purple blows my mind every time...found its hard to find but grab all of it if you see it...my point is even with groundbreaking new strains (platinum kush being around for many years now) this stands with the best..how I end up being lucky enough to get strains like that when it&#39;s still illegal completely in NY n I pay for GQP n super lemon haze $125 a half, I know all you dispensary users can&#39;t even believe that but I&#39;d die before I payed $65 an eighth of any strain..I would feel robbed..yes legality in NY and on Long Island is not needed we enjoy our medicinal weed for great prices..at least I vote that all you keep sending it to NY we love you for it n r not getting robbed by an almost (n sometimes more) doubly expensive same product...God bless all my fellow potheads n medicine users (I&#39;m both myself) that bring it here with the wax n thank god for such talented( &quot;grow artists&quot;) risking their livelihood cuz without the amazingly gifted growers this medicine would not be around n not close as potent n therefore future patients in the states that don&#39;t have say God (or whoever) Ty for these great ppl that provide me with very medicine I need to function, Nobody, n that includes me) should have to take lots of anti anxiety medicine n go through life in a drugged haze.this medicinal Mary Jane helps me get through every day with less anxiety, less stress, I can eat n sleep n don&#39;t have to live on benzodiazepines cuz of great greenery..more ppl should thank the amazing growers n amazing PPP that take risks with the law everyday to help us so much...we all thank you n yea don&#39;t pass up the platinum or any of my top ten if they are around oh n alien og is top five...

VI was scared to smoke this because I generally fall right to sleep when i smoke a kush.....boy was I wrong! Not only did this weed not put me to sleep, but it didn&#39;t give me insane munchies (I&#39;m a girl, I like my body) and all I wanted to do was shoot the shit with my friends who were with me. I will say though, we didn&#39;t really move from the couch for a few hours and just watched bad TV. This stuff is beautiful to look at and has a wonderful taste (which I&#39;m not used to considering i&#39;m generally a sativa girl). For all of those who are looking for something down-y but not TOO down-y, this is perfect for you!

VDefinitely a great strain for some, however it&#39;s not one of my favorites. The high sneaks up on you after about 10 to 15 minutes. It&#39;s not that strong of a high. It&#39;s great if you&#39;re about to go out to a party or if you have a speech. The only issue I have with this strain is that it&#39;s not quite as strong as I would like and it makes your eyes a little bit drier than average (keep that eyedrops around)

VI do love Indica, and Platinum Kush is a good one. Made me very tired, and very unproductive. I would get flashes of inspiration to do a certain thing... but that feeling would be gone in a heart beat, and I would be back to sitting around, doing nothing. Just zoned off. Depending on what you do for work, you may or may NOT want to wake n bake. You&#39;ll be dragging yourself all day.

VWhen I think of what &quot;Stereotypically&quot; a Indica is suppose to be like. BOOM!!! Platinum Kush, is exactly that. Just plain ol&#39; make you sit your a** down and relaaaax. And not a sleepy relax, though you can get some amazing sleep with this strain. But no, I&#39;m talking that after a nice massage relaxed. Sure you could take a nap, but nah you want to feel how loose and good your body is. Nice smooth not to harsh smoke. Coupled with these dense frosty buds with bright dark orange hairs, and even a little purple peeking it&#39;s head through on the tips of the bud. Makes this an amazing strain, that I say everyone should try.

VI REALLY love this! One hit from a pea-sized piece of my flower brought on a subtle mind and body buzz. The racing thoughts, worries, stress and pain melted away at the 10 minute mark. I was very talkative and quite uplifted at that microdose. This is one incredible flower! An anxiety/depression and chronic pain sufferer for many years, this brought relief almost instantaneously. For all you anxious people out there, I think Platinum Kush will provide you a much needed state of respite. I was in a deep depression that is cyclical. Before taking a dose I was very anxious and deeply depressed. Afterward, I was interested in EVERYTHING. I was picking up jars and examining their every detail. Smiling, remembering funny moments and giggling. My body felt almost weightless. Without the burden of needless worry or fear.\u000aAnd this was my initial experience from a single MICRODOSE!!\u000aI would highly recommned this strain to those who suffer multiple symptoms of anxiety/depression/PTSD/chronic pain.

One of my favorite strains because a few hits is all you need until you wake up to fall back asleep again...lol. Smoking this when posting this review just got challenging...too slee--p..py.

VKind of the Best Ever Kush.  Everything you could ask for in a tasty indica - ultimate relaxation, stress relief, and enough CBD to take all of your aches and pains away.  Won&#39;t lock you to the couch, but it will make it sound like a pretty good idea......\u000a\u000aI am always trying new flavors of Indica, and I keep coming back to the Platinum. \u000a\u000aIt makes you want to dim the lights, put on some Allman Brothers, and just....chill........

VIts a very good strain in my opinion, creeps in kinda and you know when its hit you, i felt pretty happy, lazy, really had the munchies, not a couch lock, you can focus pretty well, good for any time of day really, has a good taste not harsh, burns pretty good, not quick like some strains, the smoke has a skunk smell, the bud has a very nice smell, i can smell mine from outside the bag so i put it in a jar just for safety, had a euphoric feeling after smoking this, this type of bud is &quot;just right&quot; it has a good head high and a good body high you can say, got mine for $30 a G, get it if you come across it,\u000aEnjoy(:

VThis keeps you active and relaxed at the same time. No stress or paranoia. Definitely gets you on the munchies! Love the smell, taste and of course the high; not really sedates your body but keeps you relaxed, no couch-lock and keeps you alert and thinking. I would personally give this a 4.5/5. It&#39;s missing the .5 because it&#39;s not that long-lasting but totally haves you sleeping on a cloud, I really really recommend it to all smokers out there, even the sativa-lovers, this indica is perfect for you. Stay lifted :)

VPretty potent strain. The smell and taste are hard to describe, almost similar to OG Kush, but more sweet. The effects are very relaxing and create both a cerebral and physical high that lasts for a considerable amount of time. Platinum Kush is great for my nausea and pain, and is wonderful for sleep. Overall, this is a great smoke. \u000a

VI bought half an eighth of this and it lasted me quite some time! A little bit goes a very long way with this stuff. Okay, the dry mouth/throat was almost unbearable at times, but it definitely helps if you have hot tea or a cough drop. The high was definitely stronger than Pre-98 Bubba Kush, but it was much more of a head high than the P98. The nugs weren&#39;t very dense so you could get an awful lot of it that could last up to twice as long as any fairly dense strain. I definitely would recommend, but just remember to have some tea made or a bag of cough drops nearby. Otherwise, you&#39;ll find yourself coughing and spitting into your sink, feeling like you could through up from the super-dry throat and intense coughs.

VI tried this strain maybe half an hour ago on my brand new Pax3. A decent strain with a powerful, buzzing head high...I felt as if I could flop back into a couch and sink deeper and deeper into the back. But, I could also get up and knock out of that feeling fairly easy.\u000aMy only complaint is that when I smell this strain, the thick, dense bud gives off a very unpleasant smell...almost an acidic vomit flavor. Super harsh on the taste with inhaling, nothing with exhaling.

VThis is a damn miracle strain!!!  To anyone needing a strong, sexy indica that\u2019ll kill pain, this is it!  Knocks my husban\u2019s ass out! Got chronic pancreatitis, DJD, ADD, anxiety, arthritis, lupus &amp; neuropathy (thanks western medicine!!).  These things sent me to the ER 5 times a yr before MMJ.  After MMJ\u2014 went for an x-ray &amp; appendicitis in the last 4 years.  Along w/ allowing me to get off narcotics (hydromorphone 4mg was almost forced on me) &amp; 50% of unnecessary meds. It\u2019s even killed 2 tumors.  Me thinks there may be something in this plant! &#128514;  My Dr\u2019s are watching this body heal &amp; literally asking for the best strains! Even at Mayo... it\u2019s insane!  I\u2019ve become a connoisseur &amp; savant.  And I think these reviews are groundbreaking.  With so many strains &amp; places, true medical patients need to help each other out. JMHO.\u000aAll that bullshit said, Platinum Kush, Platinum GDP, Plat Cookies, Plat OG &amp; every Platinum strain I\u2019ve tried has been a freakin miracle!  Seems like every high is different, even with the same strain!  I always pick up Plat GDP from Bloom &amp; Platinum OG wherever. It\u2019s what works when nothing rlse will. \u000aIf you have the annoying problem of a naturally high tolerance &amp; lots of pain, this is a great strain to try.  Even allows &amp; creates some hot nookie. If you\u2019re not asleep or inside a couch. \u000aThis is 1 of the strains I always tell Dr\u2019s &amp; friends about.

VI LOVE THIS INDO STRAIN! \u000aI tend to lean more towards INDO over SATI but I do PREFER a INDO DOMINANT HYBRID with as MUCH SATIVA AS I CAN HANDLE [I have extreme panic disorder n anxiety [social n generalized]].. So, basically this INDICA strain TO ME, feels like izz about maybe, 20 percent sativa [NO MORE! kinda like &quot;cherry pie&quot; in reverse, a strain I loved for sum reason even if it is 80% sativa...] \u000aThis Platinum Kush, to me, feels like skunk with a sativa [more mental stimulation n such] quality... GREAT MID-HEAVY BODY BUZZ THO! I love the &quot;CREATIVE COUCH-LOCK&quot; as I call it as izz not that DUH high lol but a couch-lockish high that has a intellectual quality to it! I LOVE THIS STRAIN! izz INDO but to me, izz HYBRID!... as WE ALL REACT DIFFERENT TO ALL STRAINS JUS ABOUT, OF CANNABIS! THAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PART OF IT, IZZ GENETIC DIVERSITY! ONE STRAIN CAN MAKE U TALKATIVE [great for SOCIAL ANXIETY] but may make sum people wit more PANIC/GENERALIZED ANXIETY, MORE NERVOUS as it takes sum STIMULATION [n OVERSTIMULATION possibly to the other &quot;anxiety&quot; type patients]... \u000aGREAT INDICA AS IT IS &quot;UNIQUE&quot; n HAS IZZ OWN &quot;STYLE&quot; or wutever u wanna call it, &quot;HIGH&quot;...

VThis is an update to my last review a couple if weeks ago (got the strain again). \u000aThis strain is definitely growing on me. As i mentioned in my previous review i do prefer other OG lineage strains (skywalker and Tahoe are the best IMHO), but this cheaper strain does the job just fine. It originally attracted because it was a light kush with afghani looking buds (almost like skunk) only it had a very sweet, earthy, hashy, kushy aroma, rather than a rotten fruit and dead skunk smell lol. I like letting other people hit this strain first, as the smell is very pleasant when smoked, still nice and sweet. Its pretty sticky, covered with crystals and relatively dense buds. This strain helps me with managing pain and depression, but it really shines for helping insomnia. After smoking this, a nap is definitely in the near future! \u000aThe strain looks good, smells good, smokes good, and helps me sleep, there really isnt that much more to ask for from a strain, but i stand with 4 stars simply because it doesnt keep me asleep the whole night like the skywalker and tahoe and the potency is less too; hovering at about 20% thats basically the minimum i buy now.

VStrong aroma, flavors stay strong even when smoked out a water pipe. Definitely one of the better Kush I have smoked. \u000a\u000aNugs were small with a deep forest green and dark orange hairs.  At first glance nothing special, at closer inspection nugs were very sticky and with lots of trichomes inside.  \u000a\u000aI am an indica lover, so the high is perfect for me. \u000a\u000aMorning anxiety gone right after wake and bake. \u000a\u000aUplifted mood, muscle pain reduced. \u000a\u000aVery clear head, going back to reading my book after this review.

I didn&#39;t look at a schedule for the next train, call my dad, or nothin. But they made an announcement at 12 that there was a train to Worcester Boarding.

VI tried this earlier, and found it a treat. I medicate for back pain, and severe depression. I found it not only numbed my pain, but I couldn&#39;t feel much of my body. I loved it to death for this. (We did tend to drop things when medicated. My buddy&#39;s never one to drop items.) It also provided that old fashioned, &quot;That 70&#39;s Show&quot;\u000aStyle of high. Munchies, Laughs, and Rock n Roll

VGreat strain for a lot of things. I smoked a massive joint of this and it had me lost in my thoughts. I brought my dog for a walk and felt like i was floating. It&#39;s easy to lose track of life with this strain. It mad me want to go for a walk, fish, or read a book. It was great for my appetite and general anxiety. Calmed life down for some time and made the day flow easier. Would highly recommend.

VThis strain was definitely good for pain. But I felt a fair amount of anxiety (negative thoughts) which kind of ruined the benefits for me. \u000a\u000aI smoked with a friend who is a daily smoker and no doubt has a high tolerance and he really liked it. So I think this might be a unique experience if you&#39;re a veteran smoker.

VSo platinum kush, I really like this strain, when I smoke it out of organic hemp papers. I decided to go for a drive with a joint. I lit it in the driveway and pulled out, I end up getting paranoid and literally two streets down, turned right and went back to the driveway. I literally drove in circle for nothing, finished the joint and went back in the house. Once in the house I felt a nice buzzing feeling in my body and my head felt light in a good way. I was goofy and giggly and anxious in a good way.  I suffer from G.A.D. so I&#39;m always anxious in a bad way and it makes me shake bad. This bud helped with that. And I could actually talk freely, without really worrying about what I might say wrong, and what people might go and use against me by flipping my words to others. I just felt relaxed and did not give a flying rat&#39;s ass. I was sleepy but not sleepy, so I got to choose stay up or go to sleep. I actually felt interested in stuff, I usually don&#39;t like to do anything. So yah I recommend it, PlK.

VAnother indica I definitely am fond of, but not blown away with. The nugs are dense and dark, flashing traces of purple here and there between orange hairs. Although not particularly strong smelling, this is another strain that takes a break from the usual pungent, citrus type flavors. A pleasant body-easing high delivers relief from muscle pain and brings easy sleep.

VI often find it hard to sleep because of the caffeine in my preworkout even 5-7 hours after taking it. There was a time I failed to fall asleep and ended my night/day doing some early morning cardio. After my workout, I hit the bed and fell to my slumber the entire part of my day. \u000a\u000aThis strong indica bud helps in numbing out the preworkout drink before going to bed. Now I find it easier to fall sleep now as its cerebral effects now exceeds that of the mega-caffeine of my preworkout. \u000a\u000aAmazing strain, but don\u2019t take it while working out! It completely keeps you from your goals and promotes lethargy. I skipped my dead lifts because of this. Nonetheless a great heavy indica strain.

VOh Boy Platinum Kush. What to say about this beauty! All i can say is that it did the job with having a stress free night. I was super happy while bull crap pasted me by. I was super paranoid riding my bike home. So newbies beware you might actually scare the shxt out of yourself. \u000aBut overall Great High!

VPlatinum Kush is an absolute beast of a strain. Frosty, vibrant nugs with clusters of orange hairs and tinges of what is almost purple, PK is a good looking strain. Combine aesthetics with intense indica effects and voila, Platinum Kush. PK provides a warm, pleasing body high, and induces a somewhat fuzzy yet still happy and enjoyable mental state. Strong stuff. Makes me not want to do much of anything, so for me is certainly not a wake n bake strain. Great for when you&#39;re ready to relax and unwind, just make sure that if you have to go out in public to not overdo it. Socializing can be a difficult task when you&#39;re too stoned to be able to effectively formulate sentences. Overall, however, PK is a wonderful strain and probably one of my personal favorites. Highly recommended for cannabis connoisseurs.

VThe first time I smoked Platinum Kush I was on a loading dock for small boats at a river. After I stood up, I started running around the parking lot. I don&#39;t know why. I also started to talk about George Washington. To sum it up, if your looking to enjoy a good laugh with friends, this is the strain.

VThis strain is pretty good, but I think the negatives heavily outweigh the positives. Positives: it makes you sexual asf and sex will be amazing on it, great for sudden sleep (I fell asleep at an assembly when I got slightly bored and was high on this). Negatives: it made me feel sick, to the point where I had killer headaches and my stomach hurt, and it made me SUPER PARANOID. The paranoia went to a point where I would think I was hearing faint knocks on my door at night and I always got extremely scared almost to the point of crying. Make sure you smoke safely if you get paranoid with indica.

VFrom what ive gathered, this strain is just right as far as a blanced high goes. I love indica strains for their pain relieving effects and the platinum kush delivers this without the adverse of being overly tired. If you are looking to medicate for pain but dont want to get couch locked - this is your strain. Its definitely a suprising balanced buzz. \u000a\u000aThe smell is super strong also and the taste is def an upside.

Very relaxing inhale/exhale with a hint of tang lol didn&#39;t see any purple notes like the pics unfortunately. Wish I got it from the source instead of a second hand. 4 stars!

VI&#39;m not the smoker I used to be. I generally take one hit of something and hope for the best, but generally CBD strains are the only ones that relax me.\u000aI had this strain recommended to me for sleepy time, and I couldn&#39;t be happier. No paranoia, nice and relaxed, and within the hour I&#39;m ready for bed. I can even take multiple bong rips and be totally fine. Plus, it&#39;s damn tasty.\u000aIf you generally have trouble with weed making you paranoid and twitchy, give the Platinum Kush a try. I&#39;ll be seeking this one out again.

VA little goes a VERY LONG way! Rolled up a large blunt and smoked too much by myself the first time I tried it..Very pleasant and happy high, great pain management probably due in part to the CBD content. This is one is best for nighttime because it can put you out pretty hard. Been smoking on Platinum for about a month now and it is easily one of my favorite strains I have ever tried.

VMy Raynauds was killing me and my digestion was all whacked out but I was trapped with the fam so I just took a few discreet hits to take the edge off - the blood instantly rushed back to my extremities and I couldn&#39;t even feel my intestines haha. Comforting pressure between my eyes and on my temples, was still presenting completely sober and had no trouble spending I&#39;m the rest of the day hanging with my HUGE family (def knocked my anxiety down a peg too!). I was not sleepy. The only thing I wasn&#39;t crazy about was I felt I had a flat affect and kinda had to feign sincerity. Was definitely not happy/euphoric for me.

But anyways, as I was in traffic earlier I smoked a regular one hit and this stuff hit me ASAP. It&#39;s an amazing body high, as it&#39;s an indica strain. As I sat in my car, realizing I was smacked, I was brought to reminisce the first time I had this strain. I was chilling, I no longer felt hot or sweaty in this humidity. This bud cooled me down and helped me relax and still am. This bud is kinda strong compared to the other stains I\u2019ve had before, but definitely a great one.

VThis is a very strong strain. Lots of crystals and orange hairs.\u000aIt hits you after a few puffs.\u000aUnfortunately, I smoker too much (about a gram) and was high off my ass. The intense high made me sick (the highest I&#39;ve ever been). I was nauseated and couldn&#39;t focus on anything. I called off work and laid in bed.\u000aSometimes the body high is the strongest, and it feels like my body is drowning under water. I guess it comes down to taste in whether or not you like that. I didn&#39;t. The head high takes a back seat, and I&#39;m usually very clumsy when high off it.\u000aMusic sounds wonderful when high off this strain. It makes me want to dance, even though I was couch locked. \u000aIt didn&#39;t make me very social (due to it being an indica rather than sativa I reckon) and I just wanted to lay down.\u000aOverall, it gets you very high, but the physical sensations can be too much to handle (for me at least).

I love indica strains for their pain relieving effects and the platinum kush delivers this without the adverse of being overly tired. If you are looking to medicate for pain but dont want to get couch locked - this is your strain. Its definitely a suprising balanced buzz. \u000a\u000aThe smell is super strong also and the taste is def an upside.

VI got about 3 grams from my connect and the day after I invited my BUDdy over to have a sesh. Boy did we finish it and sank right into the couch in my room while playing GTA V Online and munching on some Panera Bread bagels. Since we&#39;re in the South, we had the sesh in my backyard shed. But man I give this strain two thumbs up. I love how when you examine it up close with a light, you&#39;ll see little tiny beautiful crystals. I recommend it to anyone that is just wanting to relax and chill. Plus, if you have an Xbox One add me and message me at SibilingGamers.

VI smoked Platinum Kush after a several month break from a Select cartridge, THC level was about 84%. My wife said it settled down her restless leg syndrome better than prescription pills, so I would suggest Platinum Kush for pain relief, as for me, I loved the long lasting effects. My sense of touch was greatly enhanced, this is a great choice for a wild night with your loved one.

VThis strain is a very good indica. very good smell, not over-bearing, although pungent. very good body high, would recommend for people having problems with chronic pain, insomnia, depression, joint/muscle pain.\u000a\u000awill have you ready for a long well rest in bed if your that is your sole purpose for this strain

VThis strain was definitely good for pain. But I felt a fair amount of anxiety (negative thoughts) which kind of ruined the benefits for me. \u000a\u000aI smoked with a friend who is a daily smoker and no doubt has a high tolerance and he really liked it. So I think this might be a unique experience if you&#39;re a veteran smoker.

Vsmoked a dutch blunt with platinum kush with my friend, it was so strong and numbing we ended up clipping it to save it later, the high really creeps up on you and becomes more intense as time goes on. Overall very relaxing and perfect to just chill with and makes socializing pretty enjoyable, amazing strain 10/10

VI tried this earlier, and found it a treat. I medicate for back pain, and severe depression. I found it not only numbed my pain, but I couldn&#39;t feel much of my body. I loved it to death for this. (We did tend to drop things when medicated. My buddy&#39;s never one to drop items.) It also provided that old fashioned, &quot;That 70&#39;s Show&quot;\u000aStyle of high. Munchies, Laughs, and Rock n Roll
