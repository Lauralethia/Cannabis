VThe Snow Leopard I got tested at 32% and hits like a bulldozer. I didn&#39;t say freight train because it moves slower, but is just as strong. This is one of my favorite hybrids, I stay energetic but also get euphoric. It&#39;s also super sticky, yet breaks apart nicely and smells great. Love it.

VSnow Leopard hits hard, but hits slow. Imagine the beautiful endangered animal slowly stalking toward you and curling around you wrapping you in a soft cloud of white fur. That&#39;s what smoking Snow Leopard feels like. In my case that has an almost immediate sedative effect so I wouldn&#39;t recommend smoking this if you have places to be, but if you need a good sleep, smoke this with your nighttime tea, it will accompany the flavor well as Snow Leopard has a pretty woody taste.

VI bought this specifically as my &quot;going to bed&quot; bud. It definitely made me sleepy and relaxed, which actually kicked in right away. It didn&#39;t really help my pain, but to be fair, I&#39;m in rough shape and in pain all the time. I also noticed a peppery kind of note, so you may cough or at least need a beverage. \u000aOverall, I enjoy this bud and I&#39;ll include Snow Leopard into my nighttime rotation.

VHigh elevation warning needed! Just did a few dabs, with my homie Shottie, of some beautiful Shatter type BHO, processed by Botanical Laboratories over in Portland. We then proceeded to sit, awestruck at the way the light and smoke mingled, couch locked for an ungodly amount of time. With a particular musky, warm terpene profile Snow Leopard has a creamy mouthfeel, reminiscent of the most exceptional of Mcflurries. Would pair well with some fuzzy socks, autotune the news, room temp faygo.

VTen years smoking all over the US and these are some of the prettiest buds I have ever seen. This phenotype came out with deep dark green leaves, and a rich orange smattering glued together with a quite literal forest of trichomes. \u000a\u000aAdmittedly, while it was a fantastic smoke, it was also a harsh one. Effects definitely heavy, stony, melty.

VBest dispensary bud I&#39;ve ever picked up.  A lot of it had to do with the grow--grown by Fire Flower PDX.  Frostiest loveliest bud I&#39;ve seen &amp; clocked in at about 28% THC.  Great flavor, but even better high.  No couch lock, but stellar relaxation &amp; a little trippy without any anxiety.  Super strain that may become my favorite, even though I usually lean toward sativas.  Fire Flower knocked it outta the park with this one!

VA very unique flavor of spicy dirt much like patchouli just not musky.  Not a smell that I would usually go for at all having a little bit of a dry grass in the barn smell.  Budtender suggestion, good sale on top shelf brought it within price range, and a 28.7% THC on lab results made the stars align for this stony flower to be smoked in my pipe.  Luckily things like this happen breaking me out of habit allowing for experimenting with strains the nose would have me otherwise discriminate against.\u000a\u000aWith so much talk of terpenes having such an essential role in the medicinal benefits of cannabis the scent &amp; flavor obviously have a crucial role. Not to mention add to the overall experience of the high at times making or breaking certain strains for individuals.  Being the first element of cannabis dealt with when experimenting our taste/smell perception is engaged before and during the actual being stoned element making it hard to separate.  Snow Leopard tastes like mushroom tea, some fruitiness nothing sweet or tasty, maybe diesel?\u000a\u000aA confusing mixture of many different palate teasing items by themselves coming together in such a manner it would be easy to rebuke.  Before doing so kick back &amp; take a minute to try separating all these distinct notes coming from this flower. If the reader is anything like me this will never happen because within the few minutes of thought this full bodied buzz will consume such trivial ideas. \u000a\u000aMuch like its namesake lays hidden in the white snow to catch prey this strain hides a powerhouse indica relaxation under lackluster character or style.  Even the bud structure is not much to rave about although the whole thing is covered in crystals. This strain is all about effect which is fabulous enough in sleep inducing properties to either mix with a tastier strain or like me learn to enjoy something different.
