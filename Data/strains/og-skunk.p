VI picked this up @ Leagle in Denver (shout out to the awesome peeps there) \u000aI was on my way to see Carlos Santana @ Red Rocks and asked the budtender what he would smoke if he were going and he didn&#39;t hesitate to recommend this strain. Went back the following day to pick up some more\u263a\ufe0f\u000aReally awesome high!!! For live music my go to strain right now! Very relaxing, uplifting and long lasting effects. Personally I like this in the daytime.

VThis strain is awesome. Pleasant citrus / Fuel smell, amazing taste with a hint of cedar. The high it&#39;s a great head high that gently fades into a relaxing body high. Very good pain reliever and works great for anxiety as well. Will definitely be recommending this strain.

VSuper good strain for the super bowl! Hit one GB and felt the effects kick in almost immediately. Once you sit down you&#39;ll most likely not want to get back up, so get your drink before that because your mouth will be super dry! Good relaxing strain that made me very happy and laughy. Look at memes, even the dumb tom Brady ones will make you laugh!

VNice dense nugs, with orange hairs. Tastes like other skunks or cheese; real earthy and stings the nostrils. The 60/40 sativa makes it hit the head real quick then the indica kicks in and relaxes the muscles. Leaving you with a headband feel but your still able to be productive.

VOverall a fantastic strain for those suffering from mental health illnesses. \u000aAfter a week of severe depression and anxiety, and many dissociative episodes, I was able to get up take a shower and start cleaning my house. \u000aIf I could keep the strain on stock forever, it would be right there next to my green crack and blue dream. No couch lock, and no weird headache, I did hyperfocus on whatever task I said before me. So I guess smoker beware if you don\u2019t like to hyperfocus &#129335;&#127995;\u200d\u2640\ufe0f&#128150;

VHoly smokes! Best weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. Very strong skunk smell carried me back to my High school days. Very rich woodsy citrus taste. Excellent choice to share with friends at a gathering. Happy giggly, inspiring, sensual blast! Can&#39;t wait to get my hands on some seeds.

Vfirst off, this smells very strong. I&#39;d say it smells like the woods or some out door shit. It&#39;s extremely smooth, little to no coughing, no burning, very smooth high. Be prepared for some spiritual stuff. Kind of unlocks a side of you that you never knew. My favorite strain to date, a small amount of a small bowl will last you for hours and you&#39;ll never feel better, before during or after. I just grinder up my last lil bit of it and I&#39;m very positive this will get me through my pains. Trusted strain I&#39;d say.
