VSmoked this after waking up at 2 on after pulling an all-nighter.  Reversing my sleep schedule plays havoc on my bipolar and anxiety, and also on my chronic muscle spasms and occasional migraines.\u000a\u000aI was feeling down and demotivated, with a stress hangover, and it was raining off and on.\u000a\u000aOne vaporized hit - one - of Pineapple invited a much more tropical state of mind.  First impression, smells outrageously delicious.  Flavor was pungent - sweet, bright, piney and fruity.\u000a\u000aImmediate effect was of initial cloudy headiness followed by a powerful cerebral lift, which transitioned into an urge to do stuff, though not much focus for uninteresting tasks. This one is a little bit racy for me, bordering on almost too energetic.  I assume my CBD oil helped here to prevent anxiety, and I chewed a couple peppercorns just in case.\u000a\u000aVery uplifting, and once I transitioned into a relaxing activity rather than chores, I felt more at ease.  I had some soy yogurt and fruit, and enjoyed a blissful, two to three hour high, landing gently back on my feet.\u000a\u000aI didn&#39;t find the comedown to be harsh or abrupt, and I didn&#39;t feel wiped out afterward.  Felt refreshed, relaxed, and uplifted for the rest of the day.  Kind of like a pi&#241;a colada on the beach, Pineapple was sunny, bright, and relaxing.  \u000a\u000aThose with anxiety may want to take care with this one, as it does have a caffeinated feel.

VIt tastes like pineapple, so it&#39;s like smoking candy. This stuff puts me in a wonderful headspace, giggly and silly. I smoked some and went to an open mic night, which allowed me to really feel the music and empathize with the performers. Plus someone stepped on my foot and I didn&#39;t care at all.\u000a\u000aAlso, if you or someone you know has Tourette&#39;s Syndrome, my boyfriend smoked some of this and his moderate tics stopped completely.

VI purchased this as an outdoor strain on 4/20 from a dispensary.  It was the bottomshelf $20 eight.   I was skeptical but I enjoy it.  The high didn&#39;t send me into outer space or make me completely stupid.   Very mellow and clear-headed.  I don&#39;t how much being sun-grown accounts for this, but I approve.  Also had a great citrusy clean taste.

VThis stuff smells absolutely amazing and taste just as good. It truly lives up to its name. Definitely recommend this one for the daytime as I find myself greeted with a rush of energy and euphoria. It definitely gets the appetite going and completely and i mean COMPLETELY takes away any stress and/or anxiety you may be having. I will for sure be grabbing more of this stuff in the not too distant future.

Lasts a while (up to 6 hours) and more if traveling (smoke about 1-2 hours before leaving for airport. High lasts: Smoking=up to 6 hours; Vape= up to 3 hours; vape pen= alone high lasts up to 30 minutes; During Smoking you can end up spacing out or laugh breathlessly for minutes on end.

VPineapple, on it&#39;s own is a pretty weird kind of high. The combination of having a perfectly clear mind while my body is seriously buzzing is totally unlike any other strains I&#39;ve tried before.\u000a\u000aHowever, I tend to enjoy mixing my strains just to see what different types of a buzz I can engineer. I&#39;ve discovered that about 80% Pineapple with 20% Blue Dream is a a five star high that is probably the best I&#39;ve experienced in 45 years of imbibing.

VGreat for day time smoke. Awesome 50/50 hybrid you don&#39;t get super sleepy when you come down, but if you tried to sleep you probably could. You get full head and body high along with munchies. When I got the bag from the dispensary it just looks like a bag of weed hair and smells incredible.

VOnly boughten it once or twice in the past but last time i had it was in a 2.5g blunt and for taste it was definitely a tangy , citrus like taste. Made my mouth water very heavily and quickly. A good fruity but earthy type smell to it , the buds were semi-flakey but nothing annoying. As far as the high goes ( i was also a few dabs deep) however once i was done with this blunt and walking to my car I definitely noticed my high and i had a very uplifted , giggly / happy high with that kind of slow motion and off debt perception feeling. I would definitely buy again. All around very good and happy high

VReally nice mellow experience.  No paranoia and a overall sense of well being and outgoingness (I found myself dancing more than once at the club we were at - and I don&#39;t dance!)  Mix of body and head high with lots of energy and we felt very sociable.  Comes on pretty quick and then mellows in about 15 minutes.  This is the perfect strain for when you need to be out and about and socialize.  I could see this helping immensely with anxiety if that affects you.  Tastes very clean with hints of citrus.  Really like it.

Riding a bike, spinning around in circles, laughing with clowns and squeezing those red noses of theirs and giggling like the pillsbury doughboy. Not too strong in a sleepy way but you are sure to feel the effects.  Tastes excellent. Not good for night time sleepy effects at all. You&#39;ll use it all and want to go outside or play with legos.

VI picked up an eighth of this from Stonies LLC in Coos Bay, OR; but in that case it was sold as a straight Sativa, and those were certainly the effects I got. It was all head-high, and very uplifting/energizing. It took care of some social anxiety that I was dealing with at the time, and helped with the chronic pain I deal with on a daily basis from a car accident 20 years ago. At around 17 - 19%, this was plenty potent. The tropical flavor really comes through well, too.

VMmmmm feels great. My depression is eased greatly at the moment. I feel elevated and relaxed all at once. Very balanced high. The vapor does have a hint of pineapple.

VI had the Live Resin of this and the taste is BRILLIANT. It tastes like I just bit into a pineapple chunk. Amazing resin and procedure that it goes through in making it.

VI picked up an eighth of this from Stonies LLC in Coos Bay, OR; but in that case it was sold as a straight Sativa, and those were certainly the effects I got. It was all head-high, and very uplifting/energizing. It took care of some social anxiety that I was dealing with at the time, and helped with the chronic pain I deal with on a daily basis from a car accident 20 years ago. At around 17 - 19%, this was plenty potent. The tropical flavor really comes through well, too.

VTook this for stress and ADHD.  Vape pen took one draw.  Waited 40minutes. Nada.   Second draw.  And overshot my goal. But high now.  How much to just get the focused effect and not high? It&#39;s also the first strain of sativa that has me suddenly really hungry.  Oh well. The high is nice and mellow. My foot pain is just a dull ache and the nerves tingle instead of burn. Good mood lifter. Boyfriend yelled at me for and hour and then broke up. Not heartbroken no anxiety.  Better than his Xanax that he was abusing.  To relax.  I&#39;ll change star later after its affects are assessed.

I&#39;ll change star later after its affects are assessed.

VIt was a VERY NICE HIGH! You feel it in your head then goes to you body. Makes you feel very relaxed,mellow and very high. When the indica sets in be prepared to fall asleep fast, you will wake up refreshed with a little headache that last for like 5 minutes. Overall this was an awesome strain.;)

VI grabbed some of this as a BHO from Shango. Wow, it&#39;s amazing. It tastes like citrus and pineapple when vaped, but don&#39;t vape too much. I had only a few tries of it before I felt super high. It feels a lot like a big hug and all I want to do is snuggle with my dog and take a nap. 10/10, would buy again.

VVery energetic and euphoric, but had me feeling a little anxious/paranoid which usually doesn&#39;t happen to me with most sativa dominant hybrids I&#39;ve tried. But still very uplifting and energetic. The taste and smell was great, very astringent and fruity. The smoke was a little harsh on exhale. Overall a pretty good day strain but too much can easily make you feeling anxious and racey.

VI purchased this strain as a extract cartridge. It was from Select Strains (Oregon Brand) in April of 2017. I found this to be a great cleaning the house weed. It provided me just enough get up and go to start and accomplish small tasks before getting distracted by the &quot;next shinny object&quot;.  I can not watch more than an hour long drama while using this strain, and good luck getting me through a sitcom if there are commercials. Good productive weed.

VI love strains that simply are what they claim to be. However with my run of BHO had a very kush-like flavor along with the sweet tropical aftertaste. This was actually pleasant, being that it accurately portrayed the the ripe flavor of a pineapple. Very impressive terps from Dab Society. Anyway, the high was very couch-locking. I think I ate about two boxes of fruit roll ups.

VIt definitely gets your pulse going. Pineapple seems to be a pretty invigorating strain that felt it loaded me with a lot of potential energy. Some people have gotten some cannabis-induced anxiety from this strain if they don&#39;t have a sufficient way to use up that energy. But that makes this a great strain for daytime when you&#39;re getting ready for a run, a hike, or anything that expends a fair amount of energy. All in all a great energizing strain.

Right after smoking a bowl of this stuff, I started meticulously cleaning my incredibly gunky and neglected glass pipe for like a solid 30 minutes. lol. Overall, this strain pleasantly surprised me. It also makes me feel very content, which I really like.. Perhaps the best part is that I scored it for a really great price at Magic Castle in SW PDX! I will be back for more, soon!

VSo first off I looked up this strain and Leafly says it&#39;s a hybrid rather than a sativa. After smoking half of the Lowell Smokes pre-roll I would agree that it&#39;s more hybrid territory. I had some immediate general well-being feels. It didn&#39;t punch my apathy in the face but I did eventually get up and run errands so I guess it works. Lowell Smokes doesn&#39;t have the highest THC levels but as I also found with the Blue Zkittlez pre-roll, this is smooth and easy on the lungs. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll buy this specific strain pre-roll again but I like these overall so I&#39;ll continue to try more. Paranoia level: 1/10.

VIt was Waxy Wednesday at Glisan Buds so I took advantage of the 15% Waxy Wednesday discount and a 10% more off discount from a text coupon and bought my first dabbable, Pineapple BHO extract by Bhombchelly&#39;s. \u000a\u000aMy friend gave me some unlabeled extracts when she gave up dabbing but they are all indicas, so I wanted a sativa but wound up with Pineapple, a hybrid.  As with the vape cartridges, there is no ash or ashy taste so the pineapple is truly candy sweet fruity and pure tasting.  Exhaling was literally a sweet pleasure and I soon felt sativa like effects of the Pineapple strain:  energetic, high, happy, mental clarity.  \u000a\u000aI live in Portland, Oregon, where it rained 149 days in a row this year.  As you might imagine, anything tropical tasting is a welcome delight and pineapple was no exception.  Mine tested at 70.9% THC and .3% CBD.

VNot bad for some thing in my area of the state. Crazy tasty pineapple smell in nug form and also when broken up. Taste when smoked is peppery with a hint of skunk.  Good, solid high..something I can smoke in the morning and well as the afternoon and night. Another review should follow tomorrow.

VI purchased this strain as a extract cartridge. It was from Select Strains (Oregon Brand) in April of 2017. I found this to be a great cleaning the house weed. It provided me just enough get up and go to start and accomplish small tasks before getting distracted by the &quot;next shinny object&quot;.  I can not watch more than an hour long drama while using this strain, and good luck getting me through a sitcom if there are commercials. Good productive weed.

VPineapple is one of those strains that you just have to buy if you come across some that was grown right!! Pineapple candy flavor and pungent smells are traits of this strain that are recognizable within the first hit. Good for a morning and midday medicine as it is very uplifting and energizing.

VI like this strain when I am alone. It makes me not want to be around people, or to be touched -which was very odd. I usually get a &quot;heavy head&quot; feeling. It does make me feel a bit restless and like I need to be moving/completing things, but it&#39;s a content feeling (if that makes sense). Overall not bad, I do enjoy it...I just need to be alone to do so.

This herb is sweet on the exhale and leaves a very pleasant fruity/sweet aftertaste, no matter how hard I took it in was as smooth going down as smelling flowers in a meadow on a sunny day. Effects last as long as 3 to 4 hours before decline and the decline lasts 2 to 3 hours for a semi-seasoned user (4/5 days a week user at a two, .5 -1.3 gram Joint rate)

It was a very tropical taste with lots of pineapple and it will leave a sweet taste in your mouth.it was tested by SC labs at 85% and the CBD levels were very impressive too. I would definitely recommend it and I will probably try it again soon

VI&#39;m smoking on Co2 extract Pineapple and it&#39;s delicious !! Though I&#39;ve medicated with Pineapple with flower in the past. This strain is wonderful indica Dom hybrid. It&#39;s real pineapple, tropical punch taste gently lifts you. It defiantly has sativa in there, you feel both body and head high but none of that sativa jolt. This is a peaceful smoke. I would recommend for pain and anxiety (anything).\u000aThis can be a day time smoke you just might want to go easy as too much of this yummy strain will bypass couch lock straight to nap lock. I also recommend vaping this strain if you can flower but concentrate if you can find \u000ait. You will get the full flavor/terps and it&#39;s incredible !  \u000a\u000a

VThis strain of bud wasn&#39;t all that potent. Physically it really didn&#39;t help to take away the pain throughout my entire body but it helped with cutting down on my muscle spasms. Mentally this strain also was on the low side of the euphoric good relaxing feeling I usually feel from smoking really good bud. It did help me relax a little and also made me a bit more talkative too. Plus thank the beautiful Jennifer from Monarch dispensary for being very nice and helpful with the medical service provided. I give her a 5 out of 5 stars. ;)

The flavor was decent but in my opinion its just not a strong strain. Where I got it from they said all but a few plants died and the ones that survived ,looked like this very dinky

VExtremely strong Indica that is for nighttime use only. Tastes like pineapple and very hairy, sticky pungent buds

VThis quickly became one of my favorite strains! First, and foremost, it smells absolutely delicious. This is one of the best smelling strains that I&#39;ve encountered. It tastes just as delicious. It is a smooth strain that produces a lot of smoke. The first part of your high is uplifted, euphoric, and happy. It doesn&#39;t produce a lot of giggles, but does put everyone in a good mood. It is a great strain for being out and about and social. The second part of the high is very mellow. You are still happy and enjoying everything around you, but you will not be as chatty as before. I know that every time I see this strain, I will purchase it. It&#39;s one to always have around.

VThe first few minutes were nice, if not a bit heady for my taste. After that I ended up feeling like a parched sponge experiencing paranoia and depression. Overall it wasn&#39;t my favorite experience.

VA great sativa dominant hybrid. The flowers i received were incredibly dense light green and very sweet smelling. I had many great times while medicating with this flower. Not so much for pain, it takes the edge off though. However it sure does put you in a better mood. I was a little giggly and very much socially stimulated while medicating with this flower. i would definitely recommend for a day time smoke.

VI came across purple pineapple today and was presently surprised.  I&#39;ve never seen this strain b4, and got even more excited when I discovered was an indica. Super super purple buds, smooth taste, well grown. I did find a seed in my 1/4 I bought. It was fun to try but won&#39;t be a repeat 6.4/10
