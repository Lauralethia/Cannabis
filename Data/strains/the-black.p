VI believe I have found my new favorite body melting indica. This strain is one of the greatest breakthroughs for body and muscle pain I have discovered in a long time. Definitely for night time use. My anxiety And depressive mood are neutralized. As a chronic pain sufferer I highly recommend you try this one. Another unusually powerful and hard hitting strain. This has earned its place in a top 3 for myself. Thanks to the following strains and combinations I have discovered for chronic pain and other chronic ailments I am becoming free of traditional pain management. Keep the black in your pain tool kit.

VFor starters I hail from the land of no cannabis. Or cannabis that could just narrowly even be called cannabis. Swag, brickweed, or shitty outdoor. Now my wife and kids and I live in Kesey Country, Oregon. To me, this is CannaHeaven. \u000aOk, The Black. Or Black. \u000a\u000aThis incredible strain has literally made everyday I&#39;m able to medicate with it 100% better. I suffer from CRPS. It&#39;s living hell. I recently stumbked across the Best Dispensarybin Eugene here, River Valley Remedies. Classy, classy joint. (Pun intended) Basically a 21st Century apothecary. And stocked medicinally as such. I saw the profile of The Black, looked it up here on Leafy and took the chance. I&#39;m grateful as all get out that I did. The changes in my mood, my sleep, and my pain are so pronounced I forgot I had CRPS!! Like the last reviewer who&#39;s father was working with DJ Short and grew this strain said, it&#39;ll knock your ass out. If you&#39;re lucky enough to find it, that is. \u000a\u000aThank you River Valley Remedies for holding an ounce for me for $60! &#128591;\u000aI actually got a text from the owner, as he knew it worked well for me pain wise. When I saw it was &quot;sale day&quot; and $60 ounces, I couldnt get down there quick enough. And when I did,  man oh man...big ass buds, dark as night. Unless you shine some sunlight on the buds and they look like stock grown moonrocks. This cannabis is simply amazing! Grateful as Fuck!

VI would like to add or perhaps simply engage in some black induced redundancy briefly. So please just bare with me. I&#39;m in a lot of pain tonight and I believe I found a perfect effective body musculoskeletal pain killer. Combining black with a powerful high thc hybrid like rascal . Seems to be a life saver for me. I am becoming more and mor dependent on the black and am so grateful for its existence. Next on my list to try and observe those effects on my pain mk ultra, granddaddy purple romulan and northern lights. I need to also try more hybrids and even sativas as well especially for daytime working hours . Durban poison is an excellent sativa for body pain and fatigue. I guess I&#39;m so accustomed to leaning so heavy on indica for their well known pain properties. I lose sight of the sativas. I must correct this

VThis does exactly what it claims to do.  Very relaxing, helps with arthritic pain, and definitely helps me sleep. I don&#39;t like to use it during the day because I get too relaxed to get anything done.  The taste is ok, nothing great.  Based on the smell of the buds, I expected it to taste better, but to me, it has a certain dirt taste that I&#39;m not crazy about.  I would buy this again, though, because if you want good pain relieving and relaxing results, this does the job very well. I also found it doesn&#39;t give you a bad case of the munchies.

VEasily the heaviest indica flower I&#39;ve ever smoked. A new favorite! No other indica flower I&#39;ve smoked has had such knock-out effects compared to The Black. No joke with this one. The best strain if you&#39;re planning on doing absolutely nothing after tokin&#39;.\u000aI first picked up an eighth of this, and then came back for a quarter the next week! The batch I aquired was a &quot;Limited Release&quot; by Sky High Farms. The flowers had a lovely slightly-musty &amp; woody/leathery scent, and a very smooth smoke from Sky High&#39;s curing efforts! In addition to conquering insomnia, this strain is also great for addressing pain. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a hard find. But, if you&#39;re browsing a menu for something that will put you to sleep, and/or get rid of some aches and pains, don&#39;t hesitate to try The Black!\u000aHappy Smoking! \u270c&#127995;
