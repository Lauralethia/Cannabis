VAwesome everything!! Taste, smell, effects, and a pleasure to grow usually... Had some weak limbs recently and sensitive to heat more than previous years. Nice thick, dense, nugs that can mold if not watched carefully from being too big and dense.

VHappy and uplifting best describe this lady. This strain puts you in a wonderful mood. Very giggly. The buds are fluffy and sticky as hell. Coated with some nice deep red calyxes. The smell had that classic Kush odor and sweet fruitiness. The flavors are really quite nice. Very smooth earthiness, with a noticeably sweet exhale. The flavor really sticks on the palate. Great strain for depression, social anxiety and ptsd. Only down side is that the effects taper off after about 1.5 hours or so.
