VWhat a beauty! Tight Jack Herrer looking strain. Long hairs stretch over each branch to touch each other. Ruby red pistols. Tight nugs not moving an inch when you squeeze them. CBG is great smells perfect citrus and extreme piny pungent smell. It tastes like it smells. Lovely Piny citrus tastes. King of the orange chocolate smell. I faved this strain, because it cleans my eyes I have crystal clear eye sight while a nice happy go lucky feel to this. Night time warmer in these cold night. Great medicine, bud structure, flavor smell and the only draw back is a little more water. I Think I&#39;ve found the sativa for me :D green crack comes a close second then. Absolutely will buy more when I see it. What kind of medicine makes my eyes hydrated? This does will get it every time.

VJack&#39;s Cleaner is fine medicine. It&#39;s genetics bring about the terpene profile you&#39;d expect. The exhale is citrus with chemical undertones alongside that sharp bite of lemon. \u000a\u000aGreat cannabis for the morning. Lots of energy and focus, little goes a long way with this one.

VI picked this up a couple days ago, and overall, it&#39;s an amazing strain. it&#39;s extremely potent. I smoke every day and there was one day where I smoked 2 bowls and was high the entire day off of this. you definitely get your money&#39;s worth with this one. It does make you energetic, but for me, only if i take 1-2 hits. after that, i get waaaaay too high and i get really tired and pass out. so it&#39;s a good day time weed if you&#39;re willing to smoke it in moderation. not a good day time weed if you&#39;re wanting to smoke all day lol\u000athe actual high is awesome. I found it very helpful for my ADHD (probably ok for people with anxiety/paranoia because my brain thinks very quickly lol and this weed is fine for me). I went to work on it and was completely able to keep things organized in my head, have normal conversations with my customers, and be relaxed all around. It does give you the munchies, so beware! It also lasts for hours. You&#39;ll be feeling that first bowl for at least a few hours, which is why i only had to smoke 2 to stay high all day. \u000aso yeah, the only bummer for me was that i couldn&#39;t keep smoking it or else i&#39;d just pass out lol but other than that, i would give it a try!!

VDefinitely able to enjoy this day or night. Heavy consumption will lead to not much getting done. Love the taste. Picked up half gram of this by MUV 78% THC. Taste is similar to a sativa kush.\u000aLong lasting &amp; depending on dosage will give you some energy without any anxiety. I could be satiafied with smoking this as my sativa for a few month&#39;s. If you come across this strain pick some up.

VA really excellent strain for me. One of my favorites in my 50 years of off and on puffing. Great for exercise, relaxing or sleeping. If I were &quot;King Of All The Lands&quot; I&#39;d recommend Jack&#39;s Cleaner. Such an amazing strain to recommend for everything. Head and body just feel amazing after. You get productive and creative. Happiness is flowing through you. No hyperactivity or racing heart rate or nervousness either. Taste is strong like lemon  / chem. A really nice relaxing and smooth feeling I get. It&#39;s one that you can be productive with or go to sleep. I&#39;ve slept great after a few puffs. Such a versatile strain I&#39;m sure most will enjoy. I feel like I am always smiling after puffs, so fun if you want to take it there. I&#39;ll say, from the right grower, this strain can also be very potent. Hope this helps. Enjoy!

VGot 4.5 Grams of this bud. I adore it! For me it&#39;s the cadillac&#39;s of medicine, the taste is citrus orange. It smells of sage and chocolate. Its an upper that excites me in the modest chillaxed way. I could choose how I want to feel by thinking out loud about it. Its a cleaner like the name says hydrates my eyes and gives me wide vision HD 16:9. The logic is solid for this strain. 2+2=4 16x16 =256 yep thats for sure a great medicine. This specific version of jack&#39;s cleaner has some crazy tested ratios that are tested has a lot and batch number on it and their keno types are true and its crazy. ok ok so THC is at 2.77% CBD is .02 CBN .03 THC-A% 22.11 AND CBD-A .04\u000aIf you&#39;re looking to be relaxed, not stoned, and not in a fall asleep sort of way more into the possibilities with the time I have. Love it &lt;3 It does have a citrus sage herbal dry taste bring your water bottles.
