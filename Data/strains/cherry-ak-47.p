VHey Kool Aid! The flavor of Cherry AK-47 brought about the memories of the full red pitcher. The &quot;creeper&quot; in true form, it taste wonderfully cherry with a potency that will put you on your back. This strain provided strong medicine for my MS fatigue, but unlike sativas that feel like a shot of espresso, this strain will slowly drift you into a sweet sleep. Not recommended for active days, more of a chill out, stay inside, watch movies and sleep on the sofa Sunday - day.

VFor 10/g, this was still pretty good quality medicine. It is powerful but not as powerful as girilla glue which is kinda cool if you knkw what i mean... GG can make me so high that my body is vibrating and tingly which I don&#39;t mind but this is a lot more mellow. Smells great and tastes great. Its &quot;ok&quot; for sleep but great for pain and appetite. Had some very stimulating conversation after a bowl or 2 as well. Great strain, woukd definetly reccomend.

VBe careful with this strain.  I&#39;ve been smoking for a while and this is a definite couch lock and if you&#39;re chain smoking this, you&#39;ll have a hard time keeping up. This is by far the strongest strain I&#39;ve ever had, and not saying it&#39;s not a good strain, but too much and you&#39;ll get sick of it. This made me really dizzy. Never experienced dizziness in my life with weed. Good for going to sleep. MAJOR munchies. I went through a whole medium pizza and a burger by myself. I don&#39;t recommend this strain to hang out and chill. You&#39;ll end up staring at the wall for hours. Too strong imo to even enjoy yourself. Had 12 grams of this and split with 4 people in 3 days. Honestly it was way too much. If you&#39;re wanting to just smoke a bowl of this, you&#39;ll be fine for the whole day. Only for serious stoners that like indica type bud and haven&#39;t been stoned for a while. Sativa smokers wouldn&#39;t enjoy it.

VI really like this strain. I have used it as a solid weekend daytime go-to since available in this area (Bmore/DC). Perfect post run smoke, great for housework, or a day on the trails. This bud promotes relaxed well-being and good feelings without a lazy body. Totally digging it.

VNice cherry taste.  Euphoria hits first with a strong head rush.  Tingly feeling throughout the body follows, when that clears I notice the headache and back pain I had a few minutes ago has subsided.  A very happy head high, sort of floaty and dizzy, combined with a kind of lazy warm body high.  Finally as the rush settles, there is a very calm, relaxing high that&#39;s just a bit fuzzy-headed - good for relaxing but not so great for something you need to be sharp for.  \u000a\u000aI could see this strain being very nice for post-surgery pain relief along with pain meds, or even maybe without.  I could also see it for anxiety relief.    Or just to unwind in the evening for stress.  Very nice!

VI definitely agree on the strain highlight statement: &quot;Cherry AK-47 &#39;creeps&#39; up from a cerebral effect to a complete body sensation.&quot; I like this strain a lot for activity followed by rest -- video games transitioning in to TV or movie watching. I also like Shark Shock for the same purpose, and I prefer Shark Shock, but Cherry AK is still a formidable strain.

VCherry AK-47 ! \u000a\u000aMan was I excited to try this one ! This strain had a huuuge local reputation. It is kind of the trendy choice right now in oregon and many places started carrying it. It usually costs a premium as a result. Well today I went ahead and got it.\u000a\u000aThe scent on this thing is second to none. Like others have said the scent lives up to the name 100%. It smells just like a CHERRY ! There is hardly a scent of traditional cannabis at all! Plus it&#39;s covered in sugar! Looks good enough to EAT ! \u000a\u000aNow we load it up and fire it up. It tastes like nothing really ... its almost hard to detect it at all except maybe a hint of berry .... You exhale and then .... Then you learn why they call it AK-47 because BOOOOOOM! The throat hit slams into you like a 7.62 mm bullet to the throat! It burns like hell and you start coughing. \u000a\u000aThen you are completely stoned ... Like insanely stoned. I wont even use other adjectives to describe it ... That&#39;s all you need to know. You won&#39;t be functioning at all and youll be super paranoid. Prepare for lockdown. This isn&#39;t for everyone. Very Very intense .... \u000a\u000aThat&#39;s Cherry AK-47 ... pretty simple. It comes out of nowhere and blows you away. Cheers.

VI have a batch with 24.78% THC but only 0.14% CBD, I&#39;ve seen this strain advertised as indica dominant, as a 50/50 balance, and the pheno I have right now says it&#39;s sativa dominant but for the most part feels like it starts out as a VERY BRIEF sativa dom hybrid and then the indica body high creeps in leaving you very relaxed. The higher the THC then the more tired and relaxed you&#39;re going to be regardless of whether it&#39;s sativa or Indica dominant. Either way this is 1 of my fave hybrids, my fave batch was the indica dominant pheno which came from Humboldt county and the only hint towards it&#39;s genetics were a Jack Herrer crossed with an unknown California Indica strain. There are MANY phenos of this strain out there so there&#39;s a very good possibility that if u bought this strain 10 different times then you&#39;re quite possibly getting 5-6 different phenos, all of which will feel very different.\u000a

VGood taste. very stoned and it kinda creeps. the effect made me paranoid but didnt trigger my anxiety like I some kinds do.. its a good strain but not my cup of tea. I was kinda couch locked after but I had a long stressful day so it might have been coincidence. Personally I wouldnt buy, rather Id get cherry pie give an option.

VOk....cherry flavour, but I prefer plain AK47 for sure. You can feel the taste of the cherry, but the high is very medium, with mild sativa effects. To be frank... I had a batch of cherry AK47 simultaniously with super lemon haze (which was magnificent) so I can not be very objective. An ok sativa strain, but not something special (except to the especial smell and flavour).

VIt is a creeper. A very nice head high and euphoria comes and hits you hard later on after smoking it like 10 minutes later. Haves its body relaxation as well. This will later make you kinda sleepy towards the end of it. \u000aFor medical use for Cherry AK-47, will take care of depression no problem. Can be use for stress and anxiety, but with this strong head high/rush it may make it worse for some. It takes care of pain and aches as your body relaxes on this. Can be use as a sleep aid for some with the tiredness at the end of the high, which is not that strong.

VCherry AK is some potent stuff. It is a heavy-hitting indica, and you will become the couch.\u000a\u000aEuphoria ensues and you get an amazing body high. The best part about this strain is its potency. Where usually, an eighth lasts me about a week, 3 grams of this strain lasted me for over a month. \u000a\u000a1/3 of a small nug gets me to outer space. This strain is strong, potent, and also gets you very aroused. 9.5/10\u000a\u000aMake sure you stay hydrated, you may get a bad headache if you are not drinking enough water. This strain gives you very dry eyes and a very dry mouth.

Method - Pax vape Flavor - deep dark cherries, with a hint of dark chocolate Head - Clear and crisp, bright, airy and optimistic. Body - Relaxed and calm but in an uplifted way feeling lighter. Eye relief. (Felt as though I could see or read better) Great for those who have inflammation, anxiety, depression and add/adhd. Clears your mind, allows you to positively focus and be in the present and relieves pressure and tightness throughout the body.

VI&#39;m an Indica guy, &amp; I was given a free pre-roll of Cherry AK-47, which is a hybrid. To my surprise, I loved the strain. It&#39;s hands down, the best tasting strain I&#39;ve ever had, and actually does taste like cherries. I felt my mood get elevated, and had an overall great experience. I experienced a head high that was just right, and a slight body high as well. For some reason every time I smoked it, I felt it was a classy high. I&#39;m not sure if this is an added bonus of the strain or not, but it will make you want to be intimate with someone. It would be a great honeymoon strain. Even if just for the flavor... you should try out this strain.

VFantastic flower. Light lime green buds smell of cherry and fuel with a hint of wood. Great slow creeping that starts of light and turns to a strong relaxing euphoric sensation. Sweet wood taste on inhale cherry on exhale smooth draw great for afternoon to evening use.

VThe smell is undeniable... and when you smoke, it hits hard.  The aroma is so nice and smells like cherries and pine... I&#39;ve had AK-47 but never have I had the Cherry AK.... It is a great end of the day smoke, and will leave you feeling light headed and also ready to sleep if needed.  This strain is also good for day time, if you can handle the effects... In my opinion, this hybrid cross is very special and rare.  I am so glad I got my hands on some dank from my local vendor in Washington D.C. - 80 bucks for a 1/4.  You can&#39;t beat that!   Super pungent, dank, and great for getting super lit - or, pain management.  It is a all around good strain.  You don&#39;t want to miss out on this one :)

VI can see why some might give it a 5 star. My reason for dropping 1 star is the taste is not as good as smell. In a bong that might change because it in a pipe it&#39;s a little harsh. \u000a\u000aThe good is that it does smell like cherry or possible lemon. I have it in a sealed mason jar and it smells up my room. It&#39;s white crystals make the buds  look like a molded cheese. \u000a\u000aThe high. I&#39;m a returning smoker, with loads of pain to kill due to l3 to l5 arthritis, leg and foot pain. It helped with pain. When I accidentally used too much (tip of bud) then it seemed counterproductive for relaxing, so use caution. I found the stats on my batch:\u000aDetails\u000a\u000aTHC 4.76% \u000aTHCa 17.81% \u000aCBD 0.00% \u000aCBDa 0.05% \u000aCBN 0.00%

VI have always thought to assess the characteristics of weed by their psychoactive feeling, but I can say for the first time, I really appreciated the taste and smoothness of smoking this. It was so incredibly smooth, there was absolutely no burn or harshness to the smoke.  It almost had a slight cool sensation going in.  As far as the psychoactive effects that I&#39;ve noticed, it&#39;s a little slower to set in than many of the other&#39;s I&#39;ve felt.  This one creeps up on you after a good 5-10 minutes, but has a totally relaxed and happy feel, with no paranoia or anxiety.  This is like an instant go-to strain for me.  Not the best one I&#39;ve ever had, as this one doesn&#39;t make me totally lazy, but it does have a bit of body high as well.  I will always favorite the cerebral and high energy sativas of the JH family.  But for something a little different from that, I totally dig this strain, and it&#39;s a good one to relax to after a long day.

VCherry AK is some potent stuff. It is a heavy-hitting indica, and you will become the couch.\u000a\u000aEuphoria ensues and you get an amazing body high. The best part about this strain is its potency. Where usually, an eighth lasts me about a week, 3 grams of this strain lasted me for over a month. \u000a\u000a1/3 of a small nug gets me to outer space. This strain is strong, potent, and also gets you very aroused. 9.5/10\u000a\u000aMake sure you stay hydrated, you may get a bad headache if you are not drinking enough water. This strain gives you very dry eyes and a very dry mouth.
