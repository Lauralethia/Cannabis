VVCDC is a high CBD strain that provides fairly good pain relief and a nice relaxed feeling. I found it made me feel dizzy so I would not rate it as highly as some of the other high CBD strains like CBD Skunk Haze or MediHaze.  Overall  a good pain and stress reliever.

VThis is a great evening and night med to help unwind and put you in a relaxed state. I personally prefer to vape and with a few pulls I can feel my body get pretty relaxed but not &quot;couch locked&quot;.\u000aIt has helped with my spasm and arthritis pain almost instantly.

VFirst time smoking cannabis since Jan 2017. First time smoking VCDC or any high CBD strain ever. I have anxiety and panic attacks frequently... first I took 1 baby hit at a time and it didn&#39;t do anything mentally.... next time started taking bigger hits, started to get a little head feeling with a mini anxious feeling. Next day started taking 2 big hits and FINALLY I felt pretty high! Normally my heart Beats 1,000,0000 MPH but this time it just beat what felt like 1-2 beats faster per minute than normal. I was slightly freaking out because i felt very trimbly and out of breath, but my heart was calm which was very new to me so I was really confused between if I should be freaking out or if this was a good thing, because my body felt like it was very anxious but my heart was chilled out... over all I&#39;m trying t again, i deffintely slept like a baby last night

VI personally did not like it. The after taste was too tropical, like tart pineapple and it threw me off a little bit, made me nauseous after a while. It did the job at reducing the pain, inflammation and making me sleepy but as a result it also made me dizzy and I found myself not very functional. I had a serious case of dry eyes too. I personally had a better experience with Pennywise or Cannatonic when it comes to high CBD strains.

VI have tried three CBD strains to date, this strain is by far the strongest, it&#39;s exceptional, it&#39;s a five. If you like strains that hit you between the eye&#39;s this strains for you. I use this strain at night, it makes your body go numb and you will sleep like a baby, it will rival stronger THC strains. To me this strain is a stay at home, late at night, get a good night sleep powerhouse. The strain I tried was 13% cbd 12% thc, waiting for the CT grower to grow some more, love it!

VOne of the best strains I&#39;ve used for pain. I am a post transplant patient dealing with GvHD, my skin is very tight this alleviates the pain of that as well as overall stress I may be feeling battling through a long cancer fight. Don&#39;t underestimate the low THC content it delivers a nice float into the clouds a nice head feel with a comforting body buzz, what joint pain?

VA good nighttime bud. This one makes me feel sleepy, calm, weightless, and hungry. Probably best to smoke this one on an empty stomach if you&#39;re not trying to put on weight. Not a clear head bud or one I&#39;d smoke before having to do anything that doesn&#39;t involve a couch.\u000a\u000aI smoked this as a vapor cartridge and it&#39;s one you can tell is weed, in case discretion is important to you (versus something like Acapulco Gold which doesn&#39;t). \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VI really wanted this strain to work for me because it tasted so damn good lol. I usually use Cannatonic,  but purchased VCDC at the recommendation of one of the employees. I explained to him that I have severe anxiety and he stated that this should work. Well, I had the complete opposite experience. It made me extremely paranoid/anxious/panicked. This may work for some people but for me it was a terrible experience. I&#39;m just putting this out there incase someone else is in my position and is weary on which strain to use for anxiety.
