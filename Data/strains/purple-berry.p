VPurple berry is a great strain especially it containing 2 of my favorite strains GDPx blueberry.\u000aIt gives u a strong head buzz along with its strong body buzz as well. Great taste of GDP at first then the earthy blueberry hint at the exhale. Helps me a lot with my ADD/ADHD And insomnia. I love indicas but I&#39;d rate this as a hybrid.

VPurple Berry (GDPmale x Blueberryclone)\u000aGrown from seed, stable genetics.\u000aLooks: Vibrant green/blue/purple buds with streaks of red and yellow through it, absolutley beautiful, almost every bud in 4z had the color to it. The crystal coverage was nice as well. The buds were big and dense like GDP but with a more blueberry structure. Really see both parents in it.\u000aSmell/Taste: One of the best ive been luciy enough to taste. The smell hits you with that super familiar smooth&quot;blue&quot;berry smell with a delicious twist of cool grape. 2 of the most distinct and recognizable &quot;weed flavors&quot; come together to unleash the most amazing mix of creamy sweet blueberry/grape sex into your sinus with every exhale. Its almost like someone dropped artificial grape and blueberry flavoring into your nose. Phenominal.\u000aEffects: I found this a great super relaxing night time bud. Only problem is, those beautiful buds and delicious taste will have you wanting to smoke it all day long. It doesnt take much for this stuff to melt your pain/stress/anxiety away,but your drive goes right with it. Usually i make it through about an hour of pure relaxtion bliss and then its nap time. Lethargy comes quickly if you over do it.\u000aDefiently a great night time strain.
