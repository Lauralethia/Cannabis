VUnique indica. I would recommend Rocklock for nights you want complete relaxation without falling asleep shortly after medicating.\u000aRocklock would be perfect for going to concerts or a night on the town.

VJust like it&#39;s name says Rocklock very dense buds so heavily structured nock on wood toughness. It smells of fresh citrus and pungent.\u000aIt tastes like herbal not dense skunk, or earth like just put it tastes like a nice herbal Lavander thats sweet, although not bitter :p.\u000aThe effects creep on to the body slowly like you&#39;re being given a hug. The eyes creep in after and relaxes the muscles in your body, rather than tensing. Happy, carefree, and at peace. Very interesting visual though no euphoria. Makes me chill out I was high strung before, this just left me on a hang glide across the sky just cruising along. \u000aThe effects are very nice I can see why many like it. It&#39;s not affecting my breathing normally with all strains my nose gets congested not on this truly outstanding! I can feel my self becoming hungry even though I just ate perfect for hyper anorexia (a high metabloism that causess body fat in starvation the body slowly depleates all of the bodies resources until no longer threatened) its a higher cortizal levels and anorexic conditions with pain sets my conditions to halter no pain and feels and tastes great recommend this who truly struggle with your conditions A+ from me.

VI wanted an indica-dom strain to help me sleep (#homebuyerlife, compounded by some other factors), but am finding this gem is actually chill and helping me get in my head just enough to stay focused on what matters but chill enough to not care. Munchie status 3000 but who cares;\u000atastes great and like McDonald&#39;s says, I&#39;m lovin&#39; it.

VUp front she\u2019s a numbly indica, sliding into your nerves and turning them to rubber bands, but when she reaches your head you might start to think thinky thoughts. You might get creative but creating is hard work with this much couch-lock, so maybe just some tv and drawing. You might need snacks for the comedown.

VI think the strain is strong, solid, tasty, and cerebral. However, I must say that of the two strains it is hybridized from, i.e., Warlock and Rockstar, I did not like either of them as stand alones but they work well in creating Rock Lock.\u000a\u000aI became very talkitive and enjoyed relaying information about astrology during my time with the Rock House strain. I was able to think and speak very clearly and was happy too. Overall, a very decent strain, and I am glad I went and bought a gram today. Thank you. -Astro_Jay

VThe smell carries through to the taste. Vaping the flower produced several bags of thick vapor that made me cough a couple of times. The effects took about 10 minutes to be substantially noticeable for me, but when it hit, it was fairly intense euphoria mixed with calm. I was able to think clearly for the first half hour with this strain, then the munchies hit with a vengeance. I say vengeance, because I suffer with nausea problems, and too high a munchie factor can sometimes increase my nausea by kicking my stomach into overdrive. This is one of those strains. It would be great for someone who has appetite problems but doesn&#39;t deal with nausea issues. The kush effects kicked in after a snack and made me really sleepily and thick brained but really relaxed for about an hour. I was able to power through the grogginess and brain fog and am writing this review on the other side. Overall, this strain has several outstanding qualities. This smell and the favor alone make this a stand out. I recommend this strain if you want intense munchies, but you might want to get the munchies out first as there was a longish cough lock phase as well. No anxiety or paranoia for me with this strain. About a two hour migrating overall effect. Relaxing for both mind and body. I will definitely get this strain again when I can.

VThis was another strain that did nothing to assist me with my medical issues.   I was really disappointed. The bud I picked up was sativa dominant 90  with only 10 percent indica present.   I would not purchase this again. The bud was also very dry, brittle and stemmy. Seriously, every sativa I try I am disappointed with.  Bring on some heavy indica for me.

Vrocklock is an excellent strain aesthetics wise. it&#39;s got large, sense buds with an insane amount of light orange hairs. large amber trichomes cover the buds,and there is even purple chunks of bud on some examples. the flavour is mild, however very sweet.

VI bought this for the indica affect.  I thought &quot;couch lock&quot; when reading the name Rocklock.  First thing I noticed was the smooth clean draw and fruity taste.  I&#39;d say Juicy Fruit gum is the flavor.  I bought a  1 gram pre-roll.  I smoked about 1/4 of it before it finally hit.  Tube says 19.71 THCA .20 THC.  Only a head high cant feel the body high.  I ended up smoking 3/4 of it and still wide awake and wanting to smoke the rest of it.  Not as strong as I would have liked.

VThis is actually super helping my neck spasms. I am still mildly twitchy but it&#39;s nowhere near as bad and it&#39;s not painful. So, score! Also, in a really cool treat - it&#39;s removing my anxiety a fair bit. Like, the super loud intrusive thought anxiety stuff I&#39;ve had going for the past 3 days is gone but I&#39;m not any sleepier than I was before I started smoking, so that&#39;s super cool. I really like this one for the whole neck spasms and anxiety thing alone. This will definitely be a repeat buy.

VThis indica-heavy hybrid smokes incredibly smooth, with a pleasantly sweet boquet of lemon-lime and a hint of fresh berries, they should call this one 7-up it&#39;s so bubbly and refreshing. It will knock you out but not before you treat yourself to the finest munchies. Trouble sleeping or getting rest? Get a hold of this.

VI got an immediate head high as a rush for like 10 seconds that smoothed out into a nice, lasting, mellow, best of both worlds high. The munchies set in fast but didn&#39;t seem to kill my high very much. All in all its a good strain that helps relax the body as well as stimulate the mind. The smell is very pungent and diesely and the taste was pungent and also slightly fruity. Very good growing and curing.
