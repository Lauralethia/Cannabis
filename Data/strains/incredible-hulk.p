VVery tasty, high energy strain. Perfect morning smoke to get your day started and the creative juices flowing, but smoke any more than a bowl and it hits you like a train with an incredibly strong cerebral high. Oh and have some snacks ready because this shit is guaranteed to give you some extreme munchies.

VJust got a taste and feel for this bud and it&#39;s definitely up there on my sativa list, if you want to just chill and think about life or watch Netflix you can, if you feel like you need to get something done This strain actually makes you get off your ass and do it. I came home thinking I was going to get home and be couch locked and forget, instead this strain actually convinced me to get up and do my errands I owe the rest of my excellent day off to you Incredible Hulk

VOn cloud nine and didn&#39;t even finish the bowl. I&#39;ve cut down my usage from being stoned 24/7 to a couple bowls a day. Weed is weed, and high is high, but when you&#39;ve grown a tolerance the high it becomes more comfortable than exciting. This weed takes me on different roller-coaster rides each time I smoke it.  Right now my mind is thinking about a thousand different things at once, yet it&#39;s not overwhelming or stressful. I&#39;m distant, yet focused. My stress, anxiety, and sadness are all gone. I&#39;m suddenly hopeful and motivated. \u000a\u000aThe smell is pungent and wonderful. If I close my eyes and smell it I think of a rain forest shrouded in tall pine trees. In the distance is a shallow river surrounded with rocks enveloped in moss.\u000a\u000aThe taste is fantastic in my pipe. Very earthy and bold, but smooth. I bet this would be amazing in a nice bong.\u000a\u000aDry mouth is only really evident when talking for a long period of time. \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re keeping yourself occupied the munchies are tamable. If you&#39;re being lazy you&#39;ll eat enough food for 3 people and still want to order a pizza. Not even because you&#39;re hungry, but because there&#39;s so many tasty flavors out there.

VThe buds I got l are a light green and not dense at all.  Very light feeling actually.   Quite a few orange hairs throughout with a  sweet almost skunky scent.\u000a\u000aThe vapour is of good consistency and is fairly smooth with maybe a little bite at the end.\u000a\u000aWhen my tolerance was higher this stuff did not work well.  After a 2 week break the effects are stronger but still on the light side.   I&#39;m a little disappointed because I&#39;m not uplifted or energized as I was by one of my favourite strains and parent to the Hulk, Jack Herer.\u000a\u000aIn the end I succeeded in getting baked but was left a little tired and uninspired;  a feeling i&#39;d rather not have during the day.   I will try this strain again but from a different batch as this couldn&#39;t have been the best representative of Incredible Hulks two awesome parents.

VMy main concern is at first how to convey the most accurate account of my consistent usage in regards to this great Sativa strain. \u000a\u000aBeing new to the world of cannabis includes newbie sensitivities, newbie tolerance, and to a measure, an uncertainty to describe experiences and account of what is happening to the body. \u000a\u000aBut as best I can say, I love this strain. Not accounting for the various differences amongst different individual&#39;s biochemistry, this individual experience: Clear headed high, a measure of focus, pleasant light euphoria ( as if the day is sunnier) \u000a\u000aDaytime usage is of preference, but is also perfect for  a night out on the town.

VThis strain is amazing. I get migraines and I&#39;ve tried a lot of different strains. I&#39;ve found a few that help prevent migraines, but this is the first one that actually got rid of a full blown one. \u000a\u000aIn addition, it was uplifting, happy, arousing, euphoric and creative. It was great. \u000a\u000aMy only complaint is that it is really hard to find. I wish I knew who created this and is growing it. None of the stores in town have it anymore. I would buy this strain all the time if I could. I wish I could get my hands on a clone. Lol.\u000a\u000aIf this strain is your creation, thank you.

VI bought an Incredible Hulk wax cartridge and this was by far the BEST decision I\u2019ve ever made. You feel so happy and uplifted and alert, and it helps a lot if you have problems socializing. It made me really talkative and it helped me finish my homework SO MUCH faster that I would have sober. It is perfect for focusing and learning new things; it\u2019s not the kind of weed that makes you feel dumb. Because of this, it is the perfect strain to help you get things done and stay productive and awake.
