VI went in to this place, not seeing any strains I had ever heard of before. So , I really wasn&#39;t expecting to pick a flower at all. but this Budtender was one fire about this strain. I just had to try it. WELL SHE WAS RIGHT!!!!! It tasted great and I went to sleep . so this strain has my stamp of approval like yaaaaa! big time. it was at the place on 99 by Taco Time. The chic was really helpful and funny.so asking getting medication and get a laugh at the same time it both medicine laughing is great healing for soul. but anyways thank you. You know ho you are.

VHappy, clearheaded, feel good high. Very balanced classic 50/50 hybrid feeling. Relaxed, but with a jolt of cerebral euphoria. Be careful not to smoke this if you have a headache, because it can either cause one or make it worse. Great sweet, earthy, pine smell and taste.

VGreat strain. Looks nice and isn&#39;t too loud. Smoke is smooth and the taste is very pine and earthy. Good high. Definitely felt pretty tired after about an hour. Didn&#39;t even need the whole bowl.

VGreat  Hybrid! A very happy, creeper relaxation for sure! Sweet and Earthy, and sticky to the touch. Breaks up with a good return with a lemon pine exhale. Sneaks up with a intense stone that eases into a relaxed, yet busy and alert, fun time! Will turn up that appetite a notch as well, another rare find that I will definitely purchase again!
