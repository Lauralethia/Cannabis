VSTARFIGHTER is my favorite medicine.  This strain packs a powerful punch that zaps anxiety and depression.  Very happy and uplifting strain.

VThis is one of my favorite strains to smoke. \u000a\u000aWhen I first bought an oz of this for me and a buddy of mine, we decided to &quot;sample&quot; the whole oz just for the fun of it. This strain gives a smooth lift, never feeling too overbearing but is most definitely still just as wonderful.\u000a\u000aHad a beautiful taste and a nice, strong smell to it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very smooth experience.

VA great smoke for 420. This one hits hard in both mind and body. That&#39;s what I liked about this one. You can easily move about or just as easily couch locked. It let&#39;s you decide what type of experience you will have. Very friendly and talkative but also conscience expanding and relaxing all at the same time. I&#39;m quite satisfied with SF.

VI like this strain a lot. It&#39;s quite potent and works great for pain and anxiety (my strain tested at 22.2% THC). Great relaxer after a stressful week. One of the things I like about it is It doesn&#39;t get me couch locked. I can still stay fairly focused and get things done.

VI smoked barely a bowl last night in my car, and you best believe my ass was tripping. I didn&#39;t think I was that high at first because it takes a moment to really hit you. I walked out of the car into the lobby of my hotel and I was dead sure I looked high af. As soon as I laid onto the bed, my mind started to open or something, It&#39;s definitely an intense body/head high, I could feel every beat of my music, and I stared at the wall for 15 minutes trying to decipher if it was moving. Definitely one of the better strains :)

VI love this strain.  I am vaping the Hummingbird cannabis nectar from The Farm.  It&#39;s delicious and really makes music sound and feel so much better.  I&#39;m totally in love.  I&#39;ve been high af but still productive, just made a complicated meal and cleaned up my mess and then sat down to write this review.  I felt a little giddy earlier.  So good.  Very satisfied with my purchase. &lt;3
