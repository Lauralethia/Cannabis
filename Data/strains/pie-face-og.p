VThis is one of the best strains that I have ran into in awhile. A combo of cherry pie and faceoff o.g. This powerful hybrid has notes of peanut, strawberry, cherry, and a slight kush taste. The buds are so beautiful and the smell alone will make you love this strain. Prefect for day or night, so all around great strain that makes you very social while also giving you a great relaxing body buzz. Highly highly recommended.

VI purchased Pie Face OG at Phoenix relief and I gotta say that this is the best strain that I ever have! It\u2019s potency is amazing! The smell is like a breath of fresh air! A couple hits and you start feeling right! It gives rid of anxiety and gives you the confidence to want to socialize. I became very playful with the kids. The future mrs and I were just laughing like a couple of hyenas and having a good time. You feel no worries! The music be jammin! This is definitely recommended for anti depressant. It\u2019s a mellow high and you can smoke anytime of the day. If you have trouble eating this will give you an appetite as well. Once that food digest you can KO or just feel relaxed and get productive, it\u2019s your choice. Stay Blessed!\u000a

VVery very smooth smoke!  Smells extremely good with a citrusy diesel nose.  Effects snuck up on me after 10-15 mins... nothing really cerebral, just a warm mental blanket alleviating anxiety and some decent body warmth and high.  This was post 2 med sized bowls thru a large bubbler[note: i would never consider myself having a good tollerance and am a light weight who typically likes cbd strains or heavier indicas].  I will certainly keep some of this on hand as i think itd be great for family get togethers where i normally get anxiety or going into large crowds.
