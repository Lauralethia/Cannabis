VThis strain a good my buddy rolled me up. so I can&#39;t speak on how the buds look. The feel is great I was happy and relaxed. You don&#39;t get the couch potato feeling. Best used to make everyday activities more enjoyable

VNice strong skunky smell when nugs are broken down by hand, I got a batch with small dense nugs that were great for packing bowls. Indica highs can be expected from this strain, putting you into a deep relaxation after a dose.

VA lot like blue dream without the dank haziness... Strong blueberry flavor with a danky fuely afghani undertone. Dense resin covered nugs, the buds are really beautiful. It&#39;s like blue dream in some sense, an indica blue dream with a fuely danky underside. While it is good smoke, I prefer blue dream over this.

VThis wasn&#39;t a favorite of mine.  It makes my husband and I feel &quot;hung over&quot; the next morning.  Nothing some coffee won&#39;t fix, but it&#39;s hard to get up in the morning when you feel super lethargic despite getting a full 8 hrs of sleep.  I haven&#39;t encountered another strain (yet) that&#39;s done that to us.

VVery mild skunk but sweet aroma. Very sweet taste but a small spice note. Nice comfortable body high. Very relax but very alert. This strain is not very potent in thc or the CBD is real high and balances out the thc because I just can&#39;t seem to get very high on this. Smoked bowl after bowl last night and never got more that a mild buzz. This also left me unable to get to sleep as I was to alert and wired. This strain also does not give much of the munchies.

VI always called it Blueberry Afghani, a few other people I know do to also a few songs about it. I smoked this a few times and this is a super relaxing indica. You tend to find it harder to speak depending on your intake and tolerance, but that is really the only con to this strain. I like this strain because of its taste and it really treats you well in the long run, does really good for pain also. If you have an opportunity to try this you simply must.

VBright green tight nugs with sprawling orange hairs. Smells like berries, hops, and wood. Tastes big on the berry and hash. Smooth and minimal lung expansion but has a creep that expands more after a few breaths. Feels very relaxed, slightly happy immediately. After awhile sedation and hunger kick in. Very good strain. I would get again. Recommend for late nights kicking back.
