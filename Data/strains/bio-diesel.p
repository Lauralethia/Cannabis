VFirst chance I&#39;ve had to try Biodiesel &amp; I&#39;m floating&#129303; ~ my go to for pain is usually Grandaddy Purp but this strain is excellent for pain relief &amp; it doesn&#39;t cause couch lock so I can toke on it all day &amp; never feel tired.   Beautiful dense nugs &amp; quite tasty too..I highly recommend it if you have a chance to try it - DO! &#128579;\u270c&#127995;\ufe0f&#128153;

VThis strain looks beautiful and sparkly and the effects are very pronounced, with pressure behind my eyes, a sure sense of focus without any couch-lock.  I should say that if I wanted to, I could either clean my house or take a nap.  The smoke itself is expansive but smooth with no harshness or overwhelming diesel taste.  I felt a definite tingly warmth starting with my face.  This would be a really good strain to share with a partner if you know what I mean. With Sensi Star, NYC Diesel, Diesel, and Sour D making up this wonderful flower, it has to be good and it is bomb!\u000a\u000aI acquired this from CNE Collective in Bakersfield, CA

VPungent with a pleasant taste. I love hybrids and this is a great one. The head high hits you first then it trickles all the way to your toes. Good shit. 5/5 because it\u2019s exactly what I look for in a hybrid. It\u2019s strong without a nasty taste but it\u2019s not the usual fruity comparison. I\u2019m just getting over the flu so this is a great pick me up.

VPicked up this Bio-Diesel from Euflora off 16st in Colorado downtown. Bit high so bare with me. First hit, 5secs and u are sucked into some deep deep euphoria. I mention deep, it&#39;s a relaxing but uplifting and energetic type of deep euphoria. That Delicious Diesel taste was the first taste I got from this strain. Back pain is no where to be found, head tension and stress is all replaced by a deep temple massaging affect. I have energy and am definitely ready for work today. Want more of this whenever it comes my way!

VVisual Inspection:\u000a\u000aHearty flowers with a pleasant mixture of light and dark colored greenery, streams of vanilla-colored trichromes, and elegant, peaceful, and softly orange pistils. The buds form together roundly, resembling a tree that your uncle would use in his miniature landscape projects.\u000a\u000a\u000aTaste and Smell:\u000a\u000aIt has a beautiful citrus\u2013earth smell of greenery, and IS NOT a member of the Harshness Family of Smokables. Each inhale is like taking a bite out of the Georgia woods in July at 4 p.m. after the rain.\u000a\u000a\u000aEffect:\u000a\u000aLucidity alternates with zoning-out. If I were to rename this strain like it was band name, I&#39;d call it Jenny and the Avalanche, and they would cover Waylon Jennings and Stevie Wonder songs.

VA hit and u r lit.  Been around for a long time and finally got a little. I need more than a little now! Feel: Heavy hitting head high and even a body high (energetic not lethargic).  Nice euphoria and uplifting feel; colors or lights are more vibrant or that kind of affect. Great high, bottom line.. Taste: Diesel and lemony. A little zesty and piney.  Smell: old school Chronic, piney/diesely.

VI would rate this a 4.5, not a 4, but it does not allow halves in the star part of this review.\u000aI would say its a 5 if maybe the THC content was a little higher  but it was speckled throughout with crystals and all the nugs were shaped like little christmas trees and I love it when that happens. Piny and foresty aroma to the nose. When I hit it with my little turoquoise bubbler in the dying afternoon sun outside my patio,, it felt very boosting to the senses and fast to the head, like a window was opened but in my mind instead of my room. It felt like I was engulfed by rays of euphoria from the inside of my heart out and the motivation ambitious spirit of it reminds me of Green Crack but this strain is more cerebreal and euphoric. It suprises me this strain is so uplifting yet focusing and motivating, effortless in doing so with just a couple puffs.

My mood was elevated and I enjoyed my time with my friends, but I never got too high to socialize as I do with many other stains.\u000a2* Body, 3* Mind, 2.5* Potency (Out of 5*)

VI vape Bio-Diesel concentrate using a vape pen, and it&#39;s fantastic. Not only does it provide all of the benefits listed above, but it seems to me that I have less pain and increased confidence and alertness even when I haven&#39;t vaped yet that day. Since I always wait to vape until all of my work and errands are done each day, what I experience as a &quot;hold-over effect&quot; is highly beneficial. It IS strong. One hefty vape sets me for two or three hours, minimum. Thanks to Kyle at Thrive on Cheyenne for recommending it to me.

VBio-Diesel has the potential to be amazing but I have found many batches that left me wanting and ultimately smoking more than usual and that&#39;s what takes the stars away.\u000a\u000aI use cannabis primarily for Major Depressive Disorder, Acute Anxiety Disorder, Extreme Daily Nausea and IBS. Bio-Diesel will cover those symptoms but I blasted through most of the bags I&#39;ve gotten of it. It often requires me to smoke two bowls before my nausea goes away. \u000a*NOTE* I have had a couple batches where I only needed to smoke one bowl but this has been more the exception than the rule.\u000a\u000aBio-Diesel has a diesel (obviously), citrusy flavor that is quite pleasant. The aroma matches. \u000a\u000aI also noticed that it dries out rather quickly most of the time.

VWow! Talk about intense! BioDiesel is definitely my favorite strain... at least out of the ones that I have tried so far ;) With an intense cerebral effect, BioDiesel is all smiles. Taking away your pain and anxiety, and leaving you feeling relaxed and happy, use BioDiesel to unwind at the end of a particularly long day. A strong earthy and diesel taste with a hint of lemon, this strain is by far one of the best Diesel strains out there. Please be aware however, that BioDiesel is probably not best for beginners! With a strong THC percentage (mine was 27 %), BioDiesel is definitely for more seasoned smokers. Just be sure to keep some water nearby, because cottonmouth can get pretty strong with this strain, and maybe keep a snack nearby in case too! This is definitely an end of day smoke, but a very strong, happy, and relaxing one!

VVery strong diverse smells. Fruity, tropical, diesel with an underlying skunk smell. It\u2019s honestly very hard to pinpoint a specific scent, as it is one of those strains that just overpowers the senses.\u000a\u000aAnd when you smoke it, it leaves you with that same taste in your mouth. It is very pleasant. Especially when vaporized. \u000a\u000aAfter I medicated I noticed a very heavy sensation in my eyes and head. Like a slight pressure in my forehead area. I then had all my stresses that built up over the day fade away. It\u2019s a great medication for night time use. And for individuals suffering from anxiety, depression and pain. (Which is what I medicate for)... it also made me EXTREMELY hungry so if you medicate to increase your appetite this one is for you.\u000a\u000aOverall it had no negative side effects. I\u2019m prone to getting anxiety if I smoke certain strains and I had none of that happen to me with this strain. Also cotton mouth and dry eyes were minimal which was nice. \u000a\u000aOverall I am very impressed. It\u2019s not the best strain. But it is a strain I would recommend to others and a strain I would use to medicate with again. \u000a\u000a4 out of 5 stars for me!

VI vape Bio-Diesel concentrate using a vape pen, and it&#39;s fantastic. Not only does it provide all of the benefits listed above, but it seems to me that I have less pain and increased confidence and alertness even when I haven&#39;t vaped yet that day. Since I always wait to vape until all of my work and errands are done each day, what I experience as a &quot;hold-over effect&quot; is highly beneficial. It IS strong. One hefty vape sets me for two or three hours, minimum. Thanks to Kyle at Thrive on Cheyenne for recommending it to me.

VBio-Diesel has the potential to be amazing but I have found many batches that left me wanting and ultimately smoking more than usual and that&#39;s what takes the stars away.\u000a\u000aI use cannabis primarily for Major Depressive Disorder, Acute Anxiety Disorder, Extreme Daily Nausea and IBS. Bio-Diesel will cover those symptoms but I blasted through most of the bags I&#39;ve gotten of it. It often requires me to smoke two bowls before my nausea goes away. \u000a*NOTE* I have had a couple batches where I only needed to smoke one bowl but this has been more the exception than the rule.\u000a\u000aBio-Diesel has a diesel (obviously), citrusy flavor that is quite pleasant. The aroma matches. \u000a\u000aI also noticed that it dries out rather quickly most of the time.

VThe boys over @ Denver Relief really know what they&#39;re doing. Another fantastic strain!! Not super dank smelling like SD can usually be, the smoke out of a RAW J is fantastic, I was able to all my usual smoke tricks (Ghost/French inhales). The tenderness and bud structure was my favorite part of this strain, it&#39;s just so beautiful to look at. Amazing hues of light/med green and a little bit of dark brown hair running throughout with a good coating of tricomes as well! The high is amazing, I&#39;m very focused and able to complete all my tasks.
