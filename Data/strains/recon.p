VRecon was a pleasure for me to vaporize. It is quite the indica hybrid strain with great flavors to accompany its intense array of healing feelings. After vaporizing this strain I felt tingling from head to toe with waves of cresting euphoria coming over my body and mind. My stress from the day melted away and my physical fatigue was quelled after a long work day and workout. It is great for pain relief without making you too tired. \u000a   Recon is a fun strain that would be good for movie going, fine dining, or at the breaking point for a hike. Pairing it with caffeine, black tea in my case, is great for keeping that energy up and giving the high a very focused feeling.

VDelicious blend with a bit more Indica than I really needed. The high was ok at first with about a half a hit, started to calm, but then I got a wicked head high that lingered and got stronger. It is definitely a good strain for someone who is already super sleepy but needs an extra push.\u000a\u000aI usually prefer a 50/50 hybrid blend as it doesn&#39;t give me a buzzing head high that turns into a headache or added anxiety, which this strain definitely did. If I do smoke this in the future, I will definitely look at mixing it with a nice, smooth sativa with a decent CBD level.

VThis is some potent stuff! The particular batch I have tested at over 30% THC. Very relaxing, happy, and euphoric, definitely has some uplifting qualities for being mostly indica. The buds are super dense and break up into surprisingly large amounts. This strain doesn&#39;t offer much when it comes to taste, but completely makes up for it with strength that goes right to your head! Great weed!

VSo great for sleep. The unfortunate slight (luckily only the first few times) did it cause the slightest bit of anxiety, but that passes quickly. But put you out like a light within 20 minutes.

VI picked up some recon at the recommendation from my local medical dispensary. I have severe nerve damage and chronic pain that reduces my amount of sleep to 3-4 hours spread throughout the day. With Recon before bed, I sleep a solid 5 hours. For me, after all this time, finally getting sleep... I woke up and cried. It has been a blessing. \u000a\u000aIt is a lot of THC, and I got really high. I don&#39;t particularly like to be high. I smoke recreationally, on occasion, with friends or family. But day to day I need stuff that works. I was able to sleep but felt debilitated by how high I was. \u000a\u000aThe smell of the bud was amazing and sweet, and it tastes smooth and flavorful when smoked. I plan on making hard candies from an oil made from this strain so that I can sleep better regularly. I&#39;m hoping that as an edible, I can sleep longer. Also, I&#39;m hoping to control the dose pretty small.

VTakes the pain away and doesn&#39;t out you to sleep. Absolutely wonderful for a person on chronic pain who doesn&#39;t like being comatose.

VAwesome indica strain. Tastes amazing and the 30% thc makes it hit hard instantly and make you slump down fast. You can still function okay on it but definitely a good bud for just chillaxing.  8/10

VHands down one of the most irritating strains I have ever smoked. Honestly not going to waste much time on this one but to just lay it out. This achieved only 1 award for me, no this isn&#39;t a good one, and it&#39;s the most mellow smoke I have ever had in my life so mellow it irritates you. I never felt like I was getting anything, BUT this is where that changes. Give it 15min to settle in and it will give you a very nice head high one which I would consider far from mellow, but at the same time carried no relief for physical conditions just emotional and had no body high. So take this for what it&#39;s worth; Flavor - earthy, woody, maybe a citrus note but really not much there. Looks - red hairs and covered in trichomes you wouldn&#39;t expect it to be a mellow smoke. To clear up the mellow reviews once and for all. Mellow = flavor/smoke on inhale/no body high/no physical relief. Not mellow on the head high. This is more a sativa.
