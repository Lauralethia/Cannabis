VI haven&#39;t tried the Bubble Gum strain in herb form in a while, but I recently picked up some Bubble Gum hash (kief puck) from Relief Choices of Warren.\u000a\u000aThe high is a definite creeper, coming on a good 10 minutes or so after smoking. Definite hybrid high from this one. Very cerebral and euphoric, but not energetic or very uplifting. Some good body buzz and back pain relief, but not completely lethargic.  Very scatterbrained feel to it, I&#39;m having trouble staying on track writing this review. It also makes me a little dizzy at times when it&#39;s climbing up to its plateau.\u000a\u000aThe high lasts a good time, and the come down isn&#39;t terrible but will leave you slightly groggy and wanting a sativa pick-me-up (I did at least).\u000a\u000aNot my first choice for a morning smoke, but good for a lazy afternoon if you plan on relaxing and not doing anything too intense but don&#39;t want to completely pass out on the couch for hours. If that makes sense.\u000a\u000aI think I hear breakfast calling!

VOne of my favorite strains I&#39;ve tried yet! I suffer from severe depression, anxiety, and ptsd. This strain puts a smile on my face no matter what is going down. I spent my lunch break laying in the grass and staring at the clouds since it was as nice out as I felt. The nugs are fluffy, but not very dense so I always expect more weed than I get, but I don&#39;t need as much to get high off this as I usually do. The strain is very sweet and had be using my hemp to light it rather than butane so I could enjoy the taste more. \u2661\u000aI haven&#39;t felt this happy in over a year so thank you Bubble Gum! I highly recommend this strain for anyone that struggles with mental illness or just general anxiety/stress. &#129303;

VSome buzz.  Stiffness and lower pain in back now very tolerable.  No good for sharp pain or spasms.  After long day of tolerating pain, provides a morale boost at end with out eating out the kitchen.  Would recommend to those watching diet, in pain and still wanting to be lucid.

Vthis bubble gum i attained from nirvana wellness center in san jose ca. this is the best bubblegum in my opinion i have smoked in my 30 years  and  just great medicine all around . the buds where beautiful  organic flowers  with a skunky smell  very light green with a nice tint of white  and many red hairs . whoever grew this knew what they were doing. i chose to smoke this in the morning  i hate psych meds  and i had been off them for a couple months  so what better  way to start your morning !!!! than with organically grown  flowers  . the smell was pungent  the taste was sweet and the high was like i got smacked with a log  but not so much that i couldnt function  very very nice  relaxing high I DO NOT SUGGEST WORK THOUGH .  i suggest  finding a couch  a nice book and a cup of coffee.  this completely freed me up from  any symptoms of the various diagnosis i have especially pain and anxiety. i highly suggest this for people with pain  and people with anxiety disorders   people with depression the list could go on ....  i might add at some point in smoking this i did get a mild candy taste  but definately  one of  my favs

VThis strain was interesting to say the least. The bud was some of the prettiest Ive seen, and I found myself just examining each nug for a good ten minutes. After a bunt, I was hit with a VERY powerful high that wasted no time taking full effect. One minute I was sitting at my computer desk lighting up the blunt, and next minute I was seeing stars. Literal stars. This was both great and terribly jarring at the same time, and a friend of mine claims this aspect of the strain caused her to have a massive panic attack, so this should come with a warning. I never really experience panic attacks, so I was fine once I gained my bearings. I dont know for sure if its the stain or the batch, but it was so incredibly potent it was almost a bad thing. After this experince and the story from my friend, I would not reccomend this strain to anyone who does not enjoy those incredibly intense highs.

VThis could be one of my favorite strains! The taste is just like it sounds, a sweet berry flavor, much like a bubblegum, and with a strong distinct smell. I would agree with others and say that Bubble Gum really makes you creative, uplifting and active, and makes you wanna do stuff. But it also has its indica side, and gives the user a nice body relaxation, without making him/her too tired and lazy. Bubble Gum would be the perfect weed to bring if you are going on a hike with your friends or something where you wanna be high but not become to lazy and tired. I made some firecrackers edibles from this strain and I can really recommend that as well!

VTried Bubble Gum in pre-roll form last night at about 9:30pm and I just have to say WOW! I should tell you that this is only my 2nd experience with marijuana.  My 1st was 5 weeks ago with a Cookies pre-roll and although it was an amazing experience, it was also my first time and I didn&#39;t have any idea of what to expect.  With Bubble Gum, I just laid back in my chair and went along for the ride. It hit really hard and often.  I was listening to uplifting female vocal trance outside under a full moon.  As the tones in the music changed so did the effects of the strain.  It was a constant roller coaster of feelings and emotions, from a heavy but pleasant and tingly all over body high to an extremely euphoric and uplifting head high which went on continuously for what seemed like hours.  I eventually found myself listening to 80&#39;s music, U2, Mr. Mister and Men at Work to name a few (ah, the memories!) . On a side note, I&#39;m almost positive I saw 1 or 2 ghosts floating around my yard and heard a voice say my name as well but was by no means freaked out by this.  I just sat there and thought to myself how cool is that!  I definitely felt the creativity aspect that this strain offers because I was able to stroll around the yard under the moonlight and design a new patio all in my mind.  Even my neighbors usually annoying AC unit sounded pleasant.  I didn&#39;t get the munchies with this strain either.  I only ate 3 chocolate filled Oreos after smoking.  Eventually, sometime shortly after 3am, I made it into the house and into bed and slept fairly well.  I woke up at around 9am feeling completely refreshed.  I&#39;ll definitely purchase this strain again.

V3 1/2 stars for this strain, but voted up because it seems to always be around and not expensive. The taste and smell very similar to namesake with a sweet pink bubblegum flavor. The flavor does not maintain after a few tokes, but the indica effect does maintain consistency every time as does the flowers simple appearance. Small to medium buds that smoke well and do not come on heavy so is perfect for folks who prefer a lighter buzz that will creep into sleep within the hour. For a regular user of cannabis this strain is great for social use especially anxiety, slight pain relief, or just giggly moments with friends making happy memories.

VHaven&#39;t tried the real flower (can&#39;t find it anywhere near me) but I was able to have it as a solventless extract. People are not kidding, it smells and tastes like real bubble gum. Those totally unique bubble gum terpenes will give you smarts indeed, it felt like Princess Bubblegum became a weed chemist and made it just for me. It wakes me up and leaves me pretty sharp; not something you want to try to unwind or go to sleep with. Bubble Gum is not to be confused with Bubble Gum Kush, which does have significant sedative effects. I feel like some people saying it feels like an indica makes this mistake. Real Bubble Gum, in my experience, is 100% a sativa.

VJust an overall awesome, feel-good high. This is the second strain I&#39;ve ever tried, the first being God&#39;s Gift. This definitely doesn&#39;t knock me out quite like God&#39;s Gift does (predictably so, as that&#39;s an Indica and this is a Sativa-dominant hybrid). A great day smoke with the happy and chill-yet-alert feeling it brings. It also hits VERY smooth, and smells and tastes faintly sweet.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m feeling the effects a bit heavy after two bowls (mind you I am a brand-new cannabis user); not like I wanna nap, but like I could just sit on the couch for hours floating off into space and think up all kinds of crazy stories, songs, etc. I actually was magically inspired by this strain to create a look for my character in a video game that I was having a difficult time deciding on, and, not surprisingly, it came out in &quot;bubble gum&quot; colors (pink and blue), LOL!\u000a\u000aThere&#39;s no way I could possibly be depressed on this strain. It&#39;s just too happy and uplifting. It brings a TON of creative and pleasant thoughts, not to mention that this strain hits, tastes, and smells equally as pleasant while smoking it. Would absolutely recommend while watching something funny, or when you need inspiration to write/draw/otherwise create something, or while playing a video game, or while reading a good (preferably epic fantasy) book... It&#39;s the PERFECT daytime/weekend strain!\u000a\u000aThis isn&#39;t to mention too that it knocked out my back pain due to chronic muscle spasms pretty fast; part of the reason I actually smoked two bowls this sesh instead of my usual one is my back has been quite sore this week, especially so after a rough work week. I&#39;m happy, inspired, and pain-free: what&#39;s better than that?

VLooks: Medium-Dark green with red/maroon hue to the buds.\u000a\u000aSmell: Sweet and fruity.\u000a\u000aTaste: Similar to the smell \u2013 reminded me of unflavored \u201cHubba Bubba\u201d or \u201cBubble Yum\u201d gum.\u000a\u000aBuzz Type: The buzz was a nice floaty cerebral buzz.  Not much of the indica coming through \u2013 just a mellow trippy feel in your head.\u000a\u000aBuzz Length: Medium \u2013 the buzz lasted for around 1.5 hours.\u000a\u000aOverall: This is a nice, sweet tasting bud with a trippy cerebral buzz.  Just a few bong hits left me pretty mellow, which must have been the indica part of the hybrid, but not really couch locked.  The flavor really comes out in a joint or vaporizor even more than a bong, but it\u2019s unmistakable regardless of the delivery method.\u000a

VGot this in Las Vegas, NV. It is one of my new favorite strains. The group is Cannabiotix. The buds are long and sticky. It shimmers in the light, sweet perfection. If your a weed head looking for great flavor, this strain is for you. I have medical issues and am always looking at the terpenes, the Myrcene is high, which leads to better absorption on our part. When you first stick your nose deep in the jar and inhale, it smells like big league chewing gum or bazooka gum. I have a high tolerance, so for me if I smoke a little, I feel euphoric and relaxed, good for stress. If I smoke more, let&#39;s say like a joint, get slight munches, great pain reliever; for muscles, joint, cramping, tension and calms your nervous system down. You can get couch lock if you smoke too much. This is also a great strain for insomnia problems or if you have restless leg issues. I give it five stars,this weed helps the entire body, lowers stress levels, pain reliever etc, taste is perfection, and a little goes a long way. Enjoy!

It is a really nice evening high, completely mellow and slightly uplifting.  Cheers.  Enjoy!!

Other than that it smells and tastes pretty sweet but I don\u2019t really taste the bubble gum until a few hits in. 9/10 would smoke again

VThis is a creeper for sure. I  smoked it out of a Granny Smith apple not because I wanted to but because I had to. Anyways...I initially received a short-lived blast of sativa energy and then it died down pretty fast into an incredibly mellow, tingly and clear headed high. It legit smells like bubblegum and hints of citrus. I think this might be my new favorite hybrid!

His friend on the other hand seemed to act mad dumb in a dreamy state. very potent smell btw. after they smoked me out, i went to lay down on the couch n my cat came around me n laid down with me. I felt sooo much in union with everything, like.. one with the fuckin universe. My mind kept racing tho, i almost felt i was gonna astral project from my body!

VBubblegum is solidly in my top 3 best strains I&#39;ve ever smoked and sometimes is THE best strain. It tastes and smells exactly like pink bubble gum. I&#39;m thinking a piece of Double Bubble is what you&#39;ll recognize. The yield was disappointingly low but had a quick flower between 30 - 35 days. Very quick cure. Trichomes are enormous and super sticky. One of the most, if not the most, potent strains I&#39;ve ever smoked and everyone I know who tried mine said it was the most potent/best pot they&#39;ve ever had.

VI usually have pretty bad anxiety from weed, so a budtender in amsterdam (best friends coffeshop oost) recommended this strain for me. Tried in in low doses at first and it gave me nothing but pure calmness, relaxation, focus and just happiness from the inside. Body starts to feel a lil heavy and its perfect right before a nap. Really liked this strain, super chilled

VGreat strain. Very sativa based so the high was great. I smoked a few grams over an afternoon. After the first bowl or two I felt really motivated and uplifted. I felt just overall in a good mood. 6 bowls in the high changed a bit and the motivation sort of left me but I started to feel just very happy and even sort of near tripping at one point. \u000a\u000aIf you had a bad day or just really wanna chill out this a great strain. It really depends on how much you smoke though, the more you smoke the happier you get, but you lose some motivation.

VOne of my top 4 sativas domimant hybrids and top 10 desert island grows. This stands with Acapulco and Cactus OG as one of the best smelling strains. This true classic really does smell and taste remarkably like bubblegum.\u000a\u000aAs noted, this strain took years and traveled from the Midwest to New England to Amsterdam to finally perfect. This stands with Acapulco Gold as one of my favorite morning smokes. \u000a\u000aBubblegum is never overwhelmingly potent, but the moderate euphoria will make everything a little sunnier. This is a mostly Sativa strain that won&#39;t make you anxious or paranoid. Perfect to wake and bake on a functional day, second only to Acapulco and Cherry Pie IMO.

VWonderful strain for those suffering from Chronic Pain and Anxiety disorders like myself! Best used during the mornings and afternoons when medicating; nighttime is fine too although it may disrupt your ability to sleep.\u000aVery Euphoric! Relatively clean high. This is one strain I would definitely recommend to patients who suffer from chronic pain and anxiety as I do! \u000a\u000aInstead of Xanax, keep a small joint of it on you, if you are allowed to. Should you find yourself having bad anxiety or are having a panic attack, sit back, spark that bubble gum up, take one hit, hold your nreath for a moment, count to ten, and the gripping anxiety will begin to ease....at least for me it does lol\u000a\u000aNot an overwhelmingling strong high either. It is, as I said before, highly euphoric and great for pain and anxiety. Bubblegum is a strain that will definitely remain in my repitour. If you get panic attacks like I do too, this is a good strain to have on hand!\u000a\u000a4 out of 5 for me!\u000a\u000a

VBubble Gum Splash from Revolution is a great oil cartridge. It has great air flow and excellent saturation. Pulling big puffs are easy, and the cloud of vapor that is exhaled is big and satisfying. The oil is labeled as Purple Gouda distillate.  It is sweet candy flavors and the exhaled vapor has very little odor. It provides fast relaxation for body aches, and it also helps to calm overactive thoughts. I use this oil before bed to help me fall asleep without getting caught up in over-thinking.

VDiese Sorte verf&#252;gt &#252;ber einen intensiven fruchtig-zitronigen Cannabis Geruch, welcher nach dem Chrunchen verst&#228;rkt duftet. \u000a\u000a&quot;Bubble Gum&quot; ist eine tolle Sorte, die einen schon nach den ersten paar Z&#252;gen flasht. Man sie optimal zum Chillen am Abend mit seinen Freunden und aber auch vor dem Schlafen rauchen. Dennoch ist diese Hybrid-Sorte perfekt f&#252;r den Alltag geeignet. Denn &quot;Bubble Gum&quot; macht einen nicht dumm im Kopf oder koordinationslos, sondern sehr tiefenentspannt und fokussiert auf die Dinge die man sich vorgenommen hat.\u000a\u000aAlles im Allen ist &quot;Bubble Gum&quot; eine gute Wahl f&#252;r Tag und Nacht.

During the growth stages it presents a very sweet aroma that continues to hold its scent from the plant to the bowl. I recommend this strain for those nicer, sunny days in the spring. When smoked correctly, this produces a nice smoke that is not to heavy but will surely get you off the ground. A great growing plant for anyone ranging from beginner to pro.

VBubble gum bubble gum in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? \u000a\u000aAs much as I can possibly afford! \u000a\u000aI picked up a half O of bubble gum this past week and wow, this is good stuff! \u000a\u000aIn the jar: nice dense nugs that have a mild smell that is nice... not quite what I would call a bubblegum scent but it\u2019s nice .\u000a\u000aIn the grinder: grind is nice and easy yielding nice fluffy material that now smells a bit stronger.\u000a\u000aIn the vape: I used the firefly 2 vape set at 370 degrees. The taste on exhale is awesome! I still wouldn\u2019t call it a bubblegum taste but it is very pleasing.\u000a\u000aThe high: Early stage is very much in the head, then the body buzz kicks in a few minutes later. Video games, and music are fantastic. After about an hour the sativa effects start to die down and you are left with a nice body buzz that will make going to sleep quite easy if you don\u2019t stay active. \u000a\u000aOverall a very nice strain that smells and tastes great, has a nice balanced high, and will send you off in deep comfortable sleep when it\u2019s over. I will definitely buy this again and keep it around for a late evening session about an hour or two before bed.

VFirst time getting my hand on bubble gum and I&#39;m not thrilled with it.  Smell is not too pungent but unique, fruity and flowery.  Does taste quite a bit like a fresh piece of gum when smoked but the high left me a bit disappointed.  Buds look dense with a few orange hairs creeping out from the inside.  Nice covering of trichomes as well I&#39;m glad I got to try this strain, also glad I only purchased a gram.

VVisually it is very impressive. A real frosty look on medium sized buds which are pleasingly dense. It has a very pungent but unfamiliar aroma. A lot sharper than I&#39;m used to, with a little bit of a bite. Sorry, I can&#39;t think of any other way to describe it. The smoke is so very mellow and is inhaled easily. It&#39;s flavor is just as unique as it&#39;s smell to me. With the same sharpness with a little bite. Very unique. To me anyway. Now the high is... duh... what...oh yeah...I think...darn it! I forgot to remember. Now I can&#39;t remember to forget...which way does that go? Smiling unendingly. \u000aDo You Get it?\u000a\u000aAll in all I give &quot;Bubble Gum&quot; 4 out of 5 because I am not sure that unique aroma and flavor is actually a good thing. I&#39;ve frequently smoked much better tasting weed. In my opinion, anyway. But I gladly give it an A grade on virtually every other category. So I guess I can overlook the bizarre odor.

VI picked up a clear oil cartridge of the strain from Midwest compassion Center in Romeoville. I like it for an indica it&#39;s a good cerebral strain as well as body. I use this for muscle spasms mostly and to treat shoulder pain. exceeded my expectations I&#39;ve tried the flower version and the cartridge worked well if not better.

VBeing a fan of couch lock almost numbing strains, this one was quite a change for me. Definitely is not an everyday smoke for me. Quite an enjoyable high, starts of slow with the first bowl and when you go back for seconds it kicks in pretty quickly, making you think that you may not have needed the second one after all. I am currently studying a design based subject and this is definitely a good strain for idea generation both whilst medicated and during the after glow the next day. I would not recommend using as a late night smoke as it does wake you up, after my first few tries, also I started having this with coffee which definitely increases the positives experienced from this strain, however this may have affected my review, so please keep this in mind.

VWow. This stuff is fantastic much much different than the stuff I hit back in North Carolina years ago. I am testing all types of Indica to determine my favorite and rate on these review. So far this strain is my best. Not much to go on, yet. Only to compare to crap from the south and Hammerhead strain. I like this stain. I get focused and have in and outs of thinking but in I am still in control. Don&#39;t drive while on it. Good walking stuff to smoke. I give it a 4-star on my limited but growing knowledge of Washington legalized cannabis.

Vman, do I love it&#39;s taste. It truly brings in a great taste when smoking this, 5/5 in the taste department. However I noticed this strain hits me with the hammer a little too hard.

VI have had this strain several times before, but since I have gotten the bomb ass grower I have gotten, I have never seen anything like this.  The herb is beautifully fruity and just a bit skunky when squished and it will satisfy the finest palette.  I have had stonier weed but this one takes the cake for best ego whilst dealing with a long day stoned feeling.  Makes for a good night time buzz too when trying to medicate whatever but I would be careful before bed as it is a little wirey.  Anyhow see the pics but there is no wonder it has been bred into so many other bomb strains as it has that potential....

VBubble Gum Splash from Revolution is a great oil cartridge. It has great air flow and excellent saturation. Pulling big puffs are easy, and the cloud of vapor that is exhaled is big and satisfying. The oil is labeled as Purple Gouda distillate.  It is sweet candy flavors and the exhaled vapor has very little odor. It provides fast relaxation for body aches, and it also helps to calm overactive thoughts. I use this oil before bed to help me fall asleep without getting caught up in over-thinking.

VBubblegum is a really nice strain. I&#39;m surprised at how well it suits the name. Nugs are sticky and sweet and smell just like bubblegum. Smells so sweet with a little pine. After smoking a few bowls of master kush I decided to try the bubblegum. The buzz immediately woke me up and gave this noticable heady high. Colors also seemed to pop more. It also gave me a nice body high. Good for pain. One of my favourites.

VWas expecting a mid level smoke and was quite surprised. Smells of bubble gum original when ground or busted up. Taste runs along those same lines for about one or two hits in a vape. Overall great body relaxation and pain relief. Head high behind the eyes and hardcore in the temple. This strain has landed into one of my top hybrids and leans towards indica. It doesn&#39;t give you couch lock either making for great daytime use, but also has the ability to put you to sleep. If you enjoy Blue Dream then this is soon to be a favorite. Organic Soil Grown, vape 410&#176;.

VExtremely intense sativa. I\u2019m guessing this strain has extremely high THC-low CBD ratio, which has been known to cause a too-psychoactive effect without CBD to balance it out.

VDefinitely an interesting strain. If you smoke too much, you will feel couch locked and spacey but if you smoke just enough, you can do some seriously awesome creative work. As a photographer, if I smoke this with the intent to work, my art becomes more beautiful and natural. This strain definitely shuts down my perfectionism and turns on my &quot;vibe creativity.&quot; Would recommend for anyone looking for a spark of creativity, a more pleasurable musical experience or watching a movie. I mentioned couch lock earlier and that still stands out as a negative as this isn&#39;t a very drowsy strain. Do not take this to sleep or eat as I found neither urge was really strong. Nevertheless, this strain is extremely pleasant for a clear-headed, working high.

VVery psychedelic and giggly, it takes me on wild trips, particularly when listening to music. For friends with inner demons, this strain seemed quite scary, taking them to bad places, but with a guide it could be ok - not recommended for newbies in that sense. Creative feelings are definitely enhanced, and the munchies are bad but controllable. Very fun strain!

Vsmoked some bubblegum in a nice hot-box with a friend out of a pipe. lovely and smooth. time seemed to go through passages of going going by without you realising it and other periods where time seemed to drag on and on, far different from any other experience i&#39;ve had. its a nice transition into being high. nice and gradual not hitting u dead in your tracks. it does quickly turn into a fairly good body high though and I really struggled to get up again. the high is slightly sativa-like in the way that you are still able to keep focus and hold conversations, do homework ect. .

VIve never had a &quot;good&quot; treating bubblegum. tried from 3 different places but I don&#39;t get to enjoy the &quot;just like bubblegum&quot; smells or taste everyone raves about. that aside I&#39;ll point out that like other strains bubblegum is one of those that&#39;ll give you different effects varying on the dosage. through a joint or bubbler the taste is light sort of plasticy, and I feel it&#39;s a weak strain. light cerebral activity, and a soothing buzz. through gravity bong (which get you super baked anyway) bubblegum took on effects similar to fruity pebbles. almost psychotic, i felt very aware of my body. I took a bite from a crisp apple and felt the vibrations go from my teeth spread like waves down the rest of my body. however that didn&#39;t mean I enjoyed it. not enough euphoria or uplifting effect and was more of a dream state.

VGrew a few of these from clones, it grew much like the description said, slow in veg but grabbed traction in flower and produced some quality bud with a pretty good yield, it smells sweet, with floral notes but doesn&#39;t remind me of bubblegum IMO. The smoke though was the best part. This strain will leave you stupefied, and dumbfounded by the end of the bowl. Me and my buddy started calling it the bubbledumb because it literally broke our brains after we smoked a healthy size joint. Definitely a night time, end of your day strain, I&#39;ve read the other reviews saying this is one you can still function on but the bubblegum I grew will put you to bed.

VSo sweet in flavor. Definitely bubble gum flavor, very sativa dominant. Some berry, fruity flavor. Great for cooking and house work. Definitely some mid level munchies. Nice tight nugs when properly cured. \u000aGreat for arousal and creativity. Studied for an anatomy exam on this and aced it. Focused when you need it, but still great for recreation. A new favorite for sure.

VI&#39;m going to review this as what is called &quot;Bubbles&quot; in Holland. Because I can&#39;t find Bubbles in this site.\u000a\u000aHas a weird taste when smoked. Some people think it&#39;s nasty but others think it is tasty. Tastes a bit like bubblegum.\u000a\u000aGets rid of my depression real nice but it is easy to notice that you are high. Mostly because you get really talkative and energetic from it.\u000a\u000aI really like it.

VIve never had a &quot;good&quot; treating bubblegum. tried from 3 different places but I don&#39;t get to enjoy the &quot;just like bubblegum&quot; smells or taste everyone raves about. that aside I&#39;ll point out that like other strains bubblegum is one of those that&#39;ll give you different effects varying on the dosage. through a joint or bubbler the taste is light sort of plasticy, and I feel it&#39;s a weak strain. light cerebral activity, and a soothing buzz. through gravity bong (which get you super baked anyway) bubblegum took on effects similar to fruity pebbles. almost psychotic, i felt very aware of my body. I took a bite from a crisp apple and felt the vibrations go from my teeth spread like waves down the rest of my body. however that didn&#39;t mean I enjoyed it. not enough euphoria or uplifting effect and was more of a dream state.

So my guy rolls up with some D E N S E buds, so already I&#39;m smiling from ear to ear. After rolling these up and pufing away I notice something: yes, it tastes like weed, but at the same time it tastes like candy. After smoking I go my friend&#39;s house and we listen to jazz and eat snacks all night while drinking some beers, have never been more at peace in my life 9/10 would bubble this gum again

VSnatched up some of this live resin from Green Pharms in Flagstaff, AZ.  Real nice candy taste yet induces a harsh choke if you get crazy.  Brings on an immediate, heavy head high that works it&#39;s way throughout the body causing an innate, complete sense of total apathy.  A great medication for those that&#39;d like to &quot;check out&quot; for a bit.  Pop in a movie, crank some tunes or get on them video game sticks.

VDefinitely an interesting strain. If you smoke too much, you will feel couch locked and spacey but if you smoke just enough, you can do some seriously awesome creative work. As a photographer, if I smoke this with the intent to work, my art becomes more beautiful and natural. This strain definitely shuts down my perfectionism and turns on my &quot;vibe creativity.&quot; Would recommend for anyone looking for a spark of creativity, a more pleasurable musical experience or watching a movie. I mentioned couch lock earlier and that still stands out as a negative as this isn&#39;t a very drowsy strain. Do not take this to sleep or eat as I found neither urge was really strong. Nevertheless, this strain is extremely pleasant for a clear-headed, working high.

VI am very relaxed and happy. I&#39;ve been having a3 out of 10 day today, no energy, aches and pains like a mug. I usually head for the straight sativa on the rare occasion I feel like this but oh no, not anymore. This strain is the hot fire flame. Had the flower a few weeks ago and remember thinking damn, this flower got me feeling more happy and upbeat than usual. Got the concentrate and same feeling only x2 ya dig? I hope you enjoy it!

VThis strain tastes very sweet, and absolutely delicious. Hits smoothly and isn&#39;t super harsh. The euphoria is strong with this one, and I couldn&#39;t help but smiling. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the effects did not last terribly long. Felt high for about an hour, then it wore off. It is most definitely one of the best tasting strains I&#39;ve ever had, and I loved the feelings it gave me.

VI got a wax cartridge of this strain. I love the taste, as it tastes EXACTLY like Double Bubble gum. The high itself is great! Not super intense and tiring, but it relaxes you and is a great mid-day to evening strain! I can definitely say I enjoyed it and I would recommend to anybody who wants the flavor, and a relaxing high!

VExtremely intense sativa. I\u2019m guessing this strain has extremely high THC-low CBD ratio, which has been known to cause a too-psychoactive effect without CBD to balance it out. At least according to what I\u2019ve heard. Very psychedelic high. Smoked one small bowl before bed and was on my ass high for hours. (I am a regular smoker)

VBubblegum is a really nice strain. I&#39;m surprised at how well it suits the name. Nugs are sticky and sweet and smell just like bubblegum. Smells so sweet with a little pine. After smoking a few bowls of master kush I decided to try the bubblegum. The buzz immediately woke me up and gave this noticable heady high. Colors also seemed to pop more. It also gave me a nice body high. Good for pain. One of my favourites.

Buds where quite dark in appearance but had the great bubblegum and sweet berry smell you would expect. Nice taste if you like the fruity varieties (who doesn&#39;t!)

Felt tingly warm relaxation all over body primarily legs, lower back, and arms, with slight numbness in forehead and behind eyes. Moderate pain relief, and stress relief for sure.

VGrew a few of these from clones, it grew much like the description said, slow in veg but grabbed traction in flower and produced some quality bud with a pretty good yield, it smells sweet, with floral notes but doesn&#39;t remind me of bubblegum IMO. The smoke though was the best part. This strain will leave you stupefied, and dumbfounded by the end of the bowl. Me and my buddy started calling it the bubbledumb because it literally broke our brains after we smoked a healthy size joint. Definitely a night time, end of your day strain, I&#39;ve read the other reviews saying this is one you can still function on but the bubblegum I grew will put you to bed.

Vsmoked some bubblegum in a nice hot-box with a friend out of a pipe. lovely and smooth. time seemed to go through passages of going going by without you realising it and other periods where time seemed to drag on and on, far different from any other experience i&#39;ve had. its a nice transition into being high. nice and gradual not hitting u dead in your tracks. it does quickly turn into a fairly good body high though and I really struggled to get up again. the high is slightly sativa-like in the way that you are still able to keep focus and hold conversations, do homework ect. .

VBubblegum has always put me on fleek. Seems to make me concentrate more and become super-connected to my surroundings. I give great massages when I&#39;m smoking this strain. The only negative is I nearly eat my house every damn time I smoke Bubblegum! \u000a

VWas expecting a mid level smoke and was quite surprised. Smells of bubble gum original when ground or busted up. Taste runs along those same lines for about one or two hits in a vape. Overall great body relaxation and pain relief. Head high behind the eyes and hardcore in the temple. This strain has landed into one of my top hybrids and leans towards indica. It doesn&#39;t give you couch lock either making for great daytime use, but also has the ability to put you to sleep. If you enjoy Blue Dream then this is soon to be a favorite.

VI&#39;m ecstatic to have found this strain. Along with chronic neck pain, depression, insomnia etc. I have  Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. Just by sheer accident, I noticed a tremendous decrease in severe nausea I was having at that moment. In a matter of 7-10 minutes I went from feeling like I was going to vomit to feeling good. No nausea, no vomiting, no queasiness, a mild decrease in neck pain, a nice case of giggles and relaxed happy high.  Major munchies about 30 minutes later &amp; able to eat a small amount of food. Smoking the flower works a little faster than vaping but I&#39;ll take it either way. Would like to know where this strain comes from and it&#39;s parents, if any.

This is an uplifting and kick back strain.  it would be well used before an event or if your around a lot of people it will mellow the scene for sure.

VVery strong, one of my favorite ones at my indoor grow. Taking clones for about 1 year and the quality stills the same. With LED 1000w panel you will get about 40gr per plant. Not reccomended during work when focus and agility is required! Great for chill and relax at home or beach enjoying a good vibe. I always use after work to relax and get a free stress mind.

VI chose this strain after getting a good whiff. It did not remind me of bubble gum, but it was a very pungent aroma, and a pretty potent flower indeed. I have really bad pain in my l3 - l4 region of my low back, and I no longer partake of narcotics, the side affects are not worth the results. I am always on the look out for good pain relief and Bubble gum does a fine job.

VIn my twenty plus years of smoking, I have to admit the taste of pot was something I just tolerated. Bubblegum is a game changer. Wow! I like to vape  (nicotine), and this is a flavor I&#39;d seek out in an e-liquid. Familiar bubblegum taste at first, then a sweet, creamy, mild citrus finish. The high ain&#39;t to bad, either. Good balance of indica and sativa.

The high came in waves where it would peak then ease off only to peak again shortly. \u000a\u000aI love the distinctly sweet aroma and the strain name is quite fitting. I made the mistake of overloading my bowl but this is definitely a nice strain for those that suffer from anxiety (just don&#39;t smoke too much obviously).

VI was surprised to read the other reviews - I must not have gotten a very good sample. It was one of the specials at the dispensary, and now I know why. The product was dry and burnt off very quickly, which meant I had to go through quite a bit. The initial high was actually fairly impressive; I could feel it coming on just after the first hit, but moving beyond the initial buzz proved difficult. Once I was there, though, I was pleased. It&#39;s a good strain for small gatherings - hanging out, watching movies, barbecues, whatnot. It definitely has a heavy, stony feeling, but at the same time it makes you giggly and talkative. It was nice, and this is definitely a strain I will have to try again, but probably from a different source.

VThe taste is mellow and sweet, sometimes almost like pine. The aroma lingers on your tongue and in the air. Generally sticky and dense with a slight orange tint to it. The high is clear and focused, opening your mind to a new range.

VCan only rate this based on smoking it all night Friday at a house party. Didn&#39;t mix with any other drugs or alcohol as I prefer just lighting up. Very strange strain, unlike most I&#39;ve tried before, the sativa was very uplifting but felt totally natural to be so, this effect may have been heightened due to the party atmosphere but I definitely felt much better after a smoke. This inital buzz though was very light and continued throughout the stone and I couldn&#39;t seem to get higher even though I was smoking very frequently throughout the night. Around 4-5 hours after initially lighting up (joint rolled every 30 minutes or so) the more relaxing vibes came through and the party was still greatly enjoyable. Very strong bubble gum smell funnily enough, in my personal opinion the nugs are too sticky and my grinder feels horrible now, but I can&#39;t expect anything less from a strain called bubblegum. Can see why people would buy this due to the very limited side effects, but definitely not a personal favourite at all due to the high being too light.

VProbably one of my absolute favorite strains! This weed was the perfect mix of head and body high. Gives you the feeling of being five beers in on a good night lol. Makes me cough a lot but it&#39;s worth it. The buds\u000abuds are so crystaly and fuzzy that it make you want to cry and the high lasts a long time compared to others. I love it!

VOne of my favorite strains. True to its name, it tastes like bubblegum and the smoke even smells like bubblegum! It&#39;s insane! The stuff I got was very purple (the most purple I&#39;ve seen on any strain). Fluffy, sticky buds. Highly recommend it, although I got a very slight headache on the comedown. My first time smoking it I had a bowl of afghan kush right before, and the two highs went hand-in-hand.

VThis bud tastes amazing to start. Me and my friend pack our bong up twice with this sweet strain and that&#39;s all we needed. Normally we would go 4 or 5 packs deep, but after just 2 we were very ripped. Our perception of time was way out of wack. He passed me the bong, which I felt like I was holding for hours, and had to ask who&#39;s hit it was literally 2 seconds after getting it. 5 minutes after finishing it just felt like my body and feet were sinking into the chair and floor. Head to toe awesome high!

Vthis strain makes the stress pour away, Making your Creative boundries stretch from your room to  Mothers natures deepest and most hidden palace. you feel nature, the wind hugs you, the Sun enpowers your mind and makes you negative-resistans, and water washes your body free of all shit. i bet this strain is one of the great against anxiety and depression. \u000a\u000ai don&#39;t have the enegy to make physical demanding tasks, but i feel i get exrtremely Creative in my mindre, painting, musicand drawing is tempting my mind and soul. \u000a\u000aMaking love to this strain would feel like getting Mother theresas own vagina satisfying you. \u000a\u000ahands down a favourite strain &lt;3

VMy bud was not properly cured, so it\u2019s hard to say what bubble gum is supposed to do. It was tinder dry, extremely bitter and left a bad aftertaste. The 5% CBDs did nothing for my arthritis and the THC content isn\u2019t high enough at 8% to do much except feel a little floaty. Why dispensaries provide flowers no one should be selling because the grower doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing is beyond me. Interesting that the strain actually smells a bit like bubble gum.

VBubble gum is as euphoric as it is fruity, which is very. While it isn&#39;t the most potent of strains in terms of THC concentration, it is still to this day after having smoked it for the first time 2 years ago, one of my favorite highs. I personally recommend smoking it as a blunt.
