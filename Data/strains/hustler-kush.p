VPurchased from World of Weed in Tacoma 3.5g for $50\u000aFlower: gorgeous light green xmas tree shaped nuggets. Twisting orange hairs are throughout as well as a liberal dusting of frostiness. \u000aSmell: sweet, spicy and earthy. Fresh grass/hay. \u000aCrumble: was a looser bud than I expected at first glance. Ground up nicely but did not increase in volume like some other denser strains of indica. \u000aBurn: very even and clean. \u000aTaste: Spicy notes a little clove-like, sweet brown sugar with a piney background. Earthy and pungent. Hay and fresh cut grass at the very end. It did give me a stuffy nose and a tickle in my throat but that I can&#39;t definitively say was the medicine&#39;s fault. \u000aHigh: Very relaxing for the body melt. Smoked after a workout then went in the hot tub.  Great decision!  I was loudly proclaiming my pleasure, probably upsetting the neighbors but fuck em. Felt like a hustler!\u000aOverall Experience: 8.0-10\u000aGood chill strain. Would&#39;ve scored higher if product was flushed better, too much grassy hay taste. Also not quite as dense as I like, felt like I wasn&#39;t getting as much for my money.
