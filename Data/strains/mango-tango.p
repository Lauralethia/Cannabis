VDefinitely one of my favorite hybrids. I bought 1/8 and the batch came out to 21.9% THC. Upon opening the bottle, my nose was filled with a very smooth, relaxing smell of Mango. It did not have a citrus or sour smell but rather a sweet, calm mango smell. The buds that I got were HUGE. Though the smell is sweet, calm and smooth, don&#39;t let that fool you. This strain REALLY packs a punch and if you hit it too hard, you will be coughing a lung for a good minute or two especially if you hit it from a bong. \u000a\u000aI only hit this two times from a bong with my family, and so did they. The first hit makes you cough a lot, but that&#39;s what you&#39;d expect from most Mango strains. After four minutes I can immediately feel Mango Tango&#39;s Indica effects. Legs felt like they were floating, lungs felt like thousands of grains of sand floating in the air as if a strong wind was blowing it away. Now the second hit, oh boy! The second hit was the straw that broke the camels back! Immediately after I exhaled the second hit, I can feel this hybrid&#39;s Sativa effect right away! \u000a\u000aThe top of my head felt like it burst into powder that was being blown away from the wind. My eyes and entire face felt all tingly and forced me to laugh and smile. My legs felt like sand that&#39;s being poured inside of an hour glass and my lungs felt like it was pure smoke.\u000a \u000aBasically with this strain if it has at least a minimum of 20% THC and you hit it hard, you will get the best of Sativa AND Indica. Though it varies by person, this made me take the best nap of my life. 10/10 will blaze this strain again. I HIGHLY recommend you try this strain out for yourself.

VLovely and potent hybrid that leans more towards a sativa spectrum.\u000a\u000aSocial and energetic high, somewhat toned downed. A reminding light uplifting feeling. Perfect for a long walk.\u000a\u000aMangoTango has never been a source for inspiration to me. My creativity is very low and it hurts my ability to work as I work with Math and programming a lot.\u000a\u000aThe flavour is very rich and has a well balanced citrus taste. More of a typical sativa taste then indica. But it&#39;s a very good sativa taste.\u000a\u000aEpitise wise I say you will get hungry on TangoMango. I eat more than I usally do, and not just snacks... but at it&#39;s very least. \u000a\u000aWorked well with alcohol, as mentioned before due to the social qualities in the high. Don&#39;t forget to order in some nuts with does drinks though.

VIn 2015 this strain was the winner of the overall Southern California Cannabis Cup. Smell &amp; taste was a pungent citrus pine. Buds were lighter green with lots of amber hairs. The buds were caked in a fine layer of milky white crystal trichomes &amp; the THC level was 23%. Made me happy, really relaxed, &amp; mildly sleepy. Light it up!!

VHoly moly mango, this indica-heavy hybrid holds true to its name!\u000a\u000aThe taste bears an uncanny resemblance to raw, juicy mango on the inhale; the exhale yields a sweet tree sap like taste, commonly found in indicas.\u000a\u000aLight doses deliver a body heavy functional high. Heavy doses expose the sativa inheritance and indica dominance working in tandem, making it easy to really deliver an intense mind/body high. \u000a\u000aGreat for sleep, tv, or any relaxation type activity. \u000a\u000aPS: BHO was my method of consumption, may have highlighted flavor \u000a

Body is relaxed and I&#39;m in a good mood even after a long day. Smell and taste are on point. As far as the head high..... I read strain reviews all the time; they have led me to some awesome bud and I always feel like a shitty friend because I never write reviews.

VOverall a nice fruity taste, solid looking finished buds, great in and outflow, smooth, smoked well=cured well(Harvested in DEcember for February Sale, that&#39;s a good sign) Not as a heavy hitter but more operable strain for the daylight ramblings or errand moments.  Doesn&#39;t knock you out, probably batting in the 18-20%THC range.  Was good, and only say that because &quot;great&quot; is reserved for the prima reservas we find in the valley, such as LouisXIII, etc... as a hybrid, not bad, not a head thumper.

Vthis is an interesting strain to say the least smell and tastes exactly as the name sounds its like a party of mangos the high was pretty equally split between stativa and indica. overall i did enjoy mango tango but id probably only pick up in small doses as kind of like a fun weekend strain

VTried this strain for the first time and found it to be mid range which for the $ is kool. This is a way to experience a lot of strains. Suffering from a massive stroke and the residuals associated with the stroke so relief is a must. Try it the taste pretty good, I will get again.

VWalked 5 miles to see what 2015 hybrid champs like. Got served by a coupe lionesses, one love, rolled up, lit it and as if someone just jammed a handful of berries in my mouth. This baby is a creeper with a really nice entrance when the high starts settling in. Clear visual, great for glaucoma and pain mild euphoria burns smooth and even on a windy day you can still smell the fruitness from far...

VExcellent bud structure with a true OG aroma that smells somewhat sweet. You get notes of melon and mango mixed with an array of citrus fruits. Good uplifting effects with no sleepiness attached.\u000a
