VAlien rock candy was a recommendation from my budtender. I ask for something good tasting and would give me a nice mellow cerebral high and full body relax. This strain gave me that and so much more. Nice tasting flower that took about 15 minutes to settle into a nice cerebral high, as I sat down to enjoy the evening the body high began and it completely relaxed me. I felt my anxiety and stress melt away and I just feel Incredible. Loving it.

VIf you haven&#39;t tried this, I feel bad for you, at least you are searching for it. Alien Rock Candy is hands down the best strain ever. I have smoked a ton of this and it is always reliable. Powerful sativa and indica effects ..It takes complete control of you body, your locked in from about 30 minutes or more out, but before that an intense cerebral jolt, any pain that I had has completely disappeared..If your looking for pain relief this is it...I have found for me the flower is as strong as the concentrate.

VThe Look: Reminds me of rasperry kush and golden goat had a baby. Very fat pistoled nugs are dank in golden tricomes caylexes are shy and hiding curling within. Fresh and Dank not any give on the moist bud, but still snaps like premium dried top shelf bud. \u000aThe Smell: Very fresh and green smelling reminds me of after it rains and you can smell the clean air, just reminds me of a rainy day in colorado. Great for those looking for fresh smell.\u000aThe Vape: Heavily thick and dense so much so that the bag is encapsulated is a mist of canabinoid wonderland twirls of mystery.\u000aThe Toke: Coming in at 21.3%THC very dry, chestnut, earth tones some would say harsh skunk taste, but to me its more of a diesel aromas and lingering here that makes me think this has a sour diesel or OG Kush heritage.  \u000aMedical use: ADHD, Depression, Motivation, Creative, Anti-fatigue, Schizoid Tendancies, Pain, stress and mood disorders.\u000a--------\u000aOverall I feel really relaxed theres a bit of lagginess aka the delayed movement like your hand trailing along like the 1999 mouser effects on websites, its a nice effect, faster reaction times I am focused on everything. Its a bit of a creeper meaning a Creeper: Is a escalating roll-i-coaster that builds on top of your effect. To me a creeper is like multiple layers eg. Lets take a sandwhich as a metaphor for many layers, this is the bread (THC) now heres the tabasco (Linalool) and lettuce (Myrcene), Tomato for zest we&#39;ll use that for CBD, Ect. Its a combinational effect. I would recommend those that can take on harder strains this is a great one for those who have phantom limb pain.

VTHC%: 75%\u000aForm: Shatter 0.5g\u000aBrand: Firebrand\u000a\u000aI love anything mixed with Sour Dubble. Sour Dubble is just SO YUMMY. Good indica dominant properties, doesn&#39;t make me sleepy. Good for mellowing out. \u000aI was expecting a little bit more of a couch lock effect. \u000aARC is amazing for going for walks on cool nights. Normally after dabbing an indica I don&#39;t want to move. Walking my dog actually sounds really amazing right now.

VAs of the last few months this has been my absolute favorite.  I&#39;ve only had it in various concentrated forms, mostly sugar wax.  The flavor is absolutely stunning, very sour, sweet, great chemy taste.  The high is balanced but does lean to the indica side.  If you have high tolerance it can be a great daytime strain but too much can make you a little slow or tired.  Personally I can&#39;t get enough, if you&#39;re in Colorado and see this from EndoCanna I suggest you scoop!

VVery effective for insomnia, relaxation, and positive mood. I have had a very painful, terrible day and just medicated with this strain and am now relaxed, and starting to feel better already and it&#39;s only been 15 minutes. My lumbar (mid-lower) back spasms finally stopped as well which is a BIG STAR \u2b50\ufe0f in my book which is pretty extensive. GOOD &#128175; night time flower for people with Chronic Pain, Insomnia and Anxiety. \u000a\u000a\u000aRemember Keep The Faith and the goal is to get bettter!\u000a\u000a\u000aP.S. All my reviews are done with no prior medicating for at least a few hours so I can give a truthful and medical perspective that is true for myself who suffers from severe back, neck, neurological problems, anxiety, depression and more.

I am really enjoying the mellow head space and the slight body buzz buried inside an incredibly relaxed body.\u000a\u000aMy legs feel slightly warm, not too bad on dry mouth or eyes. \u000a\u000aFlavor is clean and a little fruity for me.

VThe buds looked like green candies in the jar. They were so bright they shimmered in the light. When the jar popped open the most incredible smacked me in the nose. Almost watermelons and old man cologne or roses and dirty socks. It may sound gross, but it made me want to buy and smoke these buds right away. \u000a\u000aThe tiny green buds broke up into an impressive amount of joint material. My fingers smell like I scratched my butt and ate berries after rolling a nice sized joint. \u000a\u000aWhen lit the joint smelled like dank basement with a hint of watermelon or stawberry at the end. Not the natural fruit flavor, but the artificial fruit flavor in candy and drinks.  \u000aAs the joint burned it began to lose the fruit and took more of a socks and spice aroma and a pine dominant Kush like flavor. I didn\u2019t finish the joint. The roach got me plenty stoned the next morning.

VAlien Rock was a disappointment unfortunately. I had heard from many that it was a potent strain but was a complete let down when smoked. Perhaps it was the dispensary but flower display was poor in size and also taste. Smell was pungent and aromatic but nonetheless a buzz kill when inhaled. It seemed a rocket that was out of fuel and never hit behind the eyes or body. Effects were in vain (10 mins) and null in void. FAIL.
