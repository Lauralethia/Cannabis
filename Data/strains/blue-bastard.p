VTried roasting a bowl of this.  Effects came on pretty quickly.  However one thing is to be noted, each time I tried this for pain relief, I do get it, but it comes with a price. Blue bastard has some blueberry genetics, which as most know, are famous for their euphoric feelings.  But this Blue Bastard gave me mini-nightmares a few hours after I ingested it, but only when I was asleep.  I&#39;m not sure what it is about it but I never get nightmares and this one induced nightmares each time.  Nothing major, but enough to wake me up and make me say WTF man.  I&#39;ve tried it as an oil, smoke and a tincture.  I&#39;m going to pay attention to the names from now on.  I think they are relevant.  This bud is in fact blue but its also a bastard.

VWow, I can only use Blue Bastard if I want to go to sleep.....immediately. Through a vaporizer I am pretty much knocked out within 15 minutes. \u000a\u000aThat can be a good thing or a bad thing, but it does also help with pain quite well. My head is pretty clear, other than all I want to do is sleep.

VWhen getting to know a new flower I always go as low on the dosage as possible.  This came on in gentle waves of euphoria followed through with feelings of being really healthy. Had the ability to completely snap out of it and focus.  The desired use was for back pain reduction and although during the peak and decline of the medication, it was still there, the next day I felt amazing and got a lot of shit done.   No indica brain buzz, felt really clear.

VBlue Bastard is a nice indica strain . Got a freshly cured 1/4th a few days back and have been smoking it all weed. Beautiful flowers, lots of trichomes , dark green, nice hairs. Definitely has an inviting smell , a mix of pine and berries . The high is nice and heavy but never got couch lock. A more energetic indica high with a happy , euphoric buzz. Solid strain all in all .

VI got some for night time sleep and relax.  It&#39;s very good at relaxation at night while still being clear headed. Great smoke for night time when not looking to be out cold. My wife likes this one for me still can carry on a with conversation. Very calming but not tired to much.
