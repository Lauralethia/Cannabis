VI have PTSD and arthritis, but I had avoided trying weed because of the terrible paranoia and panic attacks it would bring on. The high Indica mixture must be best for me because I have not had to deal with panic with Star Killer. In fact, much the opposite.It helps with pain and takes away the too active nerves si I can finally get to sleep. The lady at Farma in Portland said it feels like settling down with a cup of cocoa. She was right.

VI have Complex PTSD and this is the best strain in the world for it.  All my stress and flashback seem to go away and I can just relax.  Its a pretty heavy strain and can help with sleep as well.  it has a lemon earthy taste and the bugs are kinda dense.  If you have PTSD or anxiety.. look no further.  This strain is amazing!

VStar Killer is one of my favorite strains its a heavy hitter so I wouldn&#39;t suggest this strain for begginer tokers. It helps me tremendously with my chrones disease when pain sets in so its good for that. It also leaves you feeling euphoric and has a deep profound body high definitely one of my top fives

VFull-bodied hit. Tasty, but strange. Faint grape. Hints of pine and lemon. Some soil. Very low-key flavor.\u000a\u000aEffects are pleasant. Calming. Chills you right out. Reduces stress and soothes the troubled mind. Seems determined to make you sleepy or hungry as well.\u000a\u000aNot recommended for constant use, but great as a first or last smoke of the day.

Vthis is my second review on this phenomenally skunky crystal fest....purple n even pink show up as well..... I got my card in CT back in Jan of this year and this was the second strain I tried from the arrow alternative care dispensary.....Connecticut pharmaceutical solutions puts it out and its called &quot;fioraden A&quot;..... to make a long story short, I have PTSD and have tried every flower they offer and hands down, when you need relief from stress and anxiety, or just simply want to chill out n watch a movie or 3....I go on record stating star killer is the best flower I have smoked. The reason for the second review is after trying many of the great indica&#39;s CT has to offer, there still hasn&#39;t been one that can beat the star killer

VCT MMJ &quot;CTP Fioraden C&quot; flower &#127793;&quot;Hash Plant&quot; x &quot;Star Killer&quot; &#128154; Head AND Body high. Dry vaped the flower. Smells mostly citrus and very slight diesel.\u000a\u000aVery creative and humorous , but also amazing for inflammation and pain. I have an inflammation attack on my knee and was in a ton of pain by the end of the day... And this melted it away, and also brought my head down. Pretty couch locked but still with a creative spirit &#127752;&#127776;. \u000a\u000aOne of those strains that makes you focus really hard just to get one text or thought out.\u000a\u000aWatched &quot;Sisters&quot; while smoking thing. Good humorous combo effect.

VExcellent for insomnia! Lately, I&#39;ve been forced to use hybrids, as there has been a shortage of Indica around here. These hybrids I&#39;ve been forced to try lately haven&#39;t been cutting it for insomnia. Star Killer worked so well, I fell asleep WHILE vaping it. I fell asleep easier (obviously) but I also stayed asleep longer and sleep deeper. With the hybrids, I woke up every 45 minutes to an hour and a half every single night. With Star Killer, I only woke up once about halfway through the night. I came downstairs, loaded a fresh bowl, turned on the Herbalizer, put on my headphones, started my ritual... and fell asleep AGAIN before I could turn the Herbalizer off ( to be fair, it was towards the end of the bowl each time). I&#39;ve been doing two whole bowls of the hybrid crap every 45 minutes to an hour and a half and STILL haven&#39;t been able to sleep! Star Killer worked! I feel much rested today.

VI&#39;m a rookie and this was my first Indica strain. I absolutely love Star Killer! I keep going back to it primarily because of the mood it puts me in. It just......makes me happy.

Translucent amber.\u000aAnyways grab Star Killer for your next night time medicine you&#39;ll love it.

VLemon Pledge!! With a hint of skunk this is a pretty good OG although I have only tried the green pheno Rare Dankness strikes again with another cross to their signature strain RD #1 and RD #2 I believe the SK is Skywalker OG X RD #2. I think the RD #2 gives the Skywalker OG a more sour taste &amp; smell but still a very good hybrid.

VOops! Finally got to try this Indica in flower for today \u2013 and I&#39;m glad I did! Dense purple buds and a fruity taste, only a tad harsh on uptake. Stress melts away after third toke, anxiety + worries quickly follow. Coughing more than I like, but exhale is so earthy + pungent, likely too much for a beginner, as my flower is at 27.7% THC! Perfect for ptsd, chronic pain (started at a 7, quickly down to a 4 after only four tokes now.)  Loved the oil, loving the flower too! \u2728&#127769;\u000a

This was the first strain I ever bought when I made it into Colorado, and it has been a staple in my life like salt and pepper... like part of my routine, smoking this before bed has helped me sleep so much better the past few months. Also this strain is great for when I need an attitude adjustment, kicks in quick and melts pain stress and depression away. Not to mention, these are some of the PRETTIEST BUDS IVE EVER HAD!!!

Star Killer, crossing skywalker OG with some darkness, different game, not strong in scent, packs a punch in flavour and high. Colorful crystal buds, sweet like taste hits the mouth, within a few vapes i feel like my eyes are starting to get that pleasant heavy sag, yet still uplifted happy and relaxed i stay. 70% indica at 23.2% thc is definitely a heavy hitter, i found better sleeping patterns with a evening session. Really amazing that cdn growers are looking outside the everyday normal popular strains that pop up at most dispensaries/LPs.

VI bought this at the source and grown by 8 Fold.  It was not purple at all and absolutely no lemon scent/flavor like the strain information suggests.  I smoked in bowl first and it was 2 star, put in volcano and it&#39;s 3 star.  Pleasant happy buzz.

VWoa. The batch I got \u2018weighed in\u2019 at just under 30% THC. Some potent flower. I did one small bowl to try and it was enough for a very nice two hour veg on the deck. It hit me in the head quickly and I thought it was too much. But after 20 minutes I was as just jello. Super relaxed and warm and fuzzy. I\u2019m a medical patient and usually prefer high cbd strains. But I must say that after the initial head buzz it killed my chronic abdomen pain. I\u2019m gonna mix it with some cbd flower as a cocktail. Very strong stuff. Lastly, as for taste, it wasn\u2019t memorable.

VThis was my first time ordering medical marijuana, so I bought 5g of this strain. I have anxiety and thought this would be a great strain to try!\u000a\u000aThe smell was great, felt great and burned nice. I can only smoke a few puffs at a time or I get panic attacks if I go over my limit. I smoked about 3 to 4 puffs off a pinned that I rolled and holy lordy was I baked! Definitely didn&#39;t understand how strong medical marijuana was!\u000a\u000aI&#39;d definitely recommend that you start real slow if you&#39;re a user as this can be one of those strains that grab you by the  boo boo!

VThis strain is diverse for me. By night it gets me hungry and it helps my body relax so I can fall into dream land. However, if I smoke this as a wake and bake it keeps my mind steady and calm so I don&#39;t feel overwhelmed and like I can handle the day. It takes all my anxiety away and makes me mellow. If I&#39;m up and ready to do stuff it doesn&#39;t couch lock me...but if I&#39;m ready to be couch locked it&#39;s nice company. This strain isn&#39;t a testament to sometimes it&#39;s not about sativa or indica it&#39;s about what your needs during the smoke. 5/5.

I&#39;ve had this as a flower first and it has hit the low 30% thc range and i just bought a wax that is almost like shatter and is dark amber almost red in color that was tested at 93%! highly recommend this strain,the purple deisel smelling pheno type is what you are looking for when growing this strain from Rare Dankness seeds.

VI really enjoyed Star Killer, it was a great way to relieve some anxiety and achieve some muscle relaxation without becoming to tired. I must say the sedation feeling is present, however, not overwhelming. I must say I have looked forward to sampling this strain for a while and it did not disappoint me. I feel a tingling feeling from head to toe. Feels like I&#39;m bathing in the light of a full moon on a warm summer evening.

VHands down one of the most potent night-time strains I&#39;ve come across. Instantaneous pain relief, but the anxiety-relieving and sleep inducing properties took about 10 minutes to fully kick in, as well as most of the high, so be careful with this one. Very dense buds covered in crazy hues of green &amp; purple make it an aesthetically pleasing smoke. Smells like Skywalker OG fucked a big bowl of citrus fruits.

VI am going to be one of the few here but I was a bit dissatisfied with this strain in the end.  Was it good? Yes.  However, I think this is a strain geared towards smoking rather than vaping.  It didn\u2019t have the trichomes or terpenes to really make this stand out and I was really looking forward to it.  The high was lackluster, kind of reminded me of high school weed which was a good while ago.  It has potential but didn\u2019t seem quite there from the breeders who made my batch.\u000a\u000aIf I try it again and I determine the batch I got was bad gladly go back and adjust this review accordingly.

VReally nice relaxing buzz... I suffer from Dystonia. A movement disorder that is very painful... And the Indica&#39;s help w/body pain... So far I like it and will consider it again. I&#39;m looking for less spasticity inflammation and overall body pain. I also like Columbian Gold....

VSneaky good. First time I tried this flower I thought it was decent. 10 minutes maybe 15 later I was locked in my chair listening to classic rock. This flower kinda crawled up my spine and hit me in the back of the head. Shortly after it took charge of my body and stress and pain faded. For this old man, I. This is one of my favorites to date.

VAWFUL EXPERIENCE \u000aAfter reading the reviews and overview I was super excited to try this strain. It seemed it &quot;should&quot; be great for all my medical needs. I have PTSD, major anxiety, etc. \u000aAt first it seemed pretty mellow. About 5 minutes into it things took a different turn. It felt like it drained all emotion out of me &amp; immediately put me in an unpleasant depressed state. Then came on the anxiety. I know it&#39;s a heavy hitting Sativa, but it wasn&#39;t a pleasant introspective cerebral feeling at all. Instead of helping my PTSD it brought up image after image of things I wasn&#39;t ready to deal with at that moment. \u000aNow I know I will may get some people saying that maybe I got a different strain or something along those lines, as the experience I&#39;m describing is quite different than most. I can guarantee you this was the real deal. I felt the need to write this (my first Leafly review) just to give that there is a flip side to this strain to watch out for. \u000aTwo other people in fact that have very different chemistry from me felt the same drain of all emotion and just an overall unpleasant feeling using this medicine. \u000aIt&#39;s a strain to be careful with I&#39;d say. \u000a

If you have pain it eases it away. I can use this day or night but I was hoping it would help me sleep since tjats what I read its known for. sadly, I feel energized and relaxed. I guess we will see how I sleep once I can.\u000aIf you are new to this be careful because it did create some anxiety and paranoia.
