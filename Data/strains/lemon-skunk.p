VAn emotional respite. First appearances alone are pacifing, with a lush astroturf green,&#160;tightly wound orange hairs, and a dusting of powder akin to morning dew, confidence in your purchase is immediate.\u000a\u000a\u000aAnyone who&#39;s stood under a lemon tree will feel nostalgia upon opening, with lemon rind, flowers, and a hint of mossy dank meeting the nose.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is definitely a strain for the vaporizer. Smoking a lemon branch in the best possible way. Clouds are thick and fill the lungs quickly. This strain is not inherently harsh, but the volume can be unexpected.\u000a\u000a\u000aStoned, but not dopey, high, but not spacy and a real mood lifter this is a great strain for relaxed social scenes, and time spent bettering yourself at a hobby.&#160;\u000a\u000a\u000aGreat with sweet tea, live shows, and slow walking the beach.\u000a\u000a

V&#127819;&#129314; Lemon Skunk is a stinkier than it is citrusy sativa dominant hybrid. It&#39;s initial hit is quite smooth, and tastes very mild compared to some other lemon flavored strains. The high is great for the early morning and won&#39;t leave you feeling cloudy or heavy. It is not the strongest for mood boost, but definitely still effective. I highly recommend this for beginners who are unsure about what they need and are afraid to try hybrids. Lemon Skunk is a great stress reliever and also a nice starting point into the world of hybrids. Limonene: 2.54 mg/g, b-Myrcene: 3.77 mg/g, b-Caryophyllene: 3.16 mg/g.

VMy medical Lemon Skunk is called Lexikan, from Connecticut Pharmaceutical Solutions and comes in consistently around 31%. The intense high lasts for about 3 hours and then leaves you wonderfully sleepy. The flavor is fit for any gourmet, lemony and piney/skunky. This Lexican is much more of a Sativa.

VI was raised on Skunk, breast feed it. Skunk milk, we called Skunk Butter. Use to run with this guy, Kevin, that looked like Greg Allman, his wife, Dixie, would always roll these J&#39;s that looked like Pal Mal Cigarettes. Amazing! I would be dropping weed on the carpet, asking for another skin because I tore mine. And she would be laughing at me rolling one handers that looked like J R Reynolds approved. Kev always had the Skunk. I didn&#39;t know till leafly (amen to you) that there is 147.2 strains of Skunk. I remember we had the one and we were god dammed happy about it. I had to walk up hill with no shoes in the freezing cold summer just to get half a hit of this, and we were gal derned grateful. This particular (if you made it this far in the wall of reminiscent text) It has the effects of skunk and a taste that is best smoked. I vaped a oven or three and it tasted like molded lemon funk ass sandwiches served in a dirty porn bathroom. (not that bad, and I will never got to that restaurant porn theater bath room again for lunch) Vaped, to me, tasted like you went to one of those stuck up ass parties at a country club and someone is serving Fromundder Cheese and Lemon on a Ritz cracker. Smoke the strain and stay for the efx.

VSecond time I buy that Cultivar From Tweed.\u000aLast time it was not D.N.A Approved, now it is. \u000aThis may be the only strain approved by a Champion breeder available at a Canadian License producer. \u000aOrdering was a breeze and I got my order within 24h as usual, fast delivery.\u000aProduct was nicely package. different box different labels than usual. I must admit I like it :-) \u000aThe herb now. \u000aNice, Very clean head high with some body heaviness. I would not go running but could certainly write a novel. \u000aI had 5.03g and paid $12. Nugs were small but well trimmed. My largest ones were under 0.6g and all on the dry side .Smell was great, powerful lemony smell with a hint of cat piss and very little skunkyness. \u000aI vaporized with the AL &quot;Mighty Medic&quot; at 180c all the way up to 210. Lemon Candy like taste at first, than more citrus to a light skunk at the end of the session at max temp. Very nice vapor very smooth for the lungs even on big hits. . Definitely feel way more Sativa effects than Indica. \u000aFeel, look, smell very similiar to the original lemon skunk AKA TW Duke I got from Tweed. Except that everything is more with this batch. More THC, crystals, dense, smell, high, dry, expensive.   \u000a\u000aSmell and taste very similar to Mettrum Super Lemon Haze But the high is not as clean as this one and smoke is not as smooth but cheaper and more indica if this is was you like.\u000a\u000aI love the high, I will try to keep in stock at all time because of the high and the smoothness. I can clearly see myself in that state all day long. \u000aNo more pain, no more anxiety, no munchies, no stress. \u000aI am just living, NOW is all what matters. \u000a\u000aI am giving 4 stars because of the quality of the high and smoothness. without it would have got a 2.\u000a Too bad buds are on the dry side although The Mighty like it better dry. Price is way to high with small dry nugs. \u000aTweed, Ask Bedrocan to cure your herbs, I never had dry buds from your sister compagny ;-)

VAn incredable nice strain, looks a little brown in the bag but counters that nicely with a strong citrus smell. Once you grind it up the smell almost becomes unbearable. Very smooth toke and a quick high that last for a good 40 minutes. Leaving me with zero back pain and smiling for a good period. I wouldn&#39;t recommend smoking this before you have done your work for the day, Lemon Skunk will sink you into your chair, and you ain&#39;t getting outta it again. A very nice weed, would highly recommend it to my friends and hope to have more in coming days.

VI love skunk as a strain and this variation of that particular strain does not disappoint at all. The buds are light and leafy which I like sometimes because the flavor ends up being better. It tastes fruity and does have the sour taste of lemons somewhat. The high is very energetic and heady which makes it great for anxiety and depression etc. I give this strain a 8/10 and recommend it to patients seeking a day time medicine for anxiety and or depression.

VI bought 10 grams because lemon skunk was one of my favorites. 8 or the 10 grams were way over-dryed and had barely any smell or taste with light crystal coverage. The last nug i had weighed in at 2 grams and it was a sure prize. It was crystal coated to the core and this was the only nug with a smell. When i started breaking the nug down for a blunt it started reeking heavily of lemon zest and skunkiness and the 2 gram blunt was one of the best tasting and smoking ive ever had. The high leans more sativa than indica but the bud structure is definite indica, with small rock solid, uniform nugs. Even though this batch wasnt great, the last nug really saved it and reminded me why i love this strain so i still have to give the 5 stars. You cant go wrong with skunk!

VRecently went to Deep Roots in Mesquite NV, this is one of the strains they have on their growers choice menu. I like lemon cannabis types and have never had this one so I gave it a try. \u000a\u000aI will preface this review by saying that for whatever reason I was born with a gift that makes me very sensitive to THC. Plants that have a 10-15% THC level usually get me comfortable in about three hits. 5mg edibles obliterate me, like to the point of not being able to function most of the time. This particular strain when last tested in January of 2018 was registering around 20%. \u000a\u000aI took one hit and felt the effects of the strain within about 30 seconds vs the normal 5-10 minutes it usually takes for me. I enjoyed how fast I felt it, the effects were smooth and enjoyable. Nice buzz in the forehead, muscle pain went away, I was able to stretch my body without feeling the inflammation from previous injuries at the end of my day. Overall I would give this strain a 5 just due to the efficacy in which it relieved symptoms.

VI was utterly surprised by the strength of LS. The high lasted for a really long time. I was very comfortable in a seated position but my mind was overflowing with ideas and concepts. Rather a strange dichotomy with the stationary body and working-over-time mind. I loved this strain and would gladly smoke it again.\u000a\u000a*I just got this again and I still love it.

VI&#39;m writing this review from perspective of someone with debilitating anxiety.  Do not smoke this strain if you have anxiety.  I would rate it as a 0 because it made me very anxious but that wouldn&#39;t be fair to the strain.  These ratings are subjective if you don&#39;t have set standards for rating the strains.  Tastes better than most.  Get&#39;s you super high but causes anxiety.

Lemon Skunk however, is not well suited for sport or study, sex notwithstanding. \u000a\u000aLemon Skunk can help with pain caused by spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, disc herniation and, to a degree, myalgia from muscle spasm.

V\u2022 Need to re-review my *fave daytime vaping oil from CT Pharmaceutical Solutions bc this concentrate has changed in a few ways.. + after a week+ of having to &#39;do&#39;-without! The thc-content has gone down, from 34% \u2013&gt; 28% while they up&#39;d the terpenes panel.. and it is, by-far, the MOST-sophisticated that I&#39;ve ever seen! .. w/a whopping 15.83% + includes many of the more unusual -- \u000a ..like linalool, fenchol, trans-b farnesene, alpha-cedrene, beta-caryophyllene,humulene,valencene, trans-nerolidol, guaiol.. \u2022  Regardless of recipe, this is still my favorite daytime &#39;smoke&#39; (vape), both for \u000aflavor- &amp; euphoric-intensity &amp; provides an overwhelming sense of wellness.. like everything is balanced and right-again in the &#127758; when &#127819; skunk is back in town! \u2022 Still a 5 \u2b50\ufe0f &#128293;-strain! \u2022 \u2764\ufe0f

VThis review is for T 95% shatter, which I&#39;m presently trying for the first time. I already love the T 33% oil vape cartridge, so felt I couldn&#39;t go wrong with the concentrate!\u000aTastewise, it&#39;s def got less of a citrusy bite than the pure oil.. ironically it tastes more like the flower, in that the &#127794; piney flavors are more pronounced, and it&#39;s actually a bit smoother (on lungs|throat) on the uptake than flower AND oil, oddly enough. \u000aCerebrally -- as expected -- the shatter blows the lid off of the others, and I&#39;m feeling the corners of my mouth being involuntarily pulled up + into a smile.. Stress &amp; anxiety melt quickly away, and my adhd-brain&#39;s motor is finally slowing ddoowwnn + a relaxing euphoria sets nicely in for the evening. \u000aIt&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve felt THIS nicely mellow and perfectly, wonderfully, gloriously high.  \u000aI&#39;d imagine a strain w/thc-content of 95% is best-left to those with higher tolerances, altho I highly recommend everyone try a Lemon Skunk oil or shatter if offered the opportunity \u2013 you won&#39;t be disappointed! &#128076;&#127995;     \u2022  5\u2728strain  \u2022     &#128077;&#127997;&#128077;&#127997;

VI took my first two hits and felt it hard between the ears; my head filled with an uneasy restless buzz, 15 mins later the high melted into my shoulders and euphoria took over. \u000aNow a few weeks later, (16 strains in the house like to change it up), I just had two hits with a much calmer head buzz, a nice lift in energy and overall feeling of euphoria. I bought an ounce for $200 and would buy this again.

VMy experience with this strain was phenomenal!! Slow in effect, but strong once it hits. I was very uplifted and was down to listen to some music for sure. Almost psychedelic in feel, definite euphoria and happiness! The smell out of the jar is crazy zesty lemon and the taste is the same. Smoked from a clean bong, and vaped from a pen, both had a very lemony inhale and a very skunky lemon exhale. Put me in good spirits and got rid of a nasty headache. Recommended for sure!!!

VFirst, I now know what &quot;dank&quot; means.\u000a\u000aSecond, you&#39;re going to have trouble even getting this into the pipe/vape/papers/whatever... because your nose is going to be stuck to whatever container this lemon scented wonderbud is in.\u000a\u000a\u000aSeriously, this stuff SMELLS GREAT.  \u000a\u000aTaste, not so much; but I think that&#39;s probably because I used flower and not my usual concentrate.  \u000aIn concentrate form... the terps and taste should be through the roof.  \u000a\u000aLipsmackingly so.  \u000a\u000aEven losing most of those tasty terps by smoking flower, I can still taste the lemon.  Interestingly, it smells sweet, but tastes tart(ish).  \u000a\u000aAs to the rest, fairly effective pain killer.  \u000a\u000aGood daytime and nighttime strain, as you get the best of both worlds with the cerebral sativa high and then in about an hour or so the indica begins to show.  \u000a\u000aNot badly, though- this isn&#39;t ass on the couch weed.  \u000a\u000aThis is... &quot;sure, I&#39;m game for whatever&quot; weed.  Whether that&#39;s dancing, hiking, movies, whatever... s&#39;all good.  \u000a\u000aEnough motivation to get things done, but a dreamy headspace can make your attention wander.  Indica again, methinks.\u000a\u000aBut... what do you expect from a Skunk?  \u000a\u000aAnd this is a skunk... the type of skunk you smoked in the late 80&#39;s to get STONED.  \u000a\u000aRemember STONED?  Not like this, you don&#39;t.  \u000a\u000aThis was the kind of stoned that finds you driving through the forest listening to U2 and Peter Gabriel and the next thing you know it&#39;s 3 hours later and you&#39;re scarfing down a plate of the house special at some hole in the wall roadside caf&#233;.  They have the best damn pie you&#39;re ever going to eat, and you&#39;ll never find the place again once you leave because you just ate breakfast in Brigadoon.  You&#39;ll dream of that goddamn pie for years, waking up in the middle of the night with a craving so intense you could scream.\u000a\u000aTrue story, that.  \u000a\u000aRegardless, it&#39;s LEMON!  It&#39;s SKUNK!  What the hell are you waiting for?\u000a\u000aHits/Tokes to effect:  4/5 (Flower)\u000aCough Level:  Smooth, but it&#39;s Skunk.  There&#39;s always that one BIG hit that catches you by surprise when it expands...\u000aLegs:  3 to 4  hours\u000aGood for:  Day/Night Use\u000aMunchies:  You&#39;re okay until you eat something.  Then look out pantry!

VAfter smoking Lemon Skunk the last few days I think it is a really interesting &#39;alternative&#39; to Blue Dream - it has some similar effects with it&#39;s own taste and spin.  I think the LS may have a touch more Indica in it, but that is why I&#39;m really liking it - lots of full body stone and still the wonderful euphoria of a sativa dominant hybrid.  I&#39;m also impressed with the smoothness of the smoke and then the building lung expansion - gets past the throat easy and then blows up in the lungs and you can really feel the high THC.  Not sure what my current example of this comes in at in terms of %, but I&#39;d be surprised if it were under 18% - the stuff is strong.

VMmmm I so love the lemons. Lemon kush, lemon skunk, super lemon haze. If it&#39;s lemon-y, citrus-y I tend to enjoy it. Blue dream on the other hand tastes like soap to me. Yuck! Someone explained it had to do with the terpenes your body can use why certain strains appeal more than others. Whatever the case, this is one of my top 5 favorite for sure. Awesome head rush that makes you feel creative while also taking your mind off pain and helping in that area too. It&#39;s almost the magic bullet. Definitely is for me as far as a daytime med. Smell is amazing &amp; taste to me is like lemonheads candy on the exhale more than the inhale.

VFirst impression is got to be the smell.  Strong lemon with just a hint of smoke and sweet.  On the draw it is extremely smooth.  On exhale it is cool and fruity with slight hint of lemon but not overpowering.  First few minutes require a bit of patience but well worth the short wait.  Next level hits with a moderate head band but soon fades to a euphoric, happy, floating, high.  After about 3 medium hits off small bowl I have to say I am feeling just right with the world.  Only negative is this incredible high does not last very long.  Top flight for about an hour and a half but soon starts to fade quickly and leaves you reaching for your next hit.   All considered I recommend this as a at least try, and at most keep an eye out when it comes round.

VNever had lemon skunk before and just acquired some last week. For starters I must say wow! I&#39;ve don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a better more joyous high then on lemon skunk. With friends this was a blast. Almost like we were kids again. Not a care in the world! So in a sense I guess you could say it&#39;s great for depression. For me it provides an uplifting and joyous high. With friends it made it even better joking, laughing, acting silly!  It&#39;s just something you would associate with a good time. The taste was low key. My best description would be a smooth and smokey hit with hints of a tangy aftertaste. The aroma is heavy, definitely very dank but in a good way.\u000a\u000aI would recommend it to groups of close friends who want to feel younger again. For people who want a little pep in their step who are going out for chores to socialize.

VFirst impression is got to be the smell.  Strong lemon with just a hint of smoke and sweet.  On the draw it is extremely smooth.  On exhale it is cool and fruity with slight hint of lemon but not overpowering.  First few minutes require a bit of patience but well worth the short wait.  Next level hits with a moderate head band but soon fades to a euphoric, happy, floating, high.  After about 3 medium hits off small bowl I have to say I am feeling just right with the world.  Only negative is this incredible high does not last very long.  Top flight for about an hour and a half but soon starts to fade quickly and leaves you reaching for your next hit.   All considered I recommend this as a at least try, and at most keep an eye out when it comes round.

VHappy pain killing strain that gives you a high full of energy that comes and goes. You clean a room, then read a little, do some laundry, then start a movie, go for a walk, visit with friends, your day seems to last forever, you have time to get everything done and think random outrageous thoughts while your doing them. Be sure and write them down, some might be brilliant! Good for depression. #420sweepstakes

VLife is stressful. There is a lot going on in the world right now..and plenty to be stressed about. This strain completely removed the inner-nagging emotions about it all. Finally some peace of mind. I feel at ease, lucid slightly tired- but completely in tune w/ reality, with a better perception. The smell is incredible and refreshing...all around an A+ strain!

VNever had lemon skunk before and just acquired some last week. For starters I must say wow! I&#39;ve don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a better more joyous high then on lemon skunk. With friends this was a blast. Almost like we were kids again. Not a care in the world! So in a sense I guess you could say it&#39;s great for depression. For me it provides an uplifting and joyous high. With friends it made it even better joking, laughing, acting silly!  It&#39;s just something you would associate with a good time. The taste was low key. My best description would be a smooth and smokey hit with hints of a tangy aftertaste. The aroma is heavy, definitely very dank but in a good way.\u000a\u000aI would recommend it to groups of close friends who want to feel younger again. For people who want a little pep in their step who are going out for chores to socialize.

VNoted I&#39;m a heavy smoker and I&#39;ve been smoking on lemon skunk for two weeks now. The high is a very couch lock high, lasts a good hour or two from a couple joints. The stuff I got wasn&#39;t very manicured well, but the buds didn&#39;t look to bad, they smoked nice, great buzz, that gives you wicked cotton mouth. It tasted almost like a lemon filled donut in a clean pipe though.

I enjoy it more than Og Kush, Gsc, Afghani, Sour diesel, etc. It has such a strong lemony scent to it, it doesn&#39;t taste quite lemony but maybe its because it wasn&#39;t on a vape etc, but it kicks harddd and really I love it and I recommend it to everyone.

VThis is an old school strain which tends to be less potent, but one of my favorite Sativa leaning hybrids. Forget Leafly&#39;s claim. I use to get this strain from a Vietnam Vet and his lineage was from Vietnam which he used for depression and PTSD. Although it does take more for a seasoned amoker to get the job done but I have always truly enjoyed this strain for those warm sunny days. Strong lemon, cheese, skunky smell. Smooth, mellow smoke with a STRONG lemon &amp; pine flavor on exhale. According to previous review they recommend not vaping due to no/horrible flavor; Dear User, you either got a bad grow or don&#39;t know how to vape properly. (Organic Soil grown dry bud, vaporized at 405&#176;F)

VI was looking forward to trying this one after my guitar buddy had me grab a wiff of this strain.  The nose appeal of this is off the charts.  I was so impressed, that I had the wife take a quick smell from the canister when I got home and she was equally impressed.  When we sat down to sample a few days later, she just smiled when I told her what we were smoking.  We were both expecting the same sort of insane taste as the aroma but found out it was much more subtle tasting.  Slightly sweet and a bit earthy and it was pretty easy on the inhale.  You could take a pretty decent rip and not hack your lungs out.  The effects were just like the aroma though.  It was very well balanced between a cerebral buzz and a body buzz.  The reviews indicated it leaned a bit on the sativa side but we found it was smack dab in the middle for us.  When I woke up about two hours after crashing I found I was still stoned...impressive.  Other than the one time getting up to whizz...we both had a great night&#39;s sleep.  Gotta give props to the guitar bud...he pick a winner.

VLEMON SKUNK REVIEW\u000a\u000aBUD:  Taste just like it smells, very skunky with a hint of lemon\u000aLUNG EXPANSION:  Very low.  On a scale of 1-10 I&#39;d say about a 2.\u000aBODY/HEAD:  Hit&#39;s my head first, then slowly feel this moving down into my body. \u000aFLAVOR:  More of an earthy flavor.  Heavy skunk taste (or what I would imagine a skunk must taste like, since I&#39;ve never tasted one... lol.)  \u000aCONCLUSION:  Not a heavy hitter, but a very nice stone none the less.  On a scale of 1-10, I&#39;d rate this a 7.  A flower I wouldn&#39;t mind smoking again, but probably not a first pick.

VGrower: Dream City Cannabis (Flower) \u000aConsumption: Pax2 vaporizor starting at level 2 (380&#176;F (193&#176;C). The terpines are very tasty at this temp. Citrus, Fruit, Wood, Cheese. \u000aSmooth on inhale and exhale. Hits fast. Not strong at first, just eases you into a nice calm state of well-being. Helps manage c-PTSD, MDD, anxiety, and chronic joint/nerve pain; mixed with AC/DC (high CBD strain) for optimal mind/comfort during the day. \u000aAt night, I add this to a heavy Indica strain and it helps me drift into peaceful dreamy sleep.\u000aBump up heat to level 3 (400&#176;F (204&#176;C) and it produces more heady, dreamy effects.

VThis was a very pretty strain, had alot of beautiful red hairs and plenty of Trichomes to spare! Definitely had the lemon scent to match it&#39;s name with a mix of tropical smells mixed in. The taste brings memories of a lemon tart with a piney aftertaste. The first toke brings you into a energetic mindset and sets you down to a relaxing motivated mood. good for start of a day or increased appeite last between 3-5 hours using 1/4 of a gram of flower. \u000a\u000a\u000a

Other than the one time getting up to whizz...we both had a great night&#39;s sleep.  Gotta give props to the guitar bud...he pick a winner.

VInteresting that a cpl people said &quot;it was a creeper bc I burned LemonSkunk via bong and only a couple good sized inhales struck almost, quite literally, immediately to the head and body. The feel was thus quite unique hence five stars. Euphoric and relaxing as well as a nice subtle head buzz and a very good focus,  withOut any energetic feeling.    And last not least  there is an uplifting quality.  Smell: lemony and old school chronic, heavy herb/pine.  Tastes kinda like it&#39;s name sounds.  A raw-digga strain!

VI picked up a vape cartridge of this strain today. I took one very large hit while I was in the middle of a phone call and within 2 mins I was happily rambling on and having deep philosophical discussion with my friend. This strain has that classic skunk type high but not quite as sedating as i remember which was nice. My mood was elated, good energy level with a relatively clear head. One experience that happened several times in the first hour was walking into a room to get something and getting totally distracted and forgetting my original purpose. It wasn&#39;t a severe fried brain feeling, it seemed like I was really focused and into whatever I was doing but easily distracted at the same time. The tendency to get sidetracked makes me a bit apprehensive to use it as my main daytime med at this point but that will probably subside.

VThis is an old school strain which tends to be less potent, but one of my favorite Sativa leaning hybrids. Forget Leafly&#39;s claim. I use to get this strain from a Vietnam Vet and his lineage was from Vietnam which he used for depression and PTSD. Although it does take more for a seasoned amoker to get the job done but I have always truly enjoyed this strain for those warm sunny days. Strong lemon, cheese, skunky smell. Smooth, mellow smoke with a STRONG lemon &amp; pine flavor on exhale. According to previous review they recommend not vaping due to no/horrible flavor; Dear User, you either got a bad grow or don&#39;t know how to vape properly.

VThis is my second review for this strain because it&#39;s so damn good. Lemon Skunk just seems perfect for me. When ever I start feeling like the world is on my shoulders this bud just seems to take away all the depression and stress and it let&#39;s me look at life in a new and enlightened way. Although I&#39;ve smoked a lot of different strains, this one is probably my second favorite after Pineapple Purps.  It is like a smokeable source of sunshine...sweet. Give it a try and you&#39;ll be amazed at how centered it makes you feel.

VNever had lemon skunk before and just acquired some last week. For starters I must say wow! I&#39;ve don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a better more joyous high then on lemon skunk. With friends this was a blast. Almost like we were kids again. Not a care in the world! So in a sense I guess you could say it&#39;s great for depression. For me it provides an uplifting and joyous high. With friends it made it even better joking, laughing, acting silly!  It&#39;s just something you would associate with a good time. The taste was low key. My best description would be a smooth and smokey hit with hints of a tangy aftertaste. The aroma is heavy, definitely very dank but in a good way.\u000a\u000aI would recommend it to groups of close friends who want to feel younger again. For people who want a little pep in their step who are going out for chores to socialize.

This flower is ALWAYS skunky and pungent!!! \u000a\u000aWhen I smoke this strain I enjoy the smooth inhale and flavor profile.  \u000a\u000aJust after a few hits of exhale the effects hit me in the mind.  I start to become uplifted and happy; with a great sense of relaxation.  .  Although if I smoke too much lemon skunk it can start to send me into a very lazy mood.  &#127819;&#127819;&#127819;&#127819;\u000a\u000aLemon skunk will always be one to return to. &#128077;&#127996;

The taste brings memories of a lemon tart with a piney aftertaste. The first toke brings you into a energetic mindset and sets you down to a relaxing motivated mood. good for start of a day or increased appeite last between 3-5 hours using 1/4 of a gram of flower. \u000a\u000a\u000a

I enjoy it more than Og Kush, Gsc, Afghani, Sour diesel, etc. It has such a strong lemony scent to it, it doesn&#39;t taste quite lemony but maybe its because it wasn&#39;t on a vape etc, but it kicks harddd and really I love it and I recommend it to everyone.

VFirst impression is got to be the smell.  Strong lemon with just a hint of smoke and sweet.  On the draw it is extremely smooth.  On exhale it is cool and fruity with slight hint of lemon but not overpowering.  First few minutes require a bit of patience but well worth the short wait.  Next level hits with a moderate head band but soon fades to a euphoric, happy, floating, high.  After about 3 medium hits off small bowl I have to say I am feeling just right with the world.  Only negative is this incredible high does not last very long.  Top flight for about an hour and a half but soon starts to fade quickly and leaves you reaching for your next hit.

VI was looking forward to trying this one after my guitar buddy had me grab a wiff of this strain.  The nose appeal of this is off the charts.  I was so impressed, that I had the wife take a quick smell from the canister when I got home and she was equally impressed.  When we sat down to sample a few days later, she just smiled when I told her what we were smoking.  We were both expecting the same sort of insane taste as the aroma but found out it was much more subtle tasting.  Slightly sweet and a bit earthy and it was pretty easy on the inhale.  You could take a pretty decent rip and not hack your lungs out.  The effects were just like the aroma though.  It was very well balanced between a cerebral buzz and a body buzz.  The reviews indicated it leaned a bit on the sativa side but we found it was smack dab in the middle for us.  When I woke up about two hours after crashing I found I was still stoned...impressive.  Other than the one time getting up to whizz...we both had a great night&#39;s sleep.  Gotta give props to the guitar bud...he pick a winner.

VMigraine pain 5; nausea 6 when I medicated round 1530 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. No anxiety/paranoia (a must for me). Body high just what I needed. Head high strong &amp; happy. I could see having too much of this strain being a bad thing or maybe leading to some mild paranoia. But I didn&#39;t do that so it was freakin great! Lemon anything always has a heavenly, pungent lemongrass smell. Just now startin to come down over 3 hours later. Very nice. Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea! :-)

VThis is my second review for this strain because it&#39;s so damn good. Lemon Skunk just seems perfect for me. When ever I start feeling like the world is on my shoulders this bud just seems to take away all the depression and stress and it let&#39;s me look at life in a new and enlightened way. Although I&#39;ve smoked a lot of different strains, this one is probably my second favorite after Pineapple Purps.  It is like a smokeable source of sunshine...sweet. Give it a try and you&#39;ll be amazed at how centered it makes you feel.

VConsumption: Vaporizer (the mighty) and joints\u000a\u000aEffects: Solid day-time greens that are good for stress relief and general well-being. I felt good, happy, and functional with little euphoria or zoning out. Was able to speak to others without feeling delayed or out of it. Used it primarily during the day, but did provide a very slight body high too that made it less than ideal for working while high (although definitely do-able).\u000a\u000aSmell: as advertised, very citrusy nose with some earthy and skunks undertones. Strong smells.\u000a\u000aTaste: some citrusy notes up front, especially when first lit/heated but more earthy skunk immediately after, mellowing out to a mellow typical &quot;marijuana&quot; like smell. \u000a\u000aOverall: solid day-time greens that I would buy again and again, although the buds weren&#39;t super dense (moderately) they just smelled so damn good and were such a mellow high. I enjoyed it more so in joints where it was very smooth smoke, although it vaped pretty well too, just my preference. Hope you enjoy!

VLemon Skunk is one hell of a ride, from its delayed effects to their ability to absolutely floor you.

VGood daytime strain to alleviate depression.  Small amounts bring clarity and focus.  Larger amounts have the opposite effect; I get spacey, forgetful, and I pace around a lot, kind of like a haze strain but not as much fun.  For medicinal use, it&#39;s a 4 in the right amount and a 2.5 if you misjudge it.  I am giving it a 4 because the side effect profile is fantastic:  No dry mouth, no munchies, no red or irritated eyes.

VThis is a nice sativa heavy hybrid. Pretty strong stuff. Great uplifting effects which are great for PTSD &amp; depression. An overall spirit lifter. Strong but focused with a low dose. Smells like a skunk rolled in some pine sol. More like a lemon kush smell. I like this a lot. It can keep you up though so watch out if you&#39;re not used to sleeping on sativas.

VZesty and sweet lemon taste with this one, not as tart and citric as you would expect. Can definitely taste the old school columbian/ mexican sativa. This is that stuff that&#39;s great for daytime activities and is amazing for anxiety, it had me smiling for no reason about 15 minutes later. Dat perma-grin status, can&#39;t hide that face, oh no LOL!! Sampled this as Shatter awhile back and it was ridiculously terpy, almost like lemonade on a hot summer day or like when Lemonheads stop being sour and turn to sugary goodness.

VDefinitely one of my favored strains when I am feeling depressed. Lemon Skunk has a strong pungent odor, and is a smooth smoke. It is a definite uplifting experience, and this particular strain makes me very giggly! A great way to combat chronic depression is to have a bit of lemon skunk and put on your favorite stand up comedian! With a lemon and citrus taste, this strain is joy to smoke!

Helps with back pain and def vegg weed, find a comfy couch and get lost in a movie. Smooth comedown ( not too groggy. Great for making hash with the shake left over since leaves are covered in crystals. Top 5 strain in my book. Not the best but def a top tier strain.   \u000a\u000a

VSmoked a joint full of some very sticky Lemon Skunk. Surrounded by tall trees and a beautiful sunset. The high came out of nowhere. (If you&#39;re not a heavy smoker, go easy on this strain). Creeper is a great way to describe Lemon Skunk. As the effects wear off, your appetite demands you satisfy it immediately. I think this should be saved for a late afternoon/evening smoke. A must try if you ever come across the strain.

Did one with 0.5g Lemon Skunk and tobacco like i always do with new strains. The first sativa hits so strong and almost a psychedelic feeling. Euphric hits right after a while and the real high feeling leaves 30 to 40 mins to a more normal high. I was creative and have done some good paintings while smoking this strain. A day time smoke.

VLemon Skunk: has been effective for daytime functioning with chores and errands, I first thought that I wasn&#39;t affected but then I realized I was singing in the shower which is a monumental shift from depressed and refusing to shower, so Ls CAN be very helpful for me, however, one time I took a dose when I was already a bit anxious and it just sustained a low level of anxiety for 1.5 hrs, which was unpleasant, and another time I took a dose of Ls when I was just watching TV and I actually felt restless and irritated. I will use Ls only when I know I am about to start chores/errands.

VLooks: Light green with hints of purple here and there.  Lots of short thick orange hairs.  Covered in dense amber trichomes.  Average density but very, very sticky. \u000a\u000aSmell: Strong citrus with skunky undertones.  Almost like rotten lemons.  Very Pungent.\u000a\u000aTaste: Just like the smell but a little more skunky.  The smoke is very smooth, sometimes I forget to stop rippin\u2019 the bong cuz I can\u2019t feel the smoke!  Smoking it out of a vape is great too as it brings out all kinds of crazy flavors. \u000a\u000aBuzz Type: The high hits immediately, you feel it come over as you exhale.  It could be a little intense for some less experienced smokers as it is a strong sativa high.  The high transforms into a more indica stone.  The couch and a bag of chips will be your best friend.  A good day time smoke if you only take a few hits, but otherwise it\u2019s a great one to pack in the bong after a day of work.\u000a\u000a

VSmoked a joint full of some very sticky Lemon Skunk. Surrounded by tall trees and a beautiful sunset. The high came out of nowhere. (If you&#39;re not a heavy smoker, go easy on this strain). Creeper is a great way to describe Lemon Skunk. As the effects wear off, your appetite demands you satisfy it immediately. I think this should be saved for a late afternoon/evening smoke. A must try if you ever come across the strain.

VLemon Skunk is one hell of a ride, from its delayed effects to their ability to absolutely floor you. Even a small bowl of this strain has a way of making me feel very detached from the world around me. When I&#39;m seeking the kind of high that makes me both giggly and introspective, this is my go-to.\u000a\u000aOverall, a recent favorite that I see myself buying often. Smooth smoke, smooth vibes. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t recommend smoking a bowl of this strain thinking that you&#39;ll stay alert, because you won&#39;t, but that does make it a perfect bedtime companion.

Vbrought to us German patients under the disguise of Spectrum Cannabis&#39; &quot;Red No. 2&quot; (they won&#39;t even tell us indica/sativa here, no info for Germany!), it is one of very few sativa-dominant strains available.\u000a\u000aI simply love the smell of citrus and the taste of sweet lemon candy.\u000aI use it to combat fatigue from MS and it really works wonders - am truely glad to have gotten this medicine!\u000a\u000athat said, the situation iin Germany looks quite bad, they overcharge us extremely, pharmacies put a 100% surcharge on cannabis flos/flower!\u000athis brings eych and every strain to an average of 23,50\u20ac per g.\u000athis is simply unacceptable!\u000afar too expensive, it hurts our insurance and my doc&#39;s budget.\u000athere have to be changes to that law and fast!\u000a\u000aback to Lemon Skunk: it is uplifting and leeps me from doszing off during the day, taste and smell are fantastic, all citrus and sweet and no skunk in sight...or smelling range.\u000aLemon Skunk makes me want to type, so I started writing a novel. great for creative tasks.\u000a\u000awith a THC level of 17,9% it may not be the strongest, still, I always see these things as someone with a high tolerance, vaping 100-120g/month.\u000ait&#39;s not strong at all for me in my condition, buut 17,9% can definitely screw with people... however, Lemon Skunk is highly relaxing, without hindering your creativity or pinning you to the couch.\u000a\u000amy all-day. every day, at the moment (though, new strains are arriving from Canada, soon)!

VI got this strain for being a new patient at my local dispensary and it is by far my least favorite strain so far. Comes on slow and doesn&#39;t really give much mood elevation. I had no cares but there was no shiney happy feeling like I have gotten with other strains and I was an odd combination of sleepy and focused with a side of anxiety that lasted for half of the night.

Helps with back pain and def vegg weed, find a comfy couch and get lost in a movie. Smooth comedown ( not too groggy. Great for making hash with the shake left over since leaves are covered in crystals. Top 5 strain in my book. Not the best but def a top tier strain.   \u000a\u000a

VThis is a pretty &quot;classic&quot; strain. This is one of the more enjoyable smelling strains out there. Lemony skunky goodness reeks from these beautifully resin-coated buds. As you break up the nice dense buds the smell id overpowering and the crystal density is so high the buds glisten and look like they are dripping. Nice, light green color with a decent amount of hairs, but like i said before, resin production was ridiculous. The outside of the nugs were a little leafy due to a bad trim job and so they didnt look all that chrystally, but when you cracked a nug open, it was like a salt shaker. \u000aLemon skunk is one of my favorites for sure

V Taste just like lemon heads candy. It allowed me to focus if I wanted to, but if I didn&#39;t, it was very psychoactive. After 3.5 bowls, a spliff, and a gravity bong hit, with a total of about 2 grams by myself, I was seeing lighted flashing patterns all over the place. But still functional, when I smoked the spliff I was focused as fuck. Great smoke even though I&#39;m more of an indica fan.

VZesty and sweet lemon taste with this one, not as tart and citric as you would expect. Can definitely taste the old school columbian/ mexican sativa. This is that stuff that&#39;s great for daytime activities and is amazing for anxiety, it had me smiling for no reason about 15 minutes later. Dat perma-grin status, can&#39;t hide that face, oh no LOL!! Sampled this as Shatter awhile back and it was ridiculously terpy, almost like lemonade on a hot summer day or like when Lemonheads stop being sour and turn to sugary goodness.

VGood daytime strain to alleviate depression.  Small amounts bring clarity and focus.  Larger amounts have the opposite effect; I get spacey, forgetful, and I pace around a lot, kind of like a haze strain but not as much fun.  For medicinal use, it&#39;s a 4 in the right amount and a 2.5 if you misjudge it.  I am giving it a 4 because the side effect profile is fantastic:  No dry mouth, no munchies, no red or irritated eyes.

VI was turned on to this strain last summer and liked it immediately. At times I have such horrible back pain that causes my whole body to tense.

VThe smell is like a warning signal that you&#39;re about to get really frickin high! It smelled like earth with a hint of lemon. Beautiful orange hairs all over. It smokes outstandingly smooth when rolled in a blunt. When you hit it in a piece you get more of the lemon flavor. It&#39;s not one of those &quot;3 hits and you&#39;re already high&quot; type of smokes but it&#39;s one of those gradual &quot; oh shit I&#39;m high as hell&quot; smokes.

VThis was some real dank shit. I was so uplifted and excited about anything. This one definitely excited me though. for an easily or already excited person can raise danger. My heart rate went to 157 just from sitting down. I just tried to relax with my dog to calm mr. So I should&#39;ve paced myself because I wasn&#39;t aware of the potency but just FYI to anyone else. That being said, the intellectual journey I had was great.

Vi got 2 ounces of lemon skunk because the buds were very chunky, i loved the texture and insanely frosty as well. obviously texture and frost is going to vary from your source. the high was very euphoric and immediate, yet ephemeral. It lacked bodily effects, making it a good wake and baker. you need quite a bit to put you down, much more of a get you going strain, sativa dominant hybrid. ialso noticed more creativity. this strain is great to use in conjunction with other strains, mostly indica dominants to get a full array of desired effect. very flavorful smoke. zesty skunk, very tart and citrusy but with a slight, but piercing funkiness.

VBeing relatively new to smoking, I haven&#39;t gotten to try many strains yet. I got to try this for a few weeks right after trying Purple Afgani for the first time, and the results weren&#39;t quite as good as I expected. Compared to Pa, it&#39;s like a &#39;luke warm&#39; high. However, when compared to more common strains, it goes way beyond it&#39;s lesser developed counterparts. All in all, it&#39;s not terrible.

VNice clean head high mixed with some tingle in the upper body, however it doesn&#39;t seem to last too long and also kinda makes me want to do nothing.  Love the zesty smell and the pea-like structure of the buds.  In my opinion, this strain is best mixed with something else that has little more pep to it.
