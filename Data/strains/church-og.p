VBow down to the citrus jesus. \u000a\u000aJust like a good church, if there is such a thing, a little bit goes a long way. Too much and you will fall asleep in the pew, stinking like you just spent cash to take a nap in a uncomfortable spot.  It rings my cranium like the Bells Of St. Mary. True Indica, believe it!

VThis is the first and only (so far) indica I\u2019ve been able to thoroughly enjoy. Mentally, it is lightly relaxing and uplifting. Physically I find it very relaxing and opening, without any heaviness or lethargy. Kind of like a very mild muscle relaxer. Gives me the kind of high that feels almost like not being \u201chigh\u201d at all\u2014it peeled the stress and anxiety away and just left me feeling really good. An overall light and uplifting smoke good for daytime, social, or creative activities. Great anti-anxiety effects for me personally. Strong munchies though, like, real strong. \u000a\u000a(I am a super THC light weight and blend all my smokes with non-psychoactive herbs to dilute potency and control dosage.)

VChurch(2 bowls) (Indica) (Pipe)\u000a__________________________________________\u000a--Space..I feel the stars and the sky all around. The planets inside my soul to continue their exploration. The chair im sitting in is half way off the ground. The back 2 wooden stumps are the only thing keeping me up. when I tilt back and forth I feel as if I&#39;m being rocked by my love one in water. The feeling the baby has being rocked back and forth by their loving mother. The center of my forehead feels like a swirling pool of warm water and being sucked inside like an infinite vortex. My body rocks back and forth going simultaneously back and forth the other way. Creating a full body exploration of one&#39;s colors. Vibrating in three different dimension Red, Green, Purple. My pelvic region feels like the tip of my dick in the freezer. It&#39;s cold. And my hamstrings vibrate in 3 more dimensions but these arnt colors but 3D objects that are hallowed in the middle. My legs and feet are slightly warm. My feet are sweating but my feet are being swayed by the ocean waves. Slowly back and forth with the slow moving waves of the sand. Time has increased by at least 25%. Pretty amazing\u000a

VAs a Lyme sufferer,  and advocate, I tend to seek out strains that have amazing looks, smells, and taste, but my major focus is how well the strain does it&#39;s job in relieving pain and anxiety. Church OG, a hybrid of God&#39;s Gift and OG Kush is a definite winner on my list. It packs a smooth taste that starts off as very Earthy, before releasing a slight spicy, flowery terpene profile. Upon exhaling, the smoke expands to leave a slight tingle throughout the respiratory areas. This is followed by an immediate lift of the mind, that soon settles into a very relaxed, Zen like experience. This strain is not too heavy, in the sense that you cannot function mentally, but definitely puts some weight on the body, as you enter a couch lock like euphoria, even if you&#39;re still active. Great strain for pain management, when you don&#39;t want to just sleep it away... and the overall feeling of wellness and contentment from the actual THC profile,  make this a must have,  for all sufferers of pain related issues

All laughs aside -I noticed this strain was very friendly and happy but still indica, so no anxiety or jittery feeling. Highly recommended for chilling, watching a documentary, cooking or baking? I did smoked this st night when I was already tired from work and of course slept great and woke up good. Very pleased with Church OG&#128076;&#127996;

VSo I tried this last night and I really liked it. The high comes on in two phases for me. 1), is a heady happy feeling, 2) Is a warm all over body feeling. Honestly it felt like I was turning into jello. A happy glob of sleepy jello. It was a very pleasant sensation. Also sensations like brushing my teeth or using the nail brush was oddly interesting and I wanted to continue those sensations for an extended period of time. In any case it was a good strain. The pain melted away in my back and I felt really good. Woke up refreshed and relatively pain free. A little tired still.

VSmooth tokin!  Earthy and a little fruity.  Definitely taste good.  It&#39;s mellow yet makes you more creative.   You can feel both indica and sativa effects.  Only downfall seems to make my headaches worse.  Still manageable though.   I say worth a try.

VI had this and it made me hallucinate, become paranoid, and upped my anxiety. I can only say this from personal experience. Don&#39;t shy away from a strain just because this happened to another person; I already have psychosis and it did not help me and it made everything elevated and worse, unfortunately.

VI&#39;d rank this up there with a good GDP, 97 Pre-Bubba, and other great Kush-hybrids. Very heavy and all-encompassing, a nighttime fave with sweet cerebral notes makes for lovely dreaming. Not a good medication to be out in public, or operating heavy equipment.

VIndica effect for sure, with a earthy smell &amp; taste. She is about feelings, and body sensations. Her Sativa aspects are focus, liveness and present spirit. There is a happy and relaxing chill vibe with her.  Church OG is excellent for socializing when smoking together as a group of a few or creative alone. There are other Sativa&#39;s I prefer in more active situations. Her prescences comes from deep grounding and aliveness- but not energetic. I definitely see that the medical values such as pain or stress are relieved from this God Gaia Medicine.\u000a\u000aWithin the range of indicas, her gifts are happiness, internal focus, and feeling sedatively (!) in love with the holy Godly moment of now.\u000a\u000a-Northston.
