VHoly shit.  Vaped this strain. Was so good I took five long draws and was totally fucked up within 7 minutes.  Felt like I was floating and my mouth and lips were numb; felt like I just left the dentist shot up with novocaine.  The high lasted 2 hours - all I wanted to do was lay down and felt like I was floating in the clouds.  Tastes amazing.  I&#39;d recommend 2 three second draws and go from there - because 5 draws fucked me up to the point I felt like I was taking an LSD trip.

V*Just before you read, this review is strictly based on high alone.* \u000a\u000asmoked on Christmas day. it&#39;s nice in your body. I can really feel that sativa. I feel very alert. but numbing body high from the indica. Let me smoke more before I continue. Definitely gave me the munchies. Got myself some pokemon moon. I&#39;m having a good time. hit me up if you Wana chat. *note makes you friendly * \u000akeep a glass of water around. Dry mouth is a thing. loving Christmas carols right now so liking the art. VERY euphoric. music and this is the right choice. Also you get very dizzy. colours are very clear. honest this might be the best high I have ever been on. wow I&#39;m really euphoric right now. please I feel like I&#39;m floating away. My mathematic skills feel like they have increased a substantial amount. Warning very dizzy. but very euphoric and heavy body high.

VA friend of my grew this lovely sativa and was kind enough to let me sample a half ounce of smoke. \u000a\u000aLet&#39;s start with bud structure, light and fluffy with long foxtails that pack tons of terpey goodness into each bowl.\u000a\u000aThe smell is delicious, just one quick pop of the top and Sweet citrus hits your nose like a heavyweight boxer.\u000a\u000aTaste is a thick tangie and orange flavor blend that will have your mouth watering in no time. \u000a\u000aThe stone is very unique. Had some at 6 in the morning on my day off and really enjoyed watching the sun come up with my two weiner dogs. Pleasant morning buzz.\u000a\u000aOverall I&#39;d say 4.6 out of 5.-Budsey

VIf there was ever something one would consider a &quot;clean&quot; high, this is it. Everything you want in a Sativa minus the negatives (racing thoughts, anxiety, paranoia). \u000a\u000aAs an occasional user using a small amount, roughly 100mg, in a joint was enough to turn everythig up to 11. Melt away stress and enduce a functional relaxation that was quite pleasureable.\u000a\u000aSlept this beauty off and feel as if nothing transpired the previous night. TOP SHELF high all around.

VThis strain has just taken the spot for my favorite daytime fix.  I was visiting my bro in Eugene, Or and after some advise from a local working at the Vintage, we made our way to Flowr of Lyfe.  So we picked up a 1/4 oz and some rolling papers and headed back to my bros house.  Living in Seattle, I miss be able to hand wash my car in the driveway, so I figured this would be a great chance to do that.  We rolled up a few joints and after two good hits, you can feel the effects kicking in.  I love the clarity you have and uplifting boost of energy which really lasts a long time.  I ended up washing and waxing 3 cars.  I can definitely see using this strain on my next backpacking trip or day hike!  The flavor notes of sweet citrus are smooth, and the buds were so sticky and covered in trichomes.  I will be looking for some in Seattle!

VI had gotten used to vaping Sour Diesel, so when I tried out Sour Tangie for the first time, I was blown away! \u000a\u000aThe first thing I noticed right off the bat was how well the cartridge I received hit. Lots of smoke in even a short hit. Immediately following was the citrus taste. It was strong, but not overwhelming. \u000aThe high is pretty enjoyable. It doesn&#39;t make me drowsy, but sleeping on it is a fantastic experience. I haven&#39;t slept that well in years!\u000a\u000aMy cartridge ended up lasting me two days. Everyone I know loves it, myself definitely included. I absolutely love this strain, even more so than its parent Sour Diesel.

My body high is making me feel as though I&#39;m swimming in thick syrup, but I&#39;m full of energy. This taste is a mix of earthy sour tangerine, as weird as that sounds it works very well together. This high just hit me like a train. It&#39;s made everyone here so full of life and talkative.

V\u2022 Grabbed a 3-pack of Sour Tangie pre-rolls at same time I bought the oil that I previously reviewed.. The thc-content is 19% &amp; the flavor|smoke|high is true to its&#39; (ECS)Diesel-lineage, including the Tangie undertones. \u2014 Altho seems to be a true-20% (as leafly describes) with its&#39; mild &#127818; citrusy taste, low cannibinoid- &amp; terpene-profile. Smooth + easy to smoke, a SoLiD 4.5 \u2728 strain.. Appropriately stone-y, as it calms me when necessary (&#161;just now!) + allows me focus when project-at-hand.. \u2022 this is likely a good strain for both newbies &amp; &#39;ol timers, &#128076;&#127995; alike bc not-fire &#128293;! \u2022 \u270c&#127997; \u2764\ufe0f &#127802; &#127752; &#129412; for all! \u2022

I have been told it also my be for the elevated CBD level. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a good day smoke and get things done in the right dosis.

We have had some excellent conversations and the atmosphere is very relaxed and bright.

Great Little Dispensary out in North County San Diego, where suburbs give way to country.  Can&#39;t recall the exact THC test results displayed at the Dispensary, but its well above 25%.  This is what a Sativa Experience is all about ! A functional  Euphoric, Blissful, Sociable, Slap a Stoney Grin on your ass high.  No Paranoia and no Racey Heart.  A high that pleasantly lingers for a couple of hours.  This one I always want to be well stocked with :)  Get yourself a gram of this when its in stock and puff puff Party!

Tastes like Tang, and lemonade, and everything citrus and sweet with a little pungent diesel.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I tried this in a vape cartridge a while back and wasn&#39;t a huge fan, mostly because I had also recently smoked a Durban Poison cart and this one wasn&#39;t as massively uplifting or speedy.\u000a\u000aHowever, I&#39;m closing in on 24 hours of a terrible migraine.  AK-47 didn&#39;t help at all.  No OTC medicines, sleep, ice, dark, etc made me functional.\u000a\u000aSour Tangie did.  I will keep it forever in my medicine cabinet for that alone.  It didn&#39;t cure the migraine, but I feel a lot better after micro dosing a couple times.

VLovely New Favorite. Got 1.5 grams today, and I can already tell this is a damn great motivator. There&#39;s nice head melting indica, hearing echos of deep sound makes music stand out more, but the energetic side is more motivating to what ever you are doing. Going on a hike take this to achieve your goal with 0 stress. Love how it just helps me rather than getting in my way, or making me tired. It also makes a great impression on taste very sour n sweet kind of like lemon icing. The next Time I get paid I&#39;m getting 7G of this it is that great of a motivator. I am wholeheartedly in love with the taste and how I accomplishing sooooo much! It causes a little bit of dizziness and head pressure. Not bad on the dry mouth and practically no dry eyes. If you need motivation if you&#39;re super depressed or have already giving into the closed off alone negativity, it has a way of showing you how to turn things around for the better impossible to think negatively. I am also kind of giggly and bubbly thanks to this sour tangie :DDDD

VThis strain just looks so beautiful! The buds are spectacular, an incredible amount of orange hairs running through out it. Has a distinct diesel taste to it with hints of a lemon taste. The high does the job, you&#39;re stoned but you&#39;re alert at the same time. Good for a daytime smoke and a walk through thee neighborhood.

VI&#39;ve vaped several really good 80/20 Sativa Dom. Hybrids including Goji OG, Super Lemon Haze, Ghost Train Haze, Sour Diesel, Acapulco Gold and Sour Tangie.  I like them all but Sour Tangie may just be my favorite of the group.  \u000aAs far as the flavor goes, it has a very skunky, citrusy sort of taste to it.  As far as effects, it&#39;s very euphoric and cerebral.   This would be an excellent strain to pair with a good comedy.  Just be sure to have snacks, refreshments and eye drops close by.

VThis is one of the \u201cfun\u201d sativas. More along the lines of recreational versus medical. I say that it\u2019s recreational because you will want to be outside, or binge trippy YouTube videos, just enjoying whatever the world offers for your senses to enjoy. I also found myself being incredibly talkative to the point where I thought I was being too obvious, and I hadn\u2019t even taken more than two hits from my Stiiizy cartridge. You\u2019ll definitely get a creative boost from this strange. If I were in any art profession where telling a story were the goal, this would be a strain I\u2019d go to. There\u2019s also very little raciness to it, unlike some other sativas. However as an added bonus, there is some moderate muscle relaxation in this sativa. But every sativa is different. Jack Herer just sort of clears my head with a slight energy buzz, but that\u2019s literally all it does for me. Sour Tangie boost your mood, brings physical relaxation, increases your cerebral function and in high doses can be borderline psychedelic. Altogether, this is a strain I\u2019d want with me if I were going to Disneyland or Monterey Bay Aquarium. You know, something fun for the senses.

This strain is exactly what I need in the morning to get up and be able to live my day. A half gram of sour tangie and a few cups of coffee really makes my day better. I do suffer from pretty severe anxiety as well and so far this strain has been fine. It&#39;s never made me anxious or paranoid. I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who&#39;s looking for a good, happy, energy high.

VThis is a fantastic start your day, good morning strain.  I rolled a 1gram cone of HEF&#39;s Sour Tangie to begin the day, it was impressive.  I enjoyed the sour diesel taste mixed with citrus, definitely true to the flavors.  My flower tests at 10.33% THC, the last time I smoked a low testing strain I was blown back by how good it was.  This remains true for ST.  Not too heady as some sativas are known to be.  Not too couchy, but I feel very motivated and energized.

VBeing a novice cannabis user (I&#39;ve been experimenting with different strains for the past year), it was after consuming this particular strain that I felt compelled to create a user account and leave a review. I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder (Chronic Anxiety). I can tell you that this strain is a game-changer for me. The racing thoughts, worry and sadness disappeared rather quickly after only 2 hits (Remember, I&#39;m a beginner). I actually felt like a normal person, not having to constantly battle my own mind. This isn&#39;t a destructive self-medication story, rather a beneficial and positive example of how cannabis is an aiding, helpful remedy. I know everyone responds differently to various strains but if you are suffering from similar ailments such as mine look no further than Sour Tangie for (at the very least) a glimmer of hope in your approach to alleviating your struggle. I am NOT the type of person who is quick to declare a strain effectual and it is only after many &quot;trial and error&quot; sessions with different strains that I can absolutely and irrevocably state that medicinal cannabis can and does work. Again, I would have never taken the time to create a &quot;username&quot; and compose and submit a review if I wasn&#39;t 100% sure my experience was an accurate and helpful one. That being said, give Sour Tangie a chance and if it&#39;s not for you? Fear not! As I&#39;m sure there is a strain out there that can and will work for you. Be patient. Trust me. I know. Be well!

Became very talkative, got more touchy feely, weird thoughts, gets you sleepy, have to poop after a while so maybe it\u2019s like a mini detox, motor skills could be better, sometimes I was lost with my words and actions, didn\u2019t do a lot of \u201cthinking before doing\u201d, sometimes I forget what I was talking about mid sentence, ya get a little of the shakes, a friend of mine got high just by looking at me when I was on this stuff, then while I was vaping the extract I was also making out with my girlfriend, she got high, there was no halt of laughter.

VBeing a novice cannabis user (I&#39;ve been experimenting with different strains for the past year), it was after consuming this particular strain that I felt compelled to create a user account and leave a review. I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder (Chronic Anxiety). I can tell you that this strain is a game-changer for me. The racing thoughts, worry and sadness disappeared rather quickly after only 2 hits (Remember, I&#39;m a beginner). I actually felt like a normal person, not having to constantly battle my own mind. This isn&#39;t a destructive self-medication story, rather a beneficial and positive example of how cannabis is an aiding, helpful remedy. I know everyone responds differently to various strains but if you are suffering from similar ailments such as mine look no further than Sour Tangie for (at the very least) a glimmer of hope in your approach to alleviating your struggle. I am NOT the type of person who is quick to declare a strain effectual and it is only after many &quot;trial and error&quot; sessions with different strains that I can absolutely and irrevocably state that medicinal cannabis can and does work. Again, I would have never taken the time to create a &quot;username&quot; and compose and submit a review if I wasn&#39;t 100% sure my experience was an accurate and helpful one. That being said, give Sour Tangie a chance and if it&#39;s not for you? Fear not! As I&#39;m sure there is a strain out there that can and will work for you. Be patient. Trust me. I know. Be well! Word :-)

VCurrently trying in oil form. I\u2019m not sure how a lot of Medical Oils work compared to flower, but this one is impressive. I have been logging usage of every strain I tried since college. I have always since a child suffered from ADD, trying different medications, natural remedies etc. Sour Diesel was my savior in college, and had razor sharp focus. Always ran the risk of getting overly focused by getting too roasted, then my OCD would kick in and I\u2019d be on same task for hours or be focused on a distraction and start washing, counting, re organizing all my damn dishes and kitchen stuff. Sour Tangie has a good sense of awareness and with ADD is a perfect cocktail. Never tried the other strain but it seems to give me energy and Mental motivation not to mention really good cognitive recall (sharpened short term memory). Definitely recommend this strain to anyone suffering from adult ADD will change your life. Comment back!

VHoly Orange Bateman! First thing I notice is the smell, extremely citrus, but definitely distinguishable as orange/tangerine. A creeper I feel, as soon as I exhale I want another hit. However, as every second passes I may be wrong, cause I&#39;m pretty head stoned. But clearly thinking. A nice mixture. \u000aI will maybe not get a 8er of this just cause I am a indica dominant type guy, but very refreshing, like orange juice in the morning. \u000a\u000aI feel stoned, but I still feel sharp. Yahtzee. 8/10 \u000aI&#39;m impressed for a sativa.

Vjust caped some sour tangie and the flower I got smells and tastes like sour diesel and he high is very similar to sour diesel, which I love!  this strain is uplifting and creative but is more mellow than other sativas I have tried.  overall, sour tangie is a pretty nice flower.  sour tangie didn&#39;t cause me to panic so it&#39;s a great sativa for me.  \u000a

VSour Tangie is such a good sativa strain that time seems so slow and you just get lost in your thoughts. It hits fast and lasts long. A really great sativa strain but it makes you a bit paranoid.

VThis strain is one of my favorites. All cannabis strains act as aphrodisiacs for me but Sour Tangie is the best. I smoked a couple of bowls the other day and I ended up with an 8 hour erection.

VParsley. I smoke Sour Tangie and my mouth is FILLED with the taste of parsley. I don\u2019t pick up any hints of fruit at all. That being said, I love this strain. It\u2019s the kind of weed that goes perfectly with a wake-n-bake, or having a smoke with your parents. But seriously:  Parsley.

VSour Tangie is the PERFECT strain to start the day off with. It combines the uplifting effects of a Diesel with the energetic effects of Tangie and leaves you with a clear-headed, smile inducing &quot;get up and go&quot; strain that has no body high to speak of. The high will leave you in the perfect mood to get through the day, regardless of any bullshit that comes your way. If you&#39;re looking for a clear-headed, energetic strain that isn&#39;t racy or anxiety prone that will leave you happier then being trapped in a room with 10 loving puppies (seriously, this strain eradicates any bad mood/depression instantly.) Hands down this strain is one of my all-time favorites; 5/5.

VI\u2019m usually not a big sativa guy, but I was really impressed with this stuff. Super citrusy aroma, nice looking bud kind of light camo in appearance. I put it in a small glass bong and the smoke was thick but pleasant with some sweetness and definite citrus notes. The stone is solid. Uplifting and cerebral. I kind of a felt a little like headband in pressure on the frontal lobe. All in all I loved it.

VSour Tangie looks and smells very nice, light green colour buds with orange hairs and a layer of trichomes over it all. It does smell pretty citrus like but more surprising is it&#39;s diesel like smell which is a nice touch. After smoking some the effects were really euphoric, happy and mellow relaxed feelings. A great strain overall would try again for sure, seems great for any day or maybe even night time activities/hobbies.

VOne of the best Sativas I have had the pleasure of consuming. It hits all the points that you need from a Sativa - creativity, uplifting, energetic, even philosophical at times. It does it all while tasting delicious. It almost doesn&#39;t seem fair to try to compare any other Sativa to this. This set a new bar for me, pushing down Super Lemon Haze to #2 on my list. The only negative I experienced was that it was very easy to get too high. Now, this is also a positive seeing as you can just smoke less and get just as high as you&#39;re comfortable with. I can&#39;t express how much I would recommend Sour Tangie to any Sativa lover. Do yourself a solid and try out this strain.\u000aUsed in flower form, both in a conventional pipe and vaporizer (Boundless CF).

VI\u2019m usually not a big sativa guy, but I was really impressed with this stuff. Super citrusy aroma, nice looking bud kind of light camo in appearance. I put it in a small glass bong and the smoke was thick but pleasant with some sweetness and definite citrus notes. The stone is solid. Uplifting and cerebral. I kind of a felt a little like headband in pressure on the frontal lobe. All in all I loved it.

VSour Tangie is the PERFECT strain to start the day off with. It combines the uplifting effects of a Diesel with the energetic effects of Tangie and leaves you with a clear-headed, smile inducing &quot;get up and go&quot; strain that has no body high to speak of. The high will leave you in the perfect mood to get through the day, regardless of any bullshit that comes your way. If you&#39;re looking for a clear-headed, energetic strain that isn&#39;t racy or anxiety prone that will leave you happier then being trapped in a room with 10 loving puppies (seriously, this strain eradicates any bad mood/depression instantly.) Hands down this strain is one of my all-time favorites; 5/5.

VEast coast meets the west coast to inspire a potent and tasty strain. Euphoric, happy, uplifting, slightly energetic. Feel it in my eyes, cheeks, and chest. Nerves slightly relaxed. Tastes like a mixed alcoholic orange drink that&#39;s been evaporated. Smell is the taste but stronger and more pungent. Looks like some frosty large nugs tight nugs from being sticky. Lots of of small thin copper hairs. Resin heads are a even mix of clear, cloudy, and amber. Excellent wake and bake strain. Socializing, outdoor activities, errands while enjoying Sour tangie is recommended. Negatives are minimal, but may cause anxiety with a low tolerance. I keep getting sour tangle, it comes close to being a favorite strain of mine.

VI feel this is an unfair assessment being that I took two Vicodin today (like an idiot) so I&#39;m feeling like complete shit and drained. Usually nothing can make me feel better, nothing. I smoked this for the first time, turned on some &quot;city of sun&quot; and a blanket of comfort and relaxation came over me like a safety net. Grounded my mind and made me see clearly. Very focused high. Tingly and calming. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because it doesn&#39;t last very long at all but other than that it did something nothing else in the world can do.

VI&#39;m sometimes skeptical about trying sativas because I have anxiety and obviously do not want to increase that. but this sativa is great, doesn&#39;t give me anxiety at all. it does give me a nice energy boost in the morning, but if I smoke more than one bowl from my little pipe, it makes me more tired. like last night I smoked quite a bit of this and slept SO good!

VThought it&#39;d be a lot like my favorite, Dour Diesel, but no. Horrible tasting. In 35 years, I&#39;ve never *not* been able to hit on a strain because it tasted so nasty. I had to flush an eighth because I couldn&#39;t get past the first nug. YMMV.\u000a\u000aFortunately, my awesome dispensary provided great customer service.

VIt really does have that slightly sour, but sweet tangerine taste to it.  Made all my food taste a little sour after vaping it - my grapes tasted amazing!  I love sour though.  I did get VERY dizzy though, almost instantly.  I had a hard time standing up, felt like the room was spinning.  I wasn&#39;t tired at all, I was quite focused &amp; energized.  Gave me motion sickness when I tried standing, so I&#39;d suggest daytime use or when you need a good boost of energy.  I also had a bit of the jitters - I&#39;m not used to having energy, I&#39;m pretty depleted of it everyday, so it was neat to feel energy for once.  Didn&#39;t do much for pain.

Super fragrant diesel smell with a hint of citrus. Intense, clear headed, relaxed yet uplifted Initial cerebral high. Flows into ....Energetic. Creative. Happy. great for the day time and project doing... Mellows out after 20-30 minutes into a chill head space

When we have the GP mass tgest done we will confirm if there is actually two different terpenes in the plant. Only private reserve on our shelf after each member gets one 1/8th

VAs everyone says, yes it&#39;s super delicious. Reminded me of tangerines in both smell and taste. The taste is the best because it makes your whole mouth taste citrusy with a long lasting aftertaste. My fingers reeked of the smell also so be warned of its pungency. The bud was really dense and extremely crystallized, just like I like em. This resulted in bowls that smoked for a long time which I prefer. Wouldn&#39;t recommend for joints as it might not burn well, or at least needs to be ground well. Any lovers of Sour Diesel need to try this one for sure!

VI got a veganic version of this strain at Buds and Roses Collective. It made for a very nice and mellow smoke. However tiredness and drowsiness wasn&#39;t an issue with this strain and it helped with my painting. So it did mellow me out, but didn&#39;t put me to sleep. I love that veganic version of this strain because that means there was no animal products in the soil when the plant was grown, and to me that&#39;s the healthiest plant you can get. It feels like a very clean and nice high. I highly recommend.

VI took two hits of a Sour Tangie vape cartridge that clocked in at 95%, and that\u2019s all I needed.  I cleaned the kitchen then cleaned the pantry out of stale crackers.  I couldn\u2019t sit still and I felt like getting errands done but perhaps driving wasn\u2019t the best choice because I had a paranoia episode that almost made me pull over to gather myself but I pulled through.  I was really high for about 3 hours but it was my first time smoking Sour Tangie so I\u2019ll see if the next buzz lasts that long.  This put me in a great mood and I got things accomplished, worth a shot if you enjoy sativas.
