V&quot;HortiLab Seeds present another new sativa hybrid - Sour Power. They found a sativa dominant sister of the &#39;StarBud&#39; and then pollinated her with their ECSD v3 Sour daddy to create this brilliant strain.&quot;\u000a\u000a- http://en.seedfinder.eu/strain-info/Sour_Power/HortiLab/\u000a\u000aI have been living in Sativa Land for most my smoking years and diluted genetics have seemed to plague my choices in Washington, but the Downtown Cannabis Company genetic is great. This strain is up there with some of the best genetics I&#39;ve tried yet, but as I have experienced in anything, why complicate a good thing? A strong Sour D genetic would be my personal preference, unless this pheno profile was conducive to your exact needs. Which is the beauty of this, isn&#39;t it?

VAlright, let me start off with how the bud looks. The buds were big, beautiful and simply AMAZING. The buds were pointy, it had a pale, yet strong green color. There were some purple hairs on it which made it look that much more amazing. Now the was a ass load of crystals on this bud. It looked like someone got pinch fulls of powdered sugar and put it on this thing. I know this Strain was going to be amazing when I was about to hit it. The bud was extremely sticky too. When I opened the container holding this bud, the second I opened it in the car, my mom said &quot;Jesus! It smells so good!&quot; The thing stunk up the whole car and the smelled lingered for about 45 minutes. Took it home to show to my brothers and sisters, it stunk up the house and the smell stayed for about two hours. Folks, when your bud does this, you KNOW you have good bud. Onto the taste part. Well, the taste was very earthy, &quot;skunky&quot; and &quot;Fuel&quot; like with hints of flower on the exhale, especially through the nose. I loved that about this strain. It took the weirdest combinations and made it work. Now then, the high was just great. Seriously! I felt very relaxed but also in the mood to do some yard work. This strain is somewhat of a rarity but if you happen to find this one at your local dispensary, drop what ever you&#39;re buying and get this strain. You will thank me for it.

VI&#39;ve recently been smoking indicas so I was very excited to try this strain considering it is supposed to be a strong sativa. Anyways long story short I took around 5 fat &quot;one hitters&quot; from the bong before i consumed my other strain Sunset Sherbert, and the high was very trippy in the sense that everything came to life and objects appeared to be breathing. A very strong mind high that may make newbies a little freaked out for a second if not careful. Overall a great social strain and definitely a strain to impress your friends with. Would recommend to those with any mental health problems and it would probably work great for those suffering from headaches.

VI have had this strain. The name &quot; Sour Power&quot; put feet in my heart. I smoked Crappy strains before and sour power got a KICK to it . Due to high THC levels I experienced &quot; Munchies&quot;

VI put this more in the Indica side of a hybrid or a 50/50 balance based on the phenotype I experienced. Classic cannabis taste thats sour and little skunky with smooth herbal and berry undertones. Mellow high. It can be blended with anything when dabbing which is I think the Indica / Sativa ratio is balanced. It works well for ADD/ADHD but needs more Sativa to be a full time medicine. Works well for stress and anxiety from PTSD. Not a huge stand out but it\u2019s one of those versatile stains, like blue cookies, that just goes with everything.

VMine smells like sour acrid berries.  I made edibles with it to really get to know it well.  It\u2019s uplifting but not racy and it definitely had me lmao at stupid sh*t earlier.  It\u2019s trippy and cerebral and very much a head high.  For me it calmed my anxiety and I just feel content.

VOne of my favorites. The head and body highs are both quite enjoyable, and when I smoke enough, I feel very creative and happy. I also catch myself laughing a lot. I&#39;m on it right now, which urged me to write this review. It&#39;s also helping me GREATLY with my cramps that were tearing me apart this morning.
