VPicked up some Super Sour Widow rosin and went home, took a dab and instantly felt so much better. My pain was gone, anxiety gone, I was giggly and euphoric, I loved it. Definitely recommend this strain.

VThe strain is undoubtedly potent, only needing one bowl to get decently high.\u000a\u000aThe downsides with this strain is its psychoactivity which makes it very harsh on smokers with anxiety etc.

VA very staggering euphoric strain that&#39;s highly potent. Great for recreation and pain management . Not for use during important task. Intense psychoactive affect.

VLove this strain, it combines all the best parts it&#39;s parents and produces a smooth, light and euphoric high with the added effect of a significant amount of CBD.  This strain is excellent for beginners as it does not have the harsher side effects of many strains.  It works well for pain, anxiety, and depression, and is also a &quot;social strain&quot; and can generally be used by those with social anxiety .  It also produces excellent extracts, which I snatch up whenever I find them.

VJust tried this today. Picked it up at my favorite dispensary, The Vault, in Lake Stevens. I picked up a gram of Super Widow (super sour widow) BHO for $20. It is 80.45% and a Sativa hybrid.  Omg. This strain is amazing. One dab, and I\u2019m golden. Very cerebral at first and then goes into a tingle down your shoulders. I don\u2019t feel stuck to the couch and in fact am going to go do the dishes! \u000aOh it\u2019s by Royal Oil Bad Ass Herbs
