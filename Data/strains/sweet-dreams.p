VSo I tried Sweet dreams for the first time about a week ago, and I right away fell in love. This is a hybrid Indica dominate strain, right away once you opened the container you right away smell this skunky, Kush like ammonia smell. The buds we perfectly trimmed and very green, it smokes real smooth, and it has a musty-earth flavor to it which to me taste perfectly. It does have a tendency to creep up on you though, it left me feeling relaxed and help me get a great nights rest. I also use it for my anxiety and it has worked wonders for me as well.

Vi had two experiences with this, one great, one awful. the first time was awesome. i was a little sluggish and was definetly a poor choice of strain for going hiking, but i was relaxed and happy. the second time i smoked more and i had a hard time with depth perception, walking, and communicating as if i was sober. i had to stay in bed the rest of the night because i felt so incapable moving. good in moderation, but in large amounts it can be very negative

Vlet&#39;s get one thing straight. the only reason I&#39;m giving it three stars is because of how sleepy it made me ! I&#39;m normally not too fond of indica type strains as much as I am w/ sativa ! I like being giggly :-D although, the smell is very appealing ! I&#39;d definitely recommend it to anyone who&#39;s just trying to catch some z&#39;s asap lol.

VThis 1000 mL oil tank from PTS, is the only current indica offering in the 1000 mL tank product line. The flavor is very heavy pine with a myr/sage finish. The terpenes are very strong and the flavor was off-putting for me. The first few puffs felt like pine cleaning fluid. The effect was moderate relaxation, pain relief, and clearing of invasive thoughts. This was also the only tank from PTS that I tried which clogged up during use. Overall I think that this product was decent, but needs some revisions for the amount of terpenes added back to the oil. At $70, it was still a very reasonable amount to try something new and different. I can admit that maybe I would like this strain more if I enjoyed the flavor.

VSweet dreams is a wonderful tasting strain- almost a creamy hoppy flavor. I enjoyed it- didn&#39;t find its properties to be too suited for patients with high pain. It was however still a tasty smoke.
