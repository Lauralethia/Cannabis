VA very strong strain, with sweet smell and soft smoke. It is veryuplifting  and euphoric. The buzz lasts for a very long time, and is a mixture of body high and head high, almost has a bit of mushroom-like effect. Very good choice for partying and social interaction, as well as meditation and spirituality.

VI got this from a friend who got it from Burning Man and I was just floored by it. I was struck with how hazy and sluggish I felt within minutes. thinking was hard and I couldn&#39;t feel any of my limbs. definitely a good strain for anyone who wants to relieve pain or anxiety or just relax. i became very sleepy afterwards, so insomnia sufferers will like this. Any attempt I made to speak ended in just rambling which quickly devolved into fits of laughter. This is by far the best shit I&#39;ve ever had.

V&quot;This is by far my favorite strain! haze pushes through my tolerance level, and sometimes when I smoke it feels like I&#39;m smoking for the first time. I can get real focused on a video game or show, and be totally involved in it. Great strain to watch nature shows with :)&quot;

VDefinitely one of my top 5 strains. The oz I picked up was super sticky and dense. One of my favorite smokes for sure. Very relaxing and helps with my anxiety for hours to come unlike many other strains. It&#39;s absolutely loaded with resin. If you get a chance to try this weed don&#39;t pass it up.

VLarge, dark nugs with a few orange hairs. Smell is sweet and earthy with a strong undertone of pine and fuel. Tastes decidedly piney with a harsh earthy, sour exhale.\u000aThe high starts quickly-in under 2 minutes. It\u2019s super relaxing with solid pain relief and a mild head buzz. Not spacey but certainly introspective and care free. You\u2019ll want to snack so have munchies on hand.\u000aThis is a functional indica, ideal for a lazy Sunday but you could also use this to spark an outdoor adventure or enhance activities.

VOdd name because the flavor of the smoke doesn&#39;t match the name. That is my only real quirky complaint about an otherwise fine product. Upon inhalation you will experience a light to moderate warm peppery taste with an extremely light aftertaste of berry. Cerebral effects are almost immediate. With effort you can get a whole body buzz. I find this one to work well when I need to do my chores or anything where creativity is needed! I do recommend this!

The smell and taste to this strain left a strong  berry-cheesy flavor and pine smell. The overwhelming euphoria, body tingling, numbing feeling you get is great. Pain and stress melt away with the feeling of going to bed. I would buy this again!
