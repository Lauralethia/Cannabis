VI have grown numerous strains and this strain is by far the best that I have grown and smoked.   The buzz lasted for almost 3 hours maybe more.  I found my self doing dishes and cleaning the house with a stupid grin on my face.  Very up and happy.  All my friends who love sativa  absolutely love this Strain.  They love the sweet taste,  the strength and length of the high.  Shanti has done awesome work with this strain.

VThis strain is primarily a sativa strain, But does definitely plant you when you&#39;re relaxed. The buds have a very strong mango aura and are very dense. Generally will be sold in smaller dense buds over one large bud. This strain is definitely more aimed at the seasoned smoker it will kind of be like a spaceship flying, and you&#39;re not connected to it, you&#39;re just floating along. But for the newbie bong rippers this will be like &quot;Woah! is this real? Haha lifes great. I need food. Woah!&quot; *commence sleep*. So yeah I rate 5 stars!

Nothing to write home about but I tend to be underwhelmed by flower taste. Great for flower. 1.5/2 Stars.\u000aFeel: Fun, social, and very warm high. Made my boyfriend freak out physically and mentally as he is a once in a while stoner. Made me very racy and kind of foggy and anxious. Do not go out to eat, especially not to a sit down restaurant on this. 1/2 Stars.\u000aRanking: An okay sativa. I like the smell but necessarily the effect and there are other strains that taste similarly and don&#39;t make me as racy. I would recommend to more low-energy, laid back friends. 0.5/1 Star.\u000a\u000aTotal: 4 Stars.

VFor me the dominant effects of Mango Haze were a great buzzing body high with a clear focused energy.  \u000aI also appreciated that it left me quite functional, well co-ordinated and motivated to get stuff done around the house. \u000a\u000aDefinitely happy pot as well. I laughed a little bit but to me it seems more of a joyous high.\u000a\u000a I  also didn&#39;t experience any anxiety (and some strains do make me anxious). Personally I get anxious with strains that make me dizzy, Mgh isn&#39;t one of them. It had a calming effect overall.\u000a\u000aIt also hit my system quick, feeling the start of the high in around 5 minutes via a water bong.  With a DaVinci Ascent vape it was much more of a head high.  I prefer smoking it as opposed to vaping it.\u000a\u000aFlavour-wise I noticed the pepper most distinctly.

VI got a hold of a variant of Mango Haze that I was told was high in CBD. It made me feel calm but uplifted at the same time. It has a unique sort of high to it. It feels like a &quot;low strength&quot; cannabis but that&#39;s fine, those are actually tough to find. An enjoyable experience all around, not what I expected. It really does taste like mango! \u000a\u000aAgain, this was a variant that had high CBD, and I don&#39;t think standard Mango Haze sativa would be like this. It would probably be a lot stronger.

VThe buds on this strain glow when you shine a light on them. I took 3 hits of a small bowl with my\u000aBubbler, I could feel the euphoric sensation taking over within a couple of minutes. I soon began to feel relaxed and happy out, the buildings around me lit up. I felt a small piece of anxiety coming over me, which normally happens to me with Sativas, but this one does not bite as hard as others with the anxious vibes. I threw in a tv show and the mellow mood kicked in. The much was good and the vibes were good. \u000a\u000aA new top strain for me, it is the first Sativa that I have smoked in a long time that didn\u2019t give me racing thoughts or any paranoia. I felt very energetic too but the tv show kept me on the couch. \u000a\u000aGood for me in small amounts well spaced out. It makes my list of strains to return to.

VWow what an impact sativa strain this is! Coming from a history of sativa smoking, I&#39;ve found myself in the last half a year or so smoking mostly a majority of indica dominant strains.  It was only when a friend suggested I had a sample of this Mango Haze would realise that there has been a massive gap in my most recent chilling life.  This all started when I was sat in my room while my housemate was in the garden smoking a zoot. With the windows open, an aroma forced its way into my nasal cavity.  The typical sharp smell which is coupled with strains that have Haze linage was evident and by then I was bee lining to the source. Upon obtaining this bud which was exactly how you would expect to have a sativa - crisp dry outer lining with inner stickiness, with advise, I only skinned up a small blunt. The smoke wasn&#39;t too harsh or smooth, it was evident there was a counter balance between the harsh haze and the exotic smooth fruity taste which made the smoke reasonably pleasant.  The smoke was over and I went to report back to my pal. Glad I took his advice on it&#39;s strength. Felt like I had been catapulted onto the next level, a heavy head high which you would expect with a chronic sativa - the type of cannabis that I definitely think I&#39;ve renewed my love affair with.  I&#39;m back baby!

VI liked the look of the weed, the yellow color made it look tropical. I purchased it from canna clinic. I remember it being a hybrid. It made my body very relaxed and lazy. It made me yawn quite a bit. Which will probly work well for my insomnia. It made my mind I suppose a little tired as well. It wasn&#39;t too heavy on my mind. It would be nice to blaze on a vacation while your laying on the beach, getting a tan. It&#39;s calming.

VI just tried this strain today, I took it through a DGK G-pro vaporizer by Grenco. it was amazing. such sweet flavor and while vaping it, it didn&#39;t leave a nasty &quot;burnt weed&quot; smell. all you could smell was mango! I loved it. (for my first hoot I actually didn&#39;t pack enough into the chamber of the gpro, so I didn&#39;t get much of a high off of it. however, with the little bit I DID have. it got me feeling pretty good.) mango flavor lasted quite a while after vaping it. \u000a\u000athe high itself was very euphoric. felt happy, surprisingly focussed, body was relaxed and all around it was wonderful. it lasted a while too. \u000a\u000awould recommend this to anyone who likes strong citrus flavors and a nice head high that will make you feel great.

VI&#39;ve always been a very indica leaning grower and smoker. Preferring mild kushes, and anything without skunk in it if i can help it. But these are too strong for me in the daytime.\u000a\u000aI got some lovely mango haze that ive never tried before a week or so ago, and i must say, it is probably the nicest high i have ever had from weed in 16 years. It felt happy, relaxing, calming, energetic. I loved it. I couldnt get anymore from same source, so have opted for silver haze this time. Which i hope has similar effects. My kush days maybe behind me until bedtime from now on.\u000a\u000aTasted sensational, though didnt stink of much. But it was all about the high. Perfect for me, personally.

VA cool strain. Probably one of the best tasting of its kind, the first hit brings the punch of creamy fruit before settling into a citrus sweetness in the background. Compared to some of the other strains I like, there is no real heavy head high. Instead there is chilled relaxing body high followed by a mellowed mental focus which is definitely something that can still be appreciated.

VThe buds on this strain glow when you shine a light on them. I took 3 hits of a small bowl with my\u000aBubbler, I could feel the euphoric sensation taking over within a couple of minutes. I soon began to feel relaxed and happy out, the buildings around me lit up. I felt a small piece of anxiety coming over me, which normally happens to me with Sativas, but this one does not bite as hard as others with the anxious vibes. I threw in a tv show and the mellow mood kicked in. The much was good and the vibes were good. \u000a\u000aA new top strain for me, it is the first Sativa that I have smoked in a long time that didn\u2019t give me racing thoughts or any paranoia. I felt very energetic too but the tv show kept me on the couch. \u000a\u000aGood for me in small amounts well spaced out. It makes my list of strains to return to.

VI got a hold of a variant of Mango Haze that I was told was high in CBD. It made me feel calm but uplifted at the same time. It has a unique sort of high to it. It feels like a &quot;low strength&quot; cannabis but that&#39;s fine, those are actually tough to find. An enjoyable experience all around, not what I expected. It really does taste like mango! \u000a\u000aAgain, this was a variant that had high CBD, and I don&#39;t think standard Mango Haze sativa would be like this. It would probably be a lot stronger.

VWow what an impact sativa strain this is! Coming from a history of sativa smoking, I&#39;ve found myself in the last half a year or so smoking mostly a majority of indica dominant strains.  It was only when a friend suggested I had a sample of this Mango Haze would realise that there has been a massive gap in my most recent chilling life.  This all started when I was sat in my room while my housemate was in the garden smoking a zoot. With the windows open, an aroma forced its way into my nasal cavity.  The typical sharp smell which is coupled with strains that have Haze linage was evident and by then I was bee lining to the source. Upon obtaining this bud which was exactly how you would expect to have a sativa - crisp dry outer lining with inner stickiness, with advise, I only skinned up a small blunt. The smoke wasn&#39;t too harsh or smooth, it was evident there was a counter balance between the harsh haze and the exotic smooth fruity taste which made the smoke reasonably pleasant.  The smoke was over and I went to report back to my pal. Glad I took his advice on it&#39;s strength. Felt like I had been catapulted onto the next level, a heavy head high which you would expect with a chronic sativa - the type of cannabis that I definitely think I&#39;ve renewed my love affair with.  I&#39;m back baby!

VI had a fairly moist bud I tried, so for what it&#39;s worth my rating might be edited to a better one when I try a dried bud.\u000a\u000aThe bud I got myself had a really faint but distinctive smell. I didn&#39;t know it beforehand, but I could definitely tell there was skunk in this strain.\u000a\u000aTastewise I would say that it didn&#39;t quite taste as strong mango as I&#39;d hoped, but there was a nice and fruity aftertaste.\u000a\u000aAfter smoking it I started feeling really relaxed and carefree. A while after I felt a euphoric and somewhat aroused feeling which actually was really nice.\u000a\u000aAll in all I would give this a 3/5, but because I didn&#39;t smoke it properly dried, I felt that it deserved a 4/5. \u000a\u000aThe night is still young, and I shall continue to explore this strain :)
