VT 21.5% pure oil from Curaleaf (my favorite oils by far available from one of 3 CT growers) \u2014 definitive Star Dawg parental qualities, so a tasty, citrusy flavor abounds, and the intensity + cerebral nature of this particular strain is not one I would recommend for non-seasoned folk.. I could see it provoking or producing anxiety for those folks who agitate easily FROM thc\u2014 (vs those with baseline-anxiety, like me..) Luckily marijuana has never triggered it!\u000a  \u2014&gt; only saves/spares me from it &lt;\u2014\u000a\u2022Will keep keepin&#39;on with Tres Dawg!\u2022

VVery sweet sour diesel chemdawg taste. Less hashy than headband. Really flavorful. Offers a medium sativa high with heavy indica stone. One of the best mixes of diesel flavor. This strain is very strong and the oil is amazing. If you are lucky enough to find this strain get it.

V4.5 CT Strain Violet by Curaleaf. This one was so smooth, more of Indica then hybrid I would say with a very quick onset of body tingling and then face got numb very quick and on hour 2 still feeling great. Making me sleepy as well which is what I want. Would not be productive on this guy.

VI&#39;ve only tried the Shatter and wow this strain will put any veteran smoker to sleep. Also works great with pain. Only down side is if you smoke to much and fight the sleep you can easily get paranoid.

VThe packaging on this Tres Dawg has a pug on it and labeled a hybrid. Organtica is a new dispensary just opened on the 28th of October of 2016. I am really excited for this dispensary because of the different strains they are having from strains I&#39;ve never seen nor heard like &quot;Polar Ice Cap&quot; is one and they also have DJ Shorts Actual blueberry from DJ short himself. This place really has got to be my new favorite place for buying my medicine. \u000aTres Dawg was not an easy price 15$ buds, though with a variety of this kind it&#39;s worth the extra cash. Variety doesn&#39;t always mean the best, or the cleanest. I am impressed on how well they did this strain, tested for mold pesticides ect. Labeling is clean and neat.\u000aThe Smell: Poping this Onyx Colored Baggy open I notice very earthy Mycrene floating around amongst the bud. Grassy like a fresh farm day after it has rained leaves that clean smell behind. That exactly was it! Smells like to me kind of funky for the earth and sweet fresh Irish grass. \u000aThe Bud: Definitely Hand trimmed nuggets, each one has been trimmed you can tell if it&#39;s hand trimmed if it has a perfect kind of shape, no flower leafs sticking out, just perfectly rounded, nice to know my medicine has been treated with care. Dense little nuggets get that Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop when you break apart these dank nugs!\u000aThe look: Very OG Kush shadowing around these stones light grass or green apple colors, followed by rustic looking pistols aged a bit, fire passions burn within these buds white on the inside when cracked open.\u000aThe Vape: Very thick, and fills my lungs with that grassy smell, its so thick that it lingers, but enough of a cloud to be a ninja before my getaway.\u000aThe Taste: Floral, lime, grassy and pleasant pungent earthy dirt for sure love the taste!\u000aThe Effect: Hits me hard and heavy like a shotgun blast within moments I notice, hazy effect. Mellow vibes, light and color starts to shine brighter and stick out more like Waldo in wheres Waldo if Waldo was in a white canvas lol! \u000aMedical Usage &amp; Benefits: My attention is sharper can make me focus which is nice since there are so many strains that make me space, nice to get somethings done again, like my mojo/power is back its great motivator. I am not depressed, because of the possibilities I&#39;ve found :D so much so lets have a hat &#182;:D. It&#39;s ok for pain though would recommend this for nerve, concentration, Appetite, Depression for sure! It&#39;s an all around well balanced strain, If you are a fan of Chemdawg you might like Tres Dawg, Stardawg is the next level of this strain. I highly recommend All 3 strains, Tres is rare if you find it get a gram if you&#39;re a fan of chemdawgs. -Hope everyone&#39;s new year turns out to be tough, but very rewarding. -Chill Panda
