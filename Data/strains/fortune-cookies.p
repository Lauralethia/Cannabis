VI found Fortune Cookies to be a great strain.  It has a lovely and potent flavour profile of earthy and sweet notes, with hints of flower and pine.  You can tell that it is a sativa-dominant hybrid, as, for me anyway, it was a subtle high that helped with focus but also a bit of indica &#39;couch lock&#39; which kept me comfortable and focused on the task at hand.  I definitely recommended consuming this strain via wax and vaping, so that you can really pick up on the fresh and aromatic flavours that are present.

VI think Fortune Cookies just became my new headstock! I usually don&#39;t write strain reviews, cause most strains don&#39;t stand out to me. I have an unknown auto-immune disorder that has left me with 0-10% cartilage across my entire body, as well as the bone and joint degradation of an 80+ year old human. So, I&#39;m mainly a dabber, but this flower has me singing it&#39;s praises. Pungent, pungent, pungent. Beyond dank. Amazing smell and flavor which are consistent.  And this is a real motivator.  As soon as I exhaled, I was already having ideas for some of the projects I&#39;ve been working on, and jumped right into them from there.

VFrom what I know about this strain it is parented by OG Kush and Girl Scout Cookie.  Pretty good Sativa high so far.  I feel like Meghan is feeling a bit more of the Indica but overall I like it.  I got it for pretty cheap.  Lower tear type stuff but I would more than likely buy again.

VA good strain to be social amongst other smokers. I felt happy, giggly and Capable of keeping conversation. Felt a little paranoid around those who wern&#39;t high. Maybe because I was smiling so much and cracking jokes.

VThis is my 3rd time purchasing this strains and I am a huge fan. The high is a very cookies like high with a burst euphoria and creativity with a gentle indica buzz that creeps on.  It&#39;s very balanced and it&#39;s great for stress, but after the sativa high wears off I find it hard to be productive toward my homework. Granted that my homework is pretty tough. The flavor is amazing too.\u000a\u000aI would recommend almost anyone try this strain if they have the chance.

VIn my 15 years of cannabis usage, I can&#39;t remember a more potent strain. I recently picked up an 8th of fortune cookies from OG Farms (testing at 30.1% THC!!!) and these little rock nugs have me stuck for HOURS, even with my super high tolerance. Im now stocking up any time i have the chance. #1 favorite strain hands down.

VFor me this one was kind of a creeper, took a little while to kick in.  When it did it hit pretty hard.  Definitely more of a sativa high at first. Started out focused and energetic feeling pressure around the eyes.   Then absolute couch lock, feeling relaxed and sleepy.

VWow! This hybrid strain has found its way into my top 10 favorites. Got an 8 of this, such a good score for such a potent strain. definitely take it easy with this or go long with it. its lets you be creative if you&#39;re an artsy person. if you like to indulge it will leave you feeling dizzy and lifted.\u000a\u000aCan cure what ails ya to say the least.\u000a\u000abtw, the thrichomes on this are very apparent and beautiful as are its long orange hairs. it has an earthy potent aroma
