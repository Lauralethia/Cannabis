VHave been taking it in smaller doses with the brownies cooked with the 5g/500ml oil, and although it does put my body into a bit of a bodylock state for 2-3 hours, it works well at keeping my concussion injuries at bay. Still experiencing some pain but as I would rather be able to still function this works for me.

VThis weed is very good use when you\u2019re stressed or can\u2019t sleep. It relaxes you so much, it\u2019s ideal for night use, not a good idea smoking it before going to a party. \u000a\u000aWarning: Some people may feel dizzy.

VI suffer from anxiety, but I have never felt anxious smoking Barbara so I was surprised to see the negatives on here. I feel rather happy and relaxed, and I sleep like a baby. This is definitely my go-to when I want to relax.

VThis review is for the indica dominant strain affectionately named \u201cBarbra Bud\u201d.\u000a\u000aThe strain that I have comes from my favorite producer Broken Coast, located in British Columbia Canada and punches in with a respectable 19.2 % THC.  This strain is 90% Indica.\u000a\u000aWhen I opened the sealed bottle I was a little disappointed at the lack of smell from the buds.  Barbra only has a light spicy, woodsy smell and I prefer my buds to have a strong smell about them.  I guess I view my medicine in the same way I view my food, it must start off with a good smell and have a nice visual and finally a nice taste.  So any bud that has all of that AND works for my symptoms quickly hits my top five.  Unfortunately Barb doesn\u2019t cut it in either the smell or taste departments and visually speaking, despite the nice sized buds from BC, she is rather plane Jane, nothing special. \u000a\u000aAt the time of my purchase money was tight and BC was selling Barb for a very low price, so I bought her not knowing anything about the strain.  I suffer from severe chronic pain following a car accident and I always need to have some indica on hand as I find it the most helpful for my pain and nausea.  After making my purchase I did some research on the strain and it said that it was amazing for pain\u2026  \u000a\u000aWell, I can tell you that while it did help with my pain, it wasn\u2019t nearly as good as my top five indicas are and I was left rather disappointed.\u000a  \u000aTwo things I really didn\u2019t like about this strain is the serious couch lock and the next day drowsiness.  I have to assume that this is due to Barb being 90% Indica and only 10% Sativa.  Don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t get much done when you take it, or the next day after either.  To help counter this side effect I mixed it with a good Sativa, Northern Lights Haze (see my review of NLH) and it seemed to help a bit, but was far from a perfect solution.\u000a\u000aI guess in the end I got what I paid for, and despite it helping my pain I will not be buying this strain again due to its severe couch lock and next day drowsiness.  I will stick to the strains which range at 70-80% Indica and 20-30% Sativa.

VIt was very good in giving me a very deep relaxing feeling and I really enjoyed it at first. But I noticed after the 3rd or 4th time of having it, it really raised my anxiety levels. I have an anxiety disorder and it has been under control until I started using Barbara Bud. I have been super on edge and panicky for the past week, even after stopping use of it. Since I stopped taking it things have been calming down for me but not yet back to normal. I definitely would suggest avoiding Barbara Bud if you suffer from anxiety, depression, or paranoid mental disorders.

VI purchased this strain to help with my anxiety and sleepless nights.  I like to vape all of my strains and the body buzz off Barb gives me is really relaxing with absolutely no couch lock.  Took my dog for a walk after medicating and it felt like I was floating on a cloud the whole time.  Excellent strain and will definitely snag again.  Perfect amount of THC as well since I have a high sensitivity to it.
