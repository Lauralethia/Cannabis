VOnly negative element to this strain is availability in most locations. A true diamond in the rough strain. The sativa effects are quick and energizing like a well cared for sour diesel, the mild body and indica twinges are reminiscent of agent orange or canna lope kush. Smell is slightly lemony but with a mealy, skunky frosted mini wheats back note , flavor is wonderfully sweet and citrus. Green Lady Cannabis in the Olympia, WA area carries dwg quite often and their main vendor for the strain, evergrow is one of the best local growers going today. Perfectly trimmed dense nuggets of dwg have ultimate bag appeal, mugs remind me of lambs bread or good grow of Camelot kush, very easy to pack in a bowl or roll up. Like I said above, the only negative aspect of this full spectrum, creative, energizing sativa is the common lack of availability. That being said, if you find this true strain(lemon wreck X Cinderella 99, NOT the bunk ass white widow crosses which are garbage) pick up as much as possible and store in your freezer, you will be grateful you did ;).

VShe is worth the smoke, as she is an anti-depressant with 1/5 of the energy of Durban Poison. I would say the energy is much like being at a Pep Rally in High School (get high bro), my point is that you will become motivated with a clear enough head buzz to realize you got Euphoria and the Bud is a dry eye free so far! I will definitely give this one another try if Durban is not available.

VHave been smoking this strain for a couple of weeks.  This is my first time to try Dirty Girl.   Agree with many of the reviews that the taste was more earthy and skunky to me.  The first hit or two has a definite hint of old school hashish.  Much different than the leafly description.  That being stated, for me this strain a great find.  It produces a very heady, creative, cerebral and uplifting high.  This is a superb social smoke.  I haven&#39;t felt this chatty and happy from weed in a long time.  It&#39;s almost like this strain reset my tolerance.  A fat bowl of Dirty Girl and a cup of great coffee shared with a friend will keep you rambling all afternoon. Highly recommended. The THC level of my bud is 24.22% with a CBD of .26%.  I am a MMP who generally uses a strong sativa in the day and a strong indica at night.

VThis is an all-around good sativa that won&#39;t disappoint. Nice euphoric buzz, uplifted happiness, and relatively little negative side effects.

VA very nice sativa.  Generated an energetic, creative, happy high that lasted a good length of time.  Effects were seemingly delayed when sampled from flower, and had that special &quot;creeper&quot; secondary acceleration.  Music appreciation, interest, and intensity were very pronounced in this experience.  The taste was strange, like something off about a batch of citrus fruit - it didn&#39;t make it unpalatable, just strange.\u000a\u000aSmell: strong, pungent, sour, pine and citrus\u000aTaste: strong, sour, citrus, tingling\u000aEffects: Energetic, creative, humorous, expressive, aphrodisiac, musical \u000aPotency: 7\u000aDuration: Long

VI got the ionic brand vap pen with Dirty Girl. Mild high with happiness/good feeling vibes. Very middle of the road high. I did not feel the motivational aspect some report, but I didn&#39;t get sleepy or have any couch locking. I would say this is a good daytime strain. The thing that was amazing is there were no munchies. I have never found a strain that didn&#39;t make me raid the kitchen, and I have looked high and low. If you are trying to keep your weight down, and still want to smoke this might be a good option to consider. Prices seem reasonable, but vary a lot between stores. Shop around.

Highly recommended for a myriad of issues including mood disorders, trauma victims, chronic illness depression and Combat PTSD. Dirty Girl makes everything alright again so you can get on with your daily routine.

VAre you hyper and can&#39;t relax? Have a hard time going to sleep? This strain may be for you! In my opinion, 0.25 grams consumption via a water bong is enough to calm me down and is a great at helping with anxiety and helps as a sleep aid as well. &quot;Munchies&quot; are definitely real at any dose higher than 0.25 grams, as well as a strong urge to fall asleep. It is great to take before bed time if you want to relax and ween into the night as you slowly drift away into dream land.

V&quot;Dirty Girl&quot; was not highly recommended, but different growers have different results, just like different vineyards produce different tasting wines.  That said, despite the mention of lemon and candy given in the generic description, I found the taste harsh.  On the flip side, it got me veeery stoooned.  It made me feel the way Cheech and Chong act in their movies.

VThis is my favorite right now. Tastes very earthy like others have stated, a very small hint of citrus...something, but mostly earthy and piney. Smooth smoke using a cheap hammer style bubbler, I&#39;m sure it would be amazing through a decent piece. Very uplifting, awake, willing to do things. Nice hybrid in the sense that you do feel some of the effects you would expect from an indica (heightened sensation from touch, relaxed spine and back), but there isn&#39;t any couchlock and I don&#39;t have the munchies. Great for anxiety and depression. I&#39;m pretty chill right now. I could actually go outside and not freak out. I&#39;m going to go and do that.

VThis started out a fantastic trip but ended up being, well, not so fantastic.  It smoked smooth out of the preroll, and hit incredibly fast.  Very quickly, though, I went from happy and chatty to stuck in my own head having to remind myself that the thoughts I was having were MJ induced.  I was incredibly paranoid, and really, really trapped inside my mind.  The high lasted for well over 4 hours, and that wasn&#39;t even after having smoked the whole joint (between two of us we smoked maybe half a gram).  I&#39;m not a lightweight, and my smoking partner isn&#39;t either.  Both of us were paranoid and anxious, disconnected, and disjointed.  I was so badly off that I couldn&#39;t even walk.  This stuff kicked my butt. I&#39;d be curious to try it again, knowing what to possibly expect (sometimes it&#39;s just not a good day to be stoned), but I just don&#39;t know on that one.  I&#39;ve talked to other people who have tried this strain and get the same response... even from people who work at the dispensary that I purchased it from.  I tend to smoke Indicas and Indica heavy hybrids, but I&#39;m not a complete stranger to Sativas. So, it could just be that this was too much for me.  Never know until you try again!  I will, just not right away.

VIt&#39;s a very good sativa.  Great for outdoors.  The only reason I cannot give it five stars is that while I enjoy great highs with this strain, I also became very anxious and somewhat paranoid.  I&quot;ve tried it three times now (different settings) with the same results.  Something not quite working with my brain chemistry with this strain.   Anyone who tries it and doesn&#39;t have those side effects is in for a treat!

VThe smell off this is delicious and fruity. It smells fun! There&#39;s real hits of citrus on this and under it all is luscious tropical scents. Smoking this tastes just like it smells. The smoke is playful and wispy at first, you need to hit hard to get it moving but once it gets going, things really get freaky. It&#39;s robust and juicy when you&#39;re getting great big hits of it. The flavor dances across the back of your tongue with the exhale a huge blast of fresh-cut pineapple, mango, and marijuana. When I finished the joint, I was high already. The smile across my face was huge and there was a definite skip to my step. The sativa of this is active, I wanted to do all the things. This definitely was the pick-me-up my day needed. Legs were about average, but the end was very smooth. A nice Dirty Girl will definitely raise your spirits!

VDirty Girl was my first attempt to get into the nitty, gritty of what makes various strains tick. This one was an interesting ride to go along on St. Paddy&#39;s day but overall the experience was positive if your brain is in the right space. \u000a\u000aThe bud wasn&#39;t too densely packed and didn&#39;t have a lot of crystals on it. Running at about 24% total THC with a little CDB and CBD-G thrown in but both amounts were under 1%. The Smell felt close to a combination of black tea with a hint of something bubble gummy in the background. When smoked the taste was close to the typical taste of your stereotypical strains with a hint of fruit. \u000a\u000aThe overall sensation of the experience seemed to be directed around the eyes with a little fuzziness in the body. \u000a\u000aWATER PIPE\u000a--------------\u000aI started off with a small amount in my water pipe for the patented &quot;wake and bake&quot;. I was a bit nervous about stuff that morning so that seeped into my brain just a little at the beginning of the experience. I did have moments where I felt very zen. If I was in the mood for meditation and self reflection, I feel this would be a good for that. The Zen felt like my mind was a clear zone. As if I could manifest any instance of thought I wanted. Where in other strains my mind felt like it was firing at all cylinders, on this strain it was quite the opposite. \u000a\u000aThis Strain also felt really good at one track mind things. If you have a task you want to focus on and focus on just that, the strain is great for that. If you have to multitask in anyway shape or form, I feel this strain is a hinderance for that. \u000a\u000aOne of the downsides to this strain is that I feel it caused me to dwell on negative things instead of positive things. I had to force myself to switch to a mental state that was positive. I don&#39;t have to do that with other strains. \u000a\u000aVAPING\u000a--------\u000aI tightly packed the PAX 2 and went from settings 2, 3 and 4 in succession. I&#39;m a fan of playing fighting games and when I attempted to do so, it felt like a hinderance to playing. &quot;Twitch&quot; gameplay, or the ability to react fast to situations around you is key to these games and this strain isn&#39;t a benefit to that. If I were playing a game that wasn&#39;t as intense, I might have liked it more. \u000a\u000aPRE-ROLL\u000a-----------\u000aBefore heading out for some St. Paddy&#39;s fun I took a few hits from a J I rolled up. Once I got into social situations it was weird. I didn&#39;t feel very energized by the situation it almost felt like being in a constant state of ambivalence. When talking to people, witty responses weren&#39;t coming as fast to me as if I were sober or on another strain. \u000a\u000aOverall I think utilizing the &quot;Zen&quot; that comes from it is where the strength of the strain lies. Throughout the day the experiences I had felt very inconsistent but I would say that I fared better on this stain in low doses; higher ones seem to put paranoia and anxiety to 11 which was harshing my vibe yo.

VVery stony. An escalator ride from a second-to-first floor in a crowded grocery store was a trip: just seeing all those stoned people (uh, no...that was me...I had to tone it down!) in that too-well-lit-store! I was too-well-lit myself, and realized it at that moment.\u000aExcellent relief of back strain. \u000aAroma and Taste: Very earthy, maybe a medicinal lemony suggestion, but all in all, taste and aroma not very impressive.\u000aEffects: This is a sativa-dominant hybrid but behaved like the combo that it is, and leaning toward indica. Once I got home from the store I was pretty much superglued to reclining surfaces, but I wasn&#39;t sleepy. Fairly focused. Mentally like a sativa; physically similar to an indica.\u000aCheers, Ganjaphiles!

VThis one is a bit dreamy with couch lock undertones and super high definition. Although sativa&#39;s are often recommended for daytime use, this one is more of an evening strain for me. Similar to Blue Dream, although DG can seem a bit more heavy.

VGot some Dirty Girl BHO from my favorite dispensary, The Vault, in Lake Stevens. 86% total cannabinoids...super sugary..almost a little too much, hard to keep on my dab tool..but still, nice calming high but not a couch like like a true Sativa.
