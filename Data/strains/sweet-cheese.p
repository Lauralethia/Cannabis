Vsmells kind of like mild chocolate, and if you drink Coffee or Mt. Dew while smoking this the flavors go together really well!\u000a\u000aI like the density and crystally-ness of the buds.  Gives a good heady high that I enjoy.  Got this with some NYC Diesel and I liked them both.  This one is much fainter in smell than the Diesel that is for sure

VI have sampled better brands and blends since weed was legalized in WA State, but I have also sampled worse. \u000a\u000aThe high is pleasant, neither gentle nor debilitating, but rather a nice hybrid of relaxation and a mild creative, euphoria. It&#39;s a very good herb to aid your creative writing, drawing or painting. \u000a\u000aThe weed also came packaged in a handy plastic tube (similar to the old 35mm film canisters we all used back in the day) and the weight of the 2gram product was right on the money. \u000a\u000aThe biggest draw back of this weed is it stinks to high heaven. It has a very pungent smell when smoked and also dry. It is not a pleasant smell, a combination of foot odor and milk gone bad. It also has a very unpleasant taste, like petroleum. \u000a\u000aIf you can get past the unpleasant smell and taste this is fairly decent weed.

VI mostly smoke for daytime productivity, creativity, focus, and to alleviate depression and anxiety. \u000a\u000aFor those purposes, this strain was a too heavy. More than one hit made me really sleepy. \u000aBut I expected this going in, so I blended it with SuperJack, (2/3 SuperJack, 1/3 Sweet Cheese) which offset the high-strung anxiety that SuperJack brought to the game. \u000a\u000a\u000aAt night I reeeeeally enjoyed Sweet Cheese on it\u2019s own. \u000aTHAT FLAAAAAAVOR!!!!\u000aOmg it was like the cream cheese frosting they put on top of a carrot cake.

It leaves you relaxed, uplifted, and ready to take on any daily task.  Makes you very productive, but the high doesn&#39;t last super long.  I like this strain a lot, but compared to other sativas it&#39;s not as potent.

VI got a vape cartridge of sweet cheese and I love it. I wanted something to help me relax after work but still be able to get stuff done instead of getting high and falling asleep by 9pm and this does exactly what I need. Nice cerebral, creative high, physically relaxing but not couch-locking. Getting it in an oil cartridge negates the cheesy smell, and the vapor is faintly sweet if you let it linger in your mouth.

There&#39;s a bit of a cheesy aftertaste but this also tasted kind of sweet, it made me think of roses. Depression and anxiety are both things I battle but this knocks both on their butts and makes me feel social too :) Do recommend!! It&#39;s tasty (I think) and comforting.

VFirst let me say that my wife and I are new to smoking weed having just started when it became legal in WA. Consequently, we have only tried perhaps 5 or 6 strains.\u000a\u000aThat said, we both thought the taste of Sweet Cheese was -horrible-. If you&#39;d like to get a hint of what this will taste like, have a swig of anti-freeze.    \u000a\u000aWe did, however, enjoy the effect well enough. Kind of a nice combination of relaxing and heady.

VHad a pretty bad body high. Started tripping out of reality and extreme short memory loss started happening. And my entire body burned from the inside out. Low key thought I was going to die... strain actually smelled like cheese. Slept well though.

VThis one does make you feel elated...puts you in a approachable pleasant mood, you dont mind holding lengthy convo&#39;s , I felt no body high, and it sets your stomach off almost instantly..it seems to stimulate it to start processing and sets off wicked hunger pangs, which I do not need..I am fluffy and soft enough without any help...so for me...never again
