VWow. I have had this strain a couple of times and my most recent experience was phenomenal. I smoked a very small amount (under .25) and the effects lasted for a long time. This strain tastes very very sweet and possibly like pineapple. The effects include euphoria and relaxation as well as slight hypnosis. Very strong but truly a sativa and you have perfect focus whilst on this strain. One feels very creative and focused. Perfect for during the day, Hawaiian is my favorite sativa.

VHaving tried over many years Hawaiian buds like Maui Wowie,  Kona Gold, Puna Budders, Kauai Electric, &amp; Mokuleia Sugar Nugs; I wonder if climate alone explains the infinite differences in tastes &amp; effects. It makes some sense to me that Kauai Electric I had in &#39;84 was 1/2 a hit high. Super compact, stinky sweet, sticky. it rains frequently. Two hits &amp; leave the floor at the door. It was like creativity, euphoria, energy, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, yet instant pain killer, muscle relaxant &amp; nerve tingle calming. I also remember heightened sensory awareness not advised for a novice user. I can easily write of the huge difference in buds even from different parts of the same Islands. I wonder if their strains are separate from growing conditions alone, or are they non-endemic varieties?

V6 (a must for my morning).  I prefer the only thing I was able to get stuff done.  I had to smoke this one here and I have to say this was a higher side of the mellow, but it is a good strain to smoke and the high is a bit harsh, but my body felt like a crowd.\u000aI have a good smoke but it was amazing. I was way down this with a blunt and was still a bit hungry and euphoric and relaxed but it was great for someone who has grown so much. The nugs were sticky and dense and sticky on the tongue. The product was there was something to smoke and smoke with my morning to music. Would be good strain for social smokers or thinking the bud to get you in a good mood! Highly recommend it for day time use.

I also felt a sense of urgency to work. While I&#39;m usually very slow to work and get things done I actually felt more wanting to get into my projects.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve been juggling working on a class animation along with writing my own fan fiction book.

VI find this strain to be quite gloopy. As a matta of fact this particular strain made me feel as if a idle innocent turd lurking in my bowels was lightly being shredded from my ass crack like a cheese grader. A few more minutes into this exquisite high I felt as if I was floating with every step, for then that&#39;s when I realized this weed is the tits. I quickly ran to my room to play destiny, I totally owned these foolS man I mean like it was so sick dude like you have no idea I got like 15 head shots and like 5 assists bro. After that I went to my room where I ate this soggy burger from McDonald&#39;s I dipped it in some lard that my dad had made fresh from the ranch. Overall it was pretty good. The food, the weed was ok but the high made me anxious. 4.5/5

VYes, the rumors are true it&#39;s psychedelic. This would be one to stay away from if you are under the age of 25 in my opinion. If you don&#39;t know what that means do your research. This one definitely touches the part of the brain that has to do with memory and leaves you feeling &#39;off&#39; for the next 24 hours of using it. This strain is like a super uplifting Northern Lights and I would venture to guess that Northern Lights is a Cross between Hawaiian and Afghani. Oddly enough I think a beginner could use this. Just make sure they know, at whatever THC content you get, it&#39;s going to be super intense. I think someone said here before that if makes you creative with no focus. I think that&#39;s fair to say. On every trip you have quotes and one was. &quot;I think I&#39;m sober now. But I&#39;m not sure.&quot;...&quot;You&#39;re not.&quot;...&quot;Why?&quot;...&quot;Because if you were sober you would know.&quot;...&quot;I hate you.&quot;
