VBy far my favorite strain. I&#39;ve never found something that makes me feel everything as listed and more. I feel focused and able to continue going about my day more productively with the help of critical jack. Every person I&#39;ve shared it with can agree with me as well! I wish more dispensaries knew of critical jack because it&#39;s so hard to find, but so worth it when you do!

VA fun cross I found at my local dispensary. Jack Herer is my favorite strain. So anything crossed with it usually makes me happy. This one didn&#39;t disappoint. It&#39;s a lively daytime high and fizzles on the top of your head for a few hours. \u000aIf I could find it around here more, I&#39;d definitely snatch some up.

VThis has become my absolute favorite. Grown it 4 times and each time it gets better! The flavor and smell are so strong it&#39;s mind blowing. When I decide to fire up the Xbox I pack this first! It increases my senses 10 fold, which keeps me in my game! Only problem, I have nerve damage in my back and it does not help with pain. But the high is amazing!

VI&#39;m a sativa lover for sure - I prefer strains that keep me active either to do a hike with the dogs or bang out some housework. I picked up a vape cartridge of Critical Jack primarily because I&#39;m giving vaping a try and it was on sale and labeled a sativa-dominant strain. I&#39;ve toked this one a few times and it absolutely amazes me! It keeps my energy up &amp; my mind filled with creative ideas without making me loopy. It also elevated my mood and had me dancing to the music, literally and figuratively. This is a strain I can smoke all day long and each new toke just keeps the good feeling going without pushing me over the edge or crashing me out. It definitely takes the edge off while keeping me focused. I wish I were a medical mj patient cuz I would smoke this every day!

VNever ever pass up the chance at trying this strain! I got a gram to try then they ran out but I&#39;ve held on to it for 2 weeks and use it when I want to focus on my art. the high is very cerebral but not in a stupifying way and I had this calm energy before I knew what I saw doing..I was composing again and producing beats left and right and I was just like &quot;what it totally just like possessed me to bust out my synth and drum machine and even after setting all that up, starting 2 new songs and breaking it all down.. I was still lifted from this beautiful gift. next time I see it I may just go for the gold and swoop an oz (I usually like to have multiple strains for different symptoms/ailments but I&#39;d sacrifice that for this sweet baby)

It was a very focused cerebral buzz, which left me able to concentrate on whatever I was doing. While not suppling much pain relief for my arthritis, it didn\u2019t seem to bother me as much as I went about some physical chores. Time flew and the buzz did not leave me hanging.

VA gentle smell of Pine, and a forest greets you when you break these buds up.  The feeling of being stoned didn&#39;t last that long for me.  I feel alert and I&#39;m able to focus on what I&#39;m doing.   There seems to be some mild muscle pain relief, but not enough that I would seek this out for pain relief. It did however lift my mood, and my vision is clear.  Good conditions for enjoying a video game.

VFirst time I ever smoked this strain. As soon as I opened the bag, a very distinct smell filled my room up with a sweet and earthy scent.  The nugs were quite dense but not rock hard. Critical Jacks dark complexion is splashed with colors like purple, dark green and dark orange.  It&#39;s glistening trichomes are on the medium side but the taste is on point. I would gladly share this great strain of Critical Jack with my MML friends. I hope this review helps anyone out there to get an idea of what Critical Jack is roughly suppose to be like. Although I do always have a picture attached with my review,  but in this case I don&#39;t so I apologize because it was deleted by accident.  Also keep in mind that.......\u000a\u000a      Note: Every Strain in general such as Chemdog #4 is a different grow from person to person depending on a plethora of things, such as..... environment, phenotypes,clones,genetics,strains, nutes,temps,lights, and so on.  They all play an important role for having a successful and &quot;pot&quot;ent plant.  again. I hope this helps. \u000a                  \u2661\u2661\u2661&amp;PEACE....

VThis works as a good sativa for me, earthy and pine taste.. Nice dense buds, nothing grand.. Its simply a good strain. Good for treating anxiety, got me feeling pretty focused as well.

VI think this has great potential. even though it was grown wildly outdoors in poor conditions and than cut early it still has a very pleasant high to it. can&#39;t say much about its smell but the effect is joyful - makes me want to sing, dance and eat a lot. its not lazy, leaves you with good focus, in general you can do almost anything with this strain without wanting to nap or turning into a mess
