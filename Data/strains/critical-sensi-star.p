VGot ahold of a gram of OP concentrates shatter of this strain. Is a very flexible strain. One dab is extremely functional and relaxing, good afternoon or weekend smoke. However, a larger dose just recently has left me extremely baked. For about the first 3 minutes it was a bit rough but its settled into a very strong Indica high but it isn&#39;t knocking me out. \u000a\u000aSkunky, earthy with a stronger citrus exhale. Upon exhale, immediate narcotic high kicks in and all I want to do is lay around and watch TV. Lower doses leave me mentally stimulated but not active per say. \u000a\u000aThis one shines in the body stone, if you like warm, narcotic and buzzy muscle relaxing stones like me then this one is for you. Would be great for pain relief. \u000a\u000aMy tolerance is pretty high, but I have to work the next few days so will be looking forward to coming home and having my daily dab with this.

VThis strain was ok. Not the greatest but not terrible by any means. It mad me extremely tired so would be very good for people looking for a strain to help them sleep. Overall good relaxing strain. Good taste.

VI&#39;m pretty new to medicinals so I&#39;m still finding what works for my insomnia. This did the trick to relax my entire body but it was kind of boring. I don&#39;t know, maybe it was the mood I was in but usually I can&#39;t stop laughing but not with this stuff. I just sat there.

VGreat indica. As someone who has long suffered with insomnia I&#39;m always looking for a good couch lock and CSS delivers fabulously.

VHelps with my nausea but little to no euphoria. I get more of a high just holding my breath. \u000a\u000aVapes better at lower temps. \u000a
