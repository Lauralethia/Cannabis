Vwe grew this strain in the greenhouse this year and the colas were huge.  My husband loves it, and tested out at 16%THC and 2.8 cbd so it&#39;s a great strain for pain/ headaches, seizures and ptsd and still get a pretty good buzz without wanting to follow the dog around all day.  In other words you can still function and get pain relief.  Its gets really big if you let it, takes a long time to flower, so watch for mold in those big buds.  Not for the novice but well worth the extra wait for those beautiful chocolate color in the flowers.  Very sticky with lots of trichomes, fun to trim, even the side buds are large.  If it was easier to grow I would give an extra star, but because its tricky at the end, I only gave it a 4.

VI loved it! I felt great. Everything felt so unreal. I felt a lot of heaviness and was feeling quite trippy. Not until I was coming down from the high that I felt very sleepy. I was highly recommend if you are trying to sit down, relax and have a nice evening with yourself or with someone. I don&#39;t think I could be public high on Chocolate Thai because I do feel a little out of control, but that is just me.

VAlways get a special feeling when getting to try a landrace strain.  The feeling is one of respect as if getting to meet a an old movie star that has been around since the beginning of time.  One of the originals that have had to survive the elements since before Christ was born.  Ancient.  Cher if she were a strain of weed.  lol\u000a\u000aNo, No, No I digress I meant more like big foot or the lochness monster.  Durban Poisin, Northern Lights, Afghani, as well as Chocolate Thai.  Never got to see this strain in bud form because it was a discounted gram of shake.  The leftover shake was a low percentage 9.7% with a bit of CBD 2.3%, but really had no concern with that just wanted to try some Chocolate Thai.\u000a\u000aThe leaf was a dark brown hue that was very similar to brown schwag brickweed from the east coast.  You know the kind that sometimes smells like dryer sheets cause that is what they wrap it in to smuggle it?  This smelled nothing like that though.  It was spicy and sharp to smell almost making me want to jerk my nose away.\u000a\u000aBeing that it was a neat peppery tasting smoke that was a little harsh on throat.  It did make me cough a whole heck of a lot.  But on the other side of that hacking and giggling followed by more coughing was a huge perma-grin.  The euphoria that comes with this strain is phenomenal lasting a good 2-3 hours with only a few tokes.  It was a mystical smoke that at times had me feeling so good I might as well have been smoking a bowl with Jesus.  Or Cher......

VPretty interesting strain. Didn&#39;t really get hints or notes of chocolate but my batch had a particularly weak smell overall. Buds were slightly resinous with red/orange hairs and unique delicate bud structure. High was kind of trippy with not much sedative or stoned experience. Overall not a particularly potent batch/strain in my experience but overall not bad at all.

VThe dreamy, hazy high comes on fast. The body feels slightly relaxed and free of pain, a light buzz tingles across the face, but it&#39;s the mind that is really sent to space. It&#39;s cerebral high is very psychedelic at times, but strikes the perfect balance of being a stress-reliever and motivator. Your mind feels at peace yet uplifted and awake. I like to keep this stuff in the Pax and take an occasional couple hits through out the day - even a light dose of Chocolate Thai keeps away headaches and nausea and can put you in such good mood. This is a great daytime strain in moderate  amounts but even in the evening can be consumed more liberally to unwind and have fun.

VLandrace Sativa, pungent, earthy, and some of the most psychoactive I have ever been blessed to experience.\u000a1978 was a great year and the best medicines I have ever smoked came out of this era.   One bong load of this experience was enough for a half a day or more.  The initial rush of THC was something out of the ordinary.  The taste was perfumy, floral, and sweet much akin to the Pineapple cans of Maui Waui of that day.  Exhaling this herb changed its smell to that of Church incense?\u000aFrankincense maybe.  Smoked it again at Dead Shows in Hampton 88 finding it sporadically after that on the East Coast and Frisco area.  The last I saw and smoked was grown indoor in Ann Arbor in 93.  Recently, I had a hybrid passed off to me in Cali that was not close to the original.  I would love to see the Santa Marta Purple, Acapulco Gold, Panama Red, Lambsbread, Columbian Gold, Afghani Green, Khyber Red, and Gainesville Green\u000aBrought back like Chocolate Thai.\u000a\u000aTwo thumbs up on this one, a really special treat

VAn exotic blend of landrace sativa genetics from Indochina. This varietal serves up spicy, fiery smoke and a lightning-fast, intensely vibrant high that takes off and lands like a rocketship. A lengthy challenge to cultivate commercially, her flowers develop very slowly to a mature, strong expression of THC and exhibit velvety trichrome layering over hues of cocoa and violet. A diverse and evenly dispersed terpene profile presents a highly complex flavor with notes of black cumin, sweet anise, and agarwood.  TreeHawk Farms in Chimacum, WA has an outstandingly superior phenotype of this extraordinary varietal.

VVap&#39;d this one at 355 degrees Fahrenheit with a buddy of mine. It was a classic experience. We both liked it very much. It&#39;s gentle, clear while mellow. It&#39;s now one of my favorite sativa strains for having a relaxing conversation. It&#39;s grade A stuff. It&#39;s definitely a unique strain. I would buy it again.

Recommended for first time users and encourage this to be your go to strain for a gloomy day or when you&#39;re feeling down. Makes you happy with a side of a giddy feeling and a cure of feeling that everything will be okay\u000a

VI am an avid sativa smoker. This has to be up there with my favorites. Buds are thinner and longer, but very dense with green and purple hues. The smell reminds me somewhat of an artisan pickle. The smoke is flavorful with a peppery bite. Very strong high that is almost instantaneous. Great strain to start the day as it is a very clear energetic high that last a while. One to try if you like sativas. \u000a

VThere is some controversy regarding the genetic pureness of this strain but I&#39;ll give it the benefit of the doubt.  In fact I wish/hope that someone will preserve original landrace cannabis seeds in the hope that the originals will be available in the future.\u000a\u000aThis strain comes on gently.  You won&#39;t feel a big head experience like other sativas, just a gentle raising of something that feels very natural, healthy and healing.\u000aFully 1.5 hours later is when it begins to peak and you are completely functional, but left with a nice warmness to your knees and joints.  Relaxation without sleepiness or stony-ness.  Not analgesic though.  It feels like you drank a bunch of green juice after a 4 mile run and you just feel great.  Happy and calm without the inebriation.  Original strains rock.  I feel like this is how cannabis should be enjoyed and used.  Like part of a health regimen.

VFairly nice high. Definitely very tasty vape\u000aFrom the first couple puffs, actually thought it was chocolate lmao\u000a100% sativa for sure, lots of energy and focus. So much so that it was a bit hard to get to sleep when I did give a try&#39;s so I&#39;d recommend starting the day with a vape/bowl of this or maybe midday lunch break. Definitely can compete with a nice cup of coffee if that&#39;s your thing. \u000aAlso make sure you have some eye drops ready cause it might dry you out a bit. Other than that it&#39;s a smooth vape into an easy study/work pace. Mixed with some good tunes and I felt\u000aVery relaxed and comfortable. And it&#39;s finals week so that&#39;s saying something \u000a\u000aHIGHLY recommended ;)
