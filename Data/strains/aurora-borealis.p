Vbest weed in the world. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever smoking anything else besides this. it helps with my chronic pains allot but makes me very forgetful I left the car keys in the door while I went to get food. so stay in if you&#39;re smoking it. thanks to whoever created this weed.

VAt first I felt nothing. Thought maybe I didn&#39;t smoke enough. But after a few minutes I felt real heavy.  So I sat down on the couch. My mind was pretty clear, and although I felt like I had the energy to get up and move around, I didn&#39;t, I just wanted to laze. Thankfully it didn&#39;t make me paranoid like most strains. I can function pretty well, which is great for being out socially. It definitely helped my migraine though. Im pretty new to this, but so far this is my new favorite strain.

VCan&#39;t go wrong with northern lights and skunk , I grabbed a G of phyto shatter and was impressed with the calming destressing capabilities of this strain. Great for mid afternoon to early evening sessions when you just wanna chill out and veg. Would recommend
