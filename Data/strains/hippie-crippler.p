VI get a different high from this every time. Once I was contemplating my life, once I was super spacy and out of it, once I was laughing a shit ton. Overall a good strain though. Makes you talkative, at least in the beginning.

VI&#39;m experiencing a wonderful head high and taking from it a very sweet pine taste. It&#39;s not the most potent, but it&#39;s very enjoyable. It&#39;s making a very tingly sensation and after a while, instant hunger. I&#39;m relaxed and feel quite euphoric. \u000aEnjoyed myself ^^

VThis is the best strain for a sour mood. Sunshine in a bag. I smoked this while feeling really down, and it totally turned my mood around. It also has a very unique sweet/piney flavor - almost incense-like, very not weedy at all. It&#39;s pretty clear headed too, even at ~22% thc. Very smooth, I didn&#39;t cough much until the very end of my .75g joint. I would get this again to use for my depression, but I generally prefer sativas with a more psychedelic effect, like Durban or hazes - I find them more exciting.

VI&#39;ve been trying out different sativa-dominant hybrid strains for about a month now to combat my major depression. I&#39;ve tried Cannalope Haze and Green Crack, but Hippie Crippler is the best strain that  actually makes me feel energetic. With depression, I suffer from intense lethargy and chronic fatigue. Hippie Crippler got me feeling good AND having no problem getting tasks done (even got me to exercise) with that boost of energy this strain brings. The flowers are a deep green with orange hairs, smells like pine, and gets you pretty high. Having high tolerance, I smoke one bowl for myself in the daytime which is enough for me to feel the benefits of this strain. But I&#39;m sure with two bong rips the average person will get pretty stoned. Will definitely buy again!

I started tweaking thinking that the &quot;smoke police&quot; where going to come banging like &quot;hey it smells like a whole lot of kush out here !!!&quot;--I realized that I was faded and it was my phone the one time.

VDense bud and mellow high. I tend to walk like the Pink Panther when I&#39;ve been smoking the Crippler. Good focus too. I can play games, listen to music or watch movies and never miss a detail with this stuff. Plus, it&#39;s fun to say the name.

VI get this strain every chance I come across it. I personally feel like its a well rounded, but also,pretty strong high. Some strains give me anxiety, but this does the exact opposite. I recommend everyone try this strain
