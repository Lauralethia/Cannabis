VThis strain was pretty bomb (pun intended). \u000a\u000aIt hit me pretty hard, but in a good way. I felt like the head high was pretty intense for the first 30-45 minutes, then it mellowed into a nice whole body high for 3-4 hours. \u000a\u000aThis strain is delicious, tasting of berries with a woodsy afterthought. \u000a\u000aI got this as a sample from a friend, but I&#39;d definitely buy this strain if offered to me.

VBerry Bomb is super impressive. She is a massive producer. It grows vigorously once rooted. At about three weeks it turns from a pretty frosty green to a light purple with loads of white hairs. Berry Bomb smells amazing!! Like berries!!! It&#39;s probably the prettiest strain I&#39;ve grown so far. My previous favorite being Cinex. Cloning her is easy, however a little slower to root then I&#39;m used to.

Vstumbled on to this strain this fall, the strain was also grown outside. very stinky chunky buds covered in crystals,  very smooth berry flavor lasted through the hole joint. powerful indica side puts you in a relaxed state, nice body buzz but did not do much for my nerve damage but still a top shelf stain

VBerry Bomb 80i/20s - I had three combustible tokes before hitting the lawn with the mower. The blueberry taste wasn&#39;t there this time.  It gives a nice body, relaxing buzz with some sativa-energy effects. I cleaned the lawn like a whistle and enjoyed the sunsetting.  Afterward, I had some Blue Dream to keep myself away from the TV and couch.  Berry Bomb is nice but I&#39;d go with Mother of Berries.

VSmoked this in a couple sessions. Smoked it with the lead singer and bassist of a band before seeing The Casualties play a dope set. Definitely some dope bud for some dope times. Buzzed off one bowl. Alleviated symptoms of anxiety and ADD through palliative treatment. Could Have been better. Still some outstanding Mary.

VAlthough the aroma and flavour are outstanding, I haven&#39;t had such an uncomfortably anxious high off a particular strain in ages -- Berry Bomb makes me feel like I am about to die.  Definitely not for the hypochondriac.  \u000a\u000aUnless you&#39;re socializing or are an incredibly experienced smoker with brains of steel, do not smoke this weed -- you will freak the f*** out;  Tight bulging eyes, incredibly dry-mouthed, sensitivities to touch and light, etc...   it&#39;s quite unbearable to say the least.  \u000a\u000aIt sure smells and tastes good though, but not worth the feeling of impending doom like you are about to have a heart attack and your eyes are going to explode.

VHave grown this strain a couple times now.  It&#39;s super easy to grow for a novice, although it will stretch a ton if you&#39;re lights are too high, so be careful with that.  It may have been the pheno I got, but definitely not the biggest buds, however, they are about the densest buds I&#39;ve ever personally grown.  \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t really get a blueberry flavor though.  Definitely an earthiness to it, and maybe a little sweet.  When I sampled before curing was finished, I did notice a rather strong citrus taste, almost like a bunch of different color starburst mixed together.  However, after a month of curing, the citrus went away.  \u000a\u000aI quite enjoy the effects medicinally.  There is a very mild body high, not really enough for pain relief, but good for relaxation.  There is quite a strong head high, but it&#39;s not speedy at all.  I can still get things done on this strain, which is nice.  But I can just as easily smoke a bowl and go to sleep.  \u000a\u000aI took off 1 star for 2 reasons.  This strain&#39;s effects don&#39;t seem to last as long as most others.  I suppose part of why I say that, could be due to built up strain tolerance at this point, but I remember thinking the same thing when I first grew it.  2nd reason is, munchies are really bad with this strain.  (that&#39;s a plus for some, but I&#39;d rather it not be so much).
