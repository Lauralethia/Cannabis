VThis is a review of the washington state i 502 version of this strain from the producer Bangs Cannabis.  20.9 thca stated on the package.  Flavor was ok i would give it a 4 out of 10.  High was pretty decent i would give it an 8/10.  I liked the high but i thought the flavor was too weak.  I would not try this version from Bangs again.  But im interested to try Buddah Tahoe grown by other farmers maybe there flavors would be better.

VThis powerful strain isn&#39;t for me. It took me on more of a brain-scrambling mind trip than I was looking for, which was somewhat surprising for an indica.\u000a\u000aI was hoping for something to lull me into total relaxation and asleep, but the highly-introspective cerebral journey it took me on kept me awake until I came down and switched to a different indica.\u000a\u000aUsed 27% THC strain from The Verdes Foundation, Albuquerque, NM.

VVery floral smelling minty, with black pepper at the end. The structure of the bud looks like very dark green, and not purple just the hue of the dark green brings out the bright contrasting red hairs of this strain. It looks like a darker version of jack herrer. Dense n thick I squeezed these nugs and dont budge. Tastes of flower and deffinitly wood but not pungent at all for such a dank thick n heavy vape.\u000aFantastic for throbbing and super sore pain, great for spinal pain and stress/mood disorders, great for anorexia/cachexia as well.

VAroma is a PUNGENT diesel/lemon/savory herb. The smell is incredibly strong. Trying out the strain from Double Dutch Farms in Washington State. Flavor is also incredibly strong, but leaves almost as soon as it is gone. Strange fruity/floral flavor in the exhale that I didn&#39;t expect. High hit me in about 45 seconds. Let it sink in, took another hit and boom. Not gonna lie, this is pretty good for testing on the lower side of THC. Kinda nervous when I examined the nug and didn&#39;t see a lot of THC crystals. Forget that. This is really good. Very awesome high that made me forget I was writing this for several minutes. K bye I&#39;m hungry

VVERY surprised by this strain as a veteran smoker of over 20yrs. This is a very potent and great over all strain. Gives a great indica feel with a nice sativa backer. Total body relax and head high. Couch lock is possible but so is a few hours of good sleep for my fellow insomniac&#39;s.

VThis lemon and smoky pine smells give this bud top notch for stink. I love sticky stank dank buds. The fresh bud is always some of the best vaporized way to taste a strain without combustion. It&#39;s short bushy features bring out the scarlet pistols and freshly sugar coated leafs making this medicine looking happy and healthy. Buddha is able to balance my wreathing nervs and helps me with my spinal pain. If you need hard working medicine then don&#39;t shy away from buddha. It&#39;s also a hard strain to grow so take that into consideration for the bud tenders growing this hard medicine. Love the pine and earthy textures. Helps with focus, Pain, Mood Disorders, Mania, and of course Anorexia/Cachexia.

VGot a small sample about an 1/8th. Came in at 23%.  The taste is really good not as good as the Tahoe og kush but real close. Got more power I&#39;d say tho. Nice smoke day time usage. Got me focused for a run.

VLearn from my mistake. If you have anxiety, this is NOT the indica strain for you.  I wish I had done my research on Leafly before I bought this. The top side effect listed is anxiousness. That&#39;s the last thing most anyone suffering anxiety needs to have. Lesson for me learned, and I hope this helps pay it forward.
