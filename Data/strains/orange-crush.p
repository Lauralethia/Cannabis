VThis is a bud that reinvigorates my passion for cannabis. Its sharp distinct orange soda smell smacked me in the face. It&#39;s not just citrus-y. It&#39;s distinctly Orange Crush. A smooth smoke that tastes as good as it smells and leave you feeling energetic and happy as hell. Perhaps climbing the ladder to the #1 strain. Tonight was good!

VWow! I&#39;ve been a smoker for 27 years, grew up on the Big Island of Hawaii where there was a ton of flavorful strains but this one by Cannabiotix is by far the tastiest flower I have had the pleasure of smoking. Pure citrus through and through. The high is also top notch, starting with a happy euphoria then transitioning into a very relaxed state of mind, but not couch locked. Orange Crush just jumped into my top 5, possibly top 3.

VGood bud for the price.  I toked it for the first time last night after a long day and it effectively took all the stress and tension away.  Nice body buzz with a decent amount of head clarity.  After the high was over, it took me into sleep mode pretty quickly.  Don&#39;t think I&#39;d use this one during the daytime, but not so much lockdown as maybe a full-blown Indica or Kush strain.  Citrusy smell when ground and holy crap! tons and tons of orange hairs.  More than most other bud I&#39;ve ever seen.

VNot to be confused with it&#39;s indica cousin Orange Kush; this hard hitting fruity delight, is a scrumptious sativa leaning gem that is truly a tokers&#39; treasure. The first thing you will notice is the incredible smell coming from honey. It is reminiscent of those orange gummy type candies covered with sugar we all ate as a kid. This baby is covered with tricomes for its&#39; own &quot;sugar&quot; coating.  The smell does come through on the exhale leaving a pleasant aftertaste an smell.  Orange crush is the rare sativa that can be used anytime of day for an awesome time.  Not only does it work like a sweet orange battery in the morning, but is OUTSTANDING for hiking or other outdoor activities in the afternoon, or even for a night out with friends or just chilling at night with a flick. Any time is the right time for a little crush...orange crush. Absolutely cannot recommend higher.

VIm definitely not new to cannibas or the effects it has. With thus being said I dont rate strains this high very often. Orange Crush is one of those flowers that reminds me why I love cannibas to begin with. Extraordinary taste like a smooth orande soda (especially if you add ice to your piece) a exspansive but not harsh smoke and beautiful buds. I really would recommended if your looking for something new.

VBeautiful hybrid strain! Buddy of mine dropped off about four 0.4-0.6g indoor nugs, and about 2g of some outdoor.\u000a\u000aAt first (even with the indoor stuff) I really couldn&#39;t detect more than a slightly sweet smell, however after keeping the indoor stuff in a small airtight container overnight it really brought out a beautiful sweet orange/grapefruit smell. \u000a\u000aTasted earthy at first, but after a few hits you can really detect the citrus flavor on the inhale. Pleasant buzz (however despite this strains usually somewhat lower THC levels, it WILL creep up on you over 10-20 minutes!), nice sort of &quot;behind the eyes/head-full-of-cotton-balls&quot;, relaxing, smiley strain. \u000a\u000aWas lucky enough to get four seeds from the outdoor stuff. Waiting for them to pop right now! Thinking of crossing this strain with Blackberry Kush next grow season. Say, maybe it&#39;ll have it&#39;s own Leafly page one of these days! \u000a\u000a-BONG THE RIPPER

A full thick smoke loaded with streams of orange surrounded by a balanced mix of berry and citrus. Such a complete taste for a concentrate. I get an immediate rush of energy and then it quickly balances out and allows me to dive into my work and get things done. When dabbing it blends well with OG strains.

VNot too bad of a strain. The one I sampled had a THC of 14%. I was hoping for more of a orange flavor to this strain. However, it did fall short of what I was wanting. Especially since the last &quot;citrus&quot; strain I had was Tangie and that blew me away. It definitely allowed me to relax a little without the cloudiness of other higher THC content strains.

VThis thing definitely tastes a little like orange soda.  Certainly a daytime strain.  Keeps you invigorated and clear eyed. Little similar to Tangie as well I think.  This is one of my favorites lately for when I get up and have to start the day.  One or two pen rips of some distillate and good to go.

VThis is a daytime winner for me. This can be used for ADD/ADHD, actually every strain I&#39;ve tried with orange works well for it. I give Orange Crush an 8 out of 10 on the helpful for ADD/ADHD scale. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to get a great taste profile when dabbing but that&#39;s not the case with Orange Crush. A full thick smoke loaded with streams of orange surrounded by a balanced mix of berry and citrus. Such a complete taste for a concentrate. I get an immediate rush of energy and then it quickly balances out and allows me to dive into my work and get things done. When dabbing it blends well with OG strains.

VOrange Crush reminded me of California Orange Bud. Dense, tight nugs. Citrus aroma, earthy taste. Somewhat harsh smoke for a Sativa dominant. This strain has a nice cerebral buzz, however it fades to a sleepy feeling. Not a typical &quot;jump up and clean the room&quot; Sativa, but overall a nice smoke. I found this bud was best smoked from a pipe or bong. Dense sticky buds made it harder to roll.

VOk this is 3rd of the best home grown I&#39;ve ever had but my friends also through down some Lemon Drop in the same bowl; Oh my god it was great. The bowl was one of those cool color changing ones so I sat outside held it up to he sun and looked at it for at least fifteen minutes. I wish David would have brought the vaporizer. The only problem was I had to ride my bike home; one thing I can say is that I was paranoid as fuck. The bike ride was fun the colors were so vibrant.

VGreat sativa buds. The high was uplifting and relaxing, not super energized but left me in a very positive upbeat place. After an hour and a half it settled into a more mellow indica buzz that wasn&#39;t drowsy but just super mellowed and content. \u000a\u000aSmoke through glass pipe and hand rolled jay. Very flavorful stuff, but I found blueberry to be the most pronounced flavor with hints orangey citrus.

VDeriving from such a powerful parent strain such as Blueberry, I expected more from this strain. Pleasant to smoke, but with effects never lasting more than two hours, a very noticeable come down is experienced. When mixed with more potent strains, smoking tends to give a much more uplifting high than either on their own. &quot;Welcome to the OC, bitch!&quot;

V4.5 stars really. Cool, billowy vapor. Nice, light taste to the smoke. Good for vaporizing. Good high for dancing and just having a good time, even when you are by yourself. No more worries (including no physical pain, good relief of tightness and soreness). Not too long of a high, can get creative, can make the mind wander too much. So best to keep company light. Not good for intense public outings. I could see where a possible paranoia could come in if people aren&#39;t in control of their mind. But my experience was of utmost pleasantness. Good for stretching and yoga; half-day high. I recommend giving this strain a shot.

VLeafly should re-evaluate their description of this strain, particularly the assertion that it is sativa-dominant, as the parents and the high would seem to suggest something closer to about a 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid. Either way, it does have really strong cerebral and psychedelic effects that are more common to sativas, complementing the thoroughly relaxing, warm &#39;n&#39; fuzzy body high, which lasts an exceptionally long time. As for the smell, the strain lives up to its name and smells strongly and distinctly of oranges, with some earthy and citrus notes as well. The taste is like a not-too-strong orange/lime, but what really makes it unique is that on the exhale the flavor turns to strong pine, like if you could taste how a Christmas tree smells. Orange Crush is a treat to smoke for its high and its flavor, and is useful for most ailments alleviated by cannabis.

VTime slowed down after 10 minutes of inhaling... and started repeating itself eventually. It was a very terrifying experience. What was actually a couple of seconds felt like a timeless and repetitive sensation. Freaked me out, I wanted to call an ambulance! This lasted for 40 minutes roughly... Apparently it\u2019s common to feel this when high, but I\u2019m new to this so I tripped balls like I never would have imagined. Higher in anxiety &amp; paranoia... be with your close ones if you want to try this one, try it indoors, listen to good music and don\u2019t move too much. Hope you can find this review helpful!

I have it severely and have tried maybe medications by mouth and topical and nothing worked except for taking the skin off my feet; I found out over two years ago smoking medical marijuana helped; two hits and my hands and feet are dry for hours. Then I did research and found out a Hybrid is best for someone with hyperhidrosis. So I&#39;ve been testing different ones out and Orange Crush in #1 in my book.

VI enjoyed this strain quite a bit. It&#39;s not the best ever, but it&#39;s good. I was in the woods with my friends and we were listening to cool and peaceful music.  It was nice being around all the leaves.. this high made me very &quot;lost&quot; into the music and my surroundings. Definitely a good strain for depression and just wanting to just disappear for a couple of hours.

I am a super creative person normally but not all sativas make me feel like being in that creative mood\u2014this one however, had me writing notes left right and center, having some poignant thoughts beneficial after long work periods. I never buy more than a gram and hardly ever the same strain but this is gonna be a new go to for SURE! Mine was more sativa dominant hybrid

VThe Orange Crush I picked up is indeed very orange. It is a spongy, sugary looking bud with notably long orange hairs lining all of the green material. It is a little bit more stinky than average, its smell being a classic skunky smell with another flavor that reminds me of spicy chocolate or orange peels. Despite how airy it feels and handles, it is actually a particularly long lasting smoke. I got a good nine to ten rips out of a spoon with a normal sized bowl.  The effects I experienced were pretty simple and straightforward. A rich and pleasant body high that gave me general all-around pain relief, greater perception of sense of body and touch, warmth, and perhaps just a bit of a pressing sensation on the limbs. Its mental effects are not very pronounced but are decidedly clear and euphoric; an obvious mood lifter. No paranoia or anxiety whatsoever for me. The body high was more powerful than mental, but not by much. Ultimately, I&#39;d have to say this isn&#39;t super potent cannabis and more like mid grade, but it does its job well.

I found this one to be a fave for anxiety depression. The buzz is super mellow, floaty, with a clear head but you can actually get work done, it&#39;s a great high for when you need to have it together but have pain or need a boost of happy mellow. Great for newbies, or those who don&#39;t like the heavy buzz that can go into the psycho active type of high, like me. I found this one to be a fave for anxiety depression. It&#39;s a great strain, will definitely try again. It also doesn&#39;t give you the munchies too bad.

V4.5 stars really. Cool, billowy vapor. Nice, light taste to the smoke. Good for vaporizing. Good high for dancing and just having a good time, even when you are by yourself. No more worries (including no physical pain, good relief of tightness and soreness). Not too long of a high, can get creative, can make the mind wander too much. So best to keep company light. Not good for intense public outings. I could see where a possible paranoia could come in if people aren&#39;t in control of their mind. But my experience was of utmost pleasantness. Good for stretching and yoga; half-day high. I recommend giving this strain a shot.

VI definitely enjoyed myself with this one, as I always do. What I noticed though is it&#39;s almost a fleeting high, it lingers but wears off if you aren&#39;t really doing much. I felt I needed to smoke more an hour later, but then again, it might have been my tolerance as well. The smell of it wasn&#39;t super &#39;orangey&#39; like most are calling out but it definitely had a zingy smell.

VTried my first Oc today. It tasted sweet, which I liked but it didn\u2019t have the citrusy orange taste that I expected. It wasn\u2019t a great looking batch but the price was right. The smoke was mild in my mouth and it made my tongue tingle. Kind of the way it does when you eat citrus fruit. I enjoyed the light sweet scent it left in the air. I\u2019ve been struggling with a lack of energy and fibro fog so I thought I\u2019d give Orange Crush (Orange Cali X Blueberry) a go first thing in the morning. Whenever I\u2019m trying a new cannabis strain for the first time, I always start off with a little because I have no idea how it\u2019s going to affect me. Turns out, a little nug in a bong was just right for starting my day.  It took a few minutes but before I knew it my energy had picked up slightly and my mood sky rocketed.  I was feeling uplifted, brainy, and happy. And, I realized that I was totally stress free. I didn\u2019t experience any bad side effects, not even dry mouth. I\u2019m surprised at how long the effects lasted from such a small amount. Can\u2019t wait to try a better batch of Orange Crush, pretty sure it\u2019ll be a five.

VPleasantly surprised, pretty strong high even though I have a tolerance, of course the more you toke the less effect. This is a great energizing no come down sativa. I am a super creative person normally but not all sativas make me feel like being in that creative mood\u2014this one however, had me writing notes left right and center, having some poignant thoughts beneficial after long work periods. I never buy more than a gram and hardly ever the same strain but this is gonna be a new go to for SURE! Mine was more sativa dominant hybrid

VTime slowed down after 10 minutes of inhaling... and started repeating itself eventually. It was a very terrifying experience. What was actually a couple of seconds felt like a timeless and repetitive sensation. Freaked me out, I wanted to call an ambulance! This lasted for 40 minutes roughly... Apparently it\u2019s common to feel this when high, but I\u2019m new to this so I tripped balls like I never would have imagined. Higher in anxiety &amp; paranoia... be with your close ones if you want to try this one, try it indoors, listen to good music and don\u2019t move too much. Hope you can find this review helpful!

VI&#39;m not sure if this is the one, but if it is this is the one that gets you in the zone 24/7 around the clock as far as music is concerned. Almost like a purple the way the munchies hit hard and how lazy it makes you. I used to get a batch of this stuff around 06&#39; this guy called it &quot;Orange Crush&quot; and it was leafy, yet very very densed leaves and full of crystals inside the buds(outsides were green with a light frost and orange hairs). Very fluffy and heavy skunky smell, there was no way to hide the aromas.

VLeafly should re-evaluate their description of this strain, particularly the assertion that it is sativa-dominant, as the parents and the high would seem to suggest something closer to about a 60/40 indica-dominant hybrid. Either way, it does have really strong cerebral and psychedelic effects that are more common to sativas, complementing the thoroughly relaxing, warm &#39;n&#39; fuzzy body high, which lasts an exceptionally long time. As for the smell, the strain lives up to its name and smells strongly and distinctly of oranges, with some earthy and citrus notes as well. The taste is like a not-too-strong orange/lime, but what really makes it unique is that on the exhale the flavor turns to strong pine, like if you could taste how a Christmas tree smells. Orange Crush is a treat to smoke for its high and its flavor, and is useful for most ailments alleviated by cannabis.

VBy far one of my favorite Sativas out there. The sweet, citrus aroma excites your senses, and don&#39;t worry, the buds may be small, but the density of those trichomes will get you. If you&#39;re Feelin&#39; a bit down or wanna get some euphoria in you, get crushed with Orange Crush.

VOk this is 3rd of the best home grown I&#39;ve ever had but my friends also through down some Lemon Drop in the same bowl; Oh my god it was great. The bowl was one of those cool color changing ones so I sat outside held it up to he sun and looked at it for at least fifteen minutes. I wish David would have brought the vaporizer. The only problem was I had to ride my bike home; one thing I can say is that I was paranoid as fuck. The bike ride was fun the colors were so vibrant.

VDeriving from such a powerful parent strain such as Blueberry, I expected more from this strain. Pleasant to smoke, but with effects never lasting more than two hours, a very noticeable come down is experienced.

VOrange Crush by Fireline in Washington State. Tested at 28.8% THC.\u000aThis is an absolutely amazing strain. Smells just like an orange soda. Carbonation included.\u000aMedium sized, tight buds absolutely covered in trichomes and bright orange fibers.\u000aThe aroma of this flower immediately provides a strong, yet still light and fresh orange scent, followed by a richer, spicy, almost meaty (orange chicken anyone?) smell which really does remind me of an orange soda. \u000aThe inhale was a little on the harsh side, with light notes of orange/citrus, while the exhale was much smoother and full bodied, exhibiting a fruity/malt taste.\u000aThe effects of this flower were well balanced, with a stronger cerebral high up front and an easy mellow comedown that didn\u2019t leave me too drained. \u000aThis is a bucket list strain. You have to try it.

The cloud 9 going on in your head gently falls down to an almost narcotic like, relaxing, euphoric state that lets you drift asleep. Instant cure for depression, puts a huge smile on my face. It helped with my anxiety, shooting me into that cozy soft cloud feeling that you get in your head that leaves you worry free and relaxed. All of my muscle spasms were gone, and pain is totally subdued.

VGreat strain. Was chilling with my buddies who came to visit and we decided to go to a dispensary, smoke and walk around. My friend purchased this strain which was a sativa variation and was slightly more expensive than most of the other strains. Had a great day and got back to my house and smoked some more. After hitting a bowl of this from a bong I felt immediate effects and it definetly had a citrus taste. Had very typical but strong sativa effects but to the point it made me slightly paranoid and anxious. However, I smoked a joint of Nuken following this and my worries were gone &#128522;

VThis strain is a very special strain! I was turned on to it, as a replacement for a strain they just ran out of and were so apologetic about. Genevieve and the other bud tenders were so knowledgeable and drew the comparison to be this strain. You all made me feel comfortable and real friendly (not like some places where they want you taken care of and gone quickly. I thank you for your patience in my selections!!  #\u20e3#\u20e3#\u20e3#\u20e3#\u20e3

VOrange crush is a very good strain. pistils everywhere. I have had this strain a few times now. never had a complaint or bad review. If you are looking for a good mellow high that lingers for a good while. I&#39;d say Orange crush is a good strain to try.\u000a

VThis sh** makes me laugh. I am talking politics and deep stuff and making actually good points and then forgetting them- like I forget the last sentence of each point I&#39;m trying to make. I guess it makes me think. It&#39;s decent for appetite but not great. Makes for fun giggly times for a good portion of the high. Sort of a lightweight, Really good but not special strain. I wouldn&#39;t choose it but I would not turn it away either. Not a great medical strain.

VI&#39;m new to smoking, but ice kept a journal of every strain I&#39;ve tried. This was by far my least favorite. Every time I&#39;ve smoked it I get extremely paranoid and the high is a very weak one at that

Vthe taste of this bud is probably the strongest orange tasting bud out of all of them.. it&#39;s VERY strong and leaves a unique aftertaste which i don&#39;t really like.. high is good but nothing too awesomely great.

VSuper interesting high. So much promise. But it falls short. Let me explain.\u000a\u000aIt actually FEELS like a tangerine kind of day. It EMOTIONALLY COLOURS your day POSITIVELY. And that is AMAZING. Imagine if you could just shift your EMOTIONS into POSITIVE, SUNNY, EMOTIONS. This would be the strain for you.\u000a\u000aBut there&#39;s a big flaw: it makes you LOSE TRACK of your thoughts with even a minimal dose. So if you thought you could take this and BE POSITIVE, and get work done, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to think again, DUMBASS!!! You will be positive, bordering on MANIC, but you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET WORK DONE because of the FLAW in this bud which is that it makes it TOO HARD to stay on track of your thoughts.\u000a\u000aInterestingly, the effects are VERY SIMILAR to a low, half-dose (50microgram dose) of LSD (a non-marijuana based potent Psychedelic), because that compound SIMILARLY makes it impossible to keep track of your thoughts as they wander off, and for the VERY SAME REASON, LSD is not good to work on. LSD is still better to work on than Orange Crush, because Orange Crush moves you into Manic mode more predictably than LSD which does not necessarily move you into manic mode. So it&#39;s actually WORSE than LSD on every level, and - let me tell you something -  LSD ain&#39;t that great for work either, but OC is VERY CLOSE to low-dose LSD. The one thing that makes it better than low-dose LSD is that low-dose LSD lasts 8-15 hours, OC only lasts 4 hours, AND on low-dose LSD it&#39;s possible to have a bad trip on low-dose LSD, and on OC, it is not as easy to have a bad trip, it&#39;s simply too uplifting. Low-dose LSD can also cause vaso-constriction, whereas OC does not. The only thing that is possible on Orange Crush, because of it&#39;s Sativa heritage is to get anxiety and paranoia.\u000a\u000aOC reminds me of a favorite TV show: The OC. It feels as positive as that TV show did, which is INCREDIBLE. But again, there&#39;s this in build flaw in Orange Crush that starts even at tiny doses. And that 1 flaw screws the bud up off what it could be - which is BEYOND PERFECT.\u000a\u000aIt does also PUSH YOU INTO A BORDERLINE MANIC STATE IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH, which is BAD. But if you take the right amount, you&#39;re suddenly emotionally positive. Which is MAGIC. And I wish that was the ONLY effect, but alas it effects your ability to do work, which, to me, makes it SO PROMISING, but ultimately USELESS. \u000a\u000aIf someone could breed the LOSING TRACK OF THOUGHTS MANIC aspect OUT of this bud, I would be in love, as you would now have a bud that JUST shifts your emotions to the right place and does nothing else. You would have THE PERFECT BUD.\u000a\u000aBut this guy packs that second punch of losing track, and that sucks.\u000a\u000a3/5, but it has the potential to be 10/5 if someone could breed the manic lost thoughts out of it.

VI was going to give it half a star but the taste was a redeeming quality, I was really excited to try this strain out however no matter how much I went through the ceiling was hit immediately and the buzz was less than memorable, I can&#39;t see myself ever medicating with this strain again and would recommend blueberry over this strain heavily. Don&#39;t expect a strong buzz or anything too crazy because you will be extremely disappointed, especially if you&#39;re looking at this strain from a higher tolerance prospective \u000a\u000a

VI&#39;m not really one to complain about weed, but I only tried this one based on the reviews. This was a middle shelf strain with those basic results. I don&#39;t know what people are smoking, but this didn&#39;t smell like oranges or taste like oranges or anything citrusy. Maybe I had a bad strain but I suffered through that 1/8

VIt&#39;s a bit of an &#39;airy&#39; strain. Mentally felt blank, was hoping it would be more of a creative strain. Smell is really strong, all in all, if you had a different option in front of you I suggest you choose the second. It&#39;s a good strain, just not up to par.
