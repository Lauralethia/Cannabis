VThis was my first in my life. I sat in a dark woods area... Sat there for about 30 minutes just hitting my pipe. After the affect came in, I started feeling really tired an lazy, I got kind of head dizzy for a bit (10 minutes). Then I started walking up to my house... When I got home, I felt really hungry and also much more sleepier... After my food... I fell asleep in a instance. I recommend this for people that want a goodnights rest. :)

VI&#39;m a sucker for anything with Purple in its name. Suffering from Insomnia, loss of appetite, muscle aches and a plethora of other health issues. This Magnificent strain has been a godsent. The look is Frosty witg hues of purple green and white. The flavor profile is that of Purple (If that makes sense) with a soft creaminess of ice cream. The exhale is smooth like Buttahhh. This baby packs a punch, even for experienced smokers like myself. I would recommend this for anyone seeking relief , sleep and hunger .

Vhey dogzrule,, I just read ur review and saw that u live in Washington which is where my Father lives and maybe cuz especially now that weed is completely legal in Washington maybe the government sold their HUGE stash of G-13, but since 1998,,it&#39;s even been talked about in the movie American Beauty with Kevin spacey and he starts smoking weed with that neighbor kid who slangs tree and the kid is telling Kevin spacey about the myth of G-13 and how the government literally sumhow seized all of the G-13 due to the fact that its LITERALLY the best weed out there cuz it has ZERO paranoia and ppl were starting to go crazy about it and everybody loved it, and the government wanted to perform tests on it to see what the craze was about it and also to see if it really was something that could or should be used medicinally and in the movie the neighbor kid tells Kevin spacey that he stocked up BIG TIME before the government got all the floating around G-13, so that&#39;s how he was able to keep supplying Kevin spacey with G-13 cuz he hella stocked up on it. I&#39;ve heard this numerous times from numerous different outlets. I have ALWAYS wanted to try G-13 and it sux that I can&#39;t find it ANYWHERE and EVERYBODY just keeps telling me that I&#39;m a lil over 15 years late on being able to get my hands on some true legit G-13. I&#39;m sure SOMEONE out there has the ability to grow the real thing but I&#39;m sure that they&#39;d charge out the ass for it
