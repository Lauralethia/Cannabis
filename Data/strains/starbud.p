Vsweet, piney, and chem smelling, taste similar as the smell but not as intense. good body buzz not has heavy as a thought it was going to be but was still good. very slight head change. good for pain or sleep. got at cg Corrigan&#39;s in Albuquerque for $10 a gram. bud was of good quality not the best or the worst.

VMy oh my! StarBud is a knockout. I was lucky enough to pick up some flowers from Greenland dispensary in Portland, and it is my new hands down favorite. \u000a\u000aThe taste and smell are not its strengths, but it is a beauty to look at. It smokes very smooth, but not a lot of spice or zing to it. But Holy Geez, it has a wonderful quick high. Very relaxing, nice and calm. But it does come on pretty quick. \u000a\u000aIf you get a chance to enjoy StarBud, DO!

VJust recently came by this strain, and it quickly went on my list of favorite&#39;s! Hits very hard, very heavy smoke, earthy taste, really relaxing and mellow, perfect for a night smoke after long days work. :) However it is very strong so if u plan to smoke a lot of it at once  you may get slight euphoria which might turn into slight anxiety or paranoia.\u000a\u000a

VThis is one of the most powerful indicas I have smoked. My husband, sister-in-law, and myself think that this is the hard hitter out of all the strains we smoked. This is always a knock-out punch, leaving you flat on your ass.  This is the type that will leave your ass on the couch and you are thinking &quot;Why the hell is my body and head so heavy?!  Am I turning into a rock? Why is gravity so strong?!&quot; \u000a\u000aIf you have issues with insomnia or staying asleep, this is the cure. If you want to feel like you got the heaviest sleep of your life, this is what you want to smoke. \u000a\u000aThe flavor is highly citrusy- when I think of it, it tastes exactly like the Starburst candy - LEMON flavor, EXACTLY !!!!!!

Once your done smoking you aren\u2019t at your highest yet. That happens later. And you just feel euphoric, your dizzy and happy all at once.
