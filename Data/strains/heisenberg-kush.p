VThis is one of my top favorites. This is perfect for after a hard gym workout. I&#39;m not an earthy flavor fan, but this one gets it by me kinda smoothly. If I had a chance to have this all the time in my reserves, I&#39;d keep a standing order. :)

Veh. it&#39;s cute. definitely did not get my Walter White&#39;s worth of action of this strain. very misleading. here am I expecting ATF. instead I&#39;m tending flower gardens? \u000a\u000ashit. maybe the name suits it. get it? suits it? \u000a\u000aexactly. rename should be DSnT. don&#39;t smoke n text.

VVery weak strain. Not potent at all.\u000aI smoke double what I normally would smoke, and it still fails to get a decent job done.\u000a\u000aPros: It is pot, so if you get it free you may as well accept it. Smoke enough and you will get a small high.\u000a\u000aCons: Weak strain.
