VI give this strain a 10 out of 10. The method of consumption is dabbing. The aroma is nice nothing crazy. The taste is incredible I can&#39;t really explain it, but it&#39;s unlike any other. Almost sort of spicy.\u000abefore medicating;\u000aDepression 8/10 Pain 6/10 Nausea 10/10\u000aAfter medicating:\u000aDepression 0/10 Pain 0/10 Nausea 0/10\u000a\u000aEffects:\u000aEnergetic, happy, uplifted, talkative, and an overall sense of wellbeing.\u000a\u000a I usually prefer indicas however I suffer from symptoms that are all over the scale. For example sometimes I suffer from insomnia &amp; need a strong indica - or I suffer from fatigue &amp; will need a sativa for energy. \u000a\u000aThis is now a staple in my medicine box I love this strain!!!\u000a

VNot to get completely TMI, but based on birth control and my anti-anxiety meds, my libido is practically nonexistent. I&#39;ve tried lots of different combinations of things but nothing seemed to work. Even when I did want it, the ability to finish was noooot possible. \u000a\u000aCue Kaboom. This strain feels like it sort of...melts away the fog I get from the meds that prevents me from getting aroused. Twice now this strain has helped not only put me in the mood but to finish what was started, too. I&#39;m so relieved I finally found something that helps me in that department (and my lovely wife is happy too).

VGrew this strain last year after hearing of its pain relief benefits. Great producer, it&#39;s pain relief is the real deal. After recovering from. gut surgeries I was left with a lot of pain. With the help of this strain, I was able to walk away from oxycodone without a hitch. By just smoking ( or vaping ) a little in the morning, I can start my day relatively pain free. Not to mention the fact that I turn into a downright chatty cathey. Mixes well with a good dark roast cup of joe. At night it&#39;s very comforting just before calling it a day. The lemon pinesol flavor is really quite refreshing. If You are able, put this one on your gotta try list. One of TGAs best to date.

VHot damn!! This was some seriously powerful herb. First time I smoked it got 2 puffs in and it hit me like a ton of bricks, had to put that joint out halfway through. Everytime I&#39;ve smoked it since it never ceases to amaze how quickly and powerfully it hits you. Wicked good sativa rush that was just awesome in every way.\u000a\u000aThe taste was so zesty and fresh, kind of like lemon pledge and cleaning products, but in a good way.  With a bit of Jack Herer and Romulan in the genetic mix you really can&#39;t go wrong with this one.

VSmells of lemon pine sol and... well lemon. I grew it my self and gave it 9 weeks to finish. Great citrus lemon flavors when cured three weeks. Heavy crystals and great turpins.\u000aFast creative sativa high. Mildly trippy but in a good way. Great for stress relief and working either physically or writing and accounting. Great college student and professional medication.

Vthis is an extremelyrics great Sativa with a nice pine/citrus smell too it. \u000a\u000aAt first hits hard in the head while maintaining focus and a nice happy relaxed feeling. \u000a\u000aDo to much and couch lock..... again before going to town on this, smoke out a regular pipe or joint. you may say &quot;but I have a high tolerance&quot;. With this stuff, yea there&#39;s a reason they call it kaboom.

Granted the set and setting were ideal--a mild but brilliantly sunny day in the Pacific Northwest--a holiday, Memorial day--just my best bud and me doing a little touring--both of us otherwise feeling great physically, well fed, well rested, nothing urgent or stressful hanging over our heads and...\u000a\u000aKaboom carried us into blissful hilarity for hours, and hours, and hours with occasional tokes to keep the ride going, but no crash, just sunny summery carefree childlike freedom. \u000a\u000aI hope you find a chance for a holiday soon!!

Pain is distances away and you&#39;re ready to accomplish whatever tasks you feel inspired to do...or most of them will be &quot;accomplished&quot; (or you&#39;ll decide it&#39;s a great time to share your wisdom of this wonderous strain &amp; all of its good attributes).
