VBeautiful greens and even dark purples deep in the buds. Lots of little trichomes make the bud glisten. The smoke is mellow and smooth. Taste is fair. Nothing out of this world though. The high is mellow and I think for myself I could smoke a good 1.5 G king size and be perfect. Maybe this batch is better for novice smokers. I like more punch/kick/flooring meds. lol Just my opinion as of now. The bud is still beautiful in look and it&#39;s medicating none the less. I&#39;m happy and high! Yay!

VGreat strain. Definitely will lift ANY mood. Whenever i have some SSS i cant stop smiling, laughing an being all around happy. Great for Depression, ADHD, PTSD, etc. IMO, this strain is a daytime strain. A few tokes and im on cloud 9. And for a strain with a lower THC content (roughly 15%), it packs a powerful punch. Keep in mind that THC doesn&#39;t always determine the potency, as Marijuana is made of a recipe of chemicals.

VLike another reviewer said I have never been so happy in my life it was my very first medical bud was combined in a pre-roll with DH it took me all this time to figure out what SSSDH was. Now I will  spend the rest of my life looking for the genetics because I refuse to grow unless Sss. I won&#39;t  grow but for this one strain I would. Wish me a quick blessed finding of the Sss again it was July 14 2015

VThis is a nice relaxing strain, it has some pain relief properties. But not as well as varieties that are high in CBD do. That being said it was a nice energizing but not wired feeling. I felt absolutely no paranoia with this variety.
