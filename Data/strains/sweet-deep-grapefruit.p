VI love this strain. I&#39;ve grown it outside a few times, and have had great success with it. Dense green buds with orange hairs. A good yielder. I get more of an acidic taste with it. Some say it tastes like pineapple or grapefruit. It finishes early, usually by oct 1. Sometimes a little earlier.

Vas i was reading all the reviews i didn&#39;t see one that explains how you actually feel when trying this one out, i tried this over the weekend and 1st impression and hope it works as a warning , try not to give a big hit the 1st time (i did and made me throw up)\u000athe high itself i personally didn&#39;t like it, i was in a deep conversation with myself, witch in some way people like that , i didn&#39;t enjoy that much personally , what i did enjoy about the sweet deep grapefruit is that the food was delicious it stands out from the other ones , in the info says happy relaxed , i felt a little happy and relaxed  half way thru but just for a moment, after that it was the self critic again , so i wouldnt say relaxed or happy i would say that this weed is best for people that have trouble eating or for loose of  , and i bet there would be far better highs and make you hungry than this one so thats why i would give 3stars .\u000adidn&#39;t like the high but the food and the hunger builds up in your trip and once you eat you want more !! and more!!! and moar!!

VMy area may be an outlier, but I haven&#39;t gotten much quality out of this strain. The bud I&#39;ve gotten has been mediocre at best, even off of plants I have grown myself. Mostly woody flavor, I&#39;d pass on this one.
