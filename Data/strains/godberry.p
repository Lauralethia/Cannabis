VMAN I LOVE GODBERRY!  This is my second time medicating with it, and it&#39;s just soooo awesome.  Great pain reliever and insomnia cure.  If you need to sleep and kill pain, you have to try this one.  You won&#39;t be disappointed!!!

VGodberry does not dissapoint!  My husband and I smoked this about an hour before bed and it hit both of us like a freight train!  Nice, relaxing, and we got the giggles once we were in bed.  Nice intake, great taste, got mine from GTA in Phoenix.  LOVE IT!

VAt first I was skeptical about this strain because the description made it seem like it would render a person useless and bound to the couch all day. When, in fact, my experience was the opposite. I vaped it instead of smoking and found this strain to be exactly what I was looking for. It completely killed the pain of my muscle spasms but didn&#39;t make me feel high or &quot;stupid&quot; like I expected. It turned out to be great for daytime use and I was able to get things done and be mentally sharp.

VA remarkably potent strain that tastes phenomenal.\u000a\u000aTaking more than 1 hit of Godberry is a surefire way to wind up horizontal. 1 hit, in itself, will have you thanking the stars that you have Netflix and a cellphone to order pizza.\u000a\u000aPerfect for a long night at home, either crushing a TV marathon or catching some elusive Zs.

VReal new to using marijuana as medication. I can tell you this much, things have changed since the 80&#39;s. Now as a PTSD patient, who has not had a real nights sleep in 9 years, this stuff is awesome. Even the reoccurring dreams and nightmares are not as bad. It&#39;s nice to sleep, without some VA prescribed addictive medication.

VOne of the best Indicas around for sleep. Hit it at 3 am with lots of insomnia and was out like a light in just 15 to 20 minutes. Didn&#39;t experience any munchies, but then I was asleep before they would have kicked in. Slept a hard 8 hours and awoke up refreshed and with no brain fog, which is a hazard with some indicas for me. Prefer this over Purple Urkle, Northern Lights, Gods Gift and a tie with 24K.

VI tried out this strain as my caregiver recommended. Oh. My. God. First, it burned so smoothly. I barely coughed at all, than again I&#39;m used to concentrates and I smoked this in flower form. Second, it smelled AMAZING and tasted even better! I tasted straight berry in the back of my mouth for two hours!! You do get serious cotton mouth though. Have a drink on hand! Third, don&#39;t plan on getting anything done with this strain. I took a shower right after smoking as it didn&#39;t hit me right away (I smoked an average sized bowl) and I swear I was in the shower for 45 minutes. This strain really does relax you and makes you want to do nothing at all... I was dreading my after shower routine. It&#39;s perfect for stress, lack of sleep, etc. Just do everything you wanna do and get everything ready for yourself before you enjoy this strain. &#128514; Also, you do get a little giggly in-between smoking and wanting to pass out!

VMmm...one of my favorite Indicas no doubt. I had some of this, grown in a greenhouse outside. Absolutely beautiful and I can almost say it&#39;s one of those 1 hitter quitter type of strain. Super relaxed, in a euphoric state of la la land bliss. A very nice change from an OG. In the top part of my favorites list. Find this if you can!

VThis strain has received very positive reviews but it is indeed not a very potent bud. You must consume a lot of this fluffy bud in order to feel the full effects but even at peak level it will not be intense. I do not recommend it, especially for the higher price it is usually set at.
