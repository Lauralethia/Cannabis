VGot this twice in Illinois from Cresco. I have been sleeping like a baby with this wax. Strong, relaxing, sleepy feeling is difficult to fight, recommend night time only. But every night.

VCresco labs indica strain has nice and sweet pine flavor with a very mild finish. I experienced heady relaxation and relief from stressful and anxiety-driven thoughts. This strain also dulled the pain in my hands.

VPerfect Indica for me. Can take a few puffs in the morning and tame anxiety or before bed to get me to sleep. Happy, relaxed, a great strain for emotional release. Makes me chatty. Wonderful insight came to me on several occassions while burning through an 1/8. So, I got a quarter and it is still treating me so so fine.

VA nice, eazzzy strain that melts away anxiety. Pretty heady and good for tv watching. I agree that it is a good &quot;go-to&quot; indica.

VThis is great for relaxing! I sleep like a baby.  It takes away muscle spasms.  Also helps with Multiple Sclerosis pain.  I vape it, all I need is a couple hits and I&#39;m feeling the best I do all day.

VDoesn&#39;t present as the prettiest flower I&#39;ve seen by any means but it smokes smooth. It&#39;s a great, typical indica that def helped me eat and sleep but wasn&#39;t exactly fantastic for pain. I still gave it five stars tho because it absolutely works for appetite which hit me the very first hit despite my high tolerance. And great for sleep! Oh btw, I&#39;d not suggest this if you&#39;re single. Very high on the arousal side too.

VI love this strain. I was praised that It  was reccomend &amp; I choose it. It&#39;s the best stain of flower so far I&#39;ve purchased through my local dispensary. I would recommend it to any patients who suffer with sleeping disorders like insomnia. It was also welly described in this description. When I first took this medicine I definitely felt a &quot;creeper&quot; like effect and anxieties raised but very shortly after I was in immense relief from pain &amp; feeling calm relaxed. It&#39;s one of my favorite strains now by far.

Vit was a great high, but it was a little short lived. The feelings that gave you was beyond explanation. This is one of the best highs i ever had. I smoked three blunts and four bowls of this and then I was at the skatepark skating and I just had the greatest time of my life. the only thing I would say is wrong with it is I wish the high would last longer.

VWas incredibly harsh, had lots of stems, made me feel groggy, foggy, and EXTREMELY unmotivated. Unmotivated as in stirring pasta felt like an unimaginable chore. Also after smoking solely this strain for a few days the high started to bring on feelings of depression and and overwhelming anxiety and negative thoughts. The only upside to this strain is that for an indica it sure does what it\u2019s supposed to.. knock you out. Would recommend this strain for anyone recovering from an injury or in a great deal of pain. Otherwise definitely a pass in my book.
