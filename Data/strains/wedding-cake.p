VJungle Boyz puts a good spin on GSC, very frosty and super potent. Good taste, best in the evening for pain and muscle relaxer. I used it during the daytime with Strawberry Lemonade and it pairs excellent. Highly recommend splitting and eighth of each strain.

VVery smooth. Very delicate, yet comes with a nice heavy high. It&#39;s slow to work, so be careful. I usually find most highs instantaneous, but this took several minutes for it to hit. Euphoric, happy high with a slow fade. Had some near like psychedelic moments but nothing too intense and very short lived. Great a few hours before bed as it really put me to sleep as the high faded.

VLoving this one. I picked up a paint brush &amp; starting painting with watercolor. Then I suddenly felt really relaxed, eyelids were heavy so I laid down to listen to music but I could easily drift off to sleep if I wanted to. Pure Bliss! And two of my favorite strains, GSC&#39;s &amp; cherry pie. I was soooo stressed out and anxious after work today but now ... it&#39;s like it never happened &amp; im in my own little world for the next few hours ;)

It smelled really good which is why I got it from the store. It sort smelled like orange juice in the jar. When I smoke it all tastes and smells the same to me but as a flower this smells superb. \u000a\u000aI felt a really cerebral high that left me kind of stupefied but feeling good. The smoke was also very smooth. It didnt burn my throat with a type of pungency like alot of other strains. \u000a\u000a\u000a So for those reasons I think it will always be my new &quot;go to&quot; for a &quot;get high&quot; flower.

So slippery good on the body, and very mind-calming. The go-to for leaving it all behind, and floating into the night.\u000a\u000aI tried twice to smoke this during daytime activities (moving!) Nerp. A 4-hour nap with moving truck parked outside = no bueno. Use sparingly or as a mixer or topper. Seriously!

VA great four star strain. I took it in the form of shatter that a buddy put into a cartridge for me, so I could medicate on the go. If you\u2019re like me, then you may also be a fan of vape pens and trying all the strains to really see what\u2019s the best for a quick on the go, portable concentrate dabbing/vaping.\u000a\u000aThat being said, Wedding Cake isn\u2019t a strain for the morning or day. I mean honestly, you can smoke any weed at any time and be fine, it\u2019s just about dosage. One hit of this in the morning will just leave me feeling ultra comfy. That\u2019s not so bad for me, since i naturally wake up slowly. But any more than a couple hits and I\u2019ll want a nap. I actually keep it by me at night in case I wake up because it\u2019s so effective with putting you in a sleepy state.\u000a\u000aOverall this strain isn\u2019t special. It\u2019s pretty simple and left me feeling ultra relaxed within five minutes of a hit, and it also gave me a good night of sleep. No visual tripping, no anxiety, no munchies, just a pretty one dimensional high. Then again, all Girl Scout Cookie strains, except for Thin Mints, plateau at a 7/10 high for me, or they are one dimensional. Kush strains are hit or miss for me too. Half are phenomal (like Purple Kush) and others are usually pretty boring for me (like OG Kush). I haven\u2019t figured this out yet, but if you\u2019re like me you\u2019ll find similar results probably. If you love GSC strains, you\u2019ll LOVE this. Stay lifted &#129305;&#127995;

VHo lee chit! So excited to see Wedding Cake pop up as a featured strain! My last few flower buys were strictly Wedding Cake by Little Hill Farms. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a full scale, physical melt. So slippery good on the body, and very mind-calming. The go-to for leaving it all behind, and floating into the night.\u000a\u000aI tried twice to smoke this during daytime activities (moving!) Nerp. A 4-hour nap with moving truck parked outside = no bueno. Use sparingly or as a mixer or topper. Seriously!

Vsource of the concentrate makes a good trim run shatter. overall was a pleasant experience. only thing I would take into suggestion when wanting to try this is is you have anxiety disorders be careful and start small either flower or concentrate. because Mercyne is high in cherry pie though GSC does have elevated CBG which has many great anti inflammatory properties and ani anxiety. Wedding cake could causes some mild paranoia for some.

VA great four star strain. I took it in the form of shatter that a buddy put into a cartridge for me, so I could medicate on the go. If you\u2019re like me, then you may also be a fan of vape pens and trying all the strains to really see what\u2019s the best for a quick on the go, portable concentrate dabbing/vaping.\u000a\u000aThat being said, Wedding Cake isn\u2019t a strain for the morning or day. I mean honestly, you can smoke any weed at any time and be fine, it\u2019s just about dosage. One hit of this in the morning will just leave me feeling ultra comfy. That\u2019s not so bad for me, since i naturally wake up slowly. But any more than a couple hits and I\u2019ll want a nap. I actually keep it by me at night in case I wake up because it\u2019s so effective with putting you in a sleepy state.\u000a\u000aOverall this strain isn\u2019t special. It\u2019s pretty simple and left me feeling ultra relaxed within five minutes of a hit, and it also gave me a good night of sleep. No visual tripping, no anxiety, no munchies, just a pretty one dimensional high. Then again, all Girl Scout Cookie strains, except for Thin Mints, plateau at a 7/10 high for me, or they are one dimensional. Kush strains are hit or miss for me too. Half are phenomal (like Purple Kush) and others are usually pretty boring for me (like OG Kush).

VSmoked a big bowl of this after getting some Starbucks and forgot about it in the other room for an hour. This strain smoked relatively smooth and had a pleasant floral aroma. This might be an excellent strain for stress related disorders like anxiety and PTSD. Negative feels come up and and Wedding Cake is like BAM&#128165; gtfo my house. Paranoia level: 2/10.

There is definitely a fairly noticeable tingle of a body high as well accompanied by heavy eyes and dry mouth but for anti anxiety, depression and stress I would highly recommend.

VHolly crap is this amazing strain with the perfect name. I was sitting in my bed vaping this bud and suddenly started wondering when I had cake. This bud tastes exactly like a cake, its crazy. I have a cold and can&#39;t smell well, but the vanilla... It just punches you square in the face. The best tasting bud I have ever had.\u000a\u000aWell, enough with all of the chit chat, let&#39;s get real here. This bud is strong. A perfect choice for an evening smoke after a long hard day. I don&#39;t get much uforia from this bud, but I just feel amazing. The high comes on gently, but slowly starts to build to a very powerful hybrid. Perfect for the evening smoke, this bud keeps your muscles feeling strong, and your mind feeling chill. This is definitely one of my new favorite strains for depression and anxiety, I can just lay down and hang out. Along with helping with my depression, this bud is incredible for my ADHD, I am able to type this review much faster than normal, and the words are literally just pouring out of my hands.\u000a\u000aDefinitely one of my favorite strains yet. And again, BE WARE OF THAT VANILLA!!!

VINCREDIBLE- full body buzz... straight-up stoner! The 1/8th I purchased 2 days ago (8/8/18) was the last of it at my local shop. Labeled as &quot;Triangle Mints Flower&quot; by Jeffery, somehow associated with Northwest Pearl... this is very powerful weed! 29.50% THC 0.09 CBD Mostly Indica I would say, but loaded with plenty of giddy-up as well. Perfect mid-day snack! Sweet little thumb sized nuggets really stick to the finger while cramming them in my grinder. and then yea, wham bam awesome!

Right now I have some live resin and the flavor holds up fantastic! Better than any shatter or clear, the live resin really holds the flavor profile. I usually only dab a few times a day and smoke flower the rest. With this live resin is so damn good, I don&#39;t even want flower. But it is very potent! Both flower and live resin are strong.

VThe aroma of Wedding Cake, as others have said, is very sweet and reminiscent of a cupcake. The flavor is also sugary and unique, which I found a little off putting. Being a fan of indicas (especially purples) and India-dominant hybrids, maybe this was my threshold for sativa and the new cookie craze in cannabis users. \u000a\u000aOverall, because of the effects, I can see why this bus is so popular. It is definitely a daytime smoke and allows the user to be medicated while continuing to function in public.

VI may be one of the few that thought this strain was just, &quot;Eh.&quot; However, I usually enjoy something a little more indica dominant than this one. I thought the taste left a little to be desired. Maybe the name threw me off. I expected something a little sweeter. This was more like one of those weird white cookies covered in powdered sugar at my creedy Aunt&#39;s house in the 80&#39;s.   This strain will relax you and give a nice stoney feeling. But I wouldn&#39;t say it did much for pain or tremors.

VI picked up a nice fresh quo of this strain. Right away the smell was incredible! moment I snapped the bag open the smell was wonderful, and extremely strong. Within 30 seconds of dumping out the contents of the bag the room smelled strongly of good weed. After taking a 1g joint to the face, it was safe to say that I was incredibly high and very relaxed. Despite being very relaxed, I didn\u2019t feel sleepy or an urge to close my eyes. My high was very relaxing and stress free, with a touch of energy. The only downside was my extreme case of dry eyes. Which were fairly red. 4/5 strain

VThis is my all time favor strain! I use medically mostly for depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, sometimes when I get high I get thoughts that I can&#39;t escape. Most strains will cause my thoughts to consume me if I go even a little hard. But, not this stain. Wedding Cake is my magic pill. It completely washes away my depression, anxiety, and OCD. I have not had a bad high with this strain. It has helped me to have a new lease on life. I&#39;m just afraid the dispensary I got it from (Theory Wellness) won&#39;t do another run. I would be willing to buy ounces of this strain!

From the time you see the bud and see all the crystals you know you\u2019re in for a great smoke. This can easily be a mid day smoke or you can let it be your relaxation/sleep smoke.

VAKA Pink Cookies this strain is worth enjoying when you come across it. Buds are amazing. Dense, dark green &amp; dark purple in color &amp; are covered in bright dark orange pistils with crystal trichomes. Scent &amp; flavor was interesting kind of a sweet &amp; spicy. Effects made me happy &amp; euphoric followed by relaxation without being sleepy unless i over smoked or it was the end of my day. Indica dominate with 18% THC.\u000aPeace ecaeP

VThis is Easily top three strain! Although being an avid reader of strain reviews, this is surprisingly my first ever review. That should tell you how good this strain is... when done right, of course. High THC strain that is mostly labeled as indica, but is the perfect hybrid in my opinion.  Heavy handed euphoria can be found here... Possibly from the Durban Poison heritage? Seems to be a hard to find strain. Medmen in Santa Ana has high end quality version, if you&#39;re willing to pay top dollar. Would highly recommend this strain!

VI just took a .2 snap out of my lil roor stemless bong and this strain really brings out the best of Girl Scout cookies and cherry pie. It has that signature pungent doughy smell Girl Scout cookies has with a frosting like twist and also has a hint of sweet candy berry with peppery earthy OG undertones. Strain smells delicious and hits hard like a OG delivers a very relaxed stoney body high with a focused euphoric sativa high but after a couple of hours it settles into a full on body stone but still functional. Good for creative activities and people who want pain relief but don&#39;t want to be couch locked.

Memories of a sugary sweet white frosting, maybe with those multicolored confetti. What more can I say than that.  \u000aVery potent head and body high and very long lasting. \u000a(BTW - This strain has already been created, under &quot;Birthday Cake Kush&quot; (same thing, just an alias), but I am glad to see it again because it needs to be brought into the forefront.)

VI am not a fan of GSC,  but this strain is just so special.  For me,  it taste very sweet and fruity.  Like fruity loops cereals.  \u000a\u000aHigh is a very strong sativa high.  Maybe I will try to swim after smoking these. I hope that I won&#39;t be drowned.\u000a\u000aUnless you only want something that knocks you out,  indica lovers should give this a try as well.  I am an indica person.

VI think this is going to be an all-time favorite for some. I just got finished taking a few (4 hits) hits from the bong 10 minutes ago and I tell ya, this one creeps up on ya. At first the taste is sweet and vanilla in a sort of way. My body feels relaxed. Head feels like a balloon, but with just enough &quot;helium&quot; that it does not feel too tight. Overall I&#39;m feeling really relaxed and happyand enjoying the ride. Have a great morning,evening,or night to whom-ever is reading this.

VHolly crap is this amazing strain with the perfect name. I was sitting in my bed vaping this bud and suddenly started wondering when I had cake. This bud tastes exactly like a cake, its crazy. I have a cold and can&#39;t smell well, but the vanilla... It just punches you square in the face. The best tasting bud I have ever had.\u000a\u000aWell, enough with all of the chit chat, let&#39;s get real here. This bud is strong. A perfect choice for an evening smoke after a long hard day. I don&#39;t get much uforia from this bud, but I just feel amazing. The high comes on gently, but slowly starts to build to a very powerful hybrid. Perfect for the evening smoke, this bud keeps your muscles feeling strong, and your mind feeling chill. This is definitely one of my new favorite strains for depression and anxiety, I can just lay down and hang out. Along with helping with my depression, this bud is incredible for my ADHD, I am able to type this review much faster than normal, and the words are literally just pouring out of my hands.\u000a\u000aDefinitely one of my favorite strains yet. And again, BE WARE OF THAT VANILLA!!!

VPhenomenal for relaxation. But be careful as there is a bit of weight to it. Not a strain that\u2019ll put you down for the count, but it isn\u2019t going to be ideal for activities. \u000a\u000aAs the bud tenders put it... \u201cthe best smoke you\u2019ve never smoked\u201d. Now if relaxation with a good hint of euphoria and clarity are your thing, this will definitely deliver.

VSuper relaxed and comfortable high. I was feeling very irritable and anxious before smoking and within 10 minutes I was feeling the full effects of its relaxation. There is definitely a fairly noticeable tingle of a body high as well accompanied by heavy eyes and dry mouth but for anti anxiety, depression and stress I would highly recommend. I don\u2019t feel tired BUT I haven\u2019t left the place I sat to smoke either lol

VSmoked a big bowl of this after getting some Starbucks and forgot about it in the other room for an hour. This strain smoked relatively smooth and had a pleasant floral aroma. This might be an excellent strain for stress related disorders like anxiety and PTSD. Negative feels come up and and Wedding Cake is like BAM&#128165; gtfo my house. Paranoia level: 2/10.
