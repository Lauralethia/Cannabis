VReally potent, the high reminds me of white widow with a tiny bit more cerebral effects. Had a bit of a creep to it, the indica hits fast but the sativa sides take more time to settle in.

VThis strain in vape form is one of my favorites.  It keeps me going through many laborious tasks.  Anxiety levels stay at a low and euphoria is definitely noted.

VPurchased this strain at Nature&#39;s Medicine in Phoenix AZ, one of my fave dispensaries! This strain is pretty amazing. It was relaxing, yet made me laugh harder than I ever have in my life. There is a nice body buzz as well. I highly recommend if you&#39;re looking for strong pain relief and a nice cerebral high.

VI had never tried this before and thought I should just have a little to test... felt very little. Next time (different day) I doubled (or more) the first amount and I was stunned stupid. You know that kind of feeling? Just all of a sudden a full high that lasted that same strength for over an hour before slowly coming down. I wasn&#39;t expecting that! Don&#39;t plan on doing anything that requires motor skills on this. Very happy feeling, but a bit disoriented at first. Now that I know, it&#39;s all been good :) Good for extreme focus on pretty much anything in front of you. I would recommend this for solo or very small groups. Might be way too hard to pick a focus otherwise. Maybe that&#39;s just me. \u000aWould get again.

VFunky sweet smell that wasn&#39;t really for me but I ended up liking the strain, has a good taste and smokes well. Very social strain, good for a big joint at a party or before going out. Found it to be kinda mellow overall but clearheaded and calming with decent body buzz. 3.5/5

VAK-47 x White-Widow- mild taste and buds are not well developed.  smokes smooth, it&#39;s kind of nice.  i felt my mood uplift and this is definitely good for depression, much better thank AK-47.
