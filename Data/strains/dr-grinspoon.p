VFound this today at Altitude Organic Medicine, being labeled as Dr. Who. Believe me when I say &#39;same strain&#39;, been smoking this in the Netherlands since the early 1980s. First the strain: Best Sativa Ever (if u ever &#39;honestly&#39; find it. It&#39;s Rare! Growers don&#39;t mess with it because they&#39;re difficult to get to flower properly (and most new growers don&#39;t want the negative mark against them). The buds are long/stringy and strongly smell of lemon ammonia...it&#39;s unmistakable. The magnificent WHITE frosting is unique unto itself, and the smoke very strong (for even frequent smokers). You&#39;ll simply have the finest high ever...in sativa form. I suggest you video the experience as you may invent the cure for disease or orate a classic from this white beauty. Very Rare...get it before it hides 25 more years!

VDr. Grinspoon is a very nice strain, i give it 5 stars bcuz i dont care how long a plant takes to flower. whats important is... is it worth it and this one is for sure. she doesnt like alot of things sprayed on leaves but seems to do well against pest. doesnt like too much water or nutes. very potent sativa, great smell and taste.sorta citrus. 14 week flower but great for personal.

VPrix D&#39;Ami in Amsterdam blessed me with this gorgeous specimen. At first I was skeptical about the appearance of the flowers, but the clerk was quick to shine a light on to the tiny pebbly buds hanging from these thin, super resinous stems. He strongly advised that I grind and smoke the stem (which I did) and it blew me away. Very stimulating high and lots of laughs! Top 5 from me!

VPurchased at Dampkring in Amsterdam. The first time I tried it was in a party setting. Not the best choice. Senses were heightened, paranoia settled in. I had to take a break and sit it out while the high passed and I was able to function again. It\u2019s intense, even more so if you\u2019re among strangers. \u000a\u000aI decided to give this another shot while home alone, and... just wow. It was a completely different experience. Incredibly cerebral, everything felt great to the touch, and I did not feel overwhelmed or paranoid at all. Definitely a very energetic high, incredibly insightful and great for those who are creative-minded! However, it\u2019s not a strain I would be able to smoke often. It\u2019s too intense for me. Perhaps better suited for experienced smokers.

VI can just say that this is truly one of the best strains in the sativa branch out there. Ranging 95% to 100% sativa dominance in the plant itself, and really embracing the top overhead feature of a kick that comes within the first few minutes of consuming by smoking or vaping, the plant shows all the feautures one can find in the specifications mentioned in research archives on the internet or your own leafbook. It represents itself as a gift for your mind and lets you think in the utmost brilliant ways. For recreational, creative purposes this strain is one of the best out there and that is why I give it my best recommendations to all users.

VWas traveling with a good friend prior to US legalization in Amsterdam and Spain. We had a bit of everything with some 40% water hash and 12-15 kinds of flower. No matter what or how much we smoked - if you took even 3 tokes Of the DR. It stepped all over anything. The water hash we had was a very heavy indica and made us want to sleep if we were tired at all, toke  Grinspoon and you were walk and explore. If I smoked a J myself it almost over amped me and got me nervous and I\u2019m never nervous. It\u2019s not something you would smoke daily at least not me, but it does get you high to the point of hallucination if overdone.\u000aRK
