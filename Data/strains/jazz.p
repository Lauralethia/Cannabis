VReally enjoyable &amp; compliments CBD strains perfectly.  It&#39;s great for still being functional but relaxed. The happy relaxation lasts long after the buzz wears off. Good for people who don&#39;t want to be too stoned when they&#39;re stoned or used more medicinally.

VThis is my pain strain. It makes me feel like I&#39;m curled up in a blanket of cats who are purring....while drinking the perfect temperature of hot coco. I have disk problems and nerve pain and this relaxes my entire body which eliminates the pain.

VDefinitely sinks me into the couch, which is what I was looking for, high lasts a long time. Put 4 stars because I was looking for a strain that didn&#39;t make me hungry, or think I&#39;m hungry, and this strain didn&#39;t have that as a side effect. I&#39;m pretty sure I ate all my new groceries last night.

VAs the name suggest - strain has a nice high that goes along ways. Best used when up and about. Added bonus - its tasty and aromatic - just shy of Plushberry.
