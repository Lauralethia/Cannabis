VThis strain is nuts. Takes a long time to mature and flower. Took an uncured sample and was out of control. I can&#39;t imagine what it would be like fully cured. An extreme flow of positive racing thoughts. Makes you hyper analyze everything around you when in public. During quiet times it makes you analyze yourself and your own thoughts obsessively. Gave me some real perspective, which I always appreciate in a strain. Do this on a weekend with some creative friends and get some stuff accomplished!

VThe Smoke:\u000a  Tastes quite &quot;new&quot;.  Somewhat acidic and almost sterile tasting.  Tastes like a hospital smells.  short duration from smoke to high onset.  Very heady....a classic sativa.  Arousal and euphoria are the #1 and 2 effects, followed by deep introspection.  \u000a\u000aBest Setting: \u000a  For those with lower tolerances, I would recommend this for a weekend day-time smoke.  Great for watching the game or playing video games (especially online poker).   Had the best results when preceded by a small bowl of an indica dominant hybrid.  For those with a  high tolerance, this strain may be just what you need for a mid-day smoke.   \u000a\u000aBest Med. Use:\u000a  muscle spasm, ED\u000a\u000aWatch out for:\u000a Can get a little &quot;heady&quot; at times.  Easy to lose track of time, conversations, etc.   \u000a\u000aValue:\u000a  Average....great standby if others aren&#39;t available\u000a\u000a\u000a

VHawaiian Snow is the Bomb. I love this strain. It has a sweet tropical taste that will remind you of a Hawaiian sunset. The high is awesome and it lasts for a few hours. This strain will make you socialize and laugh more than ever. It also will give you the munchies so watch out, your kitchen will be cleared out in no time. This is a great strain to wind down from a long day at work. Watching the sunset or the stars at night while smoking this will truly be an experience. Hawaiian Snow is a great strain to enjoy with the company of freinds and family. Its not too intense and is definalty an enjoyable high. I would recomend a movie and a bag of popcorn after a bowl of this stuff. Hawaiian Snow is definalty one of my favorites.

VA solid euphoric Sativa for influencing creativity while being active. It&#39;s a huge help when you&#39;re bored or depressed. Wish it would be more euphoric, but no matter how much I smoke I can&#39;t seem to hit that next level. Recommend for daytime and socializing.

Usually at least I get some kind of body sensation... smells like you are cutting up a pineapple mango salad... flawless in the look and smell.

VHawaiian Snow is pure creation; a brain massage that leaves you both relaxed and ethereal.  It starts with a sharp punch to the center of your matter that reels and sways you with romantic abandon.  It knocks you over with primal ecstasy and lets you free fall into a dreamlike pillow, releasing you from pain, personality, and personal anxieties.  A touch of psychotropic space lets your mind drift for a bit before letting your imagination, intellect, and inner ego take the trails they need to traverse.  You may feel tingly, giggly, or tasty.  Listening to music becomes both a classroom and private dance studio.  (I recommend something by Evil Needle.)  Movie watching or over talkative friends might dirty the snow; this strain is best left to enjoy alone or for relaxed, meditative, and society structure free environments.  After a spell, you return to your body with a surprisingly full-bodied body full saturation.  Both your body and mind thank you with every slow, pleasurable breath.  This is the kind of bud God kicks you out of the garden for eating.

VWonderfully uplifting strain with high cannabinoid content, excellent scent and flavor. Though it is acceptable for nighttime use it is best complemented by a day in the sun and breeze. Powerfully antidepressant in effect, a strain that truly serves as a superior alternative to a cup of coffee upon waking. Makes for great smoke, produces a ton of oil in a rosin press, and is good for edibles too. Easily consider this my go-to sativa. Well rounded effects without any mental cloudiness. Very clear and lucid with this strain.

VThere&#39;s a reason Hawaiian Snow took the Cannabis Cup in 03.  If you haven&#39;t checked this strain out since the birth of vaporizers and Concentrates you&#39;re really missing out.  With it&#39;s very apparent, inherent pineapple flavor, nice, mellow high almost like being dusted with snow on a Hawaiian island, causing you to feel revitalized and full of energy, this bud has a lot of great traits.\u000aIn addition to priming you for activity be it physical, chores, work, spreadsheets. or creative pursuits, it&#39;s not typically overbearing nor do you  feel clouded or hazed. \u000aIn short this is and has been one of the better Sativa strains for being active, or simply having an enjoyable day; clearing stress and anxiety so you can focus on what&#39;s in front of you.

VEFFECTS\u000aGreat solid sativa. It&#39;s effects go straight to the head, immediately feeling light headed. Very good social high,  talkative and creative. Lasts a good amount of time! \u000aSeems to make my head feel strange. Found it difficult to stay focused.\u000a\u000aSMOKE AND TASTE\u000aSpicy, on the heavy side, tended to bring out a cough\u000a\u000a

VHawaiian Snow is absolutely fantastic. Make no mistake this is a medium throat hit and high super sativa. I suffer from ADD/ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, PTSD and chronic pain. However, taking this friend in my lungs to begin my day really did the trick. Scoring a 94% on my Anatomy II exam today! Later on came home and indulged again and cleaned my room. I have been putting it off for months. Need to get things \u000adone? Microdosing THC from Hawaiian Snow will get you there!

VThis sativa was a nice way to start my morning.  It was energetic and uplifting, but also relaxed my muscles and assisted with body stiffness. The overall taste of this was tropical, with hints of pineapple and an undertone of skunk. The high from this strain was stimulating and energetic.

VThis shit is FIRE! Had a wonderful caviar stick of this! Flower, oil and keif all Hawaiian snow. Great wake and bake and really a great way to start the day and a bit of jump in your step! I normally have major issues with sativas but this i did not have any issues with my anxiety on! Only issues is get a lot of water ready dry mouth like no other!

VVery good strian\u000aIn the first 10-25 Minutes extremely High ( Sativa) after about 40-60 Minutes you get chilled and you get a little bit Stoned (Indica)\u000a\u000a5* very good strain to chill with your friends  :)

VLove the smooth smoke, in a vape or sub this strain tasted like sweet flowers from Hawaii! Nice high, euphoric and mellow but not tired, a good one for outdoor play or chillin&#39; at the camp or beach. Was easy on my asthma, no problem there, and I did not have any major &#39;burn out&#39; from it. I&#39;m partial to Sativas myself so that&#39;s my bias. Overall, one of my favourite strains, a sure but for me!

VOne of the best weeds I&#39;ve had. Quite strong, with a nice taste and aroma, and a very mellow, uplifting and cheerful high. Strongly recommended, especially for situations where you don&#39;t want to zone out or doze off. Major thumbs up.

VNot my favorite, but it gets the job done. It&#39;s a serious mental high, nothing else, you don&#39;t feel much different, but you don&#39;t acknowledge pain. Great for social smokers and it doesn&#39;t make you go dumb. Sadly, it&#39;s not that powerful.
