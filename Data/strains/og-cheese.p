VIt was an alright strain. It gave me more of a body stone than a cerebral high. \u000a\u000aOn one occasion it actually put me in a depressive state. But that could have been from a lot of factors. \u000a\u000aOverall, this strain is nice for people who want to sleep well. It helped me with my insomnia.

VReally strong smoke for your throat. When i smoked it I was high for like 2 hours. The strain had a very sour smell and taste, it was quite sweet in taste. I diden`t get any big munchie feelings only dry mouth and mediocre red eyes. The buds are very compact and looks like it`s less than it is.

Vman this stuff is not for beginners.unless you want to go straight to sleep in a dreamy coma! I&#39;m an eighth a day smoker and man since I picked this stuff up I can&#39;t leave my Damn house! lol very headie for an Indica back of the neck behind the eyes, temple, spent 150$ in groceries this week. so yeah anything from cancer to insomnia this is a keeper! or if you just want to walk on clouds and get a true experience of powerful cannabis get it!\u000athe taste and smell are similar very sour with a hint of berry not what I thought. it smells much different then original cheese\u000a\u000aps I will be buying more of this tasty exotic strain.

VSmoked this as a shatter by Maple Leaf Extracts, it was super pure and a really nice light golden colour and left a super clean and small amount of residue in my quartz banger.

VI absolutely love this strain, it is particularly effective at easing my migraine attacks if not stopping Then completely. Very good strain for pain and nausea, it does a good job easing your stomach. The smell is pungent, Sour cheese like but the smoking of this bud is surprisingly smooth, no coughing. Effects can be felt instantly, with full effect after 10 minutes, leaving you in a calm and peaceful euphoria with all anxiety gone and your spirit somewhat lifted, but it&#39;s best to smoke this in the evening or before bed because this is an 80% indica strain and can make you very relaxed and sleepy. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s the best strain for migraine I have had so far and will likely to remain so for a long long time\u000a\u000a5+ stars for this beauty

VI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that this stuff is strong or I\u2019ve been smoking some really bad weed lately (because I honestly have), but like someone else said, ITS NOT FOR FIRST TIMERS. I took a rather smaller toke than I usually do and it got me higher than I\u2019ve ever been. Like really high up. My head is vibrating. My forehead tingles like a mother fucker. Shit I\u2019m high.

VI absolutely love this strain, it is particularly effective at easing my migraine attacks if not stopping Then completely. Very good strain for pain and nausea, it does a good job easing your stomach. The smell is pungent, Sour cheese like but the smoking of this bud is surprisingly smooth, no coughing. Effects can be felt instantly, with full effect after 10 minutes, leaving you in a calm and peaceful euphoria with all anxiety gone and your spirit somewhat lifted, but it&#39;s best to smoke this in the evening or before bed because this is an 80% indica strain and can make you very relaxed and sleepy. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s the best strain for migraine I have had so far and will likely to remain so for a long long time\u000a\u000a5+ stars for this beauty

VThis strain was very interesting to smoke, the smell was amazing, it hit very smooth from a bong and bowl. Overall had a great time with friends, was high for about 4-5 hours and listening to music was to die for.

VI picked up a dozen different strains from some shops in Denver. OG Cheese was recommend by a budtender at The Green Solution. It&#39;s great, a real dark horse to be my new favorite strain. It&#39;s a nice combination, great for wanting to stay inside, but do laundry and stuff in-between smoking. Dig it. \u000a\u000a

VSmoked this as a shatter by Maple Leaf Extracts, it was super pure and a really nice light golden colour and left a super clean and small amount of residue in my quartz banger.  The taste was very common, but the high was a very good balance of indica and sativa.  It was a very good balance of relaxed body but alert mind.
