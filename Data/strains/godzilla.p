VI don&#39;t taste the berry, flower flavor in Godzilla. I taste earthy, citrusy, lemon flavors. It&#39;s a good indica, relaxing body sedation, yet clear-headed. Don&#39;t let the name intimidate you. Regular indica users will find this one soft as a kitten. Smooth taste and comforting. You&#39;ll want to curl up with a good book with this one.

VBought an 1/8 of Godzilla earlier today, it costs 50$ but it was worth it, very diesel/berry smell and buds looked amazing, on inhale it had a very distict diesel taste and on exhale tasted like blueberries, very smooth high, heavy body and head high, it keeps me blazed for 4 hours after just a bowl

VAfter hearing the good reviews and being a fan of Godzilla movies for fifty years I was eager to try this. Was pretty disappointed and expecting some wreckage from this beast but alas. The first couple of times it was a good high but certainly not worthy of it&#39;s name sake. It was OK for by bi-polar needs but only cut my back pain in half. I got it on sale so on that level I&#39;m not griping because it&#39;s decent for cheap weed.

VThis was a strain I had to get used to. Definite hints of indica bodywise, with a sativa finish that basically makes your body relaxed and mind sharp as a tack. \u000a\u000aPerfect while relaxing with friends or before a social event. Makes you uninhibited, appreciative and totally chill.\u000a\u000aA very sweet, almost biscuity smell sometimes when burned.

VI\u2019ve been picking this up quite a bit recently and I must say that I\u2019m more impressed each time. Very very dense nugs, mostly sweet smelling with a hint of gas to it. The trichomes are all over and it\u2019s a really sticky strain. Definitely a heavy indica and proud to be a BC special :)

VPretty solid high, however, I have anxiety issues so I try to stay away from any strains that cause too much anxiety or paranoia. I find the high is a good just zone out and chill kinda high but if I do too much at once I get pretty paranoid. So good but in small doses is the best way to summarize in my best opinion.

VThis stuff gave me a really &quot;out-there&quot; trip for the first 20 minutes or so that wasn&#39;t entirely pleasant, but then it leveled off and was pretty nice. It was a little unpredictable for me, sometimes it would give me tons of energy and sometimes it would make me sleepy. I would recommend this strain to those who like surprises. It did taste pretty good to smoke and it did totally kill a migraine.

VGodzilla OG has just the right amount of strength to keep you up and going. From the looks of the frosty leafs, big trichromes, and tight rock buds, you can tell this bud is nice and tasty. I completed some exercises on the floor after a .6 joint. The effects lasted all day til I got off home from work. This is some fire a MUST for long time smokers.
