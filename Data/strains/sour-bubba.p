VStrain is big time. Super balanced, thoughtful high, maybe a little on the indica side but near 50/50. Mentally chaotic but physically relaxed, if that makes sense. I bought half an eighth on the recommendation of my dude at the dispensary and got shitty drunk and smoked about half of it. I have a big ~15 inch bong and somehow I straight up lost it in a 900sqft loft. No idea where it went. What the fuck.

VThis one hits you really hard really fast and it&#39;s totally fun. The only downfall is that the fun only lasts for about 2-3 hours then you have to spark up again. The coming down portion makes you really sleepy and the fun part wears off.

Vwhoa! My body feels like it&#39;s in a constant state of massage chair-ness. The buds are almost white from how many crystals there are. Taste is magnificent. There&#39;s a 0% chance of you being angry or depressed after smoking this strain, everything about this bud will make you happy.

VWas hesitant to venture out past my handful of favorites at my local dispensary but today I decided to give it a try and am definitely not regretting the money spent. Good for watching movies for sure my concentration is definitely up but the body high you will inevitably feel with this one will cause you to chill to the point of sleep

VIts a very tasty strain indeed if u like a sour diesel tone but somewhat sweet. this bud seems like it locks you down to the seat for a minuted but with a creative side to it with a mellow hit of bubba kush,...... great balance of both nd pretty strong high to go with it
