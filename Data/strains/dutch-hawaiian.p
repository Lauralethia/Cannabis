VI picked this up at the advice of a cheap ass bud tender.  $10 a gram, so I thought I&#39;d give it a go.  \u000aAt first I had a few minutes of mild anxiety and slight paranoia, but then that faded.  \u000aTwo bowls in\u2026 my head feels soft and dreamy, like it&#39;s caught in a gentle whirlpool.  Some of my usual sativas are energetic like caffeine, but this strain delivers a nice relaxed head high and loads of creativity.  This morning, I was puzzling out an abstract painting in my head, and after a few hits of Dutch Hawaiian, the composition just all fell into place.     \u000aThis is only my first time trying this strain, but so far, it feels similar to a Blue Dream high with just the right mix of body and head effects.  Also helping with neck pain.\u000a\u000a**** I&#39;ve smoked this again a few times since my initial review, and it has consistently had the same effect.  This is an amazing strain for any creative person.  I am a painter and a writer and I have recently produced some of my best work while enjoying this wonderful Dutch Hawaiian strain.  I&#39;ll pick it up anytime it&#39;s available.\u000a\u000aWhen Dutch Hawaiian in flower form isn&#39;t available at my local shops, I make my own hybrid by combining Hawaiian with Dutch Treat.  Voila! That&#39;s a bowl of happiness right there.

This superb-herb deserves only the 5-est of stars for flawless potency, perfect crumbliness and delicious flavor! \u000aBig up, Kushmart! Thanks for all your efforts.\u000aDubShaman

VEverything that I consume is for holistic pain relief and medicinal use so finding a stain that hits like Ray Rice in an elevator is a bitch. The way this stuff knocks out pain is absolutely remarkable, the downside to that is it eventually knocks me out too. I&#39;m not complaining, I don&#39;t sleep enough as it is - however that means I only consume this as needed, at home with no intentions or obligations. Between lighting up and establishing low earth orbit, the journey is truly profound. Meditative, deeply therapeutic and pleasantly cerebral.

VFirst vape was smooth with a pleasant piney flavour followed by a slowly increasing head buzz slowly flowing into the body. My ambition to mow the lawn was quickly superseded by the call of my Xbox which was short lived as mild anxiety crept its way in which luckily was also short lived. Ultimately Netflix and a bath is where I was truly happiness, and here I sit while my unkempt lawn continues to grow.

VRecently obtained Hawaiian Dutch top shelf flower. Large beautiful buds with orange hairs and loaded with visible trichomes. Tested at 28.5% THC . The bud is so strong that I repeatedly have been unable to smoke even two bowls in a day!! sweet tropical taste .Wonderful High - Very strong on the Hawaiian side with some Dutch Treat body effects. Doubt that any stoner could finish more than a bowl in one sitting - one hitter for the novice. The intense high is 4-6 hours long -reminiscent of the the 70&#39;s Maui Wowee. Great for any activity -very spiritual. For the Christian, your ability to pray will be greatly enhanced - have never felt the tangible love of Jesus so strongly. Mostly sativa dominant - very trippy - the high will linger for hours,

VFlavor is incredibly spicy! Smell reminds me of Trainwreck or Sour Diesel. Normally I grab indicas or hybrids but today I decided to get an extra gram of a sativa and the local shop had ~28% THC&quot;Hawaiian Dutch&quot;. I&#39;m certainly impressed and not even slightly disappointed. A head high that&#39;s both euphorically clear-minded, this bud woke me up similar to a large coffee with an extra shot or two of espresso.

VFor me this was exactly the high I needed at exactly the right time. Pairs nicely with some good red wine. Smokes slow and fat. Smooth and then hits hard. It begins pretty heavy almost Indica like but gradually sheds the heady shell to reveal an amazing creative, outgoing, performance oriented evening. Best bud of the new season for me.

VI took some of this to a family gathering with other older women in chronic back pain. They were HEALED! And sent me back to Seattle on a mission to find out what the heck that was! Dutch Hawaiian smoked easy, was no-paranoia, and a physical high that made these old gals want to *move* again.

VDefinitely the best Dutch Hawaiian I have ever had. usually they are much more dry and have a crazy nasty bite to them.\u000a\u000aThis strain is so smooth and tasty. Out of a chilled bong it has a nice and sweet beginning that melds into this gamey aftertaste that&#39;s not gross, but apparent enough to remind you that you&#39;re smoking weed... In case you&#39;re so high you forgot you were.

VMine was labeled Hawaiian Dutch instead of Dutch Hawaiian, so hopefully I&#39;m reviewing the correct strain. I&#39;m not a fan of this one. I got a little dizzy and cloudy headed. I had some pretty deep thoughts but things just got way too weird for me. I lost pretty much all communication skills which led to some frustrating conversations. I thought it hit me pretty quickly but then it got worse before it got better, so it&#39;s kind of the ultimate creeper. I got a lot of energy, but none of the excitement. Just the angst. I was going to give it at least 3 stars, but I actually felt like shit the next day as well. So, no more of this one for me.

VHawaiian Dutch is cerebral and fantastic for working or writing papers all night, as well as for cleaning the night before company arrives--ack! HD is a very potent and stimulating strain. it usually makes me feel like i&#39;m on crack and keeps me up until 4am, as if i&#39;d drunk 32 ounces of coffee at bedtime. it&#39;s unhealthy not to sleep, but i really like the creative mental effect of HD, so i&#39;ve now started mixing it with 14.56% CBD flower, which mellows it. now i get to enjoy all of the positive effects of Dutch Hawaiian without the overstimulation and anxiety symptoms it gives me by itself.\u000a\u000athis is a creative and very energizing strain that i refer to as ADD in a bottle, because it gives me very focused streams of amazing ideas and thoughts, but then i forget them completely as soon as i stop thinking about them. it also makes me much funnier than i normally am, but i forget all of my jokes.

VDutch Hawaiian is Awesome, it&#39;s great for daytime use as it&#39;s clear headed, with a nice elevation of energy &amp; mood. It&#39;s not a sleepy stain &amp; it won&#39;t leave u stuck on the couch unable to get anything done. One of my favorite things about this strain is that amazing flavor, u get that pine from the Dutch Treat that blends perfectly with a tropical, sweet cheesey flavor of the Hawaiian it smells very sweet  like over ripe fruit with some citrus and pine thrown in for balance. Hawaiian strains have always been a favorite of mine and Dutch Hawaiian is one of the best. So if you like exotic flavored sativa strains give it a try.

Vgot some from a buddy. looked super good(frosty,thick calyx to cola ratio, great lemony,but earthy smell). only problem was that the calyxs were elusively hollow and thats where it lost most of its trichomes. i found a bit of seeds in some of the calyxs. i believe if you wait too long to harvest, the energy goes into seed production or maybe there were other variables. with that said, i&#39;d love to try some better grown dutch hawaiian because what i did smoke, was pretty good. not the best though. i have to say it looked better than it was

VVery sativa dominant. The leafly strain description was way off as usual.  Very energy boosting head high with slight body high.  No paranoia or anxiety though despite its high ratio of thc to cbd.  Also probably the highest thc % I&#39;ve seen at v 33.12% grown by Terra Canna farms in the Portland area.  Very high quality with excellent taste and smoothness. I have grown out many plants and different strains and this instantly went up there with the best of them.

VAll around a great sativa strain. Perfect for daytime use, as you won&#39;t become tired - unless you smoke more than a gram in one sitting. At least, that was my experience. The flower was dense and sticky, while maintaining a fruity, almost floral, aroma. It gave me a slight headache, but that could have been me just not drinking enough water... I enjoyed this strain. It relaxed me and let me focus on life in the moment, instead of thinking about the future! Hope you enjoy!

VMade rosin/resin from this with 28% thc in flower form. From .4g pressed, it released about .25g in oils/extracts to dab. The smell from the flower itself was amazing, after pressing it, the extract smelled even better. I suggest cleaning your rig for the best taste from a solvent-less dab, I did and was worth the extra cleaning. The aromas and taste lingered after exhaling for a good 5 minutes or more. The head high is clear, the body is relaxed yet anxious a little. Definitely not something to smoke before bed.

VHawaiian Dutch is cerebral and fantastic for working or writing papers all night, as well as for cleaning the night before company arrives--ack! HD is a very potent and stimulating strain. it usually makes me feel like i&#39;m on crack and keeps me up until 4am, as if i&#39;d drunk 32 ounces of coffee at bedtime. it&#39;s unhealthy not to sleep, but i really like the creative mental effect of HD, so i&#39;ve now started mixing it with 14.56% CBD flower, which mellows it. now i get to enjoy all of the positive effects of Dutch Hawaiian without the overstimulation and anxiety symptoms it gives me by itself.\u000a\u000athis is a creative and very energizing strain that i refer to as ADD in a bottle, because it gives me very focused streams of amazing ideas and thoughts, but then i forget them completely as soon as i stop thinking about them. it also makes me much funnier than i normally am, but i forget all of my jokes.
