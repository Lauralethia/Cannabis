Vshit is crazy. dense, nice nugs, I smoke on a daily basis and it is by far the best weed for stress, munchies and just to chill, it&#39;s like caffeine, it keeps you up for like and 1-2hrs to enjoys the high then it puts you right to bed and makes it a perfect unless night (you are out). just make sure to put in drops it you&#39;re planning on being around people you don&#39;t want to know that your high

VI just got an oz. for a fantastic price, and was very happy to see an abundance of super dense, dark green buds, trimmed to balding. The smell reminds me of mild turpentine, and the buzz is a very pleasent, relaxing, and stress relieving buzz. As a result my body physically relaxes, and I don&#39;t have to rely on muscle relaxing pills that don&#39;t work anyway. This leads to pain relief from 5 back surgeries and 2 failed fusions, and a effective cycle of pain avoidance by relaxation. It is available in mucho abundance for those in the right place. The dispensary takes no new patients.

VI picked up an 1-8th from a buddy of mine. The buds World nicely coated with trichrome&#39;s, and not all the bugs, but some definitely had a lot of purple to it. The fragrance was a slight hint of a turpentine like smell crossed with berries. I would describe the buzz as mostly an indica relaxing body buzz, but to my delight discovered that there was quite a bit Of a sativa like head buzz as well, that kept me entertained for a couple hours. Be warned: this strain gave me the munchies very bad.\u000a\u000aOverall very happy with it. This  scent, the taste, everything. I believe this goes better In a bowl rather than rolling it up, in my own opinion.

VOne of the first strains I&#39;ve tried and I have to say, this indica is the SHIT.  I only smoked two bowls of it from a water bong and I have to admit, the flavor was so different, so earthy, so piney, just a different taste that was smooth and so delicious, I was begging my friend for one more.  The high was as any indica would give the user, sleepy, hungry, happy.  A great strain to smoke with friends, or alone, just make sure to have music near by or you&#39;ll knock out.  Keep occupied until she does her healing, then she&#39;ll tuck you in a nice warm bed.  Have a relaxing session.  Cheers.

WOW !!!!! It had gotten even darker hues of purple green and the trichomes were shimmering all over. The aroma was rich mix of sweet berry, hint of grape, with an earthy piney note, rounded off by the smell of coffee mixed with jet fuel.

From that point of view Purple Dragon seems quite relaxing and enveloping in sensation.  The taste is a delightful surprise-spicy then sweet yes definitely grape.

VThis strain is a very unique, one of a kind Indica.\u000a\u000aFirst thoughts upon smoking this strain: The first effects to be noticed was a feeling of euphoria, to which soon followed a numbing sensation to the body and a tingling in the extremities.\u000a\u000aDuring: As the high set in fully, a cerebral, uplifting effect takes over and makes you feel pulled skywards. This did bring around a sense of body dysphoria, seemingly out of body.  The effects upon stabilization felt almost as if I was walking on tingly, puffy clouds. Extremely unique! It brought around a bit of energy and quirkiness that had me jumping around to feel the cloud-like effects.\u000a\u000aDown: There weren&#39;t many side effects, other than a slight foggy haze when &quot;returning&quot; to the body.\u000a\u000aThe Take Away: While this strain is entirely a unique experience, it is not one that I would want on a regular basis. This strain receives the lack of stars due to this. It, in my own opinion, would not make a suitable medicine for regular consumption.
