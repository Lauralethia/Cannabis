VThis one of my favorites!  Very smooth smoke, nice upbeat happy buzz.  I ended up cleaning my house (not something I enjoy doing for sure) for 3 hours..... just a nice steady pace, not frenzied or rushed.  I would pick up or clean something, go to move it to another room, and find something else that needed cleaning.... it was Awesome!  Not only that, but at about 4 p.m. I realized I hadn&#39;t eaten anything.  So, this strain is great for NOT getting the munchies... which is nice for a lot of us!  High last 3 hours.... crank up the music and let it move you!

VThis is probably one of the best strains of pot that I have ever had the opportunity to smoke.  I myself am a huge sativa fan, I love the cerebral high this strain gives.  I recently purchased an oz of Jesus OG which is really good too but, Juicy Fruit is a much more intense long lasting high.  Like with most strains of pot you hit that high and it last for maybe 20-1hr (now keep in mind I am saying that the super portion of the high only last for so long before planing off and beginning it&#39;s decline) however Juicy Fruit intense affects lasted up to 3hours and was a wonderful euphoric, positive, and motivating high. I would not recommend this strain to anyone other than people seeking a medical relief of pain, insomnia, fatigue, depression, cramps, muscle camps, and anxiety.

VAmazing strain 10/10. Very frosty buds, pungent smell, incredible high. This strain delivers intense euphoria and happiness. I found myself grinning wildly while looking for the first thing I could find to do. An active high, this strain leaves your body at peace and fuels creative tendencies. \u000a\u000aAcquired from a trusted source, would pick up large quantities if I had the chance.

VAccording to kindreviews.com this strain contains 17.75% Calculated Active Cannabinoids and 15.39% THC (http://www.kindreviews.com/2010/09/17/juicy-fruit-medicine-man-llc/). It has a fantastic smell and taste reminiscent of the brand of gum it is named after. It also seems to not cause as much dry mouth as most strains this strong. It delivers a floaty, giggly, trippy high. Surprisingly upbeat for a 75% Indica hybrid (http://www.gardenscure.com/420/genetics/51018-juicy-fruit.html), it also has social qualities and would not be a bad idea to bring to a party.

VI had this in cartridge form which is unusual for me so bear that in mind. I picked it because I thought the two landrace strains crossed would be interesting and good vibes, plus I like fruity strains and thought the terpenes might come through since the cartridge brand is more natural than some other brands. The effects were very much suggestive of a 50/50 hybrid, although maybe slightly more on the sedating side. A very spacey, social and chatty feeling to it as well as a slo-mo body high that starts in the chest and moves to the limbs. No special pain relieving properties but definitely useful for negative mood states and tension, just don&#39;t expect to be productive because the energy is all mental from the thai and the afgani is toooo relaxing. Creative pursuits and socializing become priority when you smoke/consume Juicy Fruit.

It is a bit of a creeper.  But unlike a lot of creepers, it comes on pretty strong at first and then, after about 5+ mins, it goes to a 2nd level which is all head.  I like it.

Vthe first time I ever tried juicy fruit was about two weeks ago with some friends. it was a typical rainy night in florida, but after taking a few hits of JF, I began to notice that the rain started falling slower. drip... drop... drip. and then suddenly it would get faster. JF was perfect for intellectual conversations, although there was times I found myself wandering in my mind.

VWow!! I have been stuck with some indica for awhile and recently got sick. I decided indica wouldn&#39;t be the best to get through my cold. so I purchased this strain along with some other hybrid/sativas. It smells wonderful, smokes smooth and actually helped get me off the couch and move around which helped with my headache and general &quot;head feels like under water&quot; feeling. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a boost through the day without a heavy burn out.

I&#39;ve recently started trying it again. I was gifted some Juicy Fruit from a good friend of mine and I took 1 hit. it kicked in fast, started very mellow, then about 20 minutes later, BOOM! The Juicy Fruit bubble popped and I was feeling like I was stuck in a dream and nothing was quite the way it should be. I got kinda paranoid and thought that my good friends that were over were constantly upset with me. I had a hard time keeping my thoughts centered when speaking. Granted I had a great time, played some Borderlands 2 like a boss but couldn&#39;t function otherwise. it&#39;s very citrus when you smell it, it tastes decent enough and I like it. &#128522;

VI tried Juicy Fruit the other day. Just like the name suggests, it tastes rather fruity and pleasant. The smoke was very smooth as well, which was great. The high made me feel like dancing in my seat, while playing some nice chill music and hanging out with some friends. And that&#39;s just what I did. Juicy Fruit has a nice head high, I didn&#39;t feel too much of a body high. I was very happy and talkative, this is a great strain for socializing/parties.\u000a\u000aFor the surprisingly smooth smoke and the uplifting and talkative high, I have to rate this a 7 out of 10. Not the best I&#39;ve smoked, but this strain has some unique qualities.

She has proclaimed that&#39;s she really likes this strain and highly recommend that if you want a warm hug from your grandfather and feel giddy. Get this strain! As for myself my body is relaxed and I have no concerns in this world. I&#39;m slightly hungry now and struggling to finish this review.

VHonestly impressed with how good this smells. Really well preserved in the concentrate I was dabbing. Although, I was slightly let down by the taste. Like Juicy Fruit that you have already been chewing for approximately 10 seconds, it tastes like nothing. Honestly though, for the price on this concentrate ($14), I was impressed, lack of taste is highly preferable over poor taste. As for the high, it&#39;s pleasant and buzzy in the head to start and kind of fades into a nice, calm, relaxation. Perfect for a wake and bake or a lazy afternoon.

Good newbie strain. Just rolls the stress and anxiety away, along with taking the edge off pain. Doesn&#39;t give you the munchies, but makes you hungry. I just eat a good meal and I am fine.  \u000a\u000aAs someone stated, it&#39;s also a good mixing strain. Mix it with a heavy type strain, and it follows suit with an up lifting feeling. \u000a\u000aThis is a nice strain to have around. :)

It felt like the smell had creeped out of the bottle and punched me in the face. The smell is very piney and citrus-y. It\u2019s an almost sour smell, but in a good way. The high was a very fun, laughter filled high. This is the strain that would make you want to sit on the couch and play some Halo or Call of Duty. Lots of full body relaxation and tingles, and also lots of giggles from the strong head high. Great strain, would recommend for weed newbies.

It has a Tropical berry almost kinda of like a tree fruit and it has a really really sweet flavor. im giving this strain a 4.5 out of 5 Amazing strain.

VThis strain was the first strain I ever smoked. I still remember the way the smell of the weed hit me whenever I first smelled it. It felt like the smell had creeped out of the bottle and punched me in the face. The smell is very piney and citrus-y. It\u2019s an almost sour smell, but in a good way. The high was a very fun, laughter filled high. This is the strain that would make you want to sit on the couch and play some Halo or Call of Duty. Lots of full body relaxation and tingles, and also lots of giggles from the strong head high. Great strain, would recommend for weed newbies.

I very slowly but surely cleaned my house for 3 hours!

Good newbie strain. Just rolls the stress and anxiety away, along with taking the edge off pain. Doesn&#39;t give you the munchies, but makes you hungry. I just eat a good meal and I am fine.  \u000a\u000aAs someone stated, it&#39;s also a good mixing strain. Mix it with a heavy type strain, and it follows suit with an up lifting feeling. \u000a\u000aThis is a nice strain to have around. :)

VHonestly impressed with how good this smells. Really well preserved in the concentrate I was dabbing. Although, I was slightly let down by the taste. Like Juicy Fruit that you have already been chewing for approximately 10 seconds, it tastes like nothing. Honestly though, for the price on this concentrate ($14), I was impressed, lack of taste is highly preferable over poor taste. As for the high, it&#39;s pleasant and buzzy in the head to start and kind of fades into a nice, calm, relaxation. Perfect for a wake and bake or a lazy afternoon.

VJuicy Fruit is a strain I go to when I want to play some acoustic guitar or mandolin. Take two good bong rips and within minutes you will be really high in the head. The first 15-20 minutes I can do nothing more than warm up exercises, but all of a sudden I get this creative rush, my fingers just start fluidly flowing on the fret board, and I get so focused and zoned in that I lose myself in the music. Euphoric feeling, absolutely euphoric.

It has a Tropical berry almost kinda of like a tree fruit and it has a really really sweet flavor. im giving this strain a 4.5 out of 5 Amazing strain.

VJuicy fruit! My first time smoking this and I picked it yo at THC in Van Nuys for $40 a 1/4 so I been smoking it all weekend.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m really digging the feeling this strain gives me, totally relaxed and stress free. I suffer from anxiety and this feels like I poped a xanax. \u000a\u000aThe smell of this strain is super sweet and fruity. Tastes the same and a lil earthy. The smoke is thick and smooth. Perfect for smoking all day.

VI love this strain.  I am an artist and I love how it sparks my creative mind.  Before I am getting ready to make a costume or think of show ideas, I have a little Juicy Fruit and it kicks my brain into gear.  It also helps to relax me and mellow out any stress I might have.  I haven&#39;t noticed too many negatives with this strain.  I feel really good when I medicate on this.  I definitely recommend this! \u000awww.cannafemmesparkles.com

VThe name is super accurate - this weed has a really pleasant, fruity aroma with 0 skunyness.

VThis is probably my favorite strain. I take quite a few antidepressants/antianxiety medications and this helps me not be as dependent on the heavy sleeping pills.

VGood strain for a mostly-sativa. Great for the morning to get things started. Has the usual qualities for a mostly sativa bud: fluffy nugs, a productive euphoric high, and sometimes it can make you pretty talkative. It&#39;s also good for focus. The only thing is that it only lasts about an hour, maybe a little longer. But you can just take a few hits every couple of hours and you&#39;re good basically.

VI wrote a review on Juicy Fruit after smoking a bunk harvest. After getting the chance to smoke good Juicy Fruit, my opinion has changed. I love this strain. It has an excellent fruity smell and a taste reminiscent of Fruity Pebbles. The green and purple buds are absolutely beautiful and the high lasts for hours with no crash. It just eases itself away. A wonderful strain indeed.

VJuicy Fruit - this red haired beauty has the signature of an amazing strain right off the first puff. The smell is amazing and the texture of this strain is quite impressive as it is very dry in a good way and it doesn&#39;t stick to you at all so it&#39;s really easy to grind. Also, almost no munchies at all felt on this strain. This bud is also really good for playing piano (or any other instrument) ....you&#39;re able to disconnect from reality so easily and, as long as you know how to function/play on automatic, you end up having a really great/magical experience as you feel like you there&#39;s more time in Time (if you know what I mean) \u000aI loved pairing this up with Trainwreck as it adds to the feeling euphoric but adds a touch of focus to the reality-disconnecting Juicy Fruit.

VJuicy fruit batches down here in AZ is unbelievable getting better with every harvest.I&#39;m loving this strain so much after hearing about it for a long time.Nice mellow smoke to smoke and vacuum and dance in your house w/ head phones on.\u000aOr with a good cup of coffee in morning or some hot cocoa.Taste like juicy fruit stick light pinacolda flavor&#39;s of gum with light thick smoke and even alertness and help&#39;s with aches if needed.Last about maybe a three hour&#39;s maybe more.\u000a\u000a1.1 thc/cbd drops b.i.d. on deck as well.Sublingual dose 5mg earlier in day.0/10 anxiety

Vi picked up about an oz of juicy fruit at my local dispensary and this strain is overall great! juicy fruit is defiantly a day time medicine. it has a very steady head high with a relaxing body buzz. I&#39;ve taken this strain many time immediately after working out at the gym and it put me in a relaxed mode but kept my head up very high. I say it&#39;s a day time strain because I work out at night and every single time I&#39;ve used this at night, I couldn&#39;t sleep for a few hours afterwards. but that doesn&#39;t take away anything from this product. the smell is also very distinguishable, with a very citric aroma, with a hint of sourness to it. the bud also looks amazing, being covered with purple and orange.

VThis strain stayed all cerebral throughout the high. The buds smelled absolutely wonderful.  Taste wasn&#39;t so great, especially considering this herbs name. May have been due to an improper flush at the end of flowering for this batch. Good for wake n bake and daytime mild medicating.

VJuicy Fruit is has an strong effect, The blend of Indica and Sativa seems perfect in this strain. I lean towards Indicas/Hybrids, I rarely mess with Sativas. The Sativa effects i felt throughout the high was a nice addition to this Flower.

VThis strain is definitely a winner in my book. It&#39;s frosty as fuck and fun to look at. The high was unlike anything I&#39;ve had in a while. It hit me pretty fast and took me to a different planet for about an hour. After that I started to mellow out and went to chill with friends. It gets you very talkative social and happy. The only problem was when I was becoming sober off it I got an intense headache. So I don&#39;t know if it was just because it was the first time I smoked or that&#39;s just how it affects me. Definitely going to try it again though.

I have tasted other samples of juicy fruit and it was the smoothest I had ever had, so I believe that to be how it is supposed to be.\u000aThe effects are nearly immediate and creep up fast. I didn&#39;t realize for a second that they were in full effect. It is definitely a GREAT hybrid. I catch myself staring out the window a lot and just thinking. Don&#39;t feel like doing much, but I&#39;m sure i could be persuaded easily. Very relaxed and pleased with Juicy Fruit.

VWhen taken in moderation, Juicy fruit has the potential to rise in my daily cycle. My introduction to Juicy Fruit&#39;s effects happened first thing this morning. Previously, I read a few reviews about this strain in which the authors stated that JF may cause some dizziness at the onset of administering it. I&#39;ve found that true for a few other strains, which for some users, may induce a bit of paranoia or anxiety. To avoid an experience that is too intense, I lessened my usual dosage to account for the undesired effects. I think the most important consideration when rating strains must include, &quot;what is this specific strain good for?&quot; I like to wake and bake, then hit the gym and be focused; moreover, I don&#39;t want to feel dizzy! I want to be functional and coherent. My experiences with this strain have been consistent; also, I&#39;ve factored in that over time I&#39;ve adapted to the effects and know what to expect from JF. Overall I enjoy the effects Juicy Fruit provides me, and aside from the dizziness consideration, it works well. I get my regime done and I feel great while I&#39;m doing it. Regarding the look and taste of this half Thai half Afghani strain, when broken down it looks like a purple OG, but smells fresh and taste sweet. I look forward to finding this strain in its purest and complete expression.

VInitial impression: Recently came across this strain at my local watering hole, and decided I would buy a little of this strain, simply because of the name. It sounded yummy. I asked to see the large glass jar it is stored in so that I could stick my head in and take a nice deep breath. It was like leaning over a 5-gallon fruit punch Gatorade container and getting that real fruity waft. I bought a few pre-rolls. They were rolled with &quot;Raw Rolling Papers&quot;, and fitted with &quot;Raw Tips&quot;.\u000a\u000aI use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.\u000a\u000aAroma: 8.0\u000aThe aroma was really the only thing this strain had going on. As I stated above, the strain has a very pungent tropical fruit punch aroma, really kinda cool. Another friend of mine stipulated my claims about the 5-gallon Fruit Punch Gatorade, although he thought it was more reminiscent of &quot;Hawaiian Punch&quot;. Like I wrote earlier, this was the only trick this old dog knew, how to smell good.\u000a\u000aTaste: 4.0\u000aThe taste of this bud was something quite different than its scent. If anyone has ever had several day old Hawaiian Punch that has been left in the car to get hot, this tasted worse than that. I am not saying this strain isn&#39;t okay, it is for someone without olfactory senses (no taste or smell). It left something to be desired, a lot.\u000a\u000aPotency: 5.5\u000aThe strength of this euphoria was average middle of the road high. I wasn&#39;t impressed, I wasn&#39;t overjoyed either. Again, this is one of those strains that was middle of the road. I don&#39;t think I will ever purchase this strain again. I might take a toke if someone passed it around, but I wouldn&#39;t buy it.\u000a\u000aFinal opinion: I thought this strain was a little weak. The only redeeming quality was the smell, that is it. Then again, maybe I had a weaker genetic variant of this particular strain, one never knows. I&#39;ll let you know if I decide to try this strain again, don&#39;t hold your breath though.\u000a\u000aTotal points awarded: 17.5 out of 30. I would rate this strain 2.5 stars, I feel that is fair.\u000a\u000aCM~

VSmooth and very cool how much this distillate tastes like the \u201cgum\u201d and I\u2019ve had underworlds juicy fruit cart and that was also wonderful and tasted just like the infamous juicy fruit gum we grew up with!!! Very uplifting and puts you in a good mood upon inhalation-very well rounded strain, tastes great and a productive high if that\u2019s possible...definitely recommend this to anyone that likes to wake, bake, and stay awake...happily cruising through the day!

VI got some shatter of this strain, first off the smell and taste is AMAZING. Best shatter I&#39;ve ever tasted and also provided a strong head high, but relaxing at the same time. Definitely would recommend

VI&#39;m going to rate Juicy Fruit as a 6/10. The strain is decent. The high lasts a while. On the other hand, it&#39;s very rough to smoke, even out of an iced water pipe. I coughed every single time I smoked this strain. I got more high from coughing my lungs out than inhaling and absorbing the THC in the bud. \u000a\u000aI would recommend, but only for rolling. A lot of this strain will get you stoned, but not a little.
