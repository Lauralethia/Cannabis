VLove this strain.  Flavor and aroma are of slightly watered down lemonade.  Very nice.  High is very strong and even.  Smooth and even.  Did not evolve much.  My mind felt expanded and clear, but with a comforting and soothing buzz in the hazy background.  Fantastic stuff.\u000aMahatma Platinum Label  100% nug run.

VI bought this strain on the advice of the dispensary staff member. I find Strawberry Lemonade (STL here on out) gave me the actual high I crave due to medical issues. I use the DreamSteam vape pen and it gets the THC into your blood quickly. It also helps me to relax and get to sleep on nights I&#39;m having trouble.\u000a\u000aThe Effects last from 4-6 hours. the greatest high comes in the first two hours after consumption. then as time goes on, nearer 4-6 hours, you&#39;ll still feel a little but nothing like the first 2 hours.\u000a\u000aCost: Now I get one cartridge for $98 and I usually get two as a cartridge lasts me by myself for over two weeks and this makes sure in the event of inclement weather, I&#39;ll have enough to last till my next resupply at the beginning of the month.

VA really good Sativa high.  THC content is 27.9%.  (Wow).  My Budtender said the high would be strong and quick, but only lasting half an hour.  WRONG.  WRONG.  WRONG.  Two hours later my son and I were still giggling about that little bit of knowledge.  (Maybe my Budtender Was a Moon-Rock kind of guy, so his tolerance was a bit higher than mine.)  Still a quick two hour euphoric session was very nice with a great full body afterglow that carried on for a couple of more hours.  I like this strain.  Lots of giggles.  Lots of body hum.

VOne of my favorite strains. I first smoked this strain about 2 years ago when I was still kind of a rookie smoker and I tended to get slight paranoia from sativa strains. This did the complete opposite and put me in a very uplifting and creative mood. I&#39;ve had very positive experiences with this strain and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who wants a good relaxing sativa high.

VThis is a very nice daytime strain. It&#39;s quietly uplifting with a pleasant, cheerful high. Sativas can give me a little paranoia, but there was none of that with this strain. \u000aIt&#39;s also a long lasting, smooth high. There was a nice initial buzz, followed by a tapering off to a continuing, enjoyable high, with enough energy and clarity to be able to go about my day. This would be a great strain to do with friends, and to enhance a day in the  outdoors.

VGot an 1/8th of this from Briargate Wellness Center in Colorado Springs as I&#39;d received an email about it being a new strain on shelf there. \u000a\u000aTo anyone questioning this strain or its potency, I can tell you right now, a little goes a long way. The batch I got was marked 15.87% THC, which is typically lower than I smoke, but this is quite a heavy sativa despite what I thought! I really haven&#39;t had a good sativa like this since I first tried Maui Wowie! This strain relaxes and puts you in a good mood. I&#39;m usually one to always try a new strain every time I buy, but I may have to get myself a half-ounce of this stuff before it&#39;s gone! \u000a\u000aIf you ever come across this strain, you HAVE to pick up some and try it! For as great as the high is, it&#39;s far too great to put in words. It&#39;s something you have to experience for yourself, preferably on a nice summer day.

VI picked up an Ocean Live Resin cartridge of this stuff and it&#39;s by far my favorite bud. I first had it in Amsterdam and it got me roaring high, so finding a cartridge was very exciting! Takes a couple long rips to give me a nice tingly head high that can last for a couple hours. Love the euphoria this strain has as well as the body tingles and the warm floating feeling. This strain is a 10/10 for me.

VI am still fairly new with trying out strains and finding what works for me. I bought this strain based upon the recommendation of the sales associate but also because it was on sale. I didn&#39;t expect it to stand out so much! This is a heavy hitter which mellowed me out tremendously. By far, the strongest head high I&#39;ve had yet. To the point, I told my teenage daughters not to worry about cleaning the house the next day. Say what!!??? I would never say that under normal circumstances! Be prepared to relax and not remember too much later.

VSo this strain is amazing. The smell has a dominant strawberry aroma with a smooth, zesty and citrus fragrance of lemon. The buds that I got were big. Now upon smoking this strain, it was very smooth. I can taste the warm sweetness of strawberry and the lip puck sourness of lemon. The taste on this strain is the BEST. You can really taste the sweetness and the fruits that this strain has. Now the high was amazing. This strain will pick you up, giving you a nice head high with an uplifting, energetic disposition. But then, you really begin to feel a body high, wanting to take a mean long nap. This strain WILL couch and bed lock you. So only smoke this on your day off or when you&#39;re not planning to do anything. 10/10

VWhen I first started smoking, this was one of the first strains I got my hands on, and it remains one of the best sativa highs I&#39;ve experienced so far. Uplifting and giggly, the high was intense and bright, making music amazing to listen to. While high on this stuff, I found myself sitting on my back porch telling my friend that I felt like I was sitting in the room listening to Led Zeppelin write the Battle of Evermore. It&#39;s the kind of high that makes you lose track  of time, and me and my friends felt like every second was 1.3 seconds. This is definitely in my top 5, among 3 Kings, Blue Dream, and Sour Disel. If I ever come across this stuff again, I&#39;m definitely going to buy loads of it.

VWoke up extremely nauseous and happened to have a joint of this I hadn&#39;t tried so took a risk. It was instantly sweet on my lips, and smoke really tasted almost like a hookah hit! I felt so great I ate a big ole slice of banana bread. Gentle overall body high, also - that awesome feeling when your lips are stoned even more than you when you try to drink! I think I am always going to pick this one again in the eventuality that I happen to see it. \u000a\u000aBTW, FWIW, *warning*... I have paranoia as a feature and at this point I know how to put a damper or distract myself from it. However! If you have paranoia problems and you are an experienced smoker wanting to try it out; have at it and take that in mind. If you are inexperienced smoker looking for something &#39;safe&#39;, get more of a hybrid. If I didn&#39;t know what I was doing  by now, I&#39;d be freaking out a bit. I still like it so much that I will still choose it.

VThe firing up of the first taste of this little devil showed its lineage.  The Strawberry Cough parent did not let this strain fall to far from the the plant.  The aroma is a little on the heavy side -- diesel in effect -- but not overwhelming as with other hybrids.\u000a\u000aThe effects were mixed.  There is a delayed body action to this for me and it was entertaining moving around after a few minutes and a couple of long draughts.  \u000a\u000aWhile there is some dulling of the mental senses they are not beaten into submission with this strain.  It sits in the mid-pack of the premium strains for my tastes and proclivities -- remember -- your experience may vary.

VI visited Arizona Organix because there are not many friendly or quality dispensaries in the valley of the sun, thankfully they have changed that.\u000a\u000aThis is some smooth and tasty concentrate.  Absolutely no cough on a two hit dab, I like to think I have big lungs, so gauge the dab size accordingly.  \u000a\u000aI smoked this via enail at 591 degrees - the flavor is clean and soft, reminds me of a Lemon Diesel, but as one exhales the sweetness becomes more present.  Afterwards 4 hours of absolute good times were had playing RAGE on my PlayStation.

VWhen I first started smoking, this was one of the first strains I got my hands on, and it remains one of the best sativa highs I&#39;ve experienced so far. Uplifting and giggly, the high was intense and bright, making music amazing to listen to. While high on this stuff, I found myself sitting on my back porch telling my friend that I felt like I was sitting in the room listening to Led Zeppelin write the Battle of Evermore. It&#39;s the kind of high that makes you lose track  of time, and me and my friends felt like every second was 1.3 seconds. This is definitely in my top 5, among 3 Kings, Blue Dream, and Sour Disel. If I ever come across this stuff again, I&#39;m definitely going to buy loads of it.

Now upon smoking this strain, it was very smooth. I can taste the warm sweetness of strawberry and the lip puck sourness of lemon. The taste on this strain is the BEST. You can really taste the sweetness and the fruits that this strain has. Now the high was amazing. This strain will pick you up, giving you a nice head high with an uplifting, energetic disposition. But then, you really begin to feel a body high, wanting to take a mean long nap. This strain WILL couch and bed lock you. So only smoke this on your day off or when you&#39;re not planning to do anything. 10/10

VWoke up extremely nauseous and happened to have a joint of this I hadn&#39;t tried so took a risk. It was instantly sweet on my lips, and smoke really tasted almost like a hookah hit! I felt so great I ate a big ole slice of banana bread. Gentle overall body high, also - that awesome feeling when your lips are stoned even more than you when you try to drink! I think I am always going to pick this one again in the eventuality that I happen to see it. \u000a\u000aBTW, FWIW, *warning*... I have paranoia as a feature and at this point I know how to put a damper or distract myself from it. However! If you have paranoia problems and you are an experienced smoker wanting to try it out; have at it and take that in mind. If you are inexperienced smoker looking for something &#39;safe&#39;, get more of a hybrid. If I didn&#39;t know what I was doing  by now, I&#39;d be freaking out a bit. I still like it so much that I will still choose it.

VPositives: \u000a-The smell. This stuff smells so fuggin good I sat on my couch for 20 minutes just sticking my nose inside the bag and breathing. Definitely smells like lemonade. \u000a-The color. A lot of orange hairs on it and little crystals.\u000a-The taste. It&#39;s a little sweet so it doesn&#39;t feel like someone is farting in my mouth whenever I take a bong rip. \u000a-Great day time strain, gives me a lot of energy, only downside is that I generally smoke at night so this keeps me up way longer than i&#39;d like, but as a day time strain it&#39;s amazing.\u000a\u000a\u000aNegatives:\u000a-Definitely feel paranoid or anxious whenever I smoke it. Not unbearably paranoid or anxious, but definitely feel either of those to an extent. But thats expected from a sativa.\u000a-The high doesn&#39;t last long. I&#39;m a weekend smoker so my tolerance isn&#39;t too high, yet whenever I smoke this I feel like I start coming down within 30ish minutes as opposed to other strains like headband where I feel ripped for an hour or 2 after the initial hit.\u000a-I hate it when I get really bad munchies, and this strain makes me eat an unhealthy amount of food. (On the medicinal side this strain would definitely be good for people suffering from severe weight loss or a poor appetite. You munch out hard)\u000a\u000a\u000aOverall pretty decent strain, best smelling strain i&#39;ve ever come across, just a little disappointed with the overall experience, would probably choose another sativa dominant strain like headband or green crack if I had the option, but regardless, this strain can still kinda hold up.

VI had high hopes for this strain. I really did. It smelled great, looked sexy as hell, and broke up damn near perfect for my smoking needs. \u000a\u000aLooks: Solid, tight nugs, weighing between 3 and 5 grams each. Beautiful trichrome development had me salivating in anticipation.\u000a\u000aSmell: The lemon shines thru here. \u000a\u000aBreak Up: Broke up nice, with a wonderful cure leaving the nugs crisp, yet somewhat springy.\u000a\u000aUsage. I used a simple pyrex spoon pipe. Tasted nice, with a huge citrus note in the sample I had. Bowl lasted 5 or 6 trips around our circle of 3 friends.\u000a\u000aEffects: A very talkative high slowly descends into a nice indicaesque couchlock. Total high lasted around 6 hours.

So I probably didn&#39;t get the full idea but I got enough to get it! So based on that I would maybe try this again, just for shits and giggles. If you happen to come across it give a try.

VAbsolutely blown away by the terpene profile of this bud. Strawberry Lemonade definitely lives up to its name in smell and taste. As soon as you break open the massive colas, the strawberry fragrance explodes in your face. I am partial to rolling up a nice-sized cone and puffing on it a few times before it&#39;s sparked to get a feel for the taste of the flower. With this particular strain, I was blown away with the fruity taste of the flower. Also, a great strain to vaporize if you are big on flavor like I am.The only reason I didn&#39;t give it a five-star rating is because I felt the potency could be better but that may be due to my tolerance. Nonetheless, I would recommend this strain to anyone who loves a delicious fruity smelling sativa.

VA good flavor strain that has a definite citrus, lemony taste going though it. Although sometimes as is burns down it becomes an &#39;off&#39; kind of chemical taste to me.\u000aExpect more sativa-centered effects: you will be in the head-high, uplifting neighborhood and it will kind of stay there without going into too much of a body high at all.\u000aComes on quickly, is somewhat strong yet totally manageable, although the high seemed to fade about as quickly as it hit.\u000aA nice, tasty sativa-type hit that has day-time written all over it.
