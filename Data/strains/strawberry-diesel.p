VDisclaimer: I am new to smoking, cannabis, and vaporizing.\u000a\u000aI was looking for a strain to help combat depression, anxiety, and really bad thoughts I am suffering from. I suffered from being mundane, lost touch with things that used to make me happy like music, art, reading, working out, etc.\u000a\u000aThat being said; STRAWBERRY DIESEL IS A WONDERFUL, HAPPY, EUPHORIC, CONTROL THE DEPRESSION, SPECIAL STRAIN.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe first time I used it, I felt an overwhelming sense of calmness, followed with steady happiness, controllable energy, and down right happy thoughts. I had a great talk with my wife, then listened to music until the wee hours! Everything was better.\u000a\u000aThe best part, I woke up the next day feeling good about myself and life. It&#39;s been 2 weeks since I&#39;ve used it and it feels like it set me in the right path. I didn&#39;t wake up feeling like I needed more to feel the way j did, it just got me going. I highly recommend medicating with this strain. Taste is good too!\u000a\u000aFor those wondering, I used a Bhang Stick and their Bhang refilled disposable oil cartridge, the one made with coconut oil. I only took 4 hits, and it seemed to work great.

VThis strain is good for beginners, as it gives a balanced high and doesn&#39;t induce very much paranoia. On the other hand if you are an experienced smoker looking to get some good stuff, you might not be super impressed with the overall high, or at least I wasn&#39;t. But overall not that bad, but not super great.

VAmazing fruity and pine fragrance/taste. Happiest high I&#39;ve ever had, this stuff just makes you feel universally content. Smoked two bowls--the effects lasted around 1.5-2 hours and after they wore off I felt pretty tired. Overall this is great stuff, I&#39;d imagine it&#39;d be perfect just to smoke while hanging out with friends, makes you happy, giggly, and sociable.

VGreat for indoor growing. Grows many branches (outward if topped) with heavy, super super dense buds that smell piney/earthy with strawberry notes definitely in there, especially when grown well. Because buds are sooo dense, mold/spider mites tend to love it also (go figure). \u000aVery strong initial high that doesn&#39;t last too long but can be used for pain relief fairly quick.  The high is certainly &quot;heavy&quot; and can produce a hellofa couchlock if you put your feet up. Leaves you with some munchies so prepare and get some good food.

V*RAW DIESEL* \u000aPretty mello high. Very Sativa like by really only giving a buzz from the shoulders up. A very fun smoke for day time. It&#39;s a good smoke, just one you&#39;d have to keep up a system to smoke all day. Zero sleepiness and no munchies. However it is a very short lived smoke. The high last barely an hour it seemed.

V4.5 out of 5.  First look reveals medium popcorn like bugs with a slight airyness but very resiny, sugary, and denser at the core. Lime green leaves and buds with a few orange and purple hairs, real Beaut. Smell is immediate skunky with diesel and fruit undertones. Grinds to niiiice amount of stickiness and moisture, doesn&#39;t stick to your hands but rolls out to a nice Joint. PERFECT example of a nice hybrid, Pain relieving and euphoric with a cerebral trip to make you wanna go out with friends and family. Only thing that wasn&#39;t idea was the burn out from it leaves you reeeeeallly sleepy, but this strain has even longtime tokers going for 2 hours minimum. Overall 4.5 out of 5

VThe smell of this strain is similar to pink lemonade which makes this strain very intriguing. The high is not too strong with a nice cerebral high and light body high. When medicating to this strain I noticed slight paranoia but it only lasted about 2 minutes and after wards music and stand up comedy could not have sounded any better. I would recommend this strain for time that needs to be given to yourself.

I could enjoy doing just about anything in this state of mind. I even went to work high, which I haven&#39;t done in a long time. Not to worry, I was on my shit and doing it with a smile.

The sheriff just left my dog had to go to court today her name is &quot;cookie&quot; she is a healer lab cross and she herded the neighbor. I was going to tell ya&#39;ll about it. But i smoked 5 hits from a bowl for this review that&#39;s an extra hit of medication for me and I feel like I just ate a xanax. This is a beautiful strain I could just melt into the couch now  or go ride motorcycle or move some wood or a whole bunch of or&#39;s  I think moving wood will have suffice my stash is in the wood bin.

VI didn&#39;t find the effects of this strain as pronounced as other reviewers. There was undoubtedly a bout of drowsiness associated but not so powerful as to curb my insomnia. I am a daily smoker; in the past few weeks smoking this strain I have found it to induce creativity but stifle timeliness. Definite dry-mouth with a rather pungent aftertaste (as is to be expected with a Sour Diesel hybrid). Good taste and aroma. Overall pleasant experience, but would not necessarily recommend to treat insomnia for habitual smokers.

VSTRAWBERRY diesel FIELDS FOREVER! Taste &amp; smell is exactly as the name implies. The dense buds were medium to dark green with light brown hairs &amp; fine clear crystals. Effects made me happy, uplifted, &amp; relaxed. THC level was 17%. Because this is a Hybrid when i smoked a little less then normal it&#39;s good for it&#39;s daytime Sativa effects. But, when i smoked more then normal it&#39;s good for it&#39;s nighttime Indica effects.

VI\u2019m really not sure about this strain. There are pros and cons and to me I haven\u2019t quite figured out if I like it or not. First time I smoked it I had too much and dude- bad. Everything was spinning. Too fucking heavy and intense. I couldn\u2019t watch tv, I couldn\u2019t fucking read. Once it cooled down I started feeling more of an indica stone. The next few times I\u2019ve taken it slow and light and sometimes I just feel a good lift and other times I feel similar to the first time. Im kinda leaning more towards I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s good when you get it right but sometimes it\u2019s not so I started thinking maybe the time of day is affecting the stone. Anyway i don\u2019t know it\u2019s a bit heavy for me at the moment as in quite literally leaves my head feeling heavy. Gives bad munchies too &#129323;

If I didn&#39;t already take some Hulk-strength sleeping pills I would try it for insomnia.\u000a\u000aI might try it for a nap or something, hanging out, watching movies, that kind of bake.

VThe Strawberry Diesel strain I received has a dark purple and dark green mix for color. The potency isn&#39;t nearly as high as i hoped it would be but it has a taste that will make your mouth water for more strawberry. The Diesel mix gives it a skunky fruitiness that isn&#39;t like most fruity buds where they have more of a light fruity taste. I would recommend that chronic smokers don&#39;t purchase this bud in high quantities just because the strong strawberry skunk smell gets almost too fruity after a while. I do recommend though that everyone should atleast try it to see whether its for them or not because everyone is different and some people like fruity stuff better.

The Diesel mix gives it a skunky fruitiness that isn&#39;t like most fruity buds where they have more of a light fruity taste. I would recommend that chronic smokers don&#39;t purchase this bud in high quantities just because the strong strawberry skunk smell gets almost too fruity after a while. I do recommend though that everyone should atleast try it to see whether its for them or not because everyone is different and some people like fruity stuff better.

Vmy go-to strain. relaxing but not incapactiating, i still feel very much in control and myself while smoking strawberry diesel. nice flavor but not the best in my opinion. fairly tight buds with lots of frost. good both before a paper and before bed, though i prefer it for the former. a strain for productivity.

VA trench of this every morning would set you up for success. The SSD I got was a straight Sativa. Either way, if it is a hybrid, it definitely is Sativa dominant. This bud makes me want to get up and do stuff. It also tastes very good - sometimes, all you&#39;ll taste are strawberries! Awesome strain, I&#39;ll definitely check it out again!

VOK, so where can i start with this one? It is definitely strong herbal tinge to it, it is a hybrid so as soon as you smoke it and keep it in you will get very smooth flavor, and like most people rate: you will get a fruity taste, the sour diesel cross gives it its native taste of strawberry. the indica was not dominant in my strain, so it gives that focused feelin and the body stays put, no jerking, but not over relaxation. just quite right. takes the pain from back parts, like that which you would get when you exercise. very fresh air taste to it, and smooth exhale.

VThe first thing I noticed was the great strawberry smell combined with a diesel overtone. The taste is great and the smoke is smooth. There&#39;s a very happy head high and an uplifting, slightly energetic buzz. It&#39;s also useful against muscle pain. When the high wore off a nice comfortable sleepy side emerges. Smoke this at least three hours before sleeping.

VReally enjoy this strain. This is my first time with it, and I am pleased with its aroma, taste and overall effect. It makes me feel fuzzy around the edges, but still able to focus and work, so long as I don&#39;t overindulge. Good evening strain, helps relax and does help with chronic pain, although that doesn&#39;t seem to be its top effect. Anyway, it&#39;s good to mix with a full indica for bedtime use (for those of us who can&#39;t sleep due to pain, etc), or with a charged sativa for a potent but effective daytime blend. I will definitely be seeking this one out again soon.

VA trench of this every morning would set you up for success. The SSD I got was a straight Sativa. Either way, if it is a hybrid, it definitely is Sativa dominant. This bud makes me want to get up and do stuff. It also tastes very good - sometimes, all you&#39;ll taste are strawberries! Awesome strain, I&#39;ll definitely check it out again!

VGot this on a road trip to Spokane, honestly I&#39;m not that much of a diesel fan, grew up smoking sour diesel and lemon sour diesel, did some work as a pain killer but mostly had to smoke a lot to get the sativa effects. When I smoked this it tasted very much like diesel on the initial taste with the strawberry definitely tasted on the exhale. I saw one of it&#39;s parent strains are strawberry cough and I have asthma so I was like &quot;shit..&quot; But it was quite smooth and had a good smoking quality versus vape. Just like the strawberry cough the sativa effects weren&#39;t instantaneous, so smoking more and more I started to feel it, then the only way to compare it to was first was a consistent dribble to feeling like a blast from the fire hose. The indica effects were fainter than I was hoping for hence the 5th star, but of overall I&#39;d recommend this strain for anyone who doesn&#39;t mind their bud kicking in a bit later. Would buy and smoke again!

VStrawberry Cough has always been a very mild strain for me. By contrast Sour Diesel has always been extremely effective medicine for me. Combining the two made for some very unique buds. The over all experience of this medicine is very mild which is not nescessarily a bad thing. You could consider this &quot;get shit done&quot; medicine because it will certainly not impair you. I found that it really helps with just general daily anxiety. Pair this with another strain for stronger effects but on its own it&#39;s a great and gentle medicine. Highly recommended for first time patients or people with extremely low toleranances. http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i33/edgeofwrath/Medical%20Cannabis/IMAG0159_zps12165df6.jpg

VDelicious diesel taste and pungy smell. Hits quickly and slowly hugs your body and makes you feel relaxed and free of headaches. Better for personal out door use. It hit my buddy later on. The effects kick in slowly but they linger throughout the session if you smoke in good scenery. It allows a trippy euphoric feeling along with a giddy and relaxed feeling. Great for night time and day time use.

VBeen smoking this strain for a few weeks now. I&#39;ve gone through approximately 10g of this flower. Nice, relaxed, euphoric high. A mellow mix of head and body. Nothing too intense but nothing bad as well. Definitely a strain to wind down after work without putting you to sleep. Video games are enjoyable with chill music. Playing Borderlands 2 listening to Drake. Munchies are minimal considering I&#39;m stoned. Not a strain to smoke before work. I&#39;d rate it for smell and taste but unfortunately my allergies are acting up and I can&#39;t smell it to verify scent but I can recall the diesel. \u000a\u000aGood strain for what I usually smoke for(stress relief) \u000aNot a good strain to keep you energetic and productive \u000a

VI smoked this strain in the 11th grade when I had just started smoking marijuana . My friend stole some from his moms cabinet ( it was grown properly ) . We ditched school that day and we smoked the pretty flower .. It gave me a very euphoric and happy high I am 18 now with a medical marihuana prescription and I am looking for this strain but\u000a no where to be found in the Bay Area region .. ):
