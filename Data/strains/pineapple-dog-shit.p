Vlovely strain. instantly euphoric and I got a nice balance body high. I felt uplifted happy and got a dry pineapple/smoke taste  mouth but it feels perfectly mellow with a clear positive head. I have bad aniexty and normally some strains set me off but this smoke gave me a nice Sence of wellbeing while able to move about with being stuff to the chair. 10/10

VSuper stinky, but not unpleasant. Hits you quick (quickly if you&#39;re a grammar nazi) and hits you hard.  \u000aPain? What pain?

VTried the Dog Shit about half an hour ago. Pretty quick to lift off, but still seems more like an indica that has a slight head high than a true sativa (which is what my dispensary had it labeled). The initial buzz stopped quickly and the after effects leave me feeling mellow and upbeat.  Interesting stuff.

VVery pleasant smoke. Great body on the buds and great taste. Cerebral effects come on fast, soon followed by a noticeable decrease in stress and increase in overall relaxation.
