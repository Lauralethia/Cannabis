VLove the earth and richness of how dank these buds are very nice and I even see a little purple here too. It hits hard in your sore spots, before slightly stonerism kicks in. MK Ultra is a classic and its even more rare than sour diesel here. I&#39;ve found that mk&#39;s Pungent woody earthy flavors are just perfect for not too much of a cotton mouth. I rate this with flying colours for pain, stress, insomnia, anorexia that appetite baby is killer helps me eat and passout best sleeper for recovering that and an Ash strain. Vaporizing with the extreme Q makes other and my self maximum high that is stronger than dabs for me. MK&#39;s essence relieves my symptoms and makes me a happy camper.

VMk Ultra is a heavy hitter K.O. bud. I smoked some this past weekend and got too stoned, went to that achy point where i couldn&#39;t get up without being sore puts your body in instant nap mode. The buds are very thick really dense weed, the smell is that of a &quot;purple&quot; with a super minty fresh alpine scent.\u000a  the bud has multi shades of green not very hairy but the hairs are deep orange with a small tint of purple ( i like the color) semi frosted nothing impressive. tastes good very smooth taste stays in your mouth for a bit its nice.\u000a   As I stated earlier this bud is strong you cant casually smoke this all day you will be to stoned to function! smoked in a session its great but leave it at that, not the kinda doja you want to have around all day. 9/10

VGreat Indica strain, one of the BEST out there for heavy indicas. This strain is so strong, even heavy smokers shouldn&#39;t need as much as they usually smoke. It is a really heavy indica, though... meaning if you aren&#39;t looking to completely chill out and maybe even snooze a bit, this strain wouldn&#39;t be for you. I have major anxiety, and this strain is PERFECT for that. Only reason not 5 stars is because it is very heavy, and consequently, it can bring you &quot;down&quot; a bit. But all-in-all, Amazing strain. Smells and tastes amazing, too! &#127794;&#128293;&#128168;&#128527;

VMK Ultra is very potent medicine. Although mostly indica, I find this strain to be uplifting enough for morning use. I taste astringent citrus notes along with a flavor that I can only describe as dank and the aroma definitely has that &quot;kind bud&quot; scent. Strongly recommended for whatever ails you.

VMK Ultra ... \u000a\u000a                    What a cool name right ? I will start off by saying the quality of the MK flower I picked up was off the charts ! Experiences may vary. \u000a\u000a                   The name absolutely fit this strain. This is very much like a traditional indica .... if that traditional indica were on steroids!\u000a\u000aThe flower smelled very pungent and sour. The flower was covered in &quot;sugar&quot; . I could tell I had a quality grow. \u000a\u000aWe let it rip. The smoke tastes ok but not great. It has this chemical taste to it with a hint of vanilla. Tastes like a burnt air freshener. I had a moderate throat hit that started abruptly and finally I was coughing.  \u000a\u000aThe high set in pretty quickly but not all at once. It sort of &quot; ramped up &quot; to it. First I could definitely tell something was up and it slowly cranked up the high until I was locked in. My whole body and mind felt relaxed. Every thing looked and felt sort of cottony. I had some dry mouth and eyes and a mild paranoia. The hunger for the sweets was there too. Eventually it sounded like the freeway was right outside my house ... except it&#39;s not. I just felt like the stars were whizzing by me or I was whizzing past them. \u000a\u000aThis strain would be great for someone trying to get to sleep. Someone with depression and serious pain management needs would also highly benefit from MK Ultra. Trippy! \u000a\u000aSo to summarize: MK Ultra is alot like the namesake ..... It feels like a CIA Agent puts a rag of chemical over your face and you wake up a psychic who can stop people&#39;s hearts with your mind.  Very unpleasant smell, flavor and throat hit in return for a very awesome, cerebral and transcendental effect that will put you in a relaxing dimension. \u000a\u000aI will certainly keep MK Ultra in mind when looking for an indica\u000a\u000a- Pineapple Scott

Very nice flavor.\u000a\u000aSoft, heavy, happy head, and soon I was off on the best, most restful night&#39;s sleep I&#39;ve had in quite a while. Good pain relief, too.

VThis was the first strain I ever bought when I got my medical card for my nerve damage and insomnia about two years ago. Whenever I see this strain at my local dispensary, in either flower or concentrate form I pick some up. In the two years since first trying MK Ultra I have never been anything but impressed, time and time again I am reminded why I love this strain. \u000a\u000aFlavour/Aroma: Earthy, spicy, reminiscent of juniper, it also has a classic skunky character.\u000a\u000aBody Effects: Instant relaxation throughout muscles, eyes becoming heavy after one bowl/dab but it takes me 2+ to be bedbound. MK Ultra almost immediately relieves the pain from the damaged nerve in my leg and soothes it for a long time. I always find my shoulder and forehead feels tingly too with this strain.\u000a\u000aMental effects: Euphoria comes on strong, stress is diminished and everything feels comfy. Mind starts to wander, not quite &quot;haze-like&quot; more like a kind of distracted &quot;staring off into space&quot; sensation. Maybe the Mind Control/Hypnosis aspect of the name rings true! :) There&#39;s a weird simultaneous uplifted yet couch-locked effect that I haven&#39;t felt to this level in many other strains (G-13 being one of the few others).

VThis review is on MK Ultra by TJ&#39;s Organic Provisions.  Eugene, OR. (Herb) \u000a\u000aI always thought the &#39;MkUltra&#39; name was catchy  but wow is it accurate.  At one point I had my eyes closed in a slight nod similar to a opiate high or someone who&#39;s been hypnotized.  This strain left me meted into the couch, completely anxiety free.   I did get this interesting pressure on my temples I don&#39;t really ever get.  And while this is very indica dominant there is a nice head high that came with this strain.  The appearance was absolutely gorgeous, a few bright orange hairs covering lime green heavily trichomed buds.  The smell/taste was very sweet, earthy, and slightly pungent.  Really great stuff! 10/10

VWeed is like pizza - some strains are better than others but the others aren&#39;t horrible. This is a better strain. When I fell asleep I stayed asleep - 8 hours solid. I also fell asleep within 15 minutes of trying. So good. After smoking I was good to read for a bit. I loved how I felt after I smoked and I feel great today too (haven&#39;t smoked). The smell was amazing when I opened up the bag.

VMy absolute favorite strain. So freakin potent it smells like no other flower in the planet . Almost like a nasty yet sweet sewer nacho cheese bad breath smell that is so addicting and pleasant. It&#39;s all I&#39;ve been smoking for the past year since discovering it

VWow. Second cross I&#39;ve had involving G13 and probably the third or fourth with some incarnation of OG Kush in them.\u000aThe crossing of the two is quite epic even for smoking veteran such as myself.\u000aThe piney sweet perfume of the bud reminds me a bit like Chronic but that&#39;s where the similarities end. Chronic you can function on and have a fairly carefree day.\u000aThis is one of those dope varieties that you don&#39;t imbibe before riding public transit because unless you&#39;re lucky or very bored you will find yourself snapping back from some distraction to either A) You&#39;ve gone past your stop by miles or, B) You are nowhere near your station but now people are staring because you&#39;ve made this panicked gesturing and suddenly everything is fine.\u000aRather than withstand further scrutiny you exit the bus at the next stop.\u000aReally.

VAs a very particular smoker, per indica/sativa, time of day, I was surprised that this indica noted for making individuals sleepy actually gave me focus, ambition, 100% relaxed, and day or night MK Ultra is alright! Great smell &amp; flavor, thick smoke that is very smooth. Very good medicine for stress and anxiety.

Last night we were raving about how good dinner was (baked potato?) and were gushing over some rando Dateline episode (literally shouting &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see how this turns out!). At one point I found the world&#39;s best white noise app!! And this afternoon we smoked two bowls of MKU and declared the movie Nerve a new horizon in filmmaking. &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;\u000a\u000aMine&#39;s grown by TJ&#39;s Organics... if you have a chance to get some, do.

Blood pressure lowers somewhat, pulse lowers somewhat, a slight and steady rush of blood to the forehead, eyes blossom open. Like a glass of whiskey or wine, alone, by a fire in the evening, this strain is also well-paired with dark chocolate and instrumental jazz (in my opinion.)

VGrower: Dynamic Gardens THC: 26.01% CBD: 0.4% WOAH this stuff is gonna make you drop to the ground with couchlock and a super relaxed and euphoric state. Makes you very forgetful as it is ridiculously stoney. After about 30 min or so It get very euphoric/giggly with just laughing for zero reason, but after about an hour and a half it gets more sedating until you nod out. The smell is quite simple but very pleasant. It is a strong sweetness with a good bit of earthiness but after a bit you can get some notes of a sweet citrus. The taste is very much like the smell except the citrus comes out a bit more after the exhale. The smoothness of the smoke is incredible as if felt very light on the throat and barely makes you cough. Buds are pretty light and not very dense with a nice lime green color and tons of light orange hairs, and are loaded with trichomes. Its a great medical strain for pain, lack of appetite, migraines, anxiety, insomnia, ptsd, glaucoma, neuropathy. But I wouldn&#39;t suggest using this during the day  unless you are just chilling at home for the day. Really good strain and recommend picking it up.

V12.3mg MK Ultra. I\u2019m going into this anxious already. Let\u2019s hope this helps. I feel my body melting like butter as I try and walk. My mind maybe is slowly getting more chill but my anxiety isn\u2019t really changing in the first minute or so. Slowly getting better. At about ten minutes in the Anxiety is also now melting away. Already showing great potential. It\u2019s kind a hard to concentrate your eyes on one thing without them blaring are kind a looking for the a bit. Definitely a good dose for relaxing and dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Maybe use a little bit less if looking to go out and do something. I do feel that this isnso far in 15 minutes a good medicine for an all day mood and anxiety management method.  I truly feel it in your body and mind as things start to slow down in a good way and you\u2019re able to process things better in a more relaxed fashion.

Blood pressure lowers somewhat, pulse lowers somewhat, a slight and steady rush of blood to the forehead, eyes blossom open. Like a glass of whiskey or wine, alone, by a fire in the evening, this strain is also well-paired with dark chocolate and instrumental jazz (in my opinion.)

V12.3mg MK Ultra. I\u2019m going into this anxious already. Let\u2019s hope this helps. I feel my body melting like butter as I try and walk. My mind maybe is slowly getting more chill but my anxiety isn\u2019t really changing in the first minute or so. Slowly getting better. At about ten minutes in the Anxiety is also now melting away. Already showing great potential. It\u2019s kind a hard to concentrate your eyes on one thing without them blaring are kind a looking for the a bit. Definitely a good dose for relaxing and dealing with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Maybe use a little bit less if looking to go out and do something. I do feel that this isnso far in 15 minutes a good medicine for an all day mood and anxiety management method.  I truly feel it in your body and mind as things start to slow down in a good way and you\u2019re able to process things better in a more relaxed fashion. Possibly thinking that this would be great for the majority of the day and sometimes to use the relax CY Tincture for times that you can\u2019t have your body and mind this relax because it truly is very strong and very heavy but works very well as now as I am writing this anxiety has basically completely melted away.

VI have been blessed to be able to smoke recreationally for a long while now everyday, I\u2019m even more grateful now that I\u2019ve come across this strain. As a conspiracy theorist, I adore the name, and as a patient, I can assure that this is one of the heavier types of strains that high tolerance communities can enjoy thoroughly. It is quite moist, with much of the THC within the dense (yet squishy) nugs, I am pleased that it leaves that sticky residue on your fingers after handling the delicate bud. I am definitely a fan as I have just picked this up with my mates from our local dispensary and thought it might\u2019ve been a hype beast of a bust, but were actually astounded by the quality high and pleasure that is associated with this strain. If you ever come across this strain, check it out, blaze it up and watch some conspiracy videos on YouTube lol.

VI luv this strain! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3\u000aI used the Pax 2 vaporizer for this.  Filled the bowl up to about .3g.\u000aThis is pretty earthy; hmm...  not quite like a brown chinese tea, not quite like dark chocolate either, more like ...  very plain cornflakes with a small hint of sweetness.  It smells kinda nutty as it bakes in the vape when I put my nose up to the chamber, not very fragrant.\u000aWhy did I pick this strain up?\u000aBudtender suggested it it to me.  Plus I was deciding to pick this up or...  the Death Star.  Told her I get nausea because of my other medication, and needed something to help with that and I wanted an indica, and so she picked out this or the DeathStar as her favorite choices of indica and between that tried to narrow it to what I was looking for.\u000aThe high?\u000aWow.  This packs quite the punch!  Almost sedative.  Totally underestimated this strain.  After vaping it, I put the vaped weed into my mac and chesse and ate it, not sure if it did anything but...\u000aThe result was getting so stoned that I was ... bed-locked.  Eyes were sooo drowsy.  Ended up taking a nap for about 2-3 hours.\u000aWaking up still stoned.

Definitely one of the better strains i have smoked in my 20 years smoke experience. Nice smell, beautiful taste and the look of the buds is also really good. Thumbs up.

VImmediate effects. This strain is highly introspective and has potent muscle relaxing effects, likely from anticholinergic properties leading to musculoskeletal relaxation. Blood pressure lowers somewhat, pulse lowers somewhat, a slight and steady rush of blood to the forehead, eyes blossom open. Like a glass of whiskey or wine, alone, by a fire in the evening, this strain is also well-paired with dark chocolate and instrumental jazz (in my opinion.) Probably best in moderation, as this strain is also quite potent.

Classic indica body high combined with a slight head buzz. I could not stop giggling like a child and this is probably the main reason I love this strain. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for a day time smoke because it is a very potent indica as mentioned before.\u000a\u000aLook: ?/5 (did not see nugs)\u000aScent: 4/5 (standard kush profiles)\u000aHigh: 4.5/5 \u000aBurning out: 5/5 (indica = yawning, sleep)\u000aOverall: 5/5 (excellent and must-try strain regardless)

VGrower: Dynamic Gardens THC: 26.01% CBD: 0.4% WOAH this stuff is gonna make you drop to the ground with couchlock and a super relaxed and euphoric state. Makes you very forgetful as it is ridiculously stoney. After about 30 min or so It get very euphoric/giggly with just laughing for zero reason, but after about an hour and a half it gets more sedating until you nod out. The smell is quite simple but very pleasant. It is a strong sweetness with a good bit of earthiness but after a bit you can get some notes of a sweet citrus. The taste is very much like the smell except the citrus comes out a bit more after the exhale. The smoothness of the smoke is incredible as if felt very light on the throat and barely makes you cough. Buds are pretty light and not very dense with a nice lime green color and tons of light orange hairs, and are loaded with trichomes. Its a great medical strain for pain, lack of appetite, migraines, anxiety, insomnia, ptsd, glaucoma, neuropathy. But I wouldn&#39;t suggest using this during the day  unless you are just chilling at home for the day. Really good strain and recommend picking it up.

VWho would have known that it could feel so good for your legs to not move at all? Using this stuff, it is great for relaxation, my body felt like it was made out of jangly jelly nerves. Instead of the pain I always feel, it gets replaced by a pleasant tingle. Like I&#39;m underneath the migraine for instance, and I can feel the sensations of the migraine without the discomfort and pain that I would be experiencing otherwise. It&#39;s like moving sensations in my head instead of the pain. Kind of an interesting perspective when you can step back away from it and analyze it like that.

VVery nice indica strain. The bud tender warned me it was very strong, which it was but i didnt really experience any couch lock. Nice mental dream state and very body relaxing. I enjoyed it a lot but not sure i would buy it again. It was good but nothing exceptional for me, i wouldnt be disappointed to get it again but i would rather have another indica strain.

VSmells of Sage Pungent and minty these bright orange hairs on the dark leaves make this christmas tree stand out. The leaves on this are super fat compared  to the pistols. This vape is thick n lingers around. This tastes of floral as it escapes my lips it hits me in the back of the neck first as it engulfs my head leaving me happy and relaxed before tingling down to the rest of the body, a nice coat of pain relief.

VSmell: Earthy. Maybe a hint of pine as well? Pungent for sure!\u000aIt has a firmness to the bud, lots of crystal, and pretty little orange hairs all over!\u000aOnce ground up, bud was fluffy and the odor became much stronger and made me quite eager to get to the tasting!\u000aI had no troubles smoking it (didn&#39;t cough) and I got a nice buzz on my first inhale.\u000aI did get squint eye from smoking this strain. Slight couch lock as well, but really helped relax my muscles and back pains faded as well! Definitely an appetite strain for me, I am quite hungry after smoking it (which is helpful as well!) and the high lasted for a couple hours at least!\u000a&#127775; 4/5 &#127775;\u000aWould DEFINITELY recommend.

VI find it to be easy to smoke, not harsh and making me cough like some. I am a lite weight. No more than a couple hits on the bong. It brings a quick cerebral buzz then slowly relaxes me. I generally smoke a little weed in the evening to relax. Another hit or two just before going to bed. This is a very good relaxing feel, but not as sedating as dream berry. to be honest, I have yet to find any strain that I did not like, this one is currently at the top of my list.

VWho would have known that it could feel so good for your legs to not move at all? Using this stuff, it is great for relaxation, my body felt like it was made out of jangly jelly nerves. Instead of the pain I always feel, it gets replaced by a pleasant tingle. Like I&#39;m underneath the migraine for instance, and I can feel the sensations of the migraine without the discomfort and pain that I would be experiencing otherwise. It&#39;s like moving sensations in my head instead of the pain. Kind of an interesting perspective when you can step back away from it and analyze it like that.

VSince og ultra doesn&#39;t seem to be on this site I&#39;m reviewing this. Og ultra is a phenotype with the same lineage from what I&#39;ve read... Thc to cbd was at least 18% to 6%, just basing that off the effects. As others have said the smoke is rough but damn is it worth it. You&#39;ll feel so relaxed and just plain incredible at the end of the day.

VThis is not a strain for novice patients. A very quick come on a strong cerebral change that will eventually melt into a powerful body change. If a new patient must try this strain consume half a blow or two pulls from your smoking device. Trust me that&#39;s all you need! it&#39;ll also induce hunger it&#39;s great to mix with CBD to keep the high manageable.

VThis beauty ranks high on my top 10 list. For pain relief it would be in my top 3. I was nailed on my motorcycle suffered multiple fractures and needed multiple surgeries to get put back together. I\u2019m 6 months into recovery and MK gives me legit pain relief for a couple hours. It relaxes me but does not knock me out and one of the few of many strains I have tried that actually alleviates my nerve pain. It\u2019s not the tastiest herb on the shelf and it may not be the strongest all I know is it has done wonders for me and managing my pain. Never leave home without it.&#128556;

VI found the MK Ultra strain to be great when battling insomnia. It takes only a few seconds after the first inhale before the world and its issues seem to completely fade away. My body and mind seemed to agree to give up and wind down for the day. One personal tip from medicating with this strain, is not to medicate with it until late at night  right before bed. All in all, I believe the MK Ultra strain is meant to be used as a natural sleep aid.

Has a musky smell a bit harsh on exhale but is great smoke. Its a lung buster but well worth it. You dont need much I smoke 1/2 gram joint wen i smoke never share mine cause jermaphobe. I share jst not my doobie to myself. But try it u usualy can find this easy. IT 150$ an oz up in thw great north Canada.

VStaring at these popcorn sized nuggets, light green coatings, on darker leafs leave a yellowish glow around this bud, light orange hairs cover more of the mid to peak level of these kernels. Pungent Sage and pine creep out of these fine ladies when you give em&#39; a squeeze. The toke is smooth very herbal but not spicy or grassy tasting, doesn&#39;t linger moves fast throughout the room. Before i felt jumpy and antsy great relaxer and can feel my muscles relaxing my elbow doesn&#39;t bother as much muscle spasms. great for sleep tests at 15.5% would recommend for light tokers not so much for heavy tokers.

VJust blazed some MK Ultra. Two snapper bowls and head is slightly dazed. Three snapper bowls in and head is decompressing. Head feeling heavier. This is the most head focused indica I&#39;ve ever had. I should have figured as much with such a name. Smell is strange. Usually it doesn&#39;t matter what kind of weed, skunky or not, the smell is lovely to me. But this stuff is like a cross between cheese and stank ass body odor, with some used gym socks thrown in. Four bowls in, this bowl was a legit bowl. Head heavier. A bit dazed. Legit high now. Uno mas. Snapper for the last. aaand stoned. Shall I go for overkill? I shall.....for science. For this, Im straying from the review material a bit, and tossing a mix of 7 or so, strains on top of it. I am now where I want to be headspace wise. Have a good one y&#39;all.

VA.P.C.C. 1/8th for $55. Delayed effect. Sensation first begins in the eyes and neck - a gradual tightening - then spills into the back and lower legs. This weed makes you straight stupid for half an hour - then it unloosens, giving you a wonderful, tingly, body high for the next hour.\u000a\u000aI like A.P.C.C.&#39;s top shelf bud, as their Hydro OG Kush, Pure Kush, and MK Ultra were all great, but their Green Crack left me wanting. I don&#39;t like the fact that they measure out their cannabis from the same jars that people sniff and take out the cannabis from. The non-display bud should be kept in a cool, dark place, away from customers.

VRare to find MK Ultra in my area so when I found some I got more than a little.  The buds are average in size and looks but the smell wins you over. like this flower was grown in the wild.   Terpenes had me!   Smoked through water clean glass.  The flavor matched the smell and although it expanded nicely in the lungs no cough and an urge to munch on that smoke as you let out easy.   Taste incredibly good.  This is chill and happy medicine for reducing symptoms such as over vigilance, anxiety, and inability to shut off your mind.  I read so often the phrase this is my new favorite so I will save us that cliche.  I am a daily smoker and have been for many years.  Grown by @cotc This is some professional medicine and exceptional compared to  other flower I&#39;ve smoke period

VFantastic, powerful smoke. .Especially good for high tolerance individuals looking for something that cuts to the chase. And indeed, the first time I smoked this I experienced somewhat of a time lapse, a &quot;drop out&quot; effect. Not a flavor explosion, subtler, but still very smooth and tasty. A must try!

The G 13 this came from was always the stuff of legend back in the day, and this does not disappoint.  Gives me an intense high right from the get-go.  Best part is, mmmmm, that smell!

VI love this strain. It gives you an uplifting, psychedelic, happy, relaxing, physically stoned but very introspective buzz. Definitely not a social buzz. You will see immediately the Kush origins while tasting the Earth and Sweet, Hashish-like aromas. The fruity aroma is hard to define because it&#39;s too subtle compare to the other 3. This is a very strong breed even sometimes with veterans so it&#39;s not for beginners. This one kills pain instantly and for a very long period way after the main buzz (up to 12 hours after). I prefer this herb to go to bed because it help you sleep and dream very well.

VPungent and Earthy tones hit my nostrils they fill me up with a sensation of the forest. This buds have a thick structure and long stems. Dark really dark orange hairs all around the top and middle. Not so much towards the bottom more leafs seem to cradle the end nicely.Woody and tea textures hit my tongue smoothly.After taking in this nice medium vape hit the exhale is like a music video thick and covers your face. The relaxing memorizing body effects really melt the pain away and allow me to chill for a moment; think before making an action and executing it perfectly. Known as a great &quot;stoner&quot; feeling, it&#39;s uplifting but bring some water with you its pepper textures layers together over time and hits your throat. Head feeling more pressure but a relaxing melting way. I love MK Ultra for those effects and for treating my medical symptoms. I&#39;d highly recommend this for depression, Insomnia, ADHD, Fibromyalgia, Anorexia , PMS, Mood Disorders and of course pain! 5 Stars!

VAMAZING! I just saw 220 units and the 2 MKUltras that were there were diamonds amongst gems. Frosty Green, vibrant orange hairs, and Ultraviolet tops. If flushed well from a good garden, there isn&#39;t much better out there. Absolutely beautiful look and amazing high . . . Amazing name too, totally marketable with a platinum perception. Thanks!

VMK ultra is covered in resin all over its trichomes, and it resembles hindu kush in appearance. The smell is classic OG (skunk, diesel, pine, earthy); however, it hits hard and is not the smoothest strain on the throat. Effects are great; lasts a long while and ends with a nice sleepy feeling.

VI love this strain. It is such a great mellow high. Great for a movie or a concert. It is like taking a xanax nothing even bothers me after I smoke it. If you smoke it in a joint every hit has just a little more bite to it. Thank you Swells in Youngtown Az for always growing the best flower .

VReally tight Phat large nugs, the tops looks like orange pistols are fighting each other, the smell of this large christmas tree of goodness is: Sage n lawn clippings. I love staring at this bud it has pistols all over more than leafs in more than a few areas. Small leaves that are lime green a dark but bright green comes to a nice sharp point at the top. I choose MK Ultra when I am too reved up or need some absolute relaxation. I take this for sleep, pain, Migraines, Paranoia and Anorexia It really helps.\u000aTastes of: Pungent and wood no earthiness, great taste though!

VI normally review strains that I really love, but today, I have to share one that did not impress me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the strength was incredible and it no doubt made me very stoned. But the way it smelled when it burned and the taste in my throat was not pleasant at all. I would not recommend this strain as the experience was not a good one. I can still remember the nasty taste in my throat. So . . . if you are looking to get way high and have a glass of kerosine handy to kill the aftertaste . . . this is the one for you. (ha). Ok . . . maybe I simply got a bad batch. At some point I will attempt this again. But honestly, it was not good. Sorry guys . . .

VNeed a heavy hitting powerful Indica dom ?! Here it is! I picked up a quarter from my local  dispensary The Temple by Calyx in Oshawa ontario Canada &#127809; &#128521;. The second the jar was cracked i could smell the potency and the buds were a dark almost purple covered in a blanket of sticky tricomes ! After medicating about 2 bowls my body well into a relaxing yet very cerebral high and my pain meltes away. Within an hour i felt warm and just pain free melted into my bed lol.  I must\u000asay Temple in Oshawa only carries the best quality medicine ive had to date and trust me ive been all over to many dispensaries and have had some very nice strains as well but when it comes to overall quality, customer service,  budtender knowledge ect The Temple takes the cake! \u000aTell em Steve sent ya &#128521;

Normally I have a lot of pain, my joints, and bone hit hard pieces of solid objects (no padding). Mk Ultra takes me to a wonderful sleepy or just over all powerful relaxer. Plus this taste of grape is superb to any royal tea I&#39;ve had.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer.\u000a\u000aPros: Fast acting (Effects felt &lt;5 mins). Relaxing that calms the mind first (light pressure behind eyes), then the body with pain relief. \u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth and minor dry eyes. \u000a\u000aOverall/Other:  Relatively smooth pull and exhale, hint of spice on exhale. Taste is piney/woodsy. Did have a very small headache a couple of times but went away quickly. No real case of the munchies. Minor couch lock.\u000a\u000aI would recommend for relaxation and pain relief. \u000a\u000aI plan to try this strain again in the future to see if it was just the batch I had that was inconsistent (had some inconsistencies in effects)
