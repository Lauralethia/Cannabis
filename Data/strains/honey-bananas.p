VHoney Bananas is an exceptional Hybrid that hits like a sativa yet soothes like an indica. I packed a bowl this fine morning in my chillum after purchasing some from Harvest of Avondale (Arizona if you don&#39;t know). Man! What a ride this is, my depression and anxiety are gone with the wind. As a take in this beautiful 45&#176; weather I began to drift to euphoric bliss and absolute happiness. Wonder flower this is, and as I say that the wind blows oh so gently as I take another hit. I realize that my ankle no longer aches and the pain is at bay. Mission accomlished, definetly keeping some Honey Bananas in my basic food group diet from now on.

VPicked this strain up from Essence and I must say this is DEFINITELY a hidden gem! The cultivators (Greenway Medical) did an exceptional job. When I popped the bottle, I was hit with a sweet, honey smooth smell. Once broken down by my fingers, inside was an oasis of trichomes and was hit with a earthy smell to remind me this wasn\u2019t an edible.\u000aI chose to stuff this in a Sweet Aromatic Backwood. Once lit, a sweet pungent smell filled the room. Hit me in the head first with extreme \u201cEverything is okay\u201d feelings and thoughts. Then it went from \u201cokay\u201d to \u201cF*** this is some good medicine.\u201d I found myself halfway into the Backwood and noticed I was smoking for taste at that point as I put it down and picked it right back up before it died out. \u000aOverall, it was definitely an enjoyable smoke which led to couchlock and an afternoon/evening marathon playing Mortal Kombat X. Will definitely be getting the ounce to keep in my pantry.

VI was able to find this in shatter at my local dispensary. It kicks off with an instant body buzz (everything is tingly) and head rush - almost feels like you stood up too quickly. It has a nice sweet taste, definitely a hint of banana.\u000a\u000aBeing indica dominate, I did this in the evening while watching tv. I was fairly engaged with what I was watching yet at the same time was just kind of enjoying the ride. My shoulder pain completely vanished and my mind became calm. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to do this before going out anywhere. If I did, I&#39;d probably just zone out in the corner.

VComes on very easy and peacefully. Perfect for beginners. Euphorically relaxing like a good massage and just as physically soothing. As high gradually builds you can feel your brain growing distant. Senses take a hallucinatory bent and combined with the brain letting go, you can\u2019t help but be consumed by your senses. Despite how overwhelming of a change it is, the high has the most stable, tranquil and peaceful mental state with strong euphoria lending an uplifting optimism. Some of the best you\u2019ll ever have for music. It consumes you entirely so there\u2019s nothing else...just you fully encompassed by the song. Haven\u2019t tried, but Banana is one of the best for movies, so I imagine this will excel, too judging by how amazing it made music.

VThis is brilliant strain!  I usually stick to indicas because I&#39;m looking for pain relief, sleep, and something to calm anxiety from PTSD.  But hey, sometimes I want something during the day.  Decided to try this at Verdes (by far my fave dispensary in the 505).  Amazing!  I was tense and knotted up from stress--so tense I was having muscle spasms in my shoulder--and this just stopped it cold.  But it didn&#39;t just relax me and calm the pain--I had this clear happy euphoria.  Just like a load was literally lifted off me, and all was right in the world.   It&#39;s one of my all time favorite blends.  Even makes house cleaning tolerable! *lol*

VI am currently vaping a CO2 oil of Honey Bananas and it tastes amazing, almost like a banana flavored candy. The high is a little slow to start (even at 80.7% potential THC), but it&#39;s excellent. Tension melted from my muscles as a smile crept across my face. Definitely the kind of smoke that&#39;s great for doing yoga or an easy walk, but there is a little couchlock to contend with. \u000aI got this oil as part of a Jazz Cabbage all-in-one set (filled cartridge, stick-style battery, and charger) which is beautiful to look at and feels sturdy.

VHoney Bananas is a mixed bag of emotions for me.  Being a very complex strain that produces a stifled, anxious response within me at time.   About a half hour into certain middle ground hybrids my body checks out exhausted while my head races.  This intense claustrophobic head trip was barely apparent with this strain, but enough to make me mention.\u000a\u000aWith that bad side never really taking fruition it was easy to see why folks love this strain.  A def odor of bananas comes straight off the nug with a smooth coconut peppery overall.  Think fruity foo-foo drink like a Pina Colada with a shit ton of cayenne pepper blended with a base of skunk.  It is absolutely phenomenal the complexity of the terpenes in this flower with just a squeeze &amp; sniff of the bud.  The smoke was just like french toast tastes with no harshness.\u000a\u000aNot the biggest fan of the high itself as was mentioned.  Even if that feeling had not occurred at all even if it was faint this strain was on the duller side.  Not a party flower, yet I would use for medicinal reasons having a very numbing effect.  Feels almost like after getting out of a massage chair with your body still pulsating.  Kinda lightheaded with the really nice deep sleep to follow once that little head trip ends.

VI was skeptical at first.  It sounds like a novelty strain that people are either gonna love or hate.  I was absolutely blown away by this strain...\u000a\u000aI bought a gram grown by Saints out of Seattle, (formerly Seattle Green Bud), via Emerald Leaves in Tacoma.  Wow this stuff is amazing.  A very sweet tea smell in my opinion, as opposed to the commonly reported banana scent.  So much good flavor.  It&#39;s a very smooth and sweet tasting herb.  It&#39;s way too easy to smoke too much.\u000aThis herb is very enjoyable.  Potent and powerful, this batch weighed in at 23.5% and I could feel ever bit of it.  Clear headed, energetic but the inertia of a good couch can lock you in all night.\u000aDefinitely a clear headed, very fun, powerful, and tasty herb, but careful... it&#39;ll fuck you up

VI smoked about a bowl of it, and about 3 minutes later it started kicking in. It started with a medium buzz in which your kinda quiet and just relaxed, I noticed that time seemed pretty distorted, I was at McDonald for like 20 minutes but it felt like an hour. Then after about 20 minutes everything just started getting funny to me, every little thing I just laughed at it, I wish I could tell you what happens after that but while I was still high I smoked another strain which was a completely different high so my head like switched modes. But overall this is a great strain to smoke with some homies and do stuff, just have fun

VI recently took an extended break which ended up totaling 43 days due to annual exam/labs.&#160;&#160; It was really easy to start the break because I was sick with the flu. I can attest that if you really wanted to start a t-break there is no better time to start than if you happen to get sick because you probably won&#39;t have the desire to smoke anyway.&#160; I had a lot of time to research strains that I haven&#39;t tried...so after reading reviews, I decided to pick up a Honey Banana vape cartridge and planned on vaping right after I got home from my appointments.&#160;&#160; Unfortunately on the eve of my appointments I got the stomache flu.&#160; Diahrea, body aches and feeling nausea,&#160; although I didn&#39;t actually throw up.&#160; This made for a miserable next day going to my appointments but I managed to battle through it for the sake of getting it over with.&#160; When I got home I just wanted to go to bed hoping I would feel better the next morning.&#160; Later that night I woke up with a splitting headache that wouldn&#39;t go away, probably due to a combination of being dehydrated, not eating for more than 24 hours and not having coffee for 2 days.&#160; When I finally got out of bed the next morning I still felt a slight throbbing in my head however I somehow managed to get up and run a couple errands.&#160; After I got home I decided to vape this strain.&#160; HOLY COW!&#160; THIS IS GOOD $#&amp;%!&#160; I can&#39;t really taste bananas but I do get a slight taste of honey.&#160;&#160; Headache was completely erased and I felt really aroused. Got the munchies so I ate 2 donuts and relaxed the rest of the afternoon.&#160; This strain definitely made me feel a whole lot better.

VI was skeptical at first.  It sounds like a novelty strain that people are either gonna love or hate.  I was absolutely blown away by this strain...\u000a\u000aI bought a gram grown by Saints out of Seattle, (formerly Seattle Green Bud), via Emerald Leaves in Tacoma.  Wow this stuff is amazing.  A very sweet tea smell in my opinion, as opposed to the commonly reported banana scent.  So much good flavor.  It&#39;s a very smooth and sweet tasting herb.  It&#39;s way too easy to smoke too much.\u000aThis herb is very enjoyable.  Potent and powerful, this batch weighed in at 23.5% and I could feel ever bit of it.  Clear headed, energetic but the inertia of a good couch can lock you in all night.\u000aDefinitely a clear headed, very fun, powerful, and tasty herb, but careful... it&#39;ll fuck you up
