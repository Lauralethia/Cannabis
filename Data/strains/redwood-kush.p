VPersonally, Great strain for your dollar. Want a cheap weed to get super faded.. Pick Redwood up. I liked the feeling and didnt taste too bad. Left my mouth and eyes dry as Eff but Arizona Green Tea and some clear eyes fixed that right up. (Who the F buys Visine)

VPhoenix Relief Center of Phoenix Az brought this Devine strain to my attention, and it has been like that lingering song you heard in an elevator, or in your car, or wherever! instead of humming along with the song in my head, I obsess about a nice long toke of this pungent, earthy front end tasting strain. I especially enjoy the smoke of bonging this strain, as it brings out pine afternotes but never seems to burn your throat. I never got through my first bowl of this flower powerhouse, because it had me couch ridden, pain/spasm free, and realizing that I had been asleep where I was sitting for the past four hours...powerful high, great taste, smooth smoke, and available in Phx, at Phoenix Relief Center. Thanks for getting this right guys! \u000a\u000a-420ARMY

VI think this is one of the first strains I\u2019ve ever tried, I was super relaxed and happy. It make me kind of giggly though which isn\u2019t a bad thing! My bf and I spent the whole time laying in bed watching Netflix and snacking. It was a point in my life where I was high anxiety and had a lot going on so it was nice to have such a calming chill day, good starter

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer. \u000a\u000aPros: Need to sleep? This will relax you in both body and mind where your thoughts become hazy and unless you power thru it, it&#39;s lights out. Dulled pain quite well. Fast acting (&lt;5 mins to feel effects).\u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth. Don&#39;t plan on being active after consumption.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Smooth draw &amp; normal exhale. Taste was pleasant being earthy/flowery with a hint of pine and a little sweetness to it. Didn&#39;t notice any increased appetite/munchies. Minor head effects, mainly feling very relaxed and a little out of it because you want to sleep. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain if you want to sleep and need some pain relief. This is now my go to strain if I need sleep. Definitely a nighttime/sleep aid strain.

VWas harsh to smoke in comparison to other strains; the earthiness was very robust on my lungs.  I made it into canna oil with coconut oil, at about 2 grams per 4 ounces.  Two to three teaspoons in a cup of cocoa was adequate for a good relaxing high without being locked to my chair.  \u000a\u000aIt helped me sleep for a while, almost like a sleeping pill, I faded out eventually, but woke up about two hours later and the pain killing effects were wearing off.  \u000a\u000aI did have a terrible headache the next day that lasted several hours. And while I was relaxed, the pain relief was not there compared to other strains, and the effects did not seem to last as long though I always use the same method for edibles.  This isn&#39;t a strain I would seek out, I don&#39;t think it meshes with my particular body chemistry

VRedwood Kush is a very distinct strain with extremely earthy qualities and has a very skunky-like soil smell to it. I enjoyed this strain mostly for helping my appetite and and helping me go to sleep. This is that one strain that takes the happy, hungry, and sleepy qualities of marijuana literally.

I was very relaxed, no anxiety or any type of paranoia and this strain gave me the munchies!!! Which I don&#39;t mind at all. Hardly any cotton mouth either.

VRedwood is a special evening treat, delivering a consistently amazing body buzz.  Great for suppressing nerve pain and taking the mind off discomfort.  Before you drift off to peaceful slumber, this strain induces a deliciously sensual state in which everything just feels great.  Stretch out with your special someone and enjoy a deep state of physical contentment!

I feel like uplifted and it seems like the type of strain to let you carry on with normal day to day activities in case you need to step out for a quick smoke break =) good job man.

VI smoked a bowl of this the past two nights before going to bed to help me sleep, and it worked very well! It was very mellow and chill and gave me quite the munchies, Lol, but also a good nights sleep. Then just now I decided to load a pretty good sized bowl and took two huge hits and got this crazy almost paranoid rush, I kept jumping at my shadow and shit &#128514; After that calmed down my entire face and upper body went completely numb!! A lot more than I was expecting but one hell of a high, wouldn&#39;t recommend for first timers, Lol.

It taste pretty good and was the perfect strain to start my day. Usually Indicas make me want to stay inside all day and Netflix binge, but this strain was relaxing enough to where you can still get stuff done! \u000a\u000aI do believe if I hit this strain out of a bong it would&#39;ve knocked me out! So be cautious. \u000a\u000aOverall really good strain and definitely plan on buying more when I come across it! \u000a\u000a4.6 out of 5 on the Fuzzy Scale! \u000a\u000a&#129304;&#128526;&#128535;&#127807;&#128293;&#128168;&#128524;

VI just bought some organic Redwood Kush... smells like the forest for sure! I rarely smoke indica... unless needed for pain and some intense menstrual cramping had me needing a good indica! Women out there will definitely love this strain for it&#39;s body numbing effects. I started feeling better within mins. Mood lifting, especially since I&#39;ve been cranky all morning. Beautiful orange haired flower! I highly recommend this strain, I&#39;m a new fan! :)
