VI always keep a large selection of med strains on hand and choose a different one every night to do my own personal research with. Tonight I took about 6 good vape hits at 375 degrees of this strain and it is almost perfect. The body high is narcotic, a warm relaxed fuzzy feeling. Laying in bed I&#39;m about as pain free as i can imagine without being completely useless. The first 20 mins there was a very noticeable buzz centered around my temples and radiating toward the top of my head. The head high is a very balanced kush high that leaves me with a super relaxed glow. I would say this is one of the best evening strains for pain that I have tried.

VI just finished smoking this awesome bud for probably the 50th time and realized I had to review it again. This is one of my all time favorite strains! I definitely have gotten used to the high but that&#39;s not a negative with this strain. It&#39;s one of the most consistent strains with very predictable effects. As a medical user that still has to be functional while working and taking care of 2 kids, it&#39;s really important to not get blindsided by a consuming high. For me this strain offers excellent pain relief and muscle relaxation. At lower dosages with added CBD it gives me decent pain relief and relaxation that is very clear headed and functional. I can take a couple of hits in the afternoon when the pain starts to get bad and work through the rest of the day comfortably. With higher doses and added CBD I feel like the pain relieving, muscle relaxing, anti anxiety and mood enhancement effects are comparable to taking a couple of vicodin and a valium or soma. It&#39;s really an excellent flower and no matter what other crazy new varieties I try, this is a standard that I always come back to.

VI have already reviewed this strain before about two weeks ago and it&#39;s still so amazing! Knocked me out last night after I rolled up slightly less than a gram in a dulce de leche wrap. Started creeping in behind the eyes with that hazy head high (which may I add felt great) before it fully knocked me out.  I would recommend this strain to someone with pain as it helped with my back pain and definitely for insomnia! As this strain in the end made my whole body feel good and well relaxed. Now the only bad thing about this strain is.... My Bubba OG prescription is \u000aempty&#128555; lol so will need to get more soon!

It is still in my rotation when I can find refill cartridges. \u000aI never even smoked cigarettes so learning to inhale and not choke has taken some time. This strain was an easy introduction for me and remains one of my favorites.

VThis stuff will send you to lazy town real quick. Very relaxing, mellow strain. You&#39;re not going to get much done on this strain. I would recommend about and hour or 2 before bed or if you want to just kick back and watch a movie or something. Good for muscle aches and stress and defiantly insomnia.

VA Sweet, dense, purple and orange array - over a traditional OG Kush. Great smoke, heavy but not instant knock out heavy.\u000aGreat weekend bud, blunt it up, or snappers in the bong - either will set you up great! Produces a large amount of kief, but not a lot through a grinder. Buds are sticky and resinous (assuming grown at potential)\u000a4.5 / 5

VVery sticky, frosty buds. Nice sized nugs. Smoked out a bong and felt it creep in around 2 minutes after I was done smoking a bowl, around .5 grams. I smoked this pretty fast and the smoke wasn&#39;t harsh at all very nice taste. I love the smell. The high was enjoyable and definitely a body high, made my limbs tingly, and I almost couldn&#39;t breath because I was so concentrated. Made me very relaxed, and quite tired after the peak. The high lasts about 2 hours and food tastes great. Good strain.

VI probably would have rated this strain 5 stars, but mine seemed to have not been trimmed correctly. Almost like it was hurried, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just one of those 1 out of every 10 type situations. Besides that this is a wonderful strain! Great smell, a subtle whiff of fruit. Like you&#39;re walking by the fruit section in the grocery store, not too overwhelming. Same with the taste, just the right amount of fruitiness without over doing it. Very relaxing and strong body high. You will feel this strain flow through your body every only a couple hits without the sleepy effects. The high, smell, and taste are all amazing, definitely a favorite of mine even with the fucked up trim job lol

VBubba OG is by no means sub-par weed, however it is not the greatest. This bud has a pungent sour smell with a hint of citrus that balances the smell out making it pleasing to my nose. The smell, in my opinion of course, is enjoyable although i have had people say they don&#39;t like the smell because it can be strong to the nose. Also if you are trying to have this weed in discreet you are going to need a container, preferably one that is air tight because the weed can be pretty &quot;loud.&quot; The flower itself is more on the dry side, but still holds some moisture to it. Because of it being on the dry side smoking the bud can be harsh on the throat. I recommend having a drink handy when you go to smoke. Now the high kicks in pretty quick, but takes a while to reach its peek. I also want to point out that you will need a little more of this bud than usual for a strong high if you smoke avidly like I do. I find that when i roll a 1 1/4 sized joint, filled with close to a G, I sustain the high for a little over an hour and a half. The high is overall mellow, it resides mostly in the head for me, although when i smoke this in large quantity it can make it hard for me to keep balance on my skateboard. (Disclaimer, If you are like me and grind up the stems to smoke in a bowl i would recommend against it. These stems give me massive headaches unlike others I&#39;ve smoked.) This weed helps me with anxiety, and depression as it keeps me in a calm and happy mood. This weed is an Indica so expect to get tired quick, smoking around bed time can be rewarding with an amazing night of sleep. I would definitely recommend this weed, but do not buy a G for more than $10. It&#39;s a good budget weed. Buying this for 20 a G is a waste of money that can be put towards a gram of stronger strain. Overall, good smell, good high, a little dry and harsh on the throat, so in conclusion this flower has earned a 3/5 from me. Let me know what you think. Enjoy Your High Everyone!

VI find the Bubba OG strain to be a really nice heady, warm body high. Combats anxiety by quieting the mind! Have a bowl of munchies ready though, as you may want to retire on the couch for the rest of night after puffing. Smoke at night while watching, reading or gaming, all good.

VBubba OG is by no means sub-par weed, however it is not the greatest. This bud has a pungent sour smell with a hint of citrus that balances the smell out making it pleasing to my nose. The smell, in my opinion of course, is enjoyable although i have had people say they don&#39;t like the smell because it can be strong to the nose. Also if you are trying to have this weed in discreet you are going to need a container, preferably one that is air tight because the weed can be pretty &quot;loud.&quot; The flower itself is more on the dry side, but still holds some moisture to it. Because of it being on the dry side smoking the bud can be harsh on the throat. I recommend having a drink handy when you go to smoke. Now the high kicks in pretty quick, but takes a while to reach peek. I also want to point out that you will need a little more of this bud than usual for a strong high if you smoke avidly like me. I find that when i roll a 1 1/4 sized joint, filled with close to a G, I sustain the high for a little over 2 hours. The high is overall mellow, it resides mostly in the head for me, although when i smoke this in large quantity it can make it hard for me to keep balance on my skateboard. (Disclaimer, If you are like me and grind up the stems to smoke in a bowl i would recommend against it. These stems give me massive headaches unlike others I&#39;ve smoked. This weed can help with anxiety, and depression as it keeps me in a calm and happy mood. This weed is an Indica so expect to get tired quick, smoking around bed time can be rewarding with an amazing night of sleep. I would definitely recommend this weed, but do not buy a G for more than $10. It&#39;s a good budget weed. Buying this for 20 a G is a waste of money that can be put towards a gram of stronger strain. Overall, good smell, good high, a little dry and harsh n the throat, so in conclusion this flower has earned a 3/5 from me. Let me know what you think. Enjoy Your High Everyone!

VI am in love with Bubba OG! I suffer with back pain &amp; just woke up at 2:30 a.m. in tears from pain. I smoked 2 bowls of Bubba OG &amp; even though the pain is not 100% gone, I will now be able to go back to bed. It definitely is the most pain relief i have had in years. I just became a medical marijuana patient, so i&#39;m still learning strains. Out of the 3 strains I bought a few days ago the Bubba OG is my favorite. A relax buzz. Creative feeling. Happy &amp; helps pain. I suffer from anxiety too &amp; this helps with Anxiety too. Didnt make me paranoid or anything.

VI tried this strain for insomnia, muscle spasms and pain.  It was only moderately helpful. But the taste was the worst - burning pepper both during and a while after vaping flower (not concentrate). Unfortunately, this one wasn&#39;t for me. I won&#39;t try it again even though Indica&#39;s (and hybrids) work best for me. (Well, except for Jack Herrer, the only sativa I&#39;ve tried so far that helps me &amp; doesn&#39;t give me anxiety &amp; the jitters.)

VI have already reviewed this strain before about two weeks ago and it&#39;s still so amazing! Knocked me out last night after I rolled up slightly less than a gram in a dulce de leche wrap. Started creeping in behind the eyes with that hazy head high (which may I add felt great) before it fully knocked me out.  I would recommend this strain to someone with pain as it helped with my back pain and definitely for insomnia! As this strain in the end made my whole body feel good and well relaxed. Now the only bad thing about this strain is.... My Bubba OG prescription is \u000aempty&#128555; lol so will need to get more soon!

Vdefinitely landing in my top 5. Had the session completely chilled, that indica-induced goofiness and uncontrollable laughter mixed with that sensational euphoric sensation made the night seem surreal. Perfect after a long stressful day, perfect for sleepless nights, perfect for great times and perfect for adding on some pounds after the munchies kick in. Love it.

VBubba OG is the bomb my friends, especially if it&#39;s grown perfectly. This sweet slightly pungent is a total relaxer, it&#39;s really great to smoke at the end of the day to just straight relax. For me it seems to work best with Anxiety down to about a 2/10, Depression down to a 2/10, Pain and Spasms literally down to a 2/10 also. This is great smoke and I highly recommend it!

VThis was my very first strain. It made my body feel so heavy and sluggish and all I wanted to do was sit down and chill forever. Its a great stress reliever and perfect for those who just want to chill with friends. Also prepare for munchies madness and extreme cotton mouth.\u000aHowever I got paranoid but it was my first time smoking so i don&#39;t wanna blame the grass.
