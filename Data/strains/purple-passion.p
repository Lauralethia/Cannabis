Vthe flavor and feeling of the medicine  hits u right away and as someone who suffers chronic anxiety, and ptsd, I would recommend this strain to anyone who could get by with a little help from their friends. also did feel a little more creative while playing my guitar. definitely one of my favorites!

Vnot a devastating high, zero anxiety, very mild yet potent in large doses, great for relaxing at home but i was still able to focus and get things done, in fact it motivated me to do so. excellent roll of the dice with this one. i will definitely revisit.

VEasy to grow from seed. Cloning success requires skill, but will produce excellent flowering plants @ 4-5 weeks of veg. Can be harvested at 6 weeks in perfect conditions, 8-9 weeks recommended for significantly better yield and increased potency. SENSITIVE TO LIGHT LEAKS. YOU WILL GET HERMIES IF YOU DO NOT DELIVER 12 HRS UN INTERRUPTED DARKNESS. Its the only downside other than the density of the colas at full maturity may require some branches to be tied for support and also requires good humidity control. Upside is that pollinated flowers still smoke well.

V&#129316; the smell is so amazing, I opened my jar and smelled it for at least a few minutes.. the buds are so pretty and deep purple hues with fiery orange hairs and to think I gotta good deal 7 grams for $55 from my favorite delivery service. I\u2019m so happy I found this strain.. me and my mom smoke together so I like to find indicas that can relax her from her excruciating arthritis pain.. this helped her tremendously.. she\u2019s eating so yeah good stuff to give you the munchies.. and real good for a night time smoke sesh to end a hard long day. I would recommend this beautiful bud to anyone indica head or anyone who really needs to relax and mellow out. I don\u2019t recommend for first timers , if so.. I suggest small doses.. maybe a joint or a bowl .. unless you like me ROLL A FUCKING BLUNT!!&#128513;&#128077;&#127998;

VTried purple passion for the first time a couple days ago for a sleep aid. Got it at dispensary I had never been to before and it was in their cheaper section and it worked better than top shelf mess from other dispensary! I would recommend this strain for a sleep aid and it has become the best indica I have found for help sleeping and it also helps with pain although that was not my primary issue I was trying to address.

VThis is a great strain!!! The batch I got comes from a rec shop here in Washington State called Green Collar Recreational. The brand is called &quot;WEED SHUT UP AND SMOKE IT&quot; haha despite the cheesy name this company grows some fire buds for an amazing price. I paid 25 dollars for 3.5 grams the only thing making these buds cheap is the poor trim job, other than that they are top shelf quality!! First  off lets start by talking about the smell, the smell is reminiscent of grapes and berries nice a fruity with a slight fuely undertone. The taste is delicious, it has just the right amount of grape flavor with an undertone of dankiness.. A completely unique flavor... The high is a creeper it takes about 20 mins to fully take effect but you feel it climbing the whole way. Doesn&#39;t make you sleepy, doesn&#39;t make you jittery, doesn&#39;t give you anxiety, gives you a big woosh of euphoria, makes music sound and feel amazing... Can be slighty trippy but calming.. actually helps with anxiety and depression... Its very uplifting... Doesn&#39;t give you the munchies, no cotton mouth... It just gives you an amazing time. It&#39;s really just an awesome strain highly recommend it.

VI just finished up first semester of my junior year at university, so I believe this was about &#39;01.  My best bud-dy had found something amazing a little earlier than normal this year.  Back then it was always solid connections, just not very many amazing trees.  They only came around certain times of the year. But when the news came around about a strain that challenged for the Cannibis Cup recently?  The frenzy was real.  We dumped our collective groups money together on as much as we could.  And, man, was it worth it.  It had come from this wizard botanist who was planning on moving soon.  So he brought out the heavy artillery for one final run before he rode off into the sunset.  I remember our university had a hugely successful run of the play Arsenic and Old Lace.  An oldie, but made to film back in the 40&#39;s, and a classic.  The cast and I got absolutely blazed for one of the last shows.  And other than my suit catching on fire by accident?  The show was a hit and our best ovation out of the 5 shows.  We had the record for highest attendance of a theater production for a while.  I&#39;m not sure if it is still the record.  But PP also got a whole bunch from the audience high... we wound up partying with loads of them after the show.  It was quite a production.

VJust got some of this for the first time and got a really pleasant high. This indica had my friend I very high for a couple hours. \u000a\u000aIt has a nice initial high, which relaxed us. Although I&#39;ve had better, we were loving the smell and taste. After a few bowls we were feeling very at ease and uplifted: not stressing out about things, watching movies, and laughing all day. After a while you get a strong body high but it makes you have cotton mouth and very, very sleepy afterwards. I also had a slight headache; but after the long high and good feeling, I didn&#39;t mind that. Definitely give it a try!
