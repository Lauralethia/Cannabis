VI had a variation on purple elephant, called blue elephant. However this cross between blue cheese and purple elephant are definitely comparable in effect. It tastes like... well any sort of indica I guess. To me all strains just taste like weed. The high was nice, but it didn&#39;t last long. It is a very soothing high. It&#39;s best to smoke this strain alone or with your girlfriend. Besides makimg you feel tranquilized, it also makes you hungry and horny. Definitely have nice food at hand and some fao-materual, or your girlfriend. I think this weed is a great anxiety killer and aphrodisiac. All these effects go along with an overall happy feeling. The only real cons for me are the duration of the high and the high price. For the rest I can recommend it to anyone who likes indicas.

VPurple Elephant, my dear friend,  I would say this is an go to smoke, one of my all time favorites. \u000aIt doesn&#39;t come out swinging,  no, this sugar floats and stings. Whomever grew this did a fine job, enjoyed first through a water-fall bong &#128513;Ooghhh, extraordinarily creamy,thick smoke, cleared it, no cough, no choke, so sweet! Buzz came on, tuned me up right, stayed on for over an hour or more. I was intrested and having a GREAT time with a friend, yet, totally relaxed. Especially since my neck quit hurting! It actually felt like my shoulders and neck relaxed and expanded to normal! My friend mentioned &quot;it&#39;s a cervical collar weed &quot;, and it is.  In the best way&#128512;

VThis batch grown by GPOWA (Green Power of Washington) It&#39;s a very nice, mellow high. Has a bit of a creeper effect, so good idea to take 2-3 hits and wait a bit.  Relieved a bad case of stress neck, and eased what I&#39;d say was a medium anxiety attack that I&#39;d been having for a couple day. If I wanted to sleep, it would help.  If I don&#39;t want to sleep, I don&#39;t feel like I have to. I&#39;d get this again, which proves that you don&#39;t really always need a high THC number to have something useful and enjoyable!

VAfter this smoke, every time I hear the word \u201cindica,\u201d I\u2019m gonna think of the experience I had tonight, smoking this strain. Not only does it make you have such a positive, euphoric experience, it makes you fucking sleeeeeeep. Literally will cure my depression soon enough and cause a nice, relaxed lifestyle.

VIf you are a fan of Indica,  like I am,  this one is a good one.  We picked up some by the Green Vault and honestly,  it feels really top shelf.  The  flower is delicate and aromatic.  Happy and relaxed is the end result!

VThis is a fine choice herb.  Picked up some starts this last spring and although the plant size was not very large the bud production was outstanding. large sticky purple nugs and the smoke was a sweet mellow flavor. The high was both stress lifting and relaxing leaving a almost euphoric state . Highly recommend this strain someone did a great job with this strain keep up the good work people!!\u000a

Vhaven&#39;t smoked it yet, still growing it for the first time. I&#39;m in week 6 of flower so it shouldn&#39;t be to much longer. smells like sweet grapes and very fruity topical smelling. going to be my most best tasting strain I got going. the hairs just starting to turn dark orangeish red and trichome production is starting to get heavy, buds super dense rock hard and they are a cool ass purple as well can&#39;t wait.
