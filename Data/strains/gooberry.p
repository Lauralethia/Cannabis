VGooberry is a good strain, having no appetite is my favorite characteristic.  Gooberry is a very good Indica and I will purchase it again.

VGooberry is my go-to evening enjoyment. I can&#39;t wait until Artizen comes out with a concentrate. The flower isn&#39;t exactly pungent, but more enveloping on the senses if that makes any sense. It&#39;s obviously sweet and berry, but it also seems to warm you and the room. Relaxing, positive (I liked what Annabean said about it recently), dreamy and very euphoric. No anxiety, paranoia, headache or dizziness that I&#39;ve experienced. Highly recommended for depression/mania/anxiety/insomnia and appetite difficulties.

VVery dense berry flavoured buds, really is a hard hitter! The high is a true indica leaving you feeling very chilled for a good 3-4 hours after a nice joint. Threw a percolator bong, a slight harsh, cough inducing hit that leaves you instantly couch-locked and very much received my lower (worn) disc complete relief from aches and pains! Would recommed

VI am so grateful for this stuff. Riding out Hurricane Harvey with a smile on my face. This stuff had me relaxed and baking Snickerdoodles while watching Disjointed (Goddess bless Kathy Bates lol). I even got two loads of laundry done. I was alert enough to watch for tornados but my anxiety is definitely under control. rxj38l: rock me like a hurricane if &#128540;&#128149;

V&#128166;&#127827;&#127815; as the name suggests gooberry is a lovely flower with tight dense nugs, pungent smell, a flavor between Earth Berry and gas or when I call my favorite! Definitely a winner and not overly sweet for my gassy taste buds. All around great medicine. From just relaxing to deep thinking this will get it done&#128521; &#128166;&#127815;&#127827;

VIt does the job of making me sleepy, but it also make me real thirsty (enough for me to wake up multiple times to get a drink), which offsets its effectiveness for me. Also, it has a tendency to make me feel a little dizzy too which I do not like.
