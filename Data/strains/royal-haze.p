VStrong taste, kind of unpleasant. The high makes up for it tho. Heavy and long lasting high perfect to get things done or go outdoors. good sativa

VA very nice hybrid sativa strain with very prominent haze characteristics. Very good for pain and depression and nausea. Not too strong, which can be good as there is little paranoia, but some dry mouth.

VNot quite sure why this strain isnt rating high in medicinal qualities with a CBD rating as such ? THC does not hold but three medicinal qualities on the wheel. I understand our obsession with THC. I like it too. My point is shopping  for a high THC content strain is like flying a red flag that you shop recreationally :)

VRoyal Haze is quickly becoming one of my favorite strains, due to the fact I&#39;ve been a major fan of Northern Lights for more than 2 decades! Taste, aroma, and a fairly high THC % make it a truely exceptional strain.

VAll round strong. Picked up some royal haze wich had good looking texture. Imo it has a cheese-like taste to it wich i think is real nice. Smoked it as wake and bake and had a good strong high for couple of hours. Even at work i was able to work fast and concentrated. Will absolutely pick up some more royal haze in the futur

VI&#39;m really just not a fan of the flavor. The high is okay. It&#39;s a blowed but still good to highly function.

VLight, motivated/energetic buzz with strong euphoria. Notable headband effects. This is good for a sativa.
