VTH Seeds in Amsterdam.  Excellent version of the Kush.  It comes from a cross of MK Ultra x Chem 91.  (MK Ultra is THSeeds&#39; cross of OG Kush x G-13).  The point of this is the genetics are outstanding.  Smells great: sour and dank, similar to other Kush.  Looks great: multi-colored buds, orange hairs, thick with trichomes.  Though CCK has all the familiar Kush characteristics, it also is a unique and aromatic blend of its lineage.  Heavy hitting, with all that Kush indica, but also indicates strong sativa influences.  Medicinal uses: good for anxiety, depression, appetite stimulation, general pain relief.

VDamn tho, this is a quality hybrid. Strong lineage with potent effects -- not recommended for beginners. The high is super relaxing on an emotional level; leaves your body feeling nice and light, even with chronic pain. Also, this strain really helped my appetite, like a lot. I ate like a monster.

VStronger on the sativa side, but definitely a hybrid. Light munchies. Relaxed body. Very creative with ideas zapping in all directions. I&#39;m in a low emotional state because I&#39;m fighting heartbreak and this calmed me down. As a result, I&#39;m a little more happy. When my tolerance was lower and I tried this for the first time, it did make me a tad drowsy. Now, it doesn&#39;t make me sleepy at all.\u000a\u000ahotrn.

V(Grower Grade- A) Organic \u000a\u000aWe have a winner!!! I have been looking for a woman who can treat me right and Cold Creek Kush stole my heart. To start, the taste and aroma are so fresh, the scent alone opens your eyes and heightens your senses. A very clear headed high and what I would call a belly high ( feeling it in your stomach) I crave &quot;belly highs&quot; that&#39;s what my body looks for when I smoke. This is my go to strain from now on and being from CO. it&#39;s easy to find. Definitely give it a try.

VWhat a mover and shaker this strain in it keeps me motivated and helps with all my joints and aches as I start to do my chores. It&#39;s more of a positive reinforcement then what the others proclaim it to be a keeps me motivated to do more as well as keeps my firm happy uplifted mood at a great level. The butt structure is a very big reminds me of the OG Kush lineage since that&#39;s what some of this is been crossed with. The calyx is and pistols are dark but there is more leaf coverage on this bud than pistols. If you&#39;re looking for something to calm you down but still keep them motivated in terms of doing physical things/activities. Then you&#39;re going to want to pick up cold creek Kush. It has a very smooth smoke smells of citrus and a little bit of earthiness.

VBellisima!!! This is my new favorite strain! I&#39;ve always had an affinity for anything named after anything in the woods and had to try it and I am more than happy I did. Pretty quickly from a couple flower puffs I felt very relaxed. I made it to my yoga mat after a few more puffs for some super-stretchy floor poses and DJ Yogi. I was incredibly mindful and every stretch was heaven. During my session I began to feel very euphoric and even more relaxed and meditative. I was boldly aware of each breath and heart-opening pose. I crawled back into my bedroom to write this review. And now I&#39;m going to sleep like a baby! Well done!! \u263a\ufe0f&#128591;&#127996;&#128149;

VThis one caught me by surprise, a very interesting strain Bulbous flowers, color light as ogkush but mean dark red hairs here n there nice complexture. I think I absolutely love anything crossed with chemdawg 91. I have not had that by it self, but it kept me focused and really humble. This strain turned my anger into a relaxed guru effect. I felt the body come on about 10 minutes after I vaped a few puffs. It&#39;s very funky the smell has something like basil and like a pungent earthy Cologne. I didn&#39;t have much dry mouth however I did find that when meeting a friend that I had a grudge against for no reason turned the bad inside out to good, Great uplifting effects. However it&#39;s not like a super heavy hitter great for just kicking back and talking to a homie. Very chill, extremely well for the effects as well as coming down it&#39;s a nice bell curve. If you suffer from loss of appetite as well as spinal chord pain for any ruptured or broken spine placements. If you&#39;re looking for a calmer but not heart pounding heavy hitter hit this one up for sure.
