Vkhalifa kush...(KK) what to say? this flower takes wiz&#39;s love for OG and crosses it with some unknown strain. gives great relief of pain and arthritis. skunky/sweet smell and a very potent flower, a few b rips and KK will leave the user feeling spacey and giggly. Good strain for anytime of the day, just be careful not to over medicate

VStarts off strong and heady, and gets stronger still. Tasty citrus pine and maybe a slight hint of linalool. Smooth almost to the end. Felt somewhat active, but with scattered efforts. Later on spacy-ness and a fidgety body buzz came in. Nice euphoria. This strain would be good for someone who could go on a hike or play sports. Not bad pain reliever, but for my pain it may not  be strong enough for an intense day.

VDear Khalifa Kush,\u000a\u000aI am writing this to inform you that I am stoned. Stoned in a happy way, a loving way. I have smoke you for the last 2 weeks and I want to personally thank you. For some odd reason, this strain is my new viagra. As my Father would say, his Vitamin &quot;V&quot;. This strain for some reason just makes me ready to go, more than any of the strains I smoke. Other than the fact I just told you, this strain makes me want to hump people&#39;s legs. \u000a\u000aThis strain is very relaxing and it is a great way to unwind without falling asleep. It relieves your stress, concerns, and if your a lucky like me your significant other will thank you or kill you. My wife said she is going to file a restraining order if I keep smoking the &quot;Khalifa Kush&quot;  Thank you Wiz, for turning me into a nymphomaniac. Will buy this strain when I can find.

VGetting my hands on this was a really good feeling. The smell was very strong and had an unusual smell like none other before. This was more expensive then other strains. This was $55 1/8, I could tell by the way it looked and tasted that it was made with the help of OG Kush and another 2 or 3 strains which tasted and smelled like pine and lemon. This would make total sense due to Wiz Khalifas love for OG Kush. Overall I would have to say that It was a good strain, I would definitely buy more of it when I can. Due to it being Indica, I did get the body high I was looking for, I would really recommend this to anyone who loves indica or anyone who loves to zone out. P.S. I did smoke this in one session, rolled up in 2 King Size Papers.  Any other questions? Send me a message or response to this. oh, by the way, The supposedly only place that sells real &quot;KK (Khalifa Kush)&quot; is the Cookies dispensary in San Mateo, California. Which makes sense due to its ties with Berner and Wiz Khalifa, Plus Wiz Likes California weed the most.

The citrus/skunky odor you can be insured its healthy with limonene, giving you a very euphoric feel. Along with the euphoria, you&#39;ll find yourself extremely relaxed due to its heavy indica properties. I would suggest trying some if you&#39;re ever by Reef!

VReally powerful strain. The flower I got was 28 percent THC. Beautiful dense buds with a mixture of green,orange, and just a hint of purple. Completely dusted in tricombs. Pungent, earthy, smell which is no surprise given its OG Kush parentage. The high is amazing. Major head change the takes care of both anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Combined with a heavy body buzz and I am feeling great. If I have a chance I would definitely pick this strain up again.

VThis is by far one of the best strains I have ever vaped! The smell was nice, light but present, but once ground up, the terpenes release this bouquet of sharp pungent notes, and I definitely taste lavender and citrus. this would be a great strain for newbies, but be warned a little can go a long way, especially if vaped. I took .4 to the head in a high end vaporizer, and I have to say &quot;mind of a stoner.&quot; The whirling energy in my mind, harken back to The Wizard of Oz.

VThis is an incredibly chill high. I&#39;m bipolar and prone to experiencing anxiety when smoking strains that have strong cerebral effects. I tend to stick to hybrids and even then have lately been adding Shark Shock or Harle-Tsu for their mellowing effects. I can smoke KK on its own, or use it to chill out a high that&#39;s a little too intense for me. I feel awake and energized, but I can think clearly. I was able to plan out in my mind a moderately complex task I have to do in a few minutes, even though I really shouldn&#39;t have taken that 3rd hit. It&#39;s fairly potent, so if your tolerance isn&#39;t high I&#39;d do a one-and-done and then give it 15 minutes. And it&#39;s good not only for creativity, but for motivation: I&#39;m a lazy writer, but I&#39;ve got a manuscript I haven&#39;t looked at in years open in my lap. I&#39;m scribbling in changes I haven&#39;t had the energy to make, and I&#39;m charging my laptop. It looks like my girlfriend might might finally get to read my novel. :) \u000a\u000aMy girlfriend and I are serious pot enthusiasts and plan on having a bud bar when we move in together. Khalifa Kush is definitely going to be a staple. I really, really like this weed.

VWhat the FUCK dude. I know this strain never appears in lists of the strongest types of cannabis, but I\u2019ll never forget what happened last night. Our friend brought over a bud so frosty and white it almost looked like it was covered in paint dust. 15 minutes after putting it through my Crafty vaporizer, we were all laughing and giggling uncontrollably. I\u2019m a daily consumer who dabs weekly but I have not had a strain straight up stupefy me the way this shit did last night in AWHILE. And yes, the taste is very OG-y. Lemon piney and earthy. If you love the taste of OGs, you\u2019ll love this shit. I\u2019m writing this the next morning and I STILL can\u2019t help but feel a little high.

Vthis strain is pretty awesome. it takes a different approach to your high when you smoke it. it takes its sweet time, like a snail crossing a road. the mood booster makes you extremely happy about everything, it also gives you the sense of determination to accomplish anything, yet also keeps you down to earth. this strong lemon scent transforms into a musky citrus taste. the high slowly comes, and even slower, goes. lingering on as long as 6 hours. definately a must for all morning/afternoon users.

VWhat the FUCK dude. I know this strain never appears in lists of the strongest types of cannabis, but I\u2019ll never forget what happened last night. Our friend brought over a bud so frosty and white it almost looked like it was covered in paint dust. 15 minutes after putting it through my Crafty vaporizer, we were all laughing and giggling uncontrollably. I\u2019m a daily consumer who dabs weekly but I have not had a strain straight up stupefy me the way this shit did last night in AWHILE. And yes, the taste is very OG-y. Lemon piney and earthy. If you love the taste of OGs, you\u2019ll love this shit. I\u2019m writing this the next morning and I STILL can\u2019t help but feel a little high.

Vthis strain is pretty awesome. it takes a different approach to your high when you smoke it. it takes its sweet time, like a snail crossing a road. the mood booster makes you extremely happy about everything, it also gives you the sense of determination to accomplish anything, yet also keeps you down to earth. this strong lemon scent transforms into a musky citrus taste. the high slowly comes, and even slower, goes. lingering on as long as 6 hours. definately a must for all morning/afternoon users.

Vvery dense and sticky. You don&#39;t break it up. You peal it or tear it. As far as taste goes I get lemon flavors upfront asap. you can feel the potentcy in your throat and chest as you&#39;re hitting it. The same size hit you would take on another strain would have you coughing on this. I wish it had stronger effects but the flavor is A-one son. It&#39;s not common for this strain to come around on my side of town but will definitely try it again if I run across it. Stay reed up

Vit&#39;s a great evening/night time medication. It&#39;s very smooth and a relaxing feel that takes the pain away a lot more I have severe arthritis in my hips and it helps that to. It also helps my cancer and all the side ghpunch the initial first few minutes then tapers of to nice still quite energetic and makes a great daytime medicine. It doesn&#39;t tend to work as a nighttime very well. It has a very nice initial taste and smooth all the through. Great medication I think this is close to a 6-7 not 4.5. It is the ultimate daytimer. Keeps you energized and mello all at the same time.

VI scored a quarter of kk from green pharms mesa location, and I&#39;ve also read how this strain is not available to the regular public, seeing that and the price(most expensive on the menu) kinda had me feeling iffy, but. risk-taker that I am; I purchased a quarter of this strain and a quarter of citrus sap(which was super flame!). the buds were EXTREMELY beautiful nuggets of pure ecstasy! they had a seductive medium green color with reddish hairs that were thick and well compact yet fluffy enough to break up into even fluffier shake once we had run it through the grinder. the smell at first was bubba cookie-ish, not to pungent, until after we had ground it up, then it released a lemony cookies smell with hints of pine and undertones of something I can only say made the back of my sinuses itchy(in a good way). as usual I used jumbo RAW paper in my RAW rolling machine. it rolled perfectly..when I lit it up, I took a second to appreciate the many wonderful aspects of the smell which was intoxicatingly pungent and one of the best smells I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure to experience! straight OG, but\u000aI kinda of thought platinum girl scout cookies, but i couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on it. the effects were immediately felt throughout my entire mind and body. the first feeling I felt was total bliss from the warmth that started in my chest and gradually spread to all my extremities, all my body was in a total state of relaxation, and my brain was buzzing like a bee, actually like an entire hive of excited killer bees! this was hands down easily one of the best experience&#39;s I&#39;ve EVER had with marijuana..and this is the reason why I continue to favor natural pain relief, and still shun man-made poisons because of the lack of oversight in the pharmaceutical industry due to political and financial burdens placed on us just to squeeze every dollar out of us hard working American&#39;s who actually need real pain relief without the side-effects or the heartache of scandalous big drug companies who&#39;d rather watch people suffer and die instead of making their drugs affordable or without the risk of chemical dependency.. I&#39;m addicted to weed, but because I choose to be, not because I&#39;m physically codependent on drugs whose negative aspects out weigh the beneficial reasons for taking them .... I still believe the God gave us EVERY seed bearing plant to use for food, spiritually as Jesus said, His body was our bread, and the body of cannabis feeds my soul by allowing me to be pain free and staying clear minded so I can function without any worries of overdosing or being looked down on by people of the establishment whose primary concern is their pocketbook, and not your overall wellbeing...

VSomehow picked this up in LA. Wonderful strain. Very uplifting and relaxing at the same time. Just puts me in this mellow state that I can still get work done in. Also kills awkwardness and anxiety for me VERY well. However, higher doses caused me to have off-and-on primal anxiety (literally just the feeling of anxiety, not even anxious thoughts). Otherwise an absolutely amazing strain and definitely going to get more.

VThis is an incredibly chill high. I&#39;m bipolar and prone to experiencing anxiety when smoking strains that have strong cerebral effects. I tend to stick to hybrids and even then have lately been adding Shark Shock or Harle-Tsu for their mellowing effects. I can smoke KK on its own, or use it to chill out a high that&#39;s a little too intense for me. I feel awake and energized, but I can think clearly. I was able to plan out in my mind a moderately complex task I have to do in a few minutes, even though I really shouldn&#39;t have taken that 3rd hit. It&#39;s fairly potent, so if your tolerance isn&#39;t high I&#39;d do a one-and-done and then give it 15 minutes. And it&#39;s good not only for creativity, but for motivation: I&#39;m a lazy writer, but I&#39;ve got a manuscript I haven&#39;t looked at in years open in my lap. I&#39;m scribbling in changes I haven&#39;t had the energy to make, and I&#39;m charging my laptop. It looks like my girlfriend might might finally get to read my novel. :) \u000a\u000aMy girlfriend and I are serious pot enthusiasts and plan on having a bud bar when we move in together. Khalifa Kush is definitely going to be a staple. I really, really like this weed.

VKhalifa Kush (mint dispensary, AZ) buds are like shake buds they&#39;re so small but that&#39;s a dispensary problem &#128514;. You can smell the sweetness oozing off the flower. It tastes like a lemonhead. It&#39;s really sweet like sugar rock candy and has more lemon flavor than lemon skunk. The high is really relaxed. Somewhat trippy but not over the top. Just kinda giggly if you&#39;re already in a good mood. The high lasts for longer than most strains. Gives a good amount of energy. I was able to smoke a gram via 2 joints and I was good for like 4 hours playing arcade games. I&#39;m still not positive I got the real exclusive kk but it is a very very good hybrid  regardless

Vthese guys are great. normally they stop delivering at 9pm but they&#39;re able to make an exception for me and we&#39;re able to deliver to me at 930 due to me getting out late. the driver was polite and answered all my questions. they even gave it to me in a jar which was a nice touch.

VThis is very powerful medicine.  My sister and wife are destroyed on this while I took less and have an electric flow going through my head.  It&#39;s very pleasant and sparkly but I know you can go wayyyy overboard on it if you want.  My advice is take a few small hits and wait.  If you need more go ahead and fly out to space with my other space hoes.

VWow this weed is strong as hell. Strongest in a very long time. The effects were strong, very heavy in the head with a body high that puts the lights out. It smells of diesel and lemon. I smoked 2 joints with 3 other people, and I went home and crashed after about 30 minutes but the stone is so wonderful. It does really put a heavy pressure in your head even 4-5 hours which is quite long for me. Overall 8/10 bud not bad \u000a

VIt&#39;s amazing. Probably the best strain I have smoked in a long time. I just found out about it and I heard and read the rumors of how it is rare and how great the high is, but obviously was dying to test it myself. Only got through half a blunt with a friend and I was baked. I felt amazing and overall happy with what I got. Highly recommend for a night out on the town or even a night where you and the boys sit around playing 2K all night.

I pretty much had the opposite effects of what it&#39;s supposed to do. (Perhaps what I got wasn&#39;t the real thing, but, I&#39;m assuming that it was...) After taking just 2 tokes I gradually started feeling very self conscious, paranoid and defensive. It was extremely difficult to interact with people in general. My body was relaxed and tingling, but , my mind was racing. It was not a pleasant experience at all. \u000a

VA newbie friend shared this with me, and yes I dig...It&#39;s a good high, super happy, slightly giggly and repetitive, I think I walked around my house several times forgetting what I was trying to do. Its a bit peppy, the come down isn&#39;t hard, which I think is what she was missing when she tried it, she wanted a sleepier high. Good stuff, I&#39;ll keep on the look out. Oh and it is PUNGENT, like one of the most PUNGENT strains I have ever seen. It lingered for hours....just in the bag.

VI finally gave this a shot and as a 15 plus year OG lover I can respect the onset high. I am able to function while on Khalifah. I did not find myself hungry using this strain. Good for managing the munchies. Overall I think this strain is a bit overhyped due to the rap culture. I did not find this to be &quot;loud fire, fam&quot;. If you have a high tolerance I find this particular strain pretty weak. Makes you want to keep hitting it more and more. I try and only write reviews when I have tried the same strains twice from different batches. I waited a good four months before posting this. I want to be respectful to those who like this cross.

VExcellent if you love to be super blazed, yet productive, focused and aware, this is perfect. Smells like fresh dabs or a blend of Girl Scout Cookies and OG Kush with a special twist. Tastes like hydroponic berries. Bright orange hairs with purple leaves. 5 &#127775;!

VGreat stuff, though I somewhat question the statement that this is great for morning or daytime use. I would say it&#39;s great for late afternoon / early evening use, whether or not you need to do anything productive after you smoke it. It won&#39;t amp you up (it is an OG after all), at least not compared to strains like Durban Poison and XJ-13, and it puts on a nice relaxing buzz without too much sedation.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a great hybrid! A little bit for everyone.
