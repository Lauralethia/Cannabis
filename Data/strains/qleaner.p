VWow!!!! To date by far my favorite strain hands down. Take only a minute for the full cerebral euphoria to take over!!! Clear headed and ready for anything! Clean crisp sweet taste with a smooth feel on the throat!! Cleaner is a must to always have on hand.

VNice, trusty sativa.  Uplifting and Stiulating effects in general.  Leaves a clear-headed, relatively functional, daytime use high.  Not a super heavy hitter on onset, but great for daytime use or durinig productive times.

VI got this strain from Liberty Meds in Flint, MI. undoubtably one of the more complex hybrids in terms of overall appeal. Dense buds, smooth smoke, and great high. I want to make a big deal about the aroma from this bud. I got a mixture of fruity/Skittles the second I smelt the pound jar of it. Quite remarkable actually. I would recommend  anyone this strain!

VThe amazing lineage really comes out in these beautiful buds, fluffy, airy nugs with long leaves and a solid coating of trichomes with bright orange pistons. I&#39;ve smelled many &quot;citrusy&quot; Sativa strains but no strain can compare to the punch of Sour Tropical and Chemical cleaner smell that this Strain delivers, very uplifting, euphoric, beware inexperienced smokers, too high of a dose of this Power Sativa will have you feeling anxious .

VA dope smoke overall. I say that because you feel uplifted and energized, when you think it feels like you have more clarity. Perfect morning or midday smoke. Be mindful too much will cause couchlock.
