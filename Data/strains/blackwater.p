VEvery time I&#39;ve tried to write a review after vaping Blackwater, I either forget, get distracted or fall asleep&#128514;.  Kills nerve pain (hard to do), crushes insomnia with sleep, doesn&#39;t give bad munchies &amp; stops panic attacks.  I always forget what I&#39;m talking about mid-sentence after Blackwater.  TKO &amp;Thank you Urban Greenhouse!!! Amazing indica!!

VSecond time around with this strain I picked up some shatter for $12.50 a half gram. It&#39;s 11:45pm &amp; I have been trying to medicate since 8pm, but some weird &amp; stressful stuff prevented me from doing so. \u000aMy blood pressure was so high then I immediately went for blackwater.\u000aJust one dab and my pain was gone, my appetites back, and I&#39;m having a hard time fighting off the sandman.\u000aThe flavor is similar to most kush strains.

VThis is the second time I have picked up an 1/8 of this strain. This time from a different source and it is just as good as it was last time. Nice big green buds with some red hairs mixed in. There is also a great deal of crystals covering the buds. The high is perfect for after work or evening time. Heavy indica body high that washes pain away and relaxes muscles. With a nice head high that is always relaxing and puts me in a good place. Definitely one of my favorite Indica right now.

VI know why they call it blackwater OG now. This one really took me by surprise. I toked a single bowl in the vaporizer for a moment, not as long as i usually need to to get proper stoned, but did not finish the entire bowl. I felt i had gotten enough, turned off my vape and decided to make some music. Before i knew it, i was high out of my mind. So high that it took me a while to even realize how high i was. And then i made some really amazing music, it really enhanced my creative energies.\u000a\u000aThis is a super strong indica high with just the right amount of headiness, one of the strongest i have had in a while.Very relaxed body high. Highly sedative. This is a great strain for sleep as i almost fell asleep without realizing it.

VI used the strain exclusively for 12 days in a edible form.\u000aIt is relaxing and great for pain. It can give you a heavy set of the giggles especially over word pro ou citations (I don&#39;t know why) anyways it&#39;s a great strain for indica lovers however I did notice almost each time I dosed I got a ten minute window of anxiety in one form or another. Very strange it was marked about 1 hour into the edible dose. \u000aPain was zero. It was awesome for that and apnea. \u000aI am a sativa lover so the anxiety on this one was a surprise,\u000aWould I use it again? \u000aHell yes!

VJust picked up this Indica for the first time yesterday and I could not be more happy. Nice big, dense buds with some red hairs mixed in and a nice dusting of crystals covering the entire bud. When smoked you get a smooth but pungent taste with subtle hints berry and pine. This is a great strain for smoking after a hard day&#39;s work. It will leave you relaxed,happy, and take away any pain you might have. A couple of more tokes and it&#39;s bed time. A definite must try.

VThe only reason I got this strain was because of the budtenders recommendation that &quot;this is what everybody comes back for&quot; so because it was my first time at that particular dispensary I trusted her judgement. Upon inspecting it looked above average to great, lime green bud with decent trichome covering and uniform orange hairs, nothing special about the smell either, slightly earthy with a hint of OG. However upon ingestion I realized the true power of Blackwater. I was amazed at its couchlock ability, almost completely numbing  my body. Within 4 years of smoking/vaporizing, Blackwater and perhaps Pure Kush are the only strains that I have ever experienced this level of sedation. This is serious medicine folks. 10/10 for medicinal qualities alone.

This is the best strain I have smoked in quite in while when it comes to relieving stress and tension relief and most everyone knows that tension is what makes back pain worse.

I have what I like to call an absolute immunity to indica&#39;s effects, basically I smoke predominantly indica&#39;s &amp; have raised my tolerance. Considerably, however Blackwater blew me away.

VHard hitting strain! It&#39;s only been like 30 mins since my first hit and I don&#39;t even need another one for a bit. this made me almost cough up lung INSTANTLY! Heavy menthol/diesel was caught in my lungs and burning feeling stayed in my chest. I feel like I sucked on a 94 Honda Civics&#39; tail pipe that is in desperate need of a smog check! The reason I took away a star was cause the burning feeling embeds itself in your saliva and chest phlegm. And it burns! And my eyes are drier than the desert, and I live in Arizona!

VI reviewed this strain a while ago and was impressed with its ability to knock out insomnia.  I  was lucky enough to get my hands on some more, and I want to explain what makes it different from most other Indicas.   Blackwater does not have the staggeringly high THC counts you will find in some other  strains.  It seems to have the perfect blend of cannabinoids. and terpenes, to make this strain almost narcotic.  3-4 hits and BWR will &quot;turn your head off,&quot; and you will fall asleep.  NOT A DAYTIME strain!!

I&#39;m glad we have found a good indica. for our wake n bake this morning we have a .05 gram Kali cuah joint we got for 5$ at the same store. its a mighty fine strain. tonight were gona try some fruity pebles. ill leave a review on fruity pebles on the strain review section. keep an eye out for my reviews and pictures. im from Fairbanks Alaska and my favorite stores are Good Sinse, Good Canabis, Grass Station 49, and True Dank. so if ever on vacation in this beautiful state and are in the interior, be sure to hit up theese stores and tell them how happy you are to be able to grab medicine on the go. must be 21 or older with Valid form of identification, expired id will not work.

VI reviewed this strain a while ago and was impressed with its ability to knock out insomnia.  I  was lucky enough to get my hands on some more, and I want to explain what makes it different from most other Indicas.   Blackwater does not have the staggeringly high THC counts you will find in some other  strains.  It seems to have the perfect blend of cannabinoids. and terpenes, to make this strain almost narcotic.  3-4 hits and BWR will &quot;turn your head off,&quot; and you will fall asleep.  NOT A DAYTIME strain!!

VI have been using this one for awhile now. It is one of my more preferred indicas. It has a very mellow tea and earth flavor that isnt great but isnt bad or overpowering. \u000a\u000aIt has the traditional indica head high and it will absolutely creep up on you so take your time with it. I feel control of my thoughts start to slightly slip away &quot; into the water &quot; so this strain is better suited for bedtime or when you are done for the day. \u000a\u000aThis strain to me was more on the mild side and is the type of cannabis I could see using daily. I&#39;ll definitely keep my eye out for it when browsing shops or this site but I don&#39;t think I would go out of my way for it. \u000a\u000aEnjoy! :)

VI recently picked up some AAAA Blackwater from my dispensary and I have to give it a solid 5.3/5. The smoke wasn&#39;t harsh and the high settles behind the eyes about 8secs after a hit. This is definitely an evening/night time strain. I made the mistake of hitting a bowl before my 8 am class and I turned into a luke warm honey bun for the rest of the day

VThis review is coming from my personal opinion after smoking 500 mg of blackwater in the form of a co2 distillate vape cartridge. In my opinion this gives the best flavor, which for me was fruity, more of a grape taste as listed above. This strain is potent and may be the perfect strain for chronic smokers who suffer from insomnia such as myself. After a restless night I grab this specific strain take a few large puffs as a good playlist shuffles and after the first few songs I\u2019m out like a lamp. But this isn\u2019t the only outcome, previously today I got ripped off my vape cartridge and remembered that I needed to take out the trash and mow the grass before it rained, I had plenty of energy through the day. Great strain, and got from some great budtenders at my favorite shop!

VI must have had a bad batch from my licensed producer because blackwater was one of the worse strain I ever had.\u000aThe smell was very unpleasant; it reminded me of moss, dirt and mold and was quite strong. I actually looked closely for mold because the smell really grossed me out but no, that&#39;s just the way it was..\u000a\u000aAs for it&#39;s effect; it&#39;s an indica with a good level of THC so I was expecting to fall asleep pretty fast and Blackwater to act like a strong muscle relaxant as it is recommended to an evening/night time strain. \u000a\u000aI vaporized it ( it taste the same as it smells) waited.. and waited.. nothing, vaporized again and then I got a bit dizzy, a bit cloudy. As if it was suddenly 1am and my eyelids were heavy but it was pretty much it. I do not have a high tolerance to THC and Blackwater did very little to help the symptoms of my medical conditions. \u000aI will not buy this strain again; very boring buzz ever.

VBlackwater is definitely a strain to put you to sleep. A couple bowls of this rich Indica and you&#39;ll be fighting to make it to the bed before you crash. I would say handle with caution if you&#39;re a new smoker b/c of the potency of this stain. Overall the only negative is the cotton mouth that sets in but you can handle this pretty easily. Excellent strain for a Sunday afternoon.

VDefinitely a night strain. Buds are beautiful with some nice purple coloration and lots of beautiful trichomes. I\u2019m a newbie so do take this lightly, but I loved how it tasted. Smooth taste. I can clearly taste the berries, surprisingly, with a bit of a watermelon hitting me slightly right at the end of the exhale. Helps me sleep like a baby. Definitely recommend it.

VA really nice indica.  This is one of the few that I&#39;ve found that doesn&#39;t give you an overwhelming head high, instead just leaving you more calm than stoned.  The pain relief was definitely a plus, as was the easy, slightly sleepily content feeling it left me with.  Not sorry I decided to try this one out at all!

As for effects, don&#39;t smoke this if you have anything at all to do the rest of the day haha Extreme couch lock that leads to a heavy sleep.

VI&#39;m winding down this Monday night with Blackwater, a sweet grape and blueberry syrup smelling and tasting indica that has got me really stoned at the moment.  I like it a lot!   Mine tested at 26.02% THC and .08 % CBD.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m feeling cloudy headed and very relaxed.  This is the type of weed to zone out to cartoons with or just chill with some music, definitely NOT the type of weed you want to smoke for energy, focus, or productivity.  This strain melts away stress and I know I will sleep well tonite.\u000a\u000aI would consider growing this one someday because it smells and tastes so sweet and is potent.

When placed in a grinder with a high CBD counterpart, preferably Blackberry, the two form a cooperation and synergy that are likeable in the finest sense. But Blackwater as she stands alone, has no friend with my body, as she keeps with her the company or nausea, dizziness, paranoia and the like.

I&#39;m in love with this bu-ddha! (Im more of a downer type of person that actually gets productive). I like The texXture - how it&#39;s roundish nugs, covered with like golden orange somewhat look alike web hairs, with some sweet purple hues deep within, oh the ShmeLl of iit (OmG how it fucking reeeeeeks! somewhat really loud with a hint of grape and pines. but really danky. It&#39;ll  really really pungently danked your room. I tell you what!). The tashte of iits somewhat like has a grapy taste to it but with a taste that&#39;s new to me and my taste buds ... well I&#39;ve never come across this particular strain or anything like this before. Hands down now one of my top 5 faves....within the first five minutes i felt soo euphorical, freeminded, not having a care for the world, I ended stashing my phone away instead of my calculator. I hadn&#39;t notice until 10 minutes later that I was holding the calculator the whole time thinking it was my phone. Last but not least, there is caution, you might experience some turbulence, dryness of the mouth, and also huunger...So grab on tight, cause your in for a riide.\u000a

VI must have had a bad batch from my licensed producer because blackwater was one of the worse strain I ever had.\u000aThe smell was very unpleasant; it reminded me of moss, dirt and mold and was quite strong. I actually looked closely for mold because the smell really grossed me out but no, that&#39;s just the way it was..\u000a\u000aAs for it&#39;s effect; it&#39;s an indica with a good level of THC so I was expecting to fall asleep pretty fast and Blackwater to act like a strong muscle relaxant as it is recommended to an evening/night time strain. \u000a\u000aI vaporized it ( it taste the same as it smells) waited.. and waited.. nothing, vaporized again and then I got a bit dizzy, a bit cloudy. As if it was suddenly 1am and my eyelids were heavy but it was pretty much it. I do not have a high tolerance to THC and Blackwater did very little to help the symptoms of my medical conditions. \u000aI will not buy this strain again; very boring buzz ever.

VA quick hitting indica, I found myself feeling relaxed and happy. Warming of my face and especially my nose was welcome. Closing my eyes reveals beautiful images that can only be described as exquisite. \u000a\u000aMild tasting, with a slight woodiness to it, it is an easy strain to vaporize. I&#39;d buy it again.

VHeavy hitting indica guaranteed to help you fall asleep &amp; stay asleep. Wonderful almost fresh morning pine but with a pungent slimy odor. Excellent for increasing  appetite greatly. Long lasting &amp; hard hitting. Dense buds with orangeish-amber hairs with varying shades of green. With the underbelly of the buds holding a dense collection of trichromes.

VBlackwater is definitely a strain to put you to sleep. A couple bowls of this rich Indica and you&#39;ll be fighting to make it to the bed before you crash. I would say handle with caution if you&#39;re a new smoker b/c of the potency of this stain. Overall the only negative is the cotton mouth that sets in but you can handle this pretty easily. Excellent strain for a Sunday afternoon.

The body high was perfect I suffer from herniated disks and smoking this I had no pain at all, I even was able to do some yoga excersices without feeling any pain or discomfort, and I felt my back spasms going away.I recommend this stain a lot for anxiety, muscle spasms and pain overall.
