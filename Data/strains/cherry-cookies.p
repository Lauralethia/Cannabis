VHelps with depression, ptsd, and pain management. \u000aI got a happy and less concerned about the major  stressors around me. Great for doing simple tasks, but nothing to complicated. Sweet taste. Very pungent.  One of my five faves!!!!

VThe buds that grew from this plant were incredibly fluffy, soft and what I like to refer to as The Kind - a rare, dank sticky strain that\u2019s hard to come by. The Cherry Pie is most evident here, in taste and smell AND effect. It is overwhelmingly sweet, pungent and sharp - You gets hints of the Durban parent too. I react so strongly it smells, i know immediately whether I will like a strain based on its smell. And this, holy cow! I definitely am a sucker for the berry strains. And the mix with the GSC cerebral high makes for a fun ride. This is such a unique strain, and grew like a charm outdoors. She has my vote and you will like her too!

VBuds are very attractive in color and smells earthy with a nice sweet flavor.\u000a\u000aAmazing experience! This hybrid starts off pretty mellow and uplifting but as the high gets stronger it randomly fluctuated between the body to head high ratios and it was always unpredictable and if you can focus enough you will get really excited to see what it will throw at you next. Also a very long lasting high that gives off great euphoria for both the body and mind and keeping you clear minded. At one point I found that my 5 senses seemed to have heightened so much that they all teamed up and created one super sense. At other times I would find myself peacefully deep in thought and I seemed to know exactly what I meant and at the same time have no clue what I meant. \u000a\u000aWould highly suggest this strain, easily in the top 5 best strains I have ever smoked.

VI bought a 1/2 ounce of this GSC strain today from a number of GSC strains and phenos. After smoking a small sampling I can see why it has the outstanding rating it has--because it is outstanding. Smooth-smoking, relaxing body effect but able to do more than think about getting off the couch.
