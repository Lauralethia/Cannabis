VThis is the real deal right here. I picked up some Grease Monkey#7 because of the insanely high THCA of this batch (30.3)  at Patriot Care and it did NOT disappoint. \u000aNice musky scent, really classic kB flavor and a high that made a veteran smoker throw his hood up and start laughing for no good god damned reason, hahahaha. Great body high, nice and numb and tingly while the mind stays alert. A true classic.

VLove this strain! I mix it with Cannatonic because I need the high CBD, but I also need the high THC. Alone these strains are really good, but mix them together and WOW!&#129303; Knocks out pain, inflammation, anxiety, and stress. Like a natural combo of Excedrin migraine, Xanax &amp; Vicodin. You can stay active if you like but you can easily fade into the couch while staring at the Netflix home screen and daydreaming. &#128521; I\u2019ve been experimenting for a year and I think this is it! \u000aGrease Monkey and any high CBD strain will do the trick.\u000aI\u2019ve had back and neck surgery and have Lupus. If your symptoms are similar, give it a try.

VPicked this one up from a local dispensary when the guy behind the counter got gitty telling me about it i knew i was in for something. At first look looked like something out of Mr. Freeze&#39;s stash. Got home took a few good bong rips. On exhale i was hit with a sweat yet skunky taste almost like kissing the God of skunks. Once the effects started to lean in I was put into what I call the ideal video game state, as in I was in complete cerebral euphoria while still clear enough to focus and be alert. Hands down one of my go to&#39;s when they have it in stock. Urban Wellness is in my opinion one of the top 3 in the state.

VGassy, deep woods earthy. With citrus, lavender, and spicy top notes. Sweet on inhale, expands in the lungs. Diesel on the exhale. The buds are tight and dense, yet soft and crystal covered when broken up. They have a deep iridescent forest green color, with vibrant orange hairs, and an almost candied look to it.

VIt\u2019s been a long day. It\u2019s also been... a couple glasses of wine night. I packed a large bowl for myself. Particularly after reading the reviews, I figured this was the way to go. \u000a\u000aGrease does not disappoint. Not overly harsh, even after a casual day of bowl smoking (you know what I mean... when that last bowl just... hurts). It\u2019s got a tinge if a burn after a large rip, but it doesn\u2019t yield a coughing fit; for that... I\u2019m grateful \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a strong one. 20 years under my belt and this one definitely reminds me of being 18 :) in all the great ways that smoking great bud at 18 makes you feel\u000a\u000aI don\u2019t really think this is a good strain for mid-day productive mode; as a graphic designer, I\u2019d find this strain too powerful for focus, but great for day dreaming or dreaming up a new Design... basically, don\u2019t smoke this before a meeting with a client... or when you have an impending deadline. \u000a\u000aUltimately, if your tolerance is high; grease monkey will do you right. If you\u2019re at the end of a long day (like tonight... Christmas Eve with a three year old); it\u2019ll do you right. In fact, as long as you don\u2019t have anything professional to do over the next couple of hours (hell yeah it\u2019s that good)... it\u2019ll do you right. \u000a\u000aEnjoy the shit out of this!\u000a\u000a

VThis strain\u2019s indica-dominant genetics saddle me, the consumer with a lazy, munchie-fueled body buzz that softens the blow of my chronic pain, nausea and stress.\u000a\u000aReally though, this is medical grade purity.  It is a strong, relaxing head buzz that softens your eyes and your muscles too.  Will knock you out, has a little dry mouth and makes physical sensations much more pleasing than normal.  I mix this with a little Purple Urkle or 9 pound hammer and it\u2019s a powerfully therapeutic way to melt your stress and clear your mind.  \u000a\u000aGot mine from Ponderosa Releaf (they just opened three weeks ago.  Their spot is amazing and they carry some of the purest and best-cured flower on the entire west side.)\u000a\u000aSedative strain for sure.

VAlright, so my first time meeting this strain and it was by description...pretty damn accurate. I definitely detected the &quot;Glue&quot; due to its pungent aroma and stickiness. I have never tried the &quot;&#127850; and Cream&quot; but I bet that part is what smoothed the rough part or the &quot;choking/raspy throat&quot; effect that the &quot;Glue&quot; hits you with...or at least me with every time...didn&#39;t really cough until the end of my blunt. &quot;Grease Monkey&quot; did start to go to my joints and other areas that are affected by my sciatica...another reason why I chose this strain. After about 15 minutes, the relaxation really kicked in and my body was powerless to the relaxing effect that took hold. All I did the rest of the night was watch Transformers, ThunderCats, and G.I. Joe cartoons the rest of the night...and eat Crunch Berries cereal lol!

VIn revisiting his strain, it&#39;s awesome as a rest and digest strain. Good for appetite especially. When I got it, it was labelled as a sativa and the budtender called it a sativa, but it is definitely an indica dominant hybrid. I can understand mixing it up for sativa though because it feels really clear headed and focused, not overly lazy. \u000aHad with a gin basil smash and tasted like apple when combined with the grease monkey. Great for heavy meals, post workout, etc. Awesome for time with family, very functional but relaxing.

VThis heavy indica-dominant hybrid found its way to my local dispensary, and at $50 for a quarter ounce, I went for it. I bought a batch of bud that tested at 26% THC; the high is fast-acting and intense. It was harsh on the throat, though the pungent, earthy taste makes up for it. The munchies are insane! I also enjoyed the suble sweet taste, which took me a few rips to pick up. It&#39;s definitely in my top three favorite strains!

VI purchased both a pre-roll &amp; shake from AZ Natural Selections in Arizona. It is very earthy but smooth followed by immediate lasting effects. I have lower back Scoliosis which causes constant muscle contractions and on occasion several muscles spasms with stabbing pain. I find a 10% decrease in pain and tension after my first two hits of Grease Monkey with continued decreases with more intake. The mental effects are mild at most but I am an daily CBD user which I have found lowers head effects. The body effects are some of the best that I have found so far with a strain. The easy onset keeps you relaxed, thirsty, hungry and wanting more. This is a perfect strain for me to use near the end of the day  but before I want to end up on the couch. My energy level seems un-effected after 3-4 packs into the &quot;one-hitter&quot;. - In conclusion, this strain is awesome and definitely will be on my &quot;keep in stock&quot; list in case dispensaries ever run out.

VRaw flower smells of diesel and cardboard, with a sweet undertone of raisins. Smoked taste is light and reminds me of granola. Effects were very relaxing, and very content. This is not a good med for focus; I was all over the place, and it took me three times the normal amount of time to complete basic household tasks. I was filled to the brim with patience, though, and that\u2019s worth a lot. It also made me a bit giggly early on. I was unable to complete the review while feeling the effects; the engage brain app had apparently stopped working. Nice body high, as well. After a couple of hours, it made me sleepy.

The smell is a really pungent, skunky, sweet cookies &amp; cream. After dabbed it tastes very fuelly, earthy/skunky, and sweet like vanilla. The smoke smelled straight up like cookies and cream. Very relaxed body buzz, dreamy cerebral effects, and an overall feeling of well-being. Definitely recommended for nighttime or couch-related activities. Did not disappoint.

VThere wasn&#39;t really much to say either way about Grease Monkey.  First there was no visual of this bud since this strain was already rolled up in 2 prerolls weighing .75 each.  This also doesn&#39;t give me much of an opinion as for the smell of this flower before burning a la jar.  This almost gave way to the notion of doing this review at a later time.  After thinking about it over the length of a doobie it seems now is the time for one reason alone.  It took me several passes on this strain before letting a budtender coax me into it so unless fate makes it happen again with a great deal the opportunity may not ever arise.\u000a\u000aNot the biggest fan of the G Glue strain with a preference for #12 so there was a preconceived bias.  The Cookies &amp; Cream other half of lineage made this a little better in my mind and also in the taste of smoke.  The smoke was not super tasty, but it did bite back in my throat making me cough every hit.  The kind of irritation or bite that only cannabis produces where by the time that quick cough is over the head is stoned.  The rest of the buzz seems to spread from that ganja bite in back of head &amp; throat down to lungs than throughout body catching up to head very fast.  So this was no creeper and the high although very down the middle hybrid had a thick insulated feeling around forehead and cheeks. \u000a\u000aThe high was functional , pretty boring effects overall albeit a long lasting 2-3 hour.  Could be used for very light pain relief or mood elevation.  Personally would not use for either unless there was nothing else.  Would consider this a recreational weed that would be great for light or first time users.  If this strain and I cross paths again by chance this review will be updated.

It&#39;s a skunky diesely lemony smell and definitely leaves a skunky flavour behind. Currently using for pain, and this definitely hit the nail there. Feeling super relaxed mentally and physically.

Unlike its parent, Gorilla Glue, there&#39;s no energy burst/head high rush at the beginning, it&#39;s just numbing and relaxing. If you don&#39;t smoke anything else, it&#39;ll pull you to sleep after an hour or so.

VHybrid strain with more of Indica characteristics. This strain has a strong odor smell when ignited (flower), and the smoke is pretty harsh. If you can get passed that then you&#39;ll have get a decent high from it (again more Indica like).

VMoving with purpose, prowling the back alleys in a country whose language is musical and indecipherable.  Hardly noticing as the long shadows blend in to night. The rhythm of the streets begins to change with the coming of the moon. \u000a\u000aIt is here, in this moment, that you find what you seek. A vendor sits in this forgotten side alley. His wares laid out on a once rich blanket. He picks an earthen jar from among them and holds it out to you, wordless, with a serious expression. \u000a\u000aEarth. Spices. Mysterious, exotic comfort. The warm, dry, sweet darkness that wraps around this world. You leave quickly with your prize tucked under one arm, protected. Blending in to the night, you are gone.

VDecent buzz, if you can get past the choke! Taste of burned motor oil is very unpleasant. Coughed, sneezed, and blew snot through half a joint before giving up. Won\u2019t be buying this one again.
