VGot this in a 1.2 gram pre roll. So smooth didn&#39;t notice I was 2 joints later. Amazing taste. Slightly fruity with a very uplifting/euphoric high. When I was outside I felt like I was part of a nature portrait. Very good strain and I would recommend to anyone who wants an uplifting high. Wasn&#39;t too spacy and was able to do tasks. Recommended!

VSmoked it for the first time today. Bro copped about a pound &amp; it came out as some really big, earthy smelling nugs. Gives a nice kick to the smoke and leaves you feeling nice and happy. Pretty low on the paranoia too. Nice strain I&#39;d recommend to anyone wanting to try a good energizing sativa.

VMy review is for Moonshine Haze shatter obtained from NETA in Brookline MA and consumed with a Puffco Pro 2. I use cannabis to treat anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. I tend to go more for hybrids because sativas can give me anxiety. No such problem with this stuff. Zero anxiety, zero paranoia, not racy, just super intense euphoria and comfort that isn&#39;t sedating. This will be a staple.

VI purchased a quarter of Moonshine Haze from Natural Remedies in Denver, Colorado.  I selected it as it had a previous Cup-winning profile, and I usually find that to be a great indicator of a plant that has been loved and cultivated appropriately.  It was a great head up high, and was a nice touch to watching an active sporting event with a fun, loud group of people.  Like all Hazes, there&#39;s a little bit of dumbed down feeling, but not enough to say spacey.  I enjoyed this plant experience, I would measure half for its genetics and the other half for the excellent producer, Natural Remedies.  I will buy this again.

VMoonshine Haze is an epic name. Being a massive haze fan, I had high expectations. They were just barely missed. I felt simply hazy and not much else. There wasn&#39;t much of the mood lift that I always look for in hazes. It was only slightly present. It wasn&#39;t bad by any means, it still relieved some stress but only mild stressors. If you need some serious punch for some serious stress then I would look deeper. Overall decent for daytime if you don&#39;t want to get too stoned. Grown by Summa Cultivation. Terpinolene: 3.6 mg/g, Ocimene: 1.1 mg/g, y-Terpinene: 3.8 mg/g.

VPicked up an eight of this strain recently.  Smells very pungent with notes of lemon, honey, spice, and pine.  Nice milky trichomes and very crystallized.  Well trimmed nicely shaped buds.  Uplifting but not energetic high.  3 bowls left me giggling for hours.  10/10 would choose this strain again.  Great strain for depression and PTSD.

VTastes and feels great as hell. On top of that it kicks in so quick that I don&#39;t have much time to react. About maybe 30 seconds max before it slams into me. It feels like it lasts for ages because of that too. For the first hour to hour and a half it feels real psychedelic and makes it easy to do things or even be active. And then over the next few hours it relaxes and lets me feel even more stress-free and better, especially with stuff where I need to talk to people. If you smoke too much it doesn&#39;t absolutely wreck you (and if it does, even then maybe for only ten minutes at most in my experience). Even though I vastly prefer and need indicas, this is one of, if not my favorite sativa(s) ever.

VWill preface that I&#39;ve only had it as an oil (69% thc vape cartridge), but - seriously the BEST sativa I&#39;ve had, and I&#39;ve tried sour diesel (which is good but different). Has an amazing floral, almost rosemary-like scent. Vaped some of this and it was like I forgot what anxiety ever was. it&#39;s an AMAZING mood lifter!! Also still able to focus and work on this strain :)

VThis strain gets my wow! Moonshine haze gives a nice heady high. Your head floats along and the body just follows along. Nice effect. I&#39;m a chronic pain patient and this strain really helps me bottom line. It moved me from a grumpy, hurty to smiley and happy. Hung out with friend and all our dogs and kids had such a great time. Moonshine has a for me a woody taste.

VIf you stop by your favorite Bud Supplier and see a pile of small tight buds called Moonshine Haze...grab &#39;em. The reason, although there is definitely a range of flavors, my selection tasted of grape which I really enjoyed. As stated one thing to look for is these small, super tight and round buds; they are just awesome! The high is mellow and relaxed, great for stress but still able to concentrate when necessary. Def recommend.

VMoonshine Haze is now available in Philadelphia dispensaries. Patients say this strain is very effective in treating patients who suffer from appitite loss, headaches and other chronic pain. They say its effective in treating inflammation, so any chronic pain problems that are being caused by inflammation maybe treated correctly with the help of this strain.

The Sativa nature of uplifting and energetic helped the hike, while still giving me a great higher to more fully enjoy the nature around me.

VThe high on this one creeps up on you, but if you can manage a few good coughs, it seems like it sets in quicker (as well as giving a hint of whiskey on the cough).

High was uplifting but not energetic.  Left me giggling for hours after a few bowls in the vaporizer.  10/10 would purchase again.  Great strain for depression and PTSD.

There&#39;s a good 30-minute of buzz, but the effects linger on for one to two hours. Originally I rated five stars. But realized I get very moody and upset when the high goes away.

VAmazing strain. One of the best sativas. Very focused with very little anxiety.  Great for daytime use. Not much of a facial buzz, more like a brain instrument.
