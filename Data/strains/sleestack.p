VA nice uplifting cultivar that is awakening without a lot of &quot;raciness&quot;.  I experienced the wonderful Sleestack in the form of hash rosin, in shatter and budder consistencies.  The aroma had a floral-pine smell that left a cooling sensation throughout the sinuses.  It tasted of real soft non-artificial lemon-lime with a hint of the floral-pine that was on the nose.  The texture of the smoke was fluffy, and expansive like the gassiness of chems/diesels.  Great for productivity and creativity.  Don&#39;t sleep on the Sleestack, it&#39;s truly one to be revered.

VGood septivia. Made me want to turn into big eyed green alien worker drone and change my name to Tor. Really though, I was out of Durban and this slid in the spot nicely. Good day blend for getting it done. Especially if you are reptile like alien.

VGet this if you see it. I am generally a fan of sweet smelling strains but this is an exception. Difficult to articulate the aroma and taste but it&#39;s delicious and addictive! &#39;Fruity Gas&#39; is one way to describe it. The buzz is positive and medium/strong. It helps me with physical relaxation while I make lists of all I need to get done.

VSleestack is an amazing sativa dominant strain. It makes me feel super happy and talkative and ready to go. Gives the perfect bony high, not couch locked at all. Very happy! Great strain!

VGrowed under pro grow 400. Unfortunately didn&#39;t get fat buds but the one that I got iwere very resinous. Clean Sativa high, well being and uplifted, nice to have a beer and something to eat after.

Vi just got 1/2 oz of some organically grown sleestack from northern california. i&#39;ve been smoking on it all day and i&#39;ve been lovin it. one negative would be  that it did seem to bring forward some anxiety but it wasn&#39;t anything a little focused breathing couldn&#39;t help. overall very solid strain. beautiful nugs with an increeeedddiiibllleee aroma.

VSativa dominant. Smells amazing (like Christmas). Besides smelling and tasting great, it&#39;s pretty average compared other sativas I&#39;ve tried. Nice head high, not much couch lock. After smoking it I really just want to get up and do something. Makes you a little anxious and paranoid at times, but nothing you can&#39;t shake off.
