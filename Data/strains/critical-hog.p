VBeautiful and true indica strain. Really helped relax me enough for the evening and bed. Super happy, pain and stress melted away and it lasts too. The thc level in the flower I got tested to 21+.Will definitely be coming back to this. Just make sure you keep some water nearby! This one will give you some serious cotton mouth.

Its a calm, happy, relaxing high - as if wrapped in a warm blanket on a cold winter day. Heavy eyes. Very little cotton mouth if any. Forgetful. Very good stuff if your an indica lover.

Smoking right along and next thing you know a  hit of euphoria and relaxation start to mingle in.  Got mine as a 3.5g pre-roll pack from SWC and dig the bang for the buck of getting 2 sessions per.

VI have 2 pheno&#39;s of this strain in my medical grow right now (Ebb &amp; Flow Tables) and although I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of trying it out, both pheno&#39;s grow very similar and fast!! They like to stretch for sure, but top them in veg and super crop the shit out of them and they fill out SOOOOO nice!! The smell is crazy too, very sweet like some maui ice cream. I&#39;ve also noticed they can handle high ppm for more sugar coating, but ease off just a little and they bulk up fast. \u000a\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve been growing my own med for awhile and I can tell this one is a keeper, if your commercial, get it! If your personal or medical, get it!! I promise u won&#39;t be un happy!!
