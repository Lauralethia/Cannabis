VGrabbed this guy after reading great reviews and looking for an energetic but non jittery fix. Buds are big, fluffy, whispy, and unique. The smell, especially after grinding, was just like cherry limeade &#128151; smoke was smooth and tasted very different but good! Hints of cherry are on the exhale and it&#39;s got a sweetness to it. The high was pretty heavy at first, possibly because my I had been smoking something different for a while. Body was tingling. I felt like I was hearing more sharply. I felt as if this could make me racy, and I was a little jumpy. Again, this could be because this is a new strain with a higher percent THC (I think.) I was kinda feeling stoney and lazy, yet aware of a couple of my senses. My touch felt heightened, so I wouldn&#39;t use this for pain. Got a little trippy after a few minutes.

V\u000aAttributes: Actual smell is more berry or fruity hints\u000anot super sticky buds\u000a\u000aI&#39;m super satisfied with the smoothness of the smoke. No chokes at all! Not much Diesel taste but every now and then you&#39;ll catch a hint of it. I know the name is cherry diesel however it taste more like berries then anything. All the benefits are there. Most strands I find it kinda hard to focus however with this Strain I find that I have little to no problems with focus. No dizzy for me but on the other hand for me I experienced a little dry eye with a little dry mouth, but I was expecting at least that. Whether the strand I had was wrong and door or out as unknown so I can&#39;t comment. Same with lighting etc :(\u000a\u000aSo something that I&#39;ve found that isn&#39;t discussed very much are which wrappers to use or suggest different wrappers that pair best for blunt smokers. So I would suggest the backwoods wild &amp; mild cigars the honey berry flavor. \u000a\u000a- Definitely a good euphoria rush\u000a- somewhat upbeat\u000a- I would say yes on depression and stress because it puts you in a good relaxed state of mine. Very so lightly.\u000a- definitely the Yang &amp; Yang effects from the 50-50 split Sativa and Indica auras from both blended nicely.\u000a- A true example of a hybrid strain!\u000a\u000a&quot;Theses are all my own opinions&quot;\u000aI hope you all enjoy cheers!

Vloved this strain, bought an ounce from TLC and it was consistent throughout the entire jar. super sweet yet sour pungent smelling at the same time. great smooth smoke , great flush. very happy giggly, potent but not too strong. perfect for socializing or just to get in a better mood. would recommend silly movies like ace Ventura haha.

VThis strain is really good for medical patients. ~26.5 THC bringing a nice head buzz &amp; relaxing body feel from the toes to brain. Pain reliever and helps with appetite, headaches, insomnia, general pain, morning sickness, joint pain, and much more. The aroma is fruity, diesel, earthy, flowery. The ideal buds look compact, with proper brown pistils, dark green leaves, and milky trichomes. Colas of this strain are amazing! Recommended for med patients of all kinds!

VProceed with caution. This strain is magnificent and very powerful. Army green buds with very slight purple brass orange hairs and sharp crystals. Density seems pretty perfect to me; soft but hard enough to crumble with your fingers. Smells like sweet and sour cherries, citrus and pine. Taste like cherries, maybe blood orange after tones.. earthy and diesel, slight nuttiness. Effects are strong, real sneaky in approach. Abundance of focus and creativity, with a rush of euphoria and relaxation. Keeps the mind in organized work and study while the body is in nirvana, although is not couch locked. Very good strain to get stuff done and feeling amazing while doing so. Don&#39;t smoke a gram bowl of this one, it could seriously knock you on your ass if you aren&#39;t careful. Recommend this for anyone with pain, depression, anxiety, ADD/ADHD, and want to be one with All&#128329;\ufe0f&#128154;\u262f\ufe0f

The high was very relaxing but yet not couch lock. Loved it and crossed it with an Island Sweet Skunk.  I would have bred it pure but I only had 1 female.

VVaporized in wax form, this stuff is deceptively smooth in that big hits feel like nothing, and very sweetly pungent. I notice a fruity aftertaste for a period after smoking. Very relaxed high with a mild head buzz that isn&#39;t distracting from the euphoric and happy effects that came with it. Throw on your favorite tunes and chill out. Five stars, mainly because it&#39;s one of the few strains where the high sincerely felt more enjoyable with each additional toke. I don&#39;t feel like I could get &quot;too&quot; high with this strain, although I still probably wouldn&#39;t function super well in public &#128077;&#128077;

VThis strain was very stimulating/arousing, in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, I felt the opposite of couch locked and motivated to do housework, cleaning, and work. I was energized by Cherry Diesel, appreciated music more, and felt uplifted while engaged in a task/activity. However, the stimulating nature of this strain, was quite unpleasant for me when I was trying to unwind/relax after work and when I was attempting to fall asleep. I felt very anxious/stressed/paranoid when I wasn&#39;t engaged in an activity (e.g. when watching tv or laying in bed). I also couldn&#39;t fall asleep because of my anxiety/stimulation from smoking this strain.

VWhile I initially felt compelled to rank this lower, I don\u2019t like a lot of hybrids. I really like walking one path or another, however this strain has walked the tightropes better than any other I\u2019ve tried and I\u2019ve been at this a while. If you can\u2019t make up your mind, try the cherry diesel. You won\u2019t regret it

VI\u2019ve been smoking for a very long time and I have a VERY HIGH tolerance, the taste of it is one of the better ones I have had (in my opinion) it gets your pretty high off 1 bowl of a good bong. I would for sure recommend this bud for anyone who tryna have a fun time out w friends or gotta clean the whole fucking house u will get it done very very fast.!!!

VOut of all the strains my girlfriend and I smoked, this strain gave her the most effects. She was very giggly and upbeat. We went to the gym prior, so when we smoked Cherry Diesel, we couldn\u2019t believe how well this strain relieved a lot of the soreness. I really enjoyed this strain myself, both the taste and the effects. If you are someone who appreciates the better tasting strains, then Cherry Diesel is the way to go!

VCherry Diesel is all-fucking right! Fondly reminds me of the first time I smoked a mystery Diesel strain. Very positive and mystical. It&#39;s a bit less powerful than the last strain of mystery Diesel I smoked. However, I was smoking out of a Volcano and ended up smoking a shitload of it. Cherry Diesel happens to be a very chill-yet-potent strain. Very little worry of being all paranoid and non-verbal around people. Smoked out of the lil pipe on this and it wasn&#39;t too harsh. That&#39;s the thing I definitely recommend. Vaping, like a noble instead of lighting your cannabis on fire like some hippie peasant.

VThis is one of my favourite sativa strains, and has some specific properties that make it great situationally.\u000a\u000aThe most extraordinary effect this strain has must be the clear-headed high it gives. Usually when stoned I cannot study because I make too many simple mental errors with calculations and spelling, but this high allows me to enjoy my work whilst still functioning mentally. If you feel like your batteries are empty and your brain has absorbed all it can, a small bowl of this and you re-engage you with your work and you dive straight back in!\u000a\u000aSecondly, as a sativa hybrid it gives a nice energetic buzz, and gives me great energy to be active and move around. Some reviewers say it gives couch-lock, and I think this is because of the relaxing indica-like body high it gives, where your muscles loosen up and feel fluid. I however find this awesome feeling great motivation to be active.\u000a\u000aIt also gives makes me more sociable, and combined with the clear headedness, energy, and creativity it offers, it is a truly great daytime smoke. I find it helpful for going out with friends, running errands, and cooking is a lot of fun when you don\u2019t screw up your timings so much.\u000a\u000aOverall, this strain stands out to me for its studying potential, and is otherwise a solid sativa smoke without fucking your head up too much. 4.5/5
