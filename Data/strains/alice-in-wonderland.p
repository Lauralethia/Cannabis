VReview is for 1/4oz purchased at OZ in Seattle.\u000a\u000aProducer is Walden Farms.\u000a\u000aTolerance at the moment:  Very high.\u000a\u000aAppearance:  I would suspect this is light dep.  Would almost guarantee it&#39;s not indoor.  Harvested Oct 2016 so nearly a year from harvest...\u000a\u000aSmell:  Mild.  It will not take over an entire room like cracking a tiny bud of Candyland.  I detect hints of minty pine with some calming vanilla.\u000a\u000aSmoke:  Mild lung expansion.  I do not detect a hint of taste on inhale or exhale.  My lips have no after taste.  This is out of a freshly cleaned beaker bottom bong.  Ash burned black, not white.\u000a\u000aEffects:  Increased focus for mentally challenging tasks.  Feels like I&#39;m able to turn off the outside noise.  After 3 bowls I find my heart rate elevating, my senses have heightened, and house chores become necessary.  I do not notice any muscle relaxation, although with my mind at ease it&#39;s enjoyable to lean into a comfy chair and relax to some miles davis.  If you are into netflix this would be a good strain for shows with subtitles, as it keeps you focused.  \u000a\u000aTolerance Build up:  I usually keep 4 strains on deck, and did not notice any tolerance buildup when going back to this.  \u000a\u000aPurchase again?  Certainly.  For $60 a quarter, this is something I would feel comfortable giving to a casual smoker, knowing after one bowl they would still be very functional.  It&#39;s nice to have these strains on deck.  Would be interested to try this with a fresher harvest date, and indoor coco.  I&#39;m pretty sure Walden is using soil.

VIt is an extremely creative strain and it will give you sharp focus. Be careful not to smoke too much in short amount of time because the high is very heady and it gave me a minor anxiety for about 10 minutes. Other than that, music sounds incredible, nature is very vivid with beautiful colors, and it gave me a little body-warming high. It&#39;s an incredible strain and you will not be disappointed. Try it!

Kept going for an hour and a half. Love it!\u000a\u000aThis was my first time vaping oil (Cannasol CO2), and it was a bit heavy for my lungs. Took about a 2-second draw and held 20 seconds. That was all I needed. I still want to try the herb, but they were out. Very dry mouth and sinuses, and eyes. Kept a lot of water nearby.\u000a\u000aUPDATE: Just tried the herb today, a couple of vapes at 350F. Nice and uplifting, nothing over the top.

I was told by the budtender that this was Willy&#39;s Wonder crossed with G13/Haze. Citrus and honey with a hint of coriander on the nose and palate - very pleasant.

VAlice in Wonderland will make you feel groovy. You&#39;ll get the euphoria, a pleasant numbness at the back of your neck, and a generally uplifted vibe. Despite this, Alice still leaves you quite clear headed, so this is an ideal strain to smoke before doing some housework, going to get groceries, or any other mundane task you want to spice up. Pairs well with a little RHCP.

VOddly, a very light weed despite its THC percentage listing of 20.  I took two additional hits beyond what would be my normal max to get really high and yet still only barely felt a slight increase in any body sensations. Zero cerebral enhancement and zero enhancement to any of the five senses. But the smoke was sweet and smooth and definitely felt a general more relaxed state much like what one would get from a few drinks. And there was a slight tingling on the face.

VFantastic long lasting high. Great tasting. I normally don&#39;t get red eyes. With this chronic that&#39;s not the case. Wonderful in the day if you like to smoke and do any physical activity this is the bud for you!

VI have always been a big fan of Indicas but after smoking this strain I have to reconsider. A long and happy high. No more stress. Great job CannaSol.

VIt may be the vaporizer I have, but I didn&#39;t really notice much from this--I felt a bit more chill but that was it. That was .5 gram with vaporizer. Maybe not enough. I did sleep a bit more than usual after smoking/vaping.
