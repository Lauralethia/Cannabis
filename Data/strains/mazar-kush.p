VIt&#39;s refreshing to see vintage genetics still being produced. I&#39;ve never tried this age-old mix of Afghani-Paki but have sampled dozens of her crosses. Earthy &amp; pungent until ground reveling layers of berries, citrus &amp; pine. Once consumed I felt relaxed and calm with a perfectly clear mind. This unique treasure is worthy of stashing away for special occasions, boasting or great conversation with connoisseurs.

VI loved reading on the history of this strain. And finding out that it is one of the strains that Spiritual Punk is derived from got me very interested in it. When it comes to relaxation, Mazar does not disappoint. It is smooth, slightly creeper and will relax you body beyond belief. Not an easy strain to find many times, but when you do, buy as much as you can. You will not regret it. Dense nugs, a wonderful aroma and burns very nice. I can&#39;t wait to find some Mazar seeds and grow this one myself. I want to see what this plant looks like in my grow room over time. Awesome Indica strain . . .

Vfirst time trying this, expected it to help with my back pain and anxiety, it helped with the anxiety but not so much for my back pain. usually when I smoke and fall asleep, I wake up feeling well rested. not the case with this strain. all in all it&#39;s ok, didn&#39;t take much either, and what I did feel was that it relaxed me, didn&#39;t make me so giggly, etc.
