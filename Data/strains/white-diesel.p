Vi&#39;m always looking for a good daytime strain and this seems to do the trick. it checked in at 22.%thc for a sativa. The previous reviews led me to believe this was a clear headed &quot;daytime work&quot; strain, and boy they are right, thanks guys! I believe this was $12 a G pre-tax $60 for 4G. For the price and the head which is totally &quot;daytime&quot; it&#39;s freakin great! Actually gives me a pep and makes me want to do stuff!. As for the scent it has a slightly pine/mint profile. My flowers did not have much if any of a diesel smell and the buds were small but nicely trik&#39;ed. In short friends it&#39;s all good with this one, enjoy!

VThis is a great strain. I highly recommend it, I&#39;ve smoked for 12 almost 13 years, and this is one of my tops. It has a strong smell, but not overbearing, you smell the diesel but get a hint of lemon as well. It has a sweet, earthy taste that&#39;s light. beautiful buds. Takes effect fairly quickly, mellow, and relaxing but with energy still to get things done. Decreases stress and opens up creativity and keeps you focused. Also allows for easier pain management.

VThe smell of this strain is what hits at first, since it is awfully pungeant and pervasive. The buds were not that dense but dried out rock-solid. Thricomes forms during tha last two weeks a frosty ice-cap (hence the name &quot;white&quot; diesel, I suppose). The taste is strong, spicy, and acid. The buzz hits real fast : you don&#39;t even have to wait for the third toke to known for sure that now, yes, you&#39;re in for good. Yet it feels more like a head high than a heavy body-stone, which underlines the mostly sativa influence. Unfortunately, duration of effect is not that long, and it makes you want to roll another joint right away. This weed is perfect for late-night friendly conversations in a veranda, with a bit of Kraftwerk or Belle and Sebastian.

Vfirst time trying this strain.. So far my thoughts on it is that, I really enjoy this strain. for me it has a nice mellow effect, definitely get a lil chatty. So I would recommend it for a social setting. No anxiety, which I know is a plus for some people.

VFantastico. The initial heavy diesel taste of this indica dominant strain is quickly overcome with floral tones of dried flowers and asian spices. A lovely high of mainly couch lock but still enough motivation to venture into the outside world.
