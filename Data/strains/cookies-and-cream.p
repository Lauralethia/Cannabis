VAnother cookies and cream review this time by Canna Organics. This strain is listed as a hybrid with a total THC of 25.57% \u000a\u000aI found the high to be happy, functional, and a bit talkative. I had a much better experience with this version of cookies and cream then I had from previous experiences.It&#39;s a good strain for walking around and talking or being social etc. \u000a\u000aFlavors I got were woody and honey.

VI told myself the first review I ever do will have to be the best strain I&#39;ve had so far...so here we are.\u000a\u000aPicked up a gram from Serra, here in Portland, OR. Grown by Pruf Cultivar.\u000a\u000aThis bud smelled delicious. Sweet, piney, with just a hint of citrus. Vaped, it tasted mild but sweet and a little earthy. Vapor was clean and smooth as hell. The high was one of the clearest headed indica leaning highs I&#39;ve ever had. Indica dominant hybrids can often take a toll on you but this was everything you want without it putting you out, making you overly hungry, or couch locking you. Srsly, this is a keeper. \u000a\u000aNow I know why the budtender mentioned this was her fav strain right now. I&#39;ll for sure be headed back for more.

VThis is definitely my favourite strain to date! Me and 4 others smoked this beauty and we kept us energetic and laughing for hours. Definitely less paranoia, anxiety, overthinking that&#39;s a potential negative with some strains but also depending on what kind of person you are. But none of these cons, nothing but good vibes. \u000a\u000aAlso smoked this while drinking few glasses of wine before going out and felt great going to a club on. Really very little drawbacks with this weed, couldn&#39;t wait to buy more of it

VSo let me say, I was extremely worried and paranoid about smoking medical marijuana. Living on the West Coast I decided to go on a limb and get my medical marijuna card. I had just been in Urgent Care, two weeks prior for horrific anxiety and ptsd. My doctor had prescribed me Xanax and short term I felt it was okay, but I had heard horroy stories about patients who had used Xanax long term and the terrible side effects of ever trying to get off the medication. While I was grateful for my doctos giving me the medication, I knew this was something I did not want to take long term. I have terrible PTSD, tremors, anxiety and paranoia. The budtender recommened me this strain after stating my condition to her. I can say nothing but good things about cookies and cream. A little goes a long way for first timers. But it gave me 0% anxiety. I felt 0 anxiety or paranoia whatsoever smoking this. It relaxes my muscles, my shoulders, my back, and just makes me feel more calm and level. I can 100% function, and go about my day, it just makes me feel like the tiny things in life dont matter, and it knocks ou my social anxiety. Great strain for first timers who have never smoked before. Great for patients looking to treat PTSD and Panic Disorder.

VTruly smells of cookies and cream. Buds are dense under a thick crystalized blanket. Once done coughing after your first toke, prepare for the burst of euphoria so reminiscent of this strain&#39;s parent, Girl Scout Cookies. My back pain melts away along with complete relief of nausea and headaches. This is one of my favorite strains to boast with strong indica traits inherited from her other parent, Starfighter.  My pain completely melts away while my mind&#39;s creativity boosts and puts me into a dream-like state as I&#39;m typing this review :)

VThis is probably my favourite strain all around. The smell is pungent and when it hits your nose, you know this is serious. Everything about this is typical of Indica: dense, kiefy nuggets with a rich aromatic flavour. This and Blackberry Kush are the most delicious strains for me. The effect is heavy, stony, and meditative. But it still has that bit of sativa pep to it so you can have a single hit and be active. That versatility is great: a quick toke before a hike, or a nice session before bed to put you into lala land. It is well worth the extra buck or two. Big love for Cookies and Cream.

VCookies and Cream! \u000a\u000aI picked this one up for cheap at my local dispensary and this particular strain was purchased at top notch quality. I keep hearing the hype of GSC and I knew this was made with that strain. \u000a\u000aIt smells pretty traditional and skunky. Maybe a bit on the lighter side. This flower was completely covered in &quot;sugar&quot; \u000a\u000aI took a rip and tasted sort of a sweet tobacco taste. I dont know that &quot;cookies&quot; would be accurate but definitely like this sweet almost pipe tobacco taste. The throat hit was so light that it was almost non-existent. That was a huge plus for me. \u000a\u000aEven though this particular flower was a nuclear bomb at 27.4 % at first it felt like nothing. This is definitely a creeper strain. It slowly crept up on me until I was definitely in the &quot; stoned &quot; category.\u000a\u000aI saw everything in green. Felt like a woman ( i&#39;m not ) and seriously pondered the meaning of life for awhile. Cookies and cream definitely put my high INSIDE my head instead of OUTSIDE like many other psychedelic strains do.  I felt very focused and I spent alot of time reflecting on things and myself. Trippy. \u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t be driving and I had a dry mouth , my eyes had this &quot;icy&quot; feel to them. \u000a\u000aMy energy level stayed moderate but that didn&#39;t mean I felt like going anywhere. \u000a\u000aCookies and cream is definitely a FUN strain. FUN .... not for everyday by a long shot. Very recreational and with interesting effect. \u000a\u000aThis would be great for folks just looking to have a good time ... not to heal their aches and pains, anxiety and sickness. This is the wrong strain for that. But to folks just looking to kick it for the evening and they know they don&#39;t have anything else going on ? \u000a\u000aTake a puff on Cookies and Cream ... Cause this one&#39;s for you. \u000a\u000a            - Pineapple Scott

VGreat strain. The name is a bit of a misnomer, in my opinion: it may sound like it&#39;s simple, but its flavor is quite complex. There&#39;s the definite cookies and cream taste you get, but it&#39;s also a bit floral-y, which I find to be delightful on exhale. But the real thing to note about Cookies and Cream is how incredibly horny I get after 30 minutes and some really good rips off my bong. If there&#39;s a strain that could be developed that would promise insane orgasms every time, one of its parents would have to be this stuff. Good ol&#39; GSC genetics. A definite try, especially if you want to feel like a literal sex god.

VI\u2019m really impressed with this strain! &#128525; I\u2019m smoking AGL\u2019s Hybridol F, the bud is densely coated with creamy looking crystals. It smokes very smoothly and I felt my mind quickly enveloped in calm and any negatively just melted away. While very calming and relaxing, it also kept me alert and focused, which is something I really like and am always looking for in strains I want to keep in regular rotation. I smoked this over a few hours and it never got to be too much, it\u2019s relaxing in the body as well without any couchlock. I noticed it brought and seemed to keep my heart rate down too\u2014 I didn\u2019t feel even a hint of anxiety with this strain. This is going to be a good strain to smoke in social settings for sure. I love these strains that just make you feel happy and witty and fun and this is one of them. \u000a\u000aI usually like to smoke a strain a few times before I review it but this one is such a standout and has everything I look for to medicate for PTSD. It may earn a spot with my current top favorites, Strawberry Cough and Blue Dream. Highly recommend this to both new and experienced users, especially for those with anxiety, depression, PTSD, or anyone who just craves a calming, focused relaxation. It\u2019s like an instant antidepressant and benzo in one bowl.

VIf you&#39;re planning on a night in watching funny shit until you fall asleep, this is your strain. C&amp;C packs a giggly, euphoric punch and a chill-ass body high that&#39;ll fuse you to whatever you&#39;re sitting/laying on. Just keep in mind that this is a nighttime strain - not something to indulge in when you still have things to get done. It knocks me out every time I smoke it.

VI like to think of this strain as two twin sisters. First, there\u2019s Cookies. She\u2019s happy, bubbly, and absolutely full of energy. She\u2019ll have you cracking jokes and skipping around and just having an overall jolly time. Then, there\u2019s Cream. More laid back than her sister, she\u2019ll mellow you out and bring on a calm sense of serenity. She tends to come on out once Cookies\u2019 energy has died down and always leads to a great way to end the night and put you in total relaxation mode, which can definitely help you fall asleep if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. Overall, the duo has a fantastic dynamic and you get the best of both worlds with this strain. On top of that, the smell is fantastic. Really sweet. And she hits so smooth. This has got to be my absolute favorite strain.

Definitely experienced a very sleepy couch lock as well. The main reason I gave this strain a three star rating is because I experienced &quot;the shakes&quot; and mild anxiety.

VCookies and Cream is great. It starts out with that nice floaty sensation and after a while dips you far enough into relaxation that sleeping is the only thing you want to do. Especially in something snugly and warm. \u000aThere is this in between period that makes you want to *eat everything in the house* that can be killer if you&#39;re trying to keep in shape.

VI can see clearly now. Just smoked a bowl of cookies and cream and I know there&#39;s no better way to start off my day. I feel relaxed and I hear the birds chirping. A little hungry but those cookies were rather filling ;) About to take one more bowl: I feel a clearer head now. The smoke was really smooth despite it being a small bong. I want to share this with my friends and the world. Remember to stay hydrated. The body high is substantial but not overwhelming. The head high is great and I simply enjoy life very much now! I recommend this to anyone who wants to relax or do small tasks like cooking or doing laundry.

VCookies and Cream is great. It starts out with that nice floaty sensation and after a while dips you far enough into relaxation that sleeping is the only thing you want to do. Especially in something snugly and warm. \u000aThere is this in between period that makes you want to *eat everything in the house* that can be killer if you&#39;re trying to keep in shape. Otherwise, it&#39;s a super tasty strain that really sets you up for a great night.

VI had a mixed experience with this strain. It gave me a good body high and  had a few good laughs. Extreme cotton-mouth; my mouth was drier than a nun&#39;s cunt. Definitely experienced a very sleepy couch lock as well. The main reason I gave this strain a three star rating is because I experienced &quot;the shakes&quot; and mild anxiety. I&#39;ve found that I am extremely prone to experiencing anxiety from any Sativa or Sativa-dominant hybrid though, so your experience may be better than mine if you like Sativa.

VMy new favorite strain so far! The earthy vanilla aroma is so delicious that I literally wanted to eat the nug! This is probably the smoothest strain I have ever smoked in a joint and the high..Oooowwwww... Very cerebral and uplifting. It has the indica effect too but not couch lock heavy feeling. Just the perfect balance of both.

VTried a strain called Double Stuffed which is a descendant of Cookies and Cream and Platinum Kush. Double Stuffed is a 70/30 indica dominant hybrid. I smoked maybe 1 gram in a joint before I was going to go to bed the nuggs were dense and had tons of crystals with a surprising amount of purple mixed in with the dark green. My mind was clear no anxiety or paranoia and just beginning to get tired, this strain lifted me up just enough to give me a smooth and pleasant head high and just bough indica to relax my body after the day, felt like my mind was clearer than it had felt in a while, allowed me to be very present but not overwhelmingly so. Mouth felt dry maybe 45 minutes after finishing.

It was so light, like it felt as if it was right there in my mouth.

VI smoked this in a one gram preroll. Currently halfway through, slow smoking it as a wake and bake. Very happy with the head high, I feel lifted and happy, mellow and up. Body high is a little weird with a jittery feeling. Smooth smoke, taste is clean. Highly recommend for stress relief, my troubles seem small and manageable and far away.

VDamn, this is some good shit! I like how it&#39;s 50/50 sativa and Indica and for me it depends on which environment I&#39;m in that shows which one was pronounced. However, you can feel both of them in waves back to back. I&#39;d put this up there with my favorite next to pineapple Express. It hit pretty quick 5-7 minutes (or less). And the flavor was really distinct and smooth. Makes u want to spend a shit to of money and energy on getting food. Makes your brain come alive but scattered. It&#39;s not impossible for me to get work done but a lot more destracted. I feel focused and distracted at the same time. I definitely want to go out and meet people but it would be good smoking with friends to start with. Dry mouth. Dry eyes? solid! How does one describe a high?

VI&#39;ve had this strain by multiple growers and for some reason it just doesn&#39;t agree with me. I&#39;m Reluctant to give it a bad review as it is loved by so many, but it has left my heart racing and my mind in a bad place on more than one occasion. \u000aTotal Cannabiniods around 30 to 36% depending on the grower etc. its not the strength that gets me as it is a relatively mid grade high that starts in a pretty nice place with the cerebral euphoria and happiness with energy and creativity. It generally ends with a tight chest and panic symptoms that present themselves nowhere else in everyday life. I&#39;m able to realize this is happening that it will pass and nothing terrible should happen less a heart issue due to being an experienced user, so warning to newer users or experienced ones that have bad reactions to specific strains.\u000a\u000aFlavor was sweet with a slight citrus

VAwesome hybrid. The terpenes of the 2 phenotypes i had were very creamy vanilla and creamsicles with the the typical cookies terps. The high started off as uplifting and slowly melted down the body to make me feel very relaxed and sleepy. . I find this only happens when you smoke a lot at a time. If you smoke a little, you still get that sativa feeling initially but feel more relaxed and less sleepy. It helps a lot with my chronic back pain. Overall one of my favorite strains. I\u2019ll keep it in my garden for a long time.

VDamn, this is some good shit! I like how it&#39;s 50/50 sativa and Indica and for me it depends on which environment I&#39;m in that shows which one was pronounced. However, you can feel both of them in waves back to back. I&#39;d put this up there with my favorite next to pineapple Express. It hit pretty quick 5-7 minutes (or less). And the flavor was really distinct and smooth. Makes u want to spend a shit to of money and energy on getting food. Makes your brain come alive but scattered. It&#39;s not impossible for me to get work done but a lot more destracted. I feel focused and distracted at the same time. I definitely want to go out and meet people but it would be good smoking with friends to start with. Dry mouth. Dry eyes? solid! How does one describe a high?

VTried a strain called Double Stuffed which is a descendant of Cookies and Cream and Platinum Kush. Double Stuffed is a 70/30 indica dominant hybrid. I smoked maybe 1 gram in a joint before I was going to go to bed the nuggs were dense and had tons of crystals with a surprising amount of purple mixed in with the dark green. My mind was clear no anxiety or paranoia and just beginning to get tired, this strain lifted me up just enough to give me a smooth and pleasant head high and just bough indica to relax my body after the day, felt like my mind was clearer than it had felt in a while, allowed me to be very present but not overwhelmingly so. Mouth felt dry maybe 45 minutes after finishing.

VShe got her Cookie and my Cream, this strain high-tens senses and was a total aphrodisiac&#128069;\u264b!  Top 10 tasting strains, was also very LOUD!  From my Pax 2 this flower tasted like what I imagine a chipped off piece of a white zinfandel wine barrel and og kush soaked in vanilla extract would taste like if vaped.  The high was complex, made the mind race, not in a introspective over think and over analyze way but in a child like MUST Seek FUN! Way.  The legs on this strain were slightly tired, as a re-up was needed after 45 minutes, keep this in mind when vaping.  When smoked the effects lasted twice as long but the woody taste was lost and only a slight vanilla OG taste came through the bong.

VGrown by GLeaf in Maryland it says it tested at 32.31% THC. My tolerance is up and kind of in need of a break but even still I was able to get a very nice buzz on 2 small bowls of this. Nice mellow feeling. Not particularly heady or body leaning, just balanced and mellow at this dosage. \u000a\u000aAs for GLeaf&#39;s part of it, very well done guys. Sugary, sticky, great smell...nothing less than the best I have seen and smoked as an MMJ patient in MD. Take a bow all at GLeaf.  Very well done.

It did, however, have an extreme effect on me after one bowl full. It made me extremely sleepy and I fell asleep almost as soon as my head hit the pillow! Highly recommend if you have trouble sleeping or staying asleep. 7:30p to 9:00a was a good chunk of sleep for me and I woke up feeling energized and recharged take on my new day!

VMy feelings could go either way with this strain.  There is not much to it honestly in regards to substance.  The buds are average reminding me a lot of beasters with same uniform shape of a little turd.  One thing to note in a positive regard is that the flower is perfect for rolling joints.  Nuggets being that perfect middle ground between fluffy and super dense that crumble between your fingers like flour.  This is a lifesaver for me with this strain because my preference is to mix C&amp;C with other fruity or unique tasting.  For example some Root Beer Float bud or Northern Berry which I experimented with both with fabulous results. \u000a\u000aSmoking a spliff combo while typing of Marionberry Kush X Cookies &amp; Cream  and tastes like those little cookies with fruit in middle all jelly like Grandma used to have.  Which does leave me with the opinion the taste closely resembles the namesake although a bit oreo, but a super flat landing.  It could sawdust my tastebuds say or that yummy ice cream flavor I love.  Think I&#39;ll go with the latter on this one, but the flavor is more of a vibe that goes with this strains name.\u000a\u000aFinally, the buzz, because lets face it weed with tasty terps is the bomb and the way I shop these days, but.....  but really if it was the only cannabis available yet tasted like dog shit (which I cannot really say because I love Dog Shit Cherry Pie and Dog Shit for that matter so so much =) anyway back track....and tasted like alligator jizz most of us stoners would still smoke it for the buzz.  And this strain never really got me there unless mixing it with other weeds.  Not more potent strains more like awesome flavor combos really brought this simple dessert coined wallflower weed to life.

VMy dispensary has been running very low on Indica concentrates so I started to explore some hybrids and I found this. I smoke shatter and wax throughout the day. My tolerance by this time is pretty high. Anyways medically this strain is helpful with my muscle relaxation issues and also anxiety and depression. I&#39;m not much into taste profiles as I am more interested in this as a medication. But it does have a nice taste. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m using a crumble. I&#39;ve smoked about 2 grams of the concentrate over the past few weeks. It&#39;s a Indica leaning with not too much getting stuck in the couch. I&#39;ve used this getting physical labor done around the house without any adverse effects. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m a big fan of Star Killer for relief of anxiety as well as giving a general positive mental feeling. So this strain is great for me.\u000a\u000a

VThe dispensary had this batch marked at 31.5% so I took it slowly as I am easily overwhelmed. Jar smell  is sweet kush and vanilla. The taste is all that you&#39;d expect from a cookies strain. Upon exhale all I could think is that this is how pot should taste. The initial high was happy and euphoric. The comedown was more relaxed and at a higher dose I didn&#39;t want to leave the couch. For me it&#39;s a very functional clear headed strain with lots of happiness which I enjoy. Good for anytime of the day but best left for nighttime if you plan on smoking a lot.

VPungent and sweet indica that hits you like a bullet train, this strain literally coats my fingers in kief when I shred a nug by hand for a bowl. definitely one that is meant for chronic pain, insomnia, or a day where Netflix and a blanket for 8 hours calls your name. Places I&#39;ve come across this strain are pretty high in the price range, even medical dispensaries matching prices to a recreational one; but this bud is absolutely worth the money, hands down a new top 5.

And I have to tell you the first hit I took was pretty potent, and it was only the seventies percentile wise. it gave me a very relaxed euphoric dreamy sort of had stayed High while totally relaxing my body at the same time. And the flavor was outstandingly smooth I definitely tasted the sweetness and it of the cookies and cream and the fact that Green Collar cannabis in Tacoma Washington keeps bringing out new All Star level strains and top-shelf quality dabs, it just makes the future even more exciting for this dab afficianado.

Vone of the best strains I have come across in 20+ years..potent..the smell is heavenly..I compare it to smelling a vanilla candle..coated in sugary crystals...my dispensary has this on its shelf almost regularly and feel lucky that it is available to me...if you come across this, I highly recommend!!

VOne of my all time favorite flavors- smooth, creamy almost stout like finish. Very sweet- subtle relaxing effects creep about within the first five minutes. You&#39;ll feel your muscles begin to relax and posture sag a wee bit. Put a smile on my face and a glaze over my eyes.

VI always over due it on cookies &amp; cream. Like a fat kid and ice cream. Strong nutty and vanilla inhale and sweet exhale. Nugs are super dense and coated with trichromes. Little does the trick, but trust me you&#39;ll over indulge into a couch locked state of relaxation.

VEasily can be in the top 5 best tasting strains ever. The effects are something like a mix of headband and bubba kush, a solid hybrid. If you can get this in wax form (like I did) definitely get it, the taste is awesome.

VI picked up this strain because I usually prefer sativa dominant hybrids and it was available as a preroll at my local shop. I have severe anxiety and migraines and need strains that manage that but leave me clear headed and focused so I can be functional. Maybe I got a bad batch but it didn&#39;t taste like the description here at all. It tasted sharper than the description would imply. I&#39;ve been smoking it for three days and it has been really hard to focus and I&#39;ve found myself feeling brain foggy quite a bit more than I&#39;d like. I&#39;ve literally started and stopped this review multiple times for example. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be picking this up again, it&#39;s clearly not for me.
