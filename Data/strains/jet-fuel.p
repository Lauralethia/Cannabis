VI&#39;m a medical marijuana patient treating fibromyalgia G6 is only the second strain I tried. I&#39;m so glad that it was recommended to me. I vaped early in the day and slowly I started to feel so much more relaxed and in less pain than I had been been in a long time. It also got rid of some nausea that had been bothering me. If you are on opiates and looking for pain relief definitely try this strain.

VAmazing uplifting sativa dominant hybrid with lots of energy and focus yet a complete body almost numbness.  Great flavor profile can taste the diesel and pine and kush distinctly.  Bud sites can be pulled apart into smaller flowers very kush like (great for bowls and grinders) not 100% hardball has some fluff to it.  Red hairs with light &amp; dark green color profile.

VThe hardest hitting strain I&#39;ve had this year it is a top-notch fullbore kick in the teeth.  If you need help relaxing sleeping or just taking the edge off this might be just a little more than you need but guaranteed it does work.  I used my Simba grinder and my vapor tower.  Standard scoop size is approximately one quarter gram.  Effects are not immediate but long-lasting.  It creeps in over the course of a half an hour not much longer after that all your troubles will have been forgotten.   This selection from Dr. Green thumb in orange county California was produced by someone who truly knew and loved what they do.  I can feel the connections being disconected from my brain one at a time about 30 min after consumption.

VFor THC purposes, it doesn&#39;t get much better than this strain. The collective labeled it 31-33% THC (I can&#39;t remember precisely)\u2026I didn&#39;t believe them until I got home and lifted off. This is definitely a strain for Indica lovers, as it lacks the tingly euphoria of a strong Sativa or good hybrid. It&#39;ll also make you very sleepy and hungry. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the taste and smell of the Diesiel family, but Jet Fuel is surprisingly delicious! It&#39;s very sweet.

VFirst off, the smell. This stuff is literally like walking around with a glass full of kerosine in your hand. Be prepared, the smell is going to linger for a while wherever you walk with it. I picked up an eighth of this at Livwell in Colorado, and it was a 50/50 hybrid sitting at 26% THC. I can honestly say that I was not prepared for how good the high was going to be. It was a perfect mix of a relaxing head high and absolute pain relief. This stuff put a genuine smile on my face, and it is amazing with a movie or music. I was more than content to lay around watching Netflix, but I feel confident that I would have no issue with social situations as well. If you are lucky enough to come across this strain, buy as much as you can. Cheers!

VI&#39;m just not a sativa lover, it is strong though. Would recommend for just hanging out and watching a movie with it. I got sleepy after the racey sativa effects wore off. A bit paranoid/jittery for a bit after smoke. Mind wandered and I was pretty spaced out. Wasn&#39;t a big fan, kind of got me down and didn&#39;t want to go out because of a bit of paranoia/anxiety.

After smoking it, the smoke itself can be a little bit harsh, but the exhale is extremely smooth and sweet, making it all worth it. It hits you first behind the eyes, and then it&#39;s all tickles and joy from there. Pretty high energy, I was vibing pretty hard to Chance the Rapper. Very nice bud. NOT for beginners!

VI take this for medical reasons. I tried it a few times now and figured it be a good time to review it now. \u000a\u000aI take mine as an EDIBLE from the medical dispensary. \u000a\u000aAfter eating it, it usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour to kick in.  I start feeling energetic and loosened up a bit.  I can feel the pain slowly fading away. \u000a\u000aI am more motivated and want to do stuff. \u000a\u000a I don&#39;t get the indica high at first. Sativa high for about the first 2 hours of so, then you level off and then it is the indica high for many hours! \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t feel when it goes from sativa to the indica high. It just happens and trust me, I know when the indica kicks in. \u000a\u000a My motivation goes away and  I just want to relax. \u000a\u000aIt is the first time I personally experienced this type of strain. Going from sativa high to a long lasting indica high.  \u000a\u000aSo, heads up this might not be for everyone. \u000a\u000aThe indica high last many hours afterwards.  \u000a\u000aMy pain and anxiety are gone, pretty much 45 min after eating it. And lasts the whole ride.  Approx. 6-7 hours.  Yeah, no joke, that long! I enjoy this strain for my medical issues. \u000a\u000aLike I said I take the edible version from my medical dispensary.  \u000aSo, my ride will be different from everyone elses ride. \u000a\u000aI would definitely recommend this strain.  It has helped with my pain, anxiety, appetite, etc... \u000a\u000aSide effects were: Sativa, Just dry mouth and eyes.  Indica, dry mouth, dry eyes, tingly feeling all over the body (helps pain), and a euphoric feeling. \u000a\u000aPros: Motivation, pain relief, anxiety relief, euphoric, artistic (It brung out some creativity I didn&#39;t know I could do)

VI take this for medical reasons. I tried it a few times now and figured it be a good time to review it now. \u000a\u000aI take mine as an EDIBLE from the medical dispensary. \u000a\u000aAfter eating it, it usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour to kick in.  I start feeling energetic and loosened up a bit.  I can feel the pain slowly fading away. \u000a\u000aI am more motivated and want to do stuff. \u000a\u000a I don&#39;t get the indica high at first. Sativa high for about the first 2 hours of so, then you level off and then it is the indica high for many hours! \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t feel when it goes from sativa to the indica high. It just happens and trust me, I know when the indica kicks in. \u000a\u000a My motivation goes away and  I just want to relax. \u000a\u000aIt is the first time I personally experienced this type of strain. Going from sativa high to a long lasting indica high.  \u000a\u000aSo, heads up this might not be for everyone. \u000a\u000aThe indica high last many hours afterwards.  \u000a\u000aMy pain and anxiety are gone, pretty much 45 min after eating it. And lasts the whole ride.  Approx. 6-7 hours.  Yeah, no joke, that long! I enjoy this strain for my medical issues. \u000a\u000aLike I said I take the edible version from my medical dispensary.  \u000aSo, my ride will be different from everyone elses ride. \u000a\u000aI would definitely recommend this strain.  It has helped with my pain, anxiety, appetite, etc... \u000a\u000aSide effects were: Sativa, Just dry mouth and eyes.  Indica, dry mouth, dry eyes, tingly feeling all over the body (helps pain), and a euphoric feeling. \u000a\u000aPros: Motivation, pain relief, anxiety relief, euphoric, artistic (It brung out some creativity I didn&#39;t know I could do)

My wife kept asking me what was wrong, I felt ok, not happy or sad, just ok. It did make me pretty dizzy and it gave me horrible dry mouth. Sex is great on it, it makes you last quite a bit longer &#128513; I&#39;d say it was an average strain for me, probably won&#39;t add it to my favorites list, but it was worth a try. \u000aBE A GOOD PERSON \u000a

VJet Fuel, a sativa lover&#39;s dream. The diesel sweetness in this strain give a smell &amp; taste that agrees with the taste buds of most stoners. And a high that is, as I said, a sativa lover&#39;s dream. Although a hybrid, Jet Fuel gives a.skyrocketing happy high with a fatigue fighting kick in the pants!

VThe diesel all-star, a must have for any true diesel lover. This strain packs a heady punch with its instant mood lift and relaxing effect. The smoke was thick and flavorful with a strong, sweet fuel taste that lingered on the pallet for hours. Even with heavy doses, the secondary narcotic effect that was present to some degree at the beginning of the high, never manages to become too overpowering, thus making day time activities still possible and more enjoyable.

VSour Diesel was my favorite strain for a long long time, now its Jet Fuel. Gassy energizing and super potent hybrid with a body buzz that starts in the head and then relaxes my muscles over time.

VI had been quietly suffering with Gout for about 5 years. I refused to be put on a life long regiment of anti inflammatory and pain killing medications. so i changed my diet...lost some weight and took back my body. But the gout fought back...i was still winning. Then came Psoriatic Arthritis. I had to find help. Jet fuel was the help i needed. For me it has a very powerful equal head and body high. It is very balanced. The head high has great clarity. No foggy haze. It is very focused and energetic. Its peaceful and uplifting. Allows me to take on any task and stay with it for hours with great productivity. While my  pains are diminished to a level of comfortable manageability. My whole body is calm and functional.

VFor this one being a 28.5%THC bomb, it&#39;s a real light hitter...\u000a\u000aThe diesel and piny SFVog smell comes through when smelling these crytal covered nugz. A bunch of tight little buds with small calyx and small lil fox tail off shoots. Not many hairs, but a lot of trichomes dusted all over.\u000aThe smoke is very light and piny...Very nice and relaxing stone.\u000aNot the best flavor, but not bad...

VPungent! If you&#39;re gonna be out in public, be prepared to get looks; this flower is staaanky. Very sticky, crystals bountiful. Very much an immediate head high that travels tingles down your back and shoulders ~30 minutes in and dissipates to a smooth hazy buzz. Energizes or relaxes with you, super versatile. Rated a 4 only because the smell and taste, while starting off as a lemon/lime citrus scent mixed with earthy flavors, became almost too strongly diesel after a while (in the opinion of a diesel lover). But I guess I shouldn&#39;t complain because it is called jet fuel, after all.

VI smoked this and it gave me a horrible panic attack. I literally thought I was going to die. I thought maybe it was because it was just really strong (I barely smoked what I usually do so I thought it was odd) so I smoked almost nothing a second time to see if I would react better and I had the same thing happen.  I don&#39;t know exactly why, everyone I&#39;ve talked to about this strain said it&#39;s great but it wasn&#39;t for me. Just a precaution for anyone with hella anxiety.

VI had been quietly suffering with Gout for about 5 years. I refused to be put on a life long regiment of anti inflammatory and pain killing medications. so i changed my diet...lost some weight and took back my body. But the gout fought back...i was still winning. Then came Psoriatic Arthritis. I had to find help. Jet fuel was the help i needed. For me it has a very powerful equal head and body high. It is very balanced. The head high has great clarity. No foggy haze. It is very focused and energetic. Its peaceful and uplifting. Allows me to take on any task and stay with it for hours with great productivity. While my  pains are diminished to a level of comfortable manageability. My whole body is calm and functional. Awesome!!!

VThe diesel all-star, a must have for any true diesel lover. This strain packs a heady punch with its instant mood lift and relaxing effect. The smoke was thick and flavorful with a strong, sweet fuel taste that lingered on the pallet for hours. Even with heavy doses, the secondary narcotic effect that was present to some degree at the beginning of the high, never manages to become too overpowering, thus making day time activities still possible and more enjoyable.

VIf you&#39;re one for concentrates, Ataraxia&#39;s G6 (aka Jet Fuel) Sunrock Shatter is a fantastic midday selection. The translucent yellow shatter is rock-stable even in your hands but still delectably terpy, adding up to a fairly smooth yet throat-tickling toke with incomparably tart &amp; juicy mango/peach/passion fruit flavor. Major munchies typically ensue in my experience, particularly for sweet carbs and umami proteins, but once the cravings are satisfied, G6&#39;s broadly distributed energy and soaring, happy high can help make light work of intrinsically-motivated tasks or get you pumped for some cardio exercise. The only thing detracting from a perfect 5 score to this dependable dab&#39;s credit is the relatively short peak that tails off into a lazier, low-altitude cruise.

VPungent! If you&#39;re gonna be out in public, be prepared to get looks; this flower is staaanky. Very sticky, crystals bountiful. Very much an immediate head high that travels tingles down your back and shoulders ~30 minutes in and dissipates to a smooth hazy buzz. Energizes or relaxes with you, super versatile. Rated a 4 only because the smell and taste, while starting off as a lemon/lime citrus scent mixed with earthy flavors, became almost too strongly diesel after a while (in the opinion of a diesel lover). But I guess I shouldn&#39;t complain because it is called jet fuel, after all.

VThe first word that comes to mind when I tried jet fuel was &quot;balance&quot;. This strain so perfectly blends the relaxed, low anxiety feeling with a focused, creative, and social buzz. \u000a\u000aThe taste is nothing short of fantastic. On the immediate exhale and minutes after, you are left with pleasant lingering sweetness covering most of the tongue. \u000a\u000aThis strain is the gift that keeps on giving.

VSour Diesel was my favorite strain for a long long time, now its Jet Fuel. Gassy energizing and super potent hybrid with a body buzz that starts in the head and then relaxes my muscles over time. Jet Fuel OG, the Indica phenotype, same taste and smell but much stonier and still cerebral but not energizing. Both are must tries for anyone that likes gassy strains.

I have anxiety and decided to smoke it, definitely felt heightened anxiety, but it did end up fading into an enjoyable high within some time. I still wouldn&#39;t choose this if you have anxiety though. Those first minutes will not help and will likely put you off. If you don&#39;t have anxiety, then I say go for it!

VThis strain has beautiful huge nugs that are olive green and is very sticky. It has a wonderful pungent smell, diesel and pine. The first puff was a little harsh but the second very nice. This gives me a nice cerebral high. Very nice space, not buzzy or racy, relaxed my aches and pains. Much better strain for me than GSC. No brain lock and body lock. Nice morning strain.

VDuring a recent trip to amsterdam i was excited to try out the notorious sour diesel strain to my inital disappointment the Grey area coffeeshop had sold out of this popular delicacy and i was referred to try Jetfuel with a guaranteed sativa high I was searching for. \u000a\u000aI was given 2 grams of the densest and most potent bud i had ever laid my hands on. The high was amazing, i was energetic and buzzing around amsterdam that entire day and would happily recommend to many. I would not describe myself as an avid smoker although after splitting the 2 grams into a couple of king rolled joints and happily crusing through them, the high wasn&#39;t overbearing nor too much.

VFlavor: This strain has an abundance of lemonene the terpene is so prevalent Jet Fuel leaves an aftertaste similar to putting the contents of a box of lemon heads in your mouth at the same time more than likely derived from the debated Lemon Thai Heritage coupled with the faint taste of lemonene which is present in East Coast Diesel\u000a\u000aHigh: Jet Fuel... need I say more... might as well...

VI see what the buzz is about but may be a little overrated, in my opinion.  Here&#39;s my take...  &quot;G6&quot; is a Sativa dominant hybrid.  I know there are different brands out there and this one is a &quot;Gold Leaf&quot; product.  Here are the numbers: 0.60 THC, 1.18 CBDA, 27.92 THCA, Total = 29.70.  When handling this bud, the aroma diffuses noticeably into the air.  To untrained noses it is skunky, but up close smells like animal waste in the woods. \u000aLighting up, the taste is unpleasant and bitter.  The effects creep for twenty minutes... Gotta love that.  The first leg up after about ten minutes, then another level before peak, starting with rapid heart, energy and head, as solid body stone fades in.  Activities are fun, creative or physical but do not operate heavy machinery.  Effects are fairly lasting, about two hours before fading.  No hangover and finishes cleanly but not as clean as Golden Goat, whose numbers are lower, or Wild Thai whose numbers are higher, and both of which I prefer.  Jet Fuel is strong bud but by comparison, must take points off for taste, flavor, smokability, quality of high and finish.  4.2/5.0. Dynamite on my scale but not Moby Tripper weed.
