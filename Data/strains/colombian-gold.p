Vi have had the real deal in the late 70&#39;s living in fla. no, it looks, tastes, smells, and acts differently today, than the real deal. i dont think todays cg is fake, i think its attributes are changed because of indoor grows, advanced nutes, and the cure. \u000awe cannot replicate what nature and old time farmers produced. and the original, had zero skunk smell to it. so if yours smells skunky, maybe it is fake? or maybe it lies in the way the ol timers processed the original? but ya...it was all sorts of honey and brown colors...  never green. either way, it was great then and now, but not the same. melts pain n that is why i say, thumbs up.

VSmall airy buds with long red hairs and yellowish golden trichomes; when ground, it is very light. Had the most stereotypical weed smell I&#39;ve ever smelt: wet hey, chopped wood, a barn, a skunk, lemon, etc. It tastes like it smells, both very good. \u000aIt hit with immediate focus, and two hits made me stair at the wall. Grateful Dead never sounded so good. Fantastic recreational cannabis; great for music, dancing, going to the park, swimming etc. \u000aNot extremely potent and highly functional, yet one or two hits will definitely make you feel happy and high. Its a weed that will get you high with a little, but if you want to keep smoking you can with out much adverse effects. \u000aFantastic marijuana strain and I would highly recommend.

VI smoked this strain all the time back in my hometown of Medellin. I would go to barrio Antioquia, not the nicest neighborhood but they had everything there. All you had to do was walk up to do&#241;a &lt;name withheld&gt;&#39;s house, knock and her hot daughter would bring out the stash for you to pick your poison.. Did I mention she was hot?? Kinda looked like Zoe Saldana.. Anyways, I miss my hometown, the homies, the hot chicks and of course the &#39;Colombian Gold&#39;! \u000a

VGreat strain! I remember the first time I smoked Colombian Gold kush, it was really gold and had powerfull mind effect. Me and my girlfriend stayed  chilli in the bed but at the same time experiencing a mind trip. we got something like telepathy, the things I was thinking about she was too just like me. It has an unique flavour, something like tropical tutti frutti flavour, cant describe better. It&#39;s Quite different from other strains I have been tried.

VOld toker has stated the case correctly. Old school &#39;lumbo did NOT have piney notes. It had a ultra pungent sweetness that is difficult to describe but once you&#39;ve smoked it you never forget. And it did go down smoothly but then &#39;expand&#39; in your lungs and almost always make you cough. It was also full of spotted seeds. Seediest weed ever. But it was sublime...the high was indeed almost psychedelic. You could not do anything but stay in one place and observe the visuals and laugh for at least an hour. Then a trip to the ice cream parlor was in order, at which you would absolutely worship a well-made banana split. Then a nap was necessary. It was hypno -couch weed if there ever was. I would love to be able to find it again. All the gorgeous sinse I have seen over the years....all that skunk and all the pine; none of it has come close to that old school seedy columbian gold.

VHaven&#39;t seen any gold ever since the guy got busted in San Franco .  Cleaning the seeds was the only pain, God in was the sweetest tasting weed too. \u000a     The next ten years a steady supply of the first skunk came in. Haven&#39;t had any kind of Skunk cross  that comes close to the originally Skunk smell, taste , and most of all the high.\u000a     I&#39;ve been smoking for 45years, and seems that the growers are tying to grow pretty buds plants. I now buy from a dispensary since I received a MM card.\u000a     I smoked, flowers, hash, oil, and keef, and I&#39;m still waiting to caught a good buzz!!!!!

VHad to grow this classic old school strain that we all smoked and smoked and smoked way back in the day. I grew 2 phenotypes one was shorter with wide fan leaves and the other tall and lanky. They started having problems with pm so they were harvested at 8 weeks. The bud was literally gold, a nice citrus fruity smell. A harsh hit, made me think yep, this is the junk, lol but it was a creeper, ended up totally baked and it is EXCELLENT for body pain, maybe the best from all of my strains. The downsides for me was the major munchies ( not cool at age 50 and up) and the problems in grow- otherwise this would be a staple on my menu.

VI&#39;m a heavy smoker, found this strain from a dispensary that I knew other strains they had were always very nice specimens. So I wanted to try it out.\u000a\u000ai was born in &#39;80 so I missed the classic era strains, such as this one, and don&#39;t know what to compare it to, or if its even close. I&#39;m hoping I got a fairly true sample, maybe some who got the real deal back in the day could thumb up this if what i describe sounds right.\u000a\u000aThe buds were very compact, but still airy. Not very sappy but just covered with golden trichomes. When you break it down it looks very goldish brown.\u000a\u000aThr scent took me a minuite, several sniffs (like i needed an excuse to smell weed) Very very sweet arome. Not a hint of skunk, sour, or diesel notes; in fact about as opposite as you could get. I picked up like a jasmine blossom, or lemom lime, but not from actual fruit but like how the trees smell when they get their blossoms. Also like a very slight one hard to pinpoint... kinda like sandlewood or oak? I don&#39;t know, but this one smells sweeter that and lemon haze, tangie, or orange tree types. Very unique.\u000a\u000aNow the good part. The high was almost instand in the head. Took about 6 hits on a raw cone (wick lit). 1st 4 were smooth, last two cough attack, but short lived. Very calming, relaxing high. Still very productive, lots of good thoughts and creativity. Stress melter, bad mood killer, and single dad saver.

It was the real deal import.\u000a\u000aPuts todays dopey dope to shame.\u000aThat stuff practically gave me super powers.\u000a\u000aIt had the taste of hash and explosive expansion like Oldtoker60 said.

Vreally fun strain. for a sativa, it was actually a pretty good body high. I was really sensitive and interested in temperatures, like the hot shower felt really good and it&#39;s cold air conditioning felt really good. I got kind of anxiously curious about the expansiveness of human Origins and diversity. Really focused in on it, but a little like worked up and concerned about it. Overall french fries we&#39;re good, could have done for some M &amp; M&#39;s. was really sensitive to touch and feel on the skin overall. Felt sort of aroused and cuddly.

VI was just checking to see if it was real because I also tried it back in the 70&#39;s and I can&#39;t find it today. From what I can remember ( and that should tell you alot) It was the baddest shit I ever had. I was told it was the dirt from the volcanoes of columbia that did it. So if anyone can do that stuff again has a fortune waiting for them. I remember black seeds in bright gold buds , after that it all got hazy in a good way.

VI smoked this back in the 70&#39;s. It tasted just like the Moroccan/Lebanese pressed hash of the day and greatly expanded in your lungs often making you cough. It was a golden color with some seeds and slightly crushed due to the fact that weed was typically formed into bricks for smuggling in those days. Skunk may have been hybridized from  CG but \u000a CG never smelled like skunk and skunk never tasted like hash. I am skeptical about any modern strains claiming to be CG because I am sure many of the characteristics of CG like flavor and appearance was due to the fact it was compressed into bricks.

VI totally agree with oldtoker60, his is the only review that was spot on. Tastes like blonde Lebanese hash and would expand so much. Just a few hits and you were stoned for a good four hours. I lived in Florida then back on the day (70&#39;s) and we rarely got the real gold. The stuff we got had tight slender buds that were truly gold in color. Amazing stuff. The only thing that was even close was Panama lredand it was no way near the buzz. The five star rating is for the original.
