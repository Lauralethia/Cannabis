VBuds dense over 8-9 weeks, leaving a moist resinous product to cure beautifully. Nugs are dark green, with an array of crystals and assortment of orange hairs. The smell is sweet, but has an overall fruity skunk aroma. Taste is one to match, or closely resemble and trich&#39;s hold onto buds very well! \u000aHigh is very 50/50, with a mid-range creep over the body, to the shoulders and head evenly and one to keep active throughout the day. More, mentally active than physically, but don&#39;t rule out getting stuff done. It&#39;s all in the eye of the beholder with &#39;Sweet Tooth&#39; \u000a4.5 / 5

VGot some high quality Sweet Tooth this week to try it out; very good strain for parties/groups of friends. It made me very happy, talkative, and creative. We were all laughing non-stop about all the funny things we were coming up with. The smoke wasn&#39;t too harsh and I don&#39;t recall any sort of taste to it, which is fine by me.  All my stresses where gone for the two hours or so while I was medicated. Make sure you have some soda or whatever to sip on, it gives you cottonmouth pretty bad, but other than that it&#39;s an excellent strain! Definitely going to get again.

VThis strain, tastes like a little pungent in the earth and wood for me, a flowery, sweet taste, but not like butter at all; not one of the taste to describe. Flowery buttery taste comes from more of the rare Vintage Diesel Indica. Now that tastes like butter and super Rose/ Lavender taste, if you have had Vanilla Kush you can taste the Lavender almost the same smell/ taste. Except at the end note it&#39;s a light sour not eww really sour just a hint of it. Sweet Tooth makes me really motivated and hungry it&#39;s perfect if you have depression + Mood disorders or Pain + Headaches Or Even Asthma + Anorexia, ADHD Anxiety this will help you. I have all three combinations and its hard for me to eat webbing in my throat causes my Esophagus should be 4x times as big as half a dime for food and theres not suppose to be webbing. So yea really lifts you to a higher plane. First time trying this and all I can say is wow!

VFirst time smoking Sweet Tooth and it&#39;s unlike any bud I&#39;ve ever smoked. A perfect blend of body stone and head high. The effects definitely creep up on you. One hit didn&#39;t seem to do anything but I wanted to be sure so I waited and oh baby did it hit me later. Very effective medicine for nausea and gastrointestinal problems. However, not one to use if you need to get up and about, as the couch lock is second to none. A deep &quot;introspective&quot; strain, as I found myself often lost in thinking about my life and family and girlfriend. Not a strain to smoke at parties, all the guests will be sitting around the bong completely silent. Overall an amazing blend of the two hybrids, providing a &#39;complete package&#39; stone.

All the stress in the world melted away and I couldn&#39;t of been happier, not to mention i had a LOT of laughing fits while high off this strain.

VI ain&#39;t trying to hate on no herb; you feel me? But I didn&#39;t get the results that a lot of people done had with this strain. Yeah, the shit got me high, but I was tryin  to get up on that Winchell&#39;s doughnuts straight out the oven sweetie pie in my damn mouth experience, nah&#39;mean? I smoked me up some Sweet Tooth like on a Friday - Nothin. Then I did it again on Saturday - Nothin. Again, don&#39;t get me wrong, the shit got me faded, son. But the high wasn&#39;t even all that. I was tryin to get faded, son. It&#39;s like when you go get yo expensive ass coffe and it&#39;s supposed to be one of those mocha vanilla pecan Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Willy Wonka ass blends supposed to make a brother wig blow back and you like,&quot;Fool, this black coffe with some syrup in it and some gat damn froth.&quot; I&#39;m gonna give the remainder of my Sweet Tooth to my gramma and maybe she can taste the intended sweetness with her old ass.

VSmoking out of a backwoods right now and the effects are really intensified. First few hits are very heady and body stimulating and goes on to be a euphoric trip the rest of the way through. Was in a bad mood but now my thoughts are uplifted and I have to say I&#39;m not too hungry right now but it sets in later. The sativa dominant effects are pleasing and it&#39;s indica properties ease you into a relaxing body high.

VLong story short, I was hospitalized for a couple weeks and wasn\u2019t allowed to eat or drink anything (I was fed via IV instead. It\u2019s as awful as it sounds). After i was discharged,  i didn\u2019t really have much of an appetite, and when i did, I couldn\u2019t finish my food. I could barely eat a pudding cup before getting full. Well, after 2 weeks of getting fed via IV, i was ready to fucking eat. \u000a\u000athis strain gave me the most intense munchies I\u2019ve ever experienced. I\u2019ve never eaten so much food in my whole life. I probably ate enough to feed a family of four. I ate everything in sight. since then my appetite is mostly back to normal, but I still like to smoke this before dinner so I can finish it. \u000a\u000aThe high isn\u2019t bad either &amp; it tastes delicious. Definitely made me feel relaxed but also very focused. I love playing video games while smoking this. \u000a\u000aBut yeah if you have issues with lack of appetite &amp; all that jazz, this strain will actually make you eat everything.

Vpretty good indica strain, had some low t people smoke some and they passed out lol. For those high tolerance users like me, its your classic &quot;i aint doing nothin today&quot; strain. Takes away pain and gives you a happy high,Smells amazing and looks really good with a decent ammount of crystals and nice orange hairs, The taste is one of the best buds i tried its really flavorful and over powers the taste of tobacco in blunts, The nugs are 8/10 on the dense scale lol. Only con i have is after smoking alot i get a minor headache but other than that great strain .

VI dabbed on some sweet tooth just a minute ago; and some earlier on and I must say!!!! Sweet and beyond satisfying :D . This high started off light in the body and slowly had a head high creep up that I must say was just all and all a nice experience. Perfect for helping with any issues listed in medical in the full report. Hope this has helped someone decide whether or not its was a good choice for them. Found it to feel uplifting though so this be 1 indica Don EL1T3 does not suggest to catch them z&#39;s...

VAMAZING strain! Picked some of this up from a local dispensary this morning, and ended up going back an hour later to stock up before they ran out! Had this recommended to me as a sativa-dominant hybrid... Sativas are not my strong suit, tending to make me extremely paranoid and chatty. This strain wiped away all anxiety, without the &quot;overmedicated&quot; feeling, giving music an amazing sound and a very focused buzz. A great way to start the day, for me at least!

Just tried it for the first time yesterday and i will definitely be trying this strain again.

The smell matched the taste perfect and while smoking, it was so smooth and tasty. The effect of this strain put me in a nice relaxing yet full of energy and happiness type of mood. It released all my pain, anger, and stress. I worked well and was very productive after smoking this strain. All together Sweet Tooth is a great strain if you are looking to be relaxed but at the same time productive.

VI dabbed on some sweet tooth just a minute ago; and some earlier on and I must say!!!! Sweet and beyond satisfying :D . This high started off light in the body and slowly had a head high creep up that I must say was just all and all a nice experience. Perfect for helping with any issues listed in medical in the full report. Hope this has helped someone decide whether or not its was a good choice for them. Found it to feel uplifting though so this be 1 indica Don EL1T3 does not suggest to catch them z&#39;s...

Vpretty good indica strain, had some low t people smoke some and they passed out lol. For those high tolerance users like me, its your classic &quot;i aint doing nothin today&quot; strain. Takes away pain and gives you a happy high,Smells amazing and looks really good with a decent ammount of crystals and nice orange hairs, The taste is one of the best buds i tried its really flavorful and over powers the taste of tobacco in blunts, The nugs are 8/10 on the dense scale lol. Only con i have is after smoking alot i get a minor headache but other than that great strain .

VFell back into severe depression recently and picked up some Sweet Tooth shatter. Did only 2 low temp dabs and I felt exponentially better. It&#39;s incredible for depression, but that being said, it did nothing to help my anxiety. I had to take a dab of Pink Rockstar to calm down a little bit, but if not for my shitty anxiety, Sweet Tooth is amazing. It&#39;s effects are strong, helping me feel happier and more content with life for the most part. I almost passed out and just laid on my bed, eyes closed, just listening to episodes of Rick and Morty, on the cusp of sleep. I&#39;m a daily dabber, so my tolerance is high, and this is the first time I&#39;ve actually had to lie down and sober up before being able to do the work I needed to do. It will be very easy to sleep tonight after just a couple large, low or mid temp temp dabs It&#39;s definitely a couch locker if you go the low temp dab route, which I highly recommend, not just for the power of it&#39;s effects, but to taste this rad strain. It has incredible, sweet flavors, as you probably guessed from it&#39;s name. It&#39;s kind of like smoking candy, at least when it&#39;s via concentrate. I highly recommend it for anyone feeling down, or anyone that needs to shut off their brain and body for the night.

VI kinda expected this to be similar to bubblegum or cream caramel. But the taste is less sweet. It has a resinous pine taste, sweet and lightly woody, but not too harsh. The smell is rather sharp so it&#39;s hard to tell any aromas with a joint. On the effects side: I have never felt so relaxed in my life. I felt the indica effects sneaking in, while I got happier and my stressful thoughts disappeared, which was a while ago. I&#39;m in my backyard, lit a candle, ate a hotdog, watched slow mo videos on YouTube. Felt amazing, content, but not anxious or uneasy. I was overwhelmed when I lit the 2nd, but a few minutes later I got the hang of it. Physically couchlocked, clear headed and positive mindset. In smaller quantities (or temperature if you&#39;re vaping) you have more of the latter, maybe even somewhat sativa leaning effects. Also great to chill with friends and play Xbox very, very badly, which is always a great indicator for the stone-o-meter. Deserves its five stars.

VI like this strain, it&#39;s just the classic stoner type of strain. You smoke this and you just chill, it&#39;s very euphoric and made my eyes heavyyyyyyy but not sleepy. Im totally functional on it though, which is nice. I don&#39;t enjoy being super baked so, this one def. is a keeper for me.\u000a\u000abuds are thick and condensed, classic indica look with dark orange hairs. The smell was very sweet, it was like a floral/woody smell with an undertone of like a citrusy bergamot kind of scent. It&#39;s not that loud of a smell, on the burn it didn&#39;t smell like anything spectacular and the taste was very subtle sweet.

VI love it, for so many reasons. It is a relaxing strain, that I love to use in social situations, especially in chaotic situations. It helps me stay focused and not be over sensitized or anxious.  \u000a\u000aHaving vertigo, everything makes me dizzy, but this strain alleviates most of it, and I can enjoy hobbies like the computer, TV viewing, creative projects, electronics, books and such.  \u000a\u000aI smoke it, and a little goes a long way. I find it helpful to have for IBS, anxiety, depression, Peri-menopause, migraines, back pain, insomnia, vertigo, and other issues. This strain helps me with all of it. I am nauseous almost every day, and this strain helps get me through some rough patches.    \u000a\u000aFor me, it is an appetite suppressant. It tastes mild, and is not too harsh to smoke in small doses. I use a glass pipe. I think it smells like sweetened cereal milk, like Trix.  :)

After a short period of time this strain hits your head like a fucking Mac truck.  Big pressure behind the eye balls, hard to keep focus...very euphoric and a little tingle in the head area along with a mild body high.  The high lasted about 3 hours at the same intensity.  \u000a\u000aNot sure this is the strain for me...I am more into a clear headed stone, that&#39;s the only reason I give it 4 stars.

It felt like it was slow coming on, but when it finally took effect full force I felt very relaxed and my pain gone. There was a bit of nausea for me because of its sweet nature that I normally wouldn&#39;t have chosen and was just trying to branch out to try something new for myself. Definitely will help you to destress and get much needed rest.

VI love it, for so many reasons. It is a relaxing strain, that I love to use in social situations, especially in chaotic situations. It helps me stay focused and not be over sensitized or anxious.  \u000a\u000aHaving vertigo, everything makes me dizzy, but this strain alleviates most of it, and I can enjoy hobbies like the computer, TV viewing, creative projects, electronics, books and such.  \u000a\u000aI smoke it, and a little goes a long way. I find it helpful to have for IBS, anxiety, depression, Peri-menopause, migraines, back pain, insomnia, vertigo, and other issues. This strain helps me with all of it. I am nauseous almost every day, and this strain helps get me through some rough patches.    \u000a\u000aFor me, it is an appetite suppressant. It tastes mild, and is not too harsh to smoke in small doses. I use a glass pipe. I think it smells like sweetened cereal milk, like Trix.  :)

VI like this strain, it&#39;s just the classic stoner type of strain. You smoke this and you just chill, it&#39;s very euphoric and made my eyes heavyyyyyyy but not sleepy. Im totally functional on it though, which is nice. I don&#39;t enjoy being super baked so, this one def. is a keeper for me.\u000a\u000abuds are thick and condensed, classic indica look with dark orange hairs. The smell was very sweet, it was like a floral/woody smell with an undertone of like a citrusy bergamot kind of scent. It&#39;s not that loud of a smell, on the burn it didn&#39;t smell like anything spectacular and the taste was very subtle sweet.

VI kinda expected this to be similar to bubblegum or cream caramel. But the taste is less sweet. It has a resinous pine taste, sweet and lightly woody, but not too harsh. The smell is rather sharp so it&#39;s hard to tell any aromas with a joint. On the effects side: I have never felt so relaxed in my life. I felt the indica effects sneaking in, while I got happier and my stressful thoughts disappeared, which was a while ago. I&#39;m in my backyard, lit a candle, ate a hotdog, watched slow mo videos on YouTube. Felt amazing, content, but not anxious or uneasy. I was overwhelmed when I lit the 2nd, but a few minutes later I got the hang of it. Physically couchlocked, clear headed and positive mindset. In smaller quantities (or temperature if you&#39;re vaping) you have more of the latter, maybe even somewhat sativa leaning effects. Also great to chill with friends and play Xbox very, very badly, which is always a great indicator for the stone-o-meter. Deserves its five stars.

I got a nice couch lock going where I did not want to move from the couch. I was over at a friend&#39;s house, and it was great for watching tv, but I was not at all social. When I got home, I smoked more and then it made me sleepy. This is a good night-time, lounging strain.

Would recommend when sick/vomiting for sure! Overall, didn&#39;t love the anxious feeling but since it subsided and the rest of my buzz was great, this strain is pretty good. Easy to smoke with asthma as well, not too harsh on the lungs.

The sweet tooth I picked up is just above 26% thc. Smells sweet, hits like diesel which I love, could be a strong smoke for some. Good for daytime or nighttime use.

VVery typical sativa dominate sour smell, reminds me of Alaskan thunder fuck...the flavor is very mild which is a nice twist.\u000a\u000aThe nugs are very nice looking, a darker green, dense, and sticky.\u000a\u000aAfter vaping 3 hits at around 310, the high came on slowly.  After a short period of time this strain hits your head like a fucking Mac truck.  Big pressure behind the eye balls, hard to keep focus...very euphoric and a little tingle in the head area along with a mild body high.  The high lasted about 3 hours at the same intensity.  \u000a\u000aNot sure this is the strain for me...I am more into a clear headed stone, that&#39;s the only reason I give it 4 stars.  Most of you will love the intensity of this strain...if you like gorilla glue you will love this shit.

VThis strain is the shit. The bud I have is a bit dry, the THC content is only 17%, but it&#39;s very purple and green. Looks great. This may be the best tasting weed I&#39;ve ever smoked, it&#39;s super sweet. Wonderful aroma. An excellent strain for taking your mind off of things and getting in to your happy place. \u000a

VThe smell of this bud is phenomenal, and is rightfully named. Although overall, i was a little disappointed. usually when i smoke, it&#39;s for anxiety or insomnia. this is an indica but made me want to stay up and actually kept me up when i wanted to go to bed. also made me feel quite anxious, continuing into the next day. i can&#39;t bash too hard because it can deliver a great high, but is very hit or miss which i believe shouldn&#39;t be the case when it comes to smoking bud. i can&#39;t say i would buy again, but it was fun and interesting when i smoked it during the day because i could still be high and productive.

VOnly negative is super high munchies when by yourself. Positive - very sweet/berry taste that was almost icy, very light on the tongue. not a lot of smoke, less thc but a super calm feeling! Dry buds, not very sticky but hard to break up. Soft sleepy feeling of the body and uplifting cerebral effects. 10/10 would get again

VOk, So I expected something a little bit more sweet but does have a tinge of what every reviewer has mentioned (at least all the positive ones) definitely makes you focused, i believe the strain i got was mainly sativa dominant. gives you very cerebral high, not so much as the body. if you take very big hits, you can definitely choke, maybe after 3-4 hits. but it is smooth and you will want to take 3-4 hits because of that reason. you feel the effects after about 10 mins, sometimes sooner. it is a very creeping up feeling

VGot this strain is los Angels for $35 an 1/8th. Buds were grass green and dense with a lot bright orange pistols protruding out. The smell and taste of this strain was incredible! It literally smells and tastes like sugarcane! I&#39;m no a fan of this strains effects though unfortunately. Although this strain is considered indica it honestly affects me like sativa head wise. It makes my mind race but at the same time I feel sleepy. Not the most happy or relaxing high&#128555;, just a lot of overthinking. On the positive though this strain did knock out my migraine. \u000a

VI consider Sweet Tooth to be sweet and pungent bud. Just rolled 1 and 3/4 gram of Sweet Tooth, sparked it and I am feeling happy, relaxed, uplifted, and euphoric. A great combination to get rid of Stress, Pain, Headaches, and Depression. The aroma of the bud is sweet with a hint of berries and the flavor is sweet &amp; smooth, taste like Berry Cotton-Candy. While under the influence of Sweet Tooth for 40min I started to feel a bit lonely(Talkative), so I decided to hit up a few friends and have a little kick back, had a group session of Sweet Tooth and watch random funny videos in YouTube and it felt 5&#215; better than smoking by yourself. Basically this strain is better when you smoke in a group(very social) I give it 3 7/8 \u2b50. Very close to a \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 but not good enough.

VWhat drew me to this lovely gem was her beauty. From the first time I saw that densely packed green and orange sticky crystal goodness, I knew she had to be mine. I don\u2019t usually fall for hybrids and so I was beside myself with anxiousness. You see, I\u2019ve only ever been with sativas. It can\u2019t be that different right? She\u2019s not a full indica. One of her parents had to be sativa. I\u2019m just gonna throw it out there, I actually thought to myself at one point, \u201cWhat are my friends gonna think when I start to bring her to our get-togethers\u201d? I know it shouldn\u2019t matter what they think but this IS Oregon, after all.\u000a \u000aI had to know more about her. But I couldn\u2019t just approach her without knowing anything about her type. I\u2019ll seem like a doofus. What to do? Luckily, the man behind the bar knew all about hybrids. He\u2019s been around the block a few times and a good bar man has ears everywhere. He told me everything I needed to know to make my first move. This particular flower has quite a name around here. She may not have the highest THC percentage but she\u2019s far from a Harlequin. I think could be happy with 22 percent. And man is she a sight to see. Later in the evening, we took a selfie so I could show my friends what I hooked up with but I can\u2019t find how to include a picture in my review.\u000a\u000aThe first date was, as always, a little awkward. You never know what to expect on first dates. Is it going to be relaxed? Am I gonna laugh too much at all her jokes and she thinks I\u2019m crazy? What if I can\u2019t stop smiling? What if I over eat and can\u2019t \u201cperform\u201d if the opportunity presents itself? What if I have bad breath? Why can\u2019t I ever seem to drink enough water? Why am I sweating so much? What is wrong with me? Can she tell I\u2019m high? All of my anxiety was soon put to ease. She was gentle and encouraging. She seemed to bring the goodness out in me. Maybe I smiled too much and got too excited when she told me about all the things that we could do together, but she was just as excited as I was. Everything seemed right again.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not one to put all my eggs in a single basket. I got a few numbers that day. The bar man\u2019s intuition was on point for every one of the princesses he introduced me to. What can I say, I guess I was feeling adventurous. I even hooked up with an indica proper! I don\u2019t know what came over me in the shop that sultry early October afternoon. Maybe the bar man was an angel pointing me towards a righteous path. Maybe he was the Devil, knowing precisely which of my heart strings to pluck\u2026 Just kidding. I\u2019m an atheist.\u000a\u000aBut there was just something about her that made all the rest unnecessary. Sure, there were some with higher THC percentages, but none felt so right for every occasion. I could climb mountains and scream her name when I reached the summit. I can take her with me to friendly get-togethers and she won\u2019t embarrass me in front of my friends and family. We can just chill together and watch a movie, no awkward silences. I can rely on her to get me to where I need to be. \u000a\u000aIn the end, does the difference between sativas and indicas have to be so fierce? Can\u2019t we all just be thankful for a good relationship with our chosen strains? I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you these things. I guess I feel like I can trust you. I\u2019m not trying to brag about scoring with the right one or anything but I can see myself spending a lot of my time smelling her sweet perfume and experiencing her mellow yet perpetually interested demeanor. Some of the others may have made my heart race a little faster and some may have made more of the pain of everyday existence seem somehow less burdensome. The time I&#39;ve spent with her has taught me that no matter who your parents are, it\u2019s your characteristics that create sparks and sustain the flame.

VI&#39;ve smoked marijuana for a year now, but I never got into the actual names of different strains and all that until now. This was the FIRST strain I smoked in which I knew what it was. I loved it. I was laughing non stop, at everything. I was extremely giggly, I was happy. I didn&#39;t have a care in the world. Also cured my insomnia. Was a very pleasant smoke, would smoke again.

VI tried this strain for the first time today and it was in the day time. Most of the comments said it&#39;s an energetic heady high but I&#39;d have to disagree. I felt more of the a indica type high with this one. Definitely a creeper though and would suggest this for more of a night time relaxing high with its sedative heavy indica feeling.

Having said that,,,.\u000a   I gave it four stars so I could leave room for the more expensive varieties, but this is plenty potent enough to satisfy me. It&#39;s very nicely cured and grinds and smokes very very good. Mild tasting.\u000a   Makes me think of a very finely tuned middleweight boxer. \u000a   Thumbs up!\u000a\u000aThis was the first time I done business with any collective or any retail outlet at all.

VThis strain reliably makes me feel like an insane clown.  And I mean that in the worst way possible.  I only purchased a gram (as I do in this state where it is legal, a gram of this and a gram of that, so I can figure out what works and what doesn&#39;t) so I&#39;ve smoked it more than a few times.\u000a\u000aAnd - without doubt - each time this strain gives me intense paranoia and anxiety.  Before you say &quot;set and setting,&quot; I&#39;ll have you know I&#39;ve smoked this is many different states of mind at many different times of day.  \u000a\u000aI have gotten some creativity out of it, such as journalling or playing music.  However, it&#39;s as if I&#39;m creating out of a fear - that this high would just go away.  I can&#39;t explain why this strain makes me feel so bad.  Not everything is for everyone - on to better strains!
