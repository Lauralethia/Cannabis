VI have only been able to try Dream Beaver once. Grown by Phat Panda in WA I hope soon they can get some more out to pierce county. I don&#39;t remember much about it as it has been at least 6 months ago. It has a very piney smell and gives a great sativa high.

VLove this strain. Picked some up on a recommendation from my budtender. Great taste, amazing smell, with a hella bomb ass high. The high is predominantly in the head, but gradually seeps down and relaxes your body. Great for gaming and interacting in a social setting.  Paid $31.50 for 1/8 locally.

VA very heady high for sure. Great piney taste with a very mellow smooth after taste. I agree with other reviews that it is good for wake n bake. In the same league as Super Silver Haze. Got mine at Issaquah Cannabis Company and Phat Panda deserves a shout out. It is as chronic as some of the good medical marijuana in the area which is saying a lot. We grow fire smoke in them Cascade Mountains.

VWhen I take just a few hits I get a definite head high, but it doesn&#39;t have any noticeable effect on the rest of my body, leaving me wanting the buzz all over.  Then last night I decided to get really high before bed and used my dry herb vape for like 10 minutes strait.  I got stupid high all over and that was wonderful!  but then I put on my headphones as I stumbled into bed and turned up some of my fav music,for me that is worship music. (you have heard of the older church folks suddenly smoking weed? yea that&#39;s me)  Well the combination of way to high along with the music, the result was nothing less than a profound spiritual experience!  I think I came too around 4 hours later so full of happiness and joy.  Let&#39;s do that again!

VEasily just became my #1 favourite! It&#39;s everything you would expect from a sativa&#128076; Gives off a a great energy boost, and makes you feel awake. The euphoria it creates is a nice wave of happiness that floods your whole body. Very good choice for wake n bake or when you need your spirits lifted&#128522;

VBest thing about this is the smell... almost exactly like cedar, with a bit of skunk thrown in for good measure. It&#39;s distinctive and wonderful.\u000a\u000aThis was stronger than I expected. It reminds me a lot of sticky haze or liberty haze... it&#39;s so heady that even if you do have energy, you&#39;re not necessarily going to do all that much because you&#39;re so high.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to buy it again, but if it&#39;s on the menu already, I definitely may.
