VUltra exotic Pink Panther, a sativa-dominant beauty. Allegedly from San Diego, Pink Panther is Nectar&#39;s Blackberry phenotype. It has a unique color, aroma and taste, even the smoke smells good.. wowza!!! This has to be one of my best finds (: 2gs from Ultra in SD. \u270c\ufe0f

VA beautiful red-pink hue, Pink Panther is that rare Sativa with a gorgeous colored flower and the potency to boot. Recently picked up a batch that tested at 29.3%, the color was surprisingly still there even at that potency level. \u000a\u000aThe smell is very sweet and fruity, but not the candy like smell of things like Black Jack or Strawberry Kush, instead it is balanced with a musky pine scent. The taste is incredibly delicious, reminiscent of a sugary sweet. \u000a\u000aI felt energized, almost anxious (but not quite), and extremely focused. A highly recommended Sativa.

VI had wanted to try this for a while unfortunately my local had them only available in cans in a deal. I usually buy small amounts weekly rather then a big buy less often so I can try more strains. Once the deal was up the leftovers were available to buy by the gram and what beautiful buds they were lovely coloring&#39;s and crystals were thick. some nice purpling in it and the aroma was pretty good hard to describe. nice smooth smoke a bit hazelike is the bets way I can describe it whilst it lasted.\u000a\u000aI find it helps lessen pain by a 1/2 count in the 1-10 pain scale (I usually sit on a 8 count)
