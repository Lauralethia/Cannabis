VMarionberry not Marion Berry the crack smoking ex D.C. Mayor. Those of us in the NW know the difference. Tasty berry kush that I got from Sasquatch Farms. Great taste, decent high, good looking colorful bud. 7.5/10

VExcellent berry/citrus flavor, a touch on the savory side.  This strain is excellent for bringing out the artist in you. Every time I enjoy MBK I turn into Picasso trying to draw everything around me. I imagine this would be a great strain for songwriters. One of my favorite strains.  Careful though, too much will certainly put you to sleep.

VA good strain because of the kush and romulan qualities. Not my favorite strain but definately worth consuming. The high is mild with a medium stone. Much more functional than GDP or Conspiracy Kush. Not too indica heavy but surely stoney. Sweet, tangy, berry, gummy, and earthy.

VI feel pretty blas&#233; about this strain. The high was mellow, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The buds are super sticky, and the smell before burning isn&#39;t the greatest in my opinion (earthy, decayed berries).

VWas very impressed with this strain. It delivers in every aspect. I grew out of those heavy couch lock strains many many years ago! Us more vintage folk like to keep it heady and vertical, and Marion Berry is one of those strains that hits all my pleasure points at once! And zero anxiety, no pounding heart no sweats, just pure eurphoic bliss, its a pretty rounded strain,great bag appeal, the Raspberry pheno smells like a Berry flavored Now or Later, taste is smooth earthy kinda fruity. Peak High last a good 1-2hrs  for me,the backside is even pleasant, no nappy naps on the couch afterwards! Give it a try, you want be disappointed.

Good for getting creative juices flowing and chill cerebral activities, like reading. Made prolonged focus while reading feel easier for my sometimes hyper mind. Not too sleepy. Also felt a slight appetite suppressant effect. Smells like summer. My guess is, you&#39;ll like it ;)

VHas a very sweet and present &quot;purple&quot;/berry taste. The smoke was a little harsh while still flavorful. Great strain to spend a night on the couch with/utilize for pain.

A smooth flavor without being harsh at all perfect in a pipe,  I can enjoy this nugget all the way down without coughing my brains out. But don&#39;t get it twisted, lol, it comes on slow but full force by about 10 min.

Wouldn&#39;t recommend to anyone but veteran smokers. Thc content can be as high as 25%. As I stated a great hybrid, would I keep this In my daily rotation? No.

My particular cut of the batch had a very nice merionberry tea-esque quality to the terpene profile in addition to some nice, light citrus notes.

VThis strain definitely has a fruity, berry smell as well as a strong berry taste. Could also really taste diesel and spicy notes. I felt extremely relaxed and thankfully, no paranoia at all. This strain is excellent for anxiety relief. Good night-time treat.

VVery pleasant strain that will be enjoyed by fans of kush and indicas.  Scent and flavor are quite redolent of berries (as much as one ever truly finds in marijuana).  I vaped via Storz and Bickel Crafty: High was immediate, with gentle surge about 20 minutes later, and lasted about three hours.  It left me relaxed but not sleepy.  Munchies occurred but were not insanely demanding.  Overall, a fine strain, reminiscent of Berry OG, and worth obtaining if it comes through your dispensary.  I obtained this at Metropolitan Wellness Center in Washington, DC.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a   v

VMy first neural/ negative review has to be this one. The taste was horrible. Like the dirt brick weed you&#39;d get back in the early 90s from that stranger your buddy just met in the alley behind a bar. It got me high...decently high at that... that&#39;s why I gave 3 stars. The head high I got was delightful and lasted a good while. Just couldn&#39;t give it the last 2 because of the taste and smell.

VI thought Space Queen and Purple Arrow could not be beat. Marionberry Kush gives them a run for their money. Clear headed and powerfully relaxing, this strain seems to make almost any situation better. Amazing results, but remember every body and everybody is different.

VDefinitely a favorite. Really good legit purple, not horseshit beastly purp. Great for anxiety. I can go to bed on this or stay up all day. Nothing bad to say

VMeh. It&#39;s harsh when I smoke (burns the throat, doesn&#39;t taste like much. Does give me the gigs real good but other than that, not really impressed
