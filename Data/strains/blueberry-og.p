VVery tasty blueberry Tate when smoked, especially in a clean glass bong and nice in joints also. The smell is fruity with classic OG aroma. Decent indica dominant body high with relaxing stress relieving and anti anxiety properties helps with appetite and sleeping in higher doses. Awesome strain highly recommended.

VWould buy more, loved the high. The smell is a delightful, and enjoyable smack in the face, like a blueberry cheesecake. the buds looked like tiny diamonds were engulfing it, and it was so sticky, and moist which is wonderful because it prolongs a loaded bowl. it relieved pain quick, and gives a let&#39;s take on the world feeling.

Nice head and body high with relaxing effects.Barneys farm did a really nice job. Extremly good yield. huge, tugh buds full of crystals.

VJust grabbed this and it is some excellent stuff. In the past this would be a 5, but I have now decided to reserve that for the top top top stuff. This is some premium bud and some of the better stuff I have found here in Illinois. \u000a\u000aWhile its listed as a hybrid, most know that both Blueberry and OG tend to lean towards the Indica side of things. What is interesting is that both strains have similar lineage (want to say two sativa landraces crossed with a pure indica both).\u000a\u000aBlueberry has been around forever, I remember first getting ahold of it locally in the late 90s. This pheno seems to lean towards the Blueberry side of things but I can for sure feel the OG in there. Its just the Blueberry is dominant on at least this pheno which is fine with me. I am kinda getting sick of OG this and that but if it helps bring back Blueberry I am all about it.

VThe description is right on for this one, good work. You definitely experience dry mouth, lack of appetite, and an indica vibe. I am ambivalent about this bud because there are properties I really like mixed with qualities I really don&#39;t, that&#39;s why I took a star off.
