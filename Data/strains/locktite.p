VI tried Locktite recently. I brewed it up in tea with honey and coconut oil. Within an hour my pain level went from a 6 to a 1. After an hour noticed a head buzz, too, and within 4 hours was ready for bed. Slept 7 hours straight instead of my usual 6 hours. Definitely, I will use this one for a good night sleep, but as for day time use - nada.

VThis strain is fantastic for anyone who cant calm down after a full day of work. As someone with gastic ulcers, it can be a little rough on my &quot;heart burn&quot; from time to time but I&#39;m sure that just my reaction. Also you&#39;ll want a bottle of water or tea because the dry mouth is strong with this one.

VLocktite is my new favorite nighttime strain... its effect is a less heady, more body melty GG#4 and it is heavenly. My ladyfriend and I were driving home tonight after a very long day... I said I had a Locktite joint waiting for us and she said &quot;yesssss let&#39;s get melty.&quot; It&#39;s not heavy, it&#39;s not trippy, it just relaxes everything and floats your mind away. Smells and tastes a lot like GG#4 and hits immediately. Definitely puts both of us to sleep.

VI had this strain before bed. I was already tired so smoking some I was given from trimming last night, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. after almost three years of being a patient this was one of the few that compliments me managing brain damage, and keeping me head high on the trip home off just a bowl. it eases you gently into a relaxed, focused, clear headed/ happy high, that still helps physically as well so my run being good for any time of day.

VLocktite I love this strain primarily due to GG or God Like Glue genetics.\u000aWhen I had her she tasted of chocolate and orange deisel with uplifting effect.\u000aI enjoyed this in concentrate form and man I wish I had more.\u000aGG genetics are the best strain I have found for relieving my symptom&#39;s of pts and depression.I have a high tolerance and use CBD daily.

VTaste is good, effects are not (for me).\u000aChemicals, gas, and hint of citrus. Fluffy frosty potent bright lime nugs with dull orange hairs. This strain is very sativa dominate. I can&#39;t relate the name sake.\u000aUppity, energetic, giggly, anxiety. Effects are almost all mental, with a major body effect in the temples and eyes.\u000aI don&#39;t think this strain will stick around for me.

VThe strain is very potent and has effects kind of similar to GG#4 but I have to be honest, the last 8t from Health for Life East was popping like corn it had so many white, useless seeds making the strain very sorry compared to some other times. Check out your buds before you leave, what a buzz kill, stuff isn&#39;t cheap. Not going to leave less stars because it it was a bad batch.

VThis is an awesome strain. It gives you the incredible chocolatey, chemmy taste profile of the gorilla glue, with undertones of pine near toward the tip of the tongue. The original gg4 is pretty inebriating on its own, but this is a little watered down, it wont turn you into a complete zombie. Great for pain and sleeping. This is some very high quality flower, but it is not the same quality as the GG#4.
