VI would definitely recommend this strain , especially if you have a cute smoking buddy.  Seriously, ANL will get you horny as fuck!  A good way to describe the feeling I got from it would be...snuggly.  \u000a\u000aOn an interesting note, though, I had a hard time deciding whether this was an indica or sativa dominant hybrid.  A good hit had a hint of the hashy, heavy taste of indica, but it still had the fresh, piney, fruity taste of a good sativa.  After finishing my bowl, I felt very talkative and clear headed, but my body felt heavy, so I think the ratio of indica vs. sativa might be almost equal.  Beware of the comedown, though.  Just like with many indicas, I found it hard to get up the next morning.  \u000a\u000aOverall, Atomic Northern Lights is a perfect strain for a night of romance and adventure.

VTop notch medicine. Not the &#39;shady&#39; kushes of varying quality. In fact Atomic NL helped cure me from a weekend of smoking some horrible kush of some kind grown in San Francisco. \u000aAtomic NL is everything NL is but with an added kick to it. Rest assured it is almost the exact same as NL. No anxiety really nor paranoia. Just upbeat clear but still buzzy type of high. More trippy than spacey. Always a good thing. \u000aHard to find this strain. Though we were not kidding around when they say it is arousing. The residual effects are very relaxing, socially comfortable and works with you rather than against.

VThis is my second review for Atomic Northern Lights.  And from the same batch about 2 months ago, so not the freshest, but still good. I believe I liked it much better this second time around... like.. Wow!  I think ATN has the most tingly effect on me of all the strains.    Let your mind wander in the right direction and arousal is an easy thing.  My husband thanks you!  Lol.... Enjoy

VI really like this one. It has a beautiful head high, racy but not in any bad way at all. No paranoia, no feelings of doom. Makes me happy and wanting to go somewhere. Then there is a strong body buzzing, especially around the groin area and the sole of my feet (kinda weird!). Affects short term memory a little, but nowhere near as bad as others I&#39;ve had. Also, don&#39;t drive on this... makes me want to drive faster than I normally would. Slight sense of confusion also which makes things kinda fun because it makes me think of weird stuff. Feel like I could watch a movie which had chase in it. Feeling horny....? Not really, I&#39;d say it makes me feel &quot;naughty&quot; rather than horny... would probably make sex more &quot;tantric&quot;. I&#39;d say this is pleasure enhancing weed. It&#39;s pretty long-lasting as well.

VI actually didn&#39;t know about this leafy site the first time I tried Atomic Northern Lights (not to be confused with the much less potent regular Northern Lights). It is in my Top 5 and I&#39;ve tried over 30 different strains at least. It has a piney taste and the high is outstanding. One of my go-to strains if and when it&#39;s available.\u000a\u000aI have insomnia, anxiety, lower back pain (from sitting in uncomfortable office chairs for years and lifting heavy things at other jobs) - This does the trick. I really don&#39;t take any other meds except maybe allergy medication when it&#39;s absolutely necessary... and now I take Omeprazole for my acid stomach... Cannabis helped a little with the acid stomach but my problems are severe and I battled with it for 3 years before finally giving up and going with omeprazole (basically bootleg prevacid)

VI&#39;m wrapped pretty tightly most of the time with chronic/severe PTSD for 40+ years.. ANL takes the edge off life better than any other strain, and I can get a decent nights sleep to boot.  I&#39;m 68 years old and can stand on my dick when I&#39;ve had a few hits of ANL any more than a few, and I go to sleep..  I wish it had the same effect on my post-menopausal wife.. I&#39;m still looking for the magic bud for her!  Any suggestions?

VI really found this very helpful with the pain of RA, in my hands. It really helped me while ranking leaves! Felt very relaxed sitting, while taking breaks from working! Even as my hands were very swollen. Smoked very smooth, very light and very mild. Relaxing to be sitting around with friends, soft music, easy chat. Preferred smoking over Power Vaporizing, but will try again. Do hope it comes in again!\u000a\u000aAs I am new to this world of choice and variation, I am sure other stains will be interesting to try!\u000a\u000aAtomic Northern Lights was very good medicine and smoke!

I picked it up on a 20 dollar eighth sale, it didn&#39;t look much like the picture of it did, but the dispensary showed me papers on it. It was grown awfully unusual, it tasted really weird and smelt really really bad. I think it was somebodys project gone bad.  \u000aAnyways, I did find the high somewhat beneficial because of my conditions medically im in a lot of pain.

VI am disappointed somewhat , and I think it has a little to do with the dispensary I got it from. I picked it up on a 20 dollar eighth sale, it didn&#39;t look much like the picture of it did, but the dispensary showed me papers on it. It was grown awfully unusual, it tasted really weird and smelt really really bad. I think it was somebodys project gone bad.  \u000aAnyways, I did find the high somewhat beneficial because of my conditions medically im in a lot of pain.

VGave a euphoric sort of feeling. Not as if walking in the clouds, but more so that you were the northern lights, hence the name I suppose. This relieved my anxiety and calmed me to a better state. I came across slight memory loss while consuming though.

VLove this! I&#39;ve been experimenting since I got my card in early December, and I swear in the past month I&#39;ve tried 30 different strains and this is awesome! I get very down when my back pain is up and I find this is a very uplifting strain if you&#39;re experiencing stress or depression, and it made me much more sociable. It&#39;s done my family yet another favor. Thanks again Mmj for getting me back on my feet!

VThis is my 3rd favorite strain ever. Usually, I need at least a gram to get me stoned, but just 1/4 of a gram of this had me high off my ass. I didn&#39;t have a care in the world, and this bud made me unwind and relax. I&#39;d say this is an indica dominant hybrid for sure. Definitely Recommend.

VAs an openly gay man, whom has been with his BF for 3 years, we tried this on Valentines day, let me tell you it made our hormones rages with passion. Both us us never smoked such a weed that made us so sexual before. Also even after the sex both of us had screaming erections for 30 minutes after and within 2 hours after sex we made love again.\u000aWe also have tried over 40 strains each, and never has any strain given us such passion and a desire sex.
