VDespite the relatively low THC content, this strain is amazing!  It&#39;s great if you&#39;re looking for something to help you get active and motivated.  This is my go-to when I need to spend a day cleaning the house or yard, and it tends to be a bargain compared to other strains.

VI like this one. Really good body high. Nice to just smoke and chill, but also gives a little energy kick so you&#39;re not a zombie. I struggle with anxiety heavily and I&#39;ve had this one create some nervous energy but not much which I was surprised seeing as the negative to this strain is anxiety. Oh and doesn&#39;t kill your wallet!

VGreat high but don&#39;t expect a typical Indica. Like many other reviewers, Cuvee treated me like a great Hybrid.  I felt happy, relaxed, my body seemed to humm, and I did not have couch lock nor was I sleepy. Great for socializing or kicking back with a book.

VJust like it says this strain blasts u off and let&#39;s u down easy. This is a hybrid to me not indica though,no couch lock just good vibes. Dank smell with purple undertones like chocolate or something. mid day smoke as it tends to blast u out there but highly functional. good social strain.

VIt&#39;s a great strain with great flavor and a beautiful bud. I really like I for a nice, light mellow. Sadly it is a low THC plant, so if you have a tolerance this bud will likely not do it for you. Would recommend for a first time or casual smoker.

VReceived a sample of this strain from a client of mine that\u2019s grows for a collective here in the Portland area. At first glance the flower looked very nice and frosty. They were a bit fluffier than I expect d it to be. A minty blue green with light yellow calyxes. The smell was pretty pungent and skunky, with a light fuely scent. The taste was piney, earthy, and sharply hazy. The effects were a bit lacking in my opinion. They came on relatively quick with a decent body buzz. The effects wore off pretty quickly and left he a bit anxious on the comedown. It gave me the munchies pretty quickly and is a nice strain for fast acting nausea relief.

VThis is an indica for people who like sativas. Surprisingly uplifting for an indica, with intense cerebral effects being felt within 10 minutes. I&#39;m a person that uses indica strains for anxiety and depression, however this particular strain makes me feel a little racy and definitely more absent minded. This strain is good for enhancing the senses, but that awareness can turn into paranoia quickly if the time and setting is not proper. The anxiety and paranoia eventually wanes after the initial come up, but be careful and do not over medicate.

VOne of my favorites. I mostly smoked Cuvee during the last year - 2017, when ever the club held it, I bought it :)\u000a\u000aThe flavour of a Cuvee is how I use to describe a well flavoured indica. Smooth and a bit nutty taste.\u000a\u000aThe high is there in the beginning, but mostly you will be stoned on Cuvee. Drift away in thoughts about life or get trapped in some work you wanna finish. Creativity booster, probably great for any form of artist.\u000a\u000aSocially, not so good... you can get talkitive while thinking about deep things that makes you sound spacad.\u000a\u000aEpitise mostly for snacks, not to big on dinners.\u000a\u000aGreat day-after-feeling that makes this my favourite. Mellows me out and gives me patients where patients needed :)\u000a\u000aBest to be smoked alone.

VNew smoker and the first time I\u2019ve tried this strain. Vaped it among friends and the flavour was woody and earthy. Very smooth vapour without coughing and my pain quickly drifted away with an extremely relaxing and mellow buzz. I found it to be quite social and tingly, I had a mild perma-grin regardless of the subject of conversation.   I really enjoyed this strain and it\u2019s effects allowed me to be social without couch-lock.  Definitely one to try again for this inexperienced, medicinal user.

VMy hubby has been using cannabis oil to treat his cancer. He has never had an panic attack in his 62 years of life, even when he was doing 1.5gm/day.  Within a week of starting 0.1gm/day of Cuvee, he had 2 panic attacks.  You are correct that anxiety is a strong negative.  He will not use it again, nor would we recommend it to anyone.
