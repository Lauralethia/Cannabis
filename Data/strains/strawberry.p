VWent for another trip with a different cut of this variety. Carrying this one in the club. Great, very impressed. Vaped at low temps. Came on very quickly, leveled out to good place in about 10 minutes, stuck around until now, 3ish hours off three pulls. \u000a\u000aMade my work I had to get done much easier. Was really uber focused from it. The medical effects were right where I need them to be.  Loss of pain, loss of ticks, calming. Great.

VGreat anytime strain. Good choice to have on the vape pen when you&#39;re not sure how you feel. Gets me to focus a little more and keeps depression at bay. Tastes a little odd but I may just have a cheap cartridge.

VVaporized in a Da Buddha, Crafty and Pax 3\u000a\u000aThis for me, is a great example of a daytime strain. The intense happiness/euphoria is short lived leaving behind less stress, a clear head and happy mood.\u000a\u000aIt does get a star docked because I don&#39;t want a short lived euphoria. Definitely recommend it, would make doing chores or homework much more pleasant.

VI usually avoid sativa strains but this Strawberry is a wonderful medicine! I usually wake up during the night and can&#39;t go back to sleep. A few tiles of this on my vape pen and I am ready for bed like a champ. Stressful family moment? No problem! Vape on Strawberry, which may as well be called natures anxiety pill. The pain in experience in the morning often leaves me cloudy in mind and disoriented. I took my meds and then toked on Strawberry. Instantly I find that I am mentally comfortable and physically painless. The world exists but I am relaxed within it and this hazy cloud of peace that has settled upon me. This strain does great on painsomnia. &#128077;&#127999;#Spoonies

VJust took 2 hits off my one hitter. I&#39;m fairly new but have done it almost daily for a year or so. I started this review at 1218, smoked at 1215. I&#39;ll update you later on on what time I finish. Everything seems slow and relaxed and just sort of floating through the day. But nothing I can&#39;t function on. Feels like I took my ambien and xanax but still awake fully functioning with daily chores without any difficulty. I really like this. It isn&#39;t knocking me out. I now feel happy. I was semi happy before but feel very happy. And pleased. As if I won a race or something. It&#39;s 1225.

VI dont normally enjoy sativa but this was fantastic. Obviously, the first thing is the smell and flavour.  From the very first toke  you can smell and taste fresh strawberries. My lips started to tingle a little bit after about 5 minutes and overall, this strain took the edge off but didnt make me tired.   The effects of this are uplifting, happy, and melted my stress away.   anIn regards to medical symptoms assisted, I would have to say this strain reduced my body pain, reduced my depression and anxiety, and made me feel comfortable and content.

VIf I were intending to buy a shirt that announced that I enjoy my flower, this is the only strain that I&#39;d wear such a shirt for! I love Strawberry, but it&#39;s really, really hard to find. I bought this in Southern Oregon. And I like flower, which makes it more difficult. But this strain is the perfect medicine. It is my top choice strain above everything else. (Strawberry Cough would come in my top ten favorite strains, but it is nothing like Strawberry.)  Strawberry that I bought is lower in THC; 12.7% with 0 CBD, but it works perfectly, and I do not focus solely on THC numbers. They&#39;re irrelevant in many instances. This strain helps me relax and I feel able focus and organize better. I use it in in the morning first thing, for sure, and am easily able to enjoy a morning run or workout before starting a work day, or setting off on a weekend trip. I feel relaxed mentally, but able to be physically active. I can easily enjoy it any time of day. I do not see any reason to use it at or near bedtime. It does not give me couch lock or munchies. I am able to do normal things, normally. If I want a great time for a short time, I can play with any number of other strains, but for functional medicinal purposes, for those of us that do still pay for our cards, even though it almost isn&#39;t worth it, this is why. Strawberry is medicine, to my system. (The only other one that I would say almost the same about is Pineapple, but that has a slightly more physically relaxing effect and I can use it at night without it either putting me to sleep too early, or keeping me awake.) I have asked and asked around for a grower that can grow Strawberry for me but people always want to tell me what I &quot;mean&quot; and they always add a &quot;Cough&quot; or a &quot;Kush&quot; or a &quot;Lemonade&quot; or &quot;Diesel&quot;. Nope. I just want Strawberry!!

The cerebral cannabis (BC Big Bud) is light, refreshing, happy and tingly.  If you smoke way too much, exaggerated quantity, then you feel the room is spinning and dizzy.

VIf I were intending to buy a shirt that announced that I enjoy my flower, this is the only strain that I&#39;d wear such a shirt for! I love Strawberry, but it&#39;s really, really hard to find. I bought this in Southern Oregon. And I like flower, which makes it more difficult. But this strain is the perfect medicine. It is my top choice strain above everything else. (Strawberry Cough would come in my top ten favorite strains, but it is nothing like Strawberry.)  Strawberry that I bought is lower in THC; 12.7% with 0 CBD, but it works perfectly, and I do not focus solely on THC numbers. They&#39;re irrelevant in many instances. This strain helps me relax and I feel able focus and organize better. I use it in in the morning first thing, for sure, and am easily able to enjoy a morning run or workout before starting a work day, or setting off on a weekend trip. I feel relaxed mentally, but able to be physically active. I can easily enjoy it any time of day. I do not see any reason to use it at or near bedtime. It does not give me couch lock or munchies. I am able to do normal things, normally. If I want a great time for a short time, I can play with any number of other strains, but for functional medicinal purposes, for those of us that do still pay for our cards, even though it almost isn&#39;t worth it, this is why. Strawberry is medicine, to my system. (The only other one that I would say almost the same about is Pineapple, but that has a slightly more physically relaxing effect and I can use it at night without it either putting me to sleep too early, or keeping me awake.) I have asked and asked around for a grower that can grow Strawberry for me but people always want to tell me what I &quot;mean&quot; and they always add a &quot;Cough&quot; or a &quot;Kush&quot; or a &quot;Lemonade&quot; or &quot;Diesel&quot;. Nope. I just want Strawberry!!

VA great sativa strain and my favorite one. Feels like electricity is running through your body because you just feel so alive. Has a tingly kind of feel.

VBeautiful indica, very sweet but dank smell.  Goes down easy without a bad burn in your throat like some sativa does. I&#39;d recommend this strain to anyone who loves the weed with a more &quot;fruity&quot; taste.

VCan\u2019t really emphasize just how pungent the odor is. : Strong.  I feel this start in the chest and head , settling in at the top of the neck with an overall warm indica body buzz.\u000a

VJust picked up some of this in honeycomb form.\u000aWonderful strain for both day/night, recommended for those who want an uplifting recreational feeling without becoming anxious.. It produced plenty of energy, euphoria and motivation with a very strong head high that will still relax to the max if that&#39;s what you prefer.

VThis is a wax review of Animal Crackers wax!  The experience is thoroughly nice, relaxing, and somewhat uplifting.\u000a\u000aThis is a potent wax (as most ones are) and it took a tiny little dab to deliver a solid dose. It was a smooth, gradual ascent into a comfortable and relaxing plateau. Generally happy thoughts and feeling with music sounding particularly interesting.  This is a great evening strain to get rid of all the stress. There is definitely a place for these effects in my life :)

VJust grabbed some Strawberry on danforth as well. Pricey place starting at $12 a gram. Anyway i grabbed some of this top shelf bud and it should be with the $10 dollar if there was one there lol. Good high i love Sativa for day smoking and this charged me up gave a nice head high but nothing crazy as the price puts on. Overall good strain.
