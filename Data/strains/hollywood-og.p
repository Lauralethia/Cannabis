VOMG opening this jar i actually was talking to myself about how great it smelled. I have not found a better smelling, tasting, and feeling strain in my entire cannabis consuming career and i am convinced that i never will. My absolute favorite. Pungent, skunky, earthy deliciousness from Seattle&#39;s Private Reserve i will forever come back to the Co. to pick up some Hollywood OG, it is more than worth the price!

VThis is a great choice for medical period. Heavy hitter, fast onset of mental focus and a good amount of pain relief from the..forgot what I was saying   Ok so this stuff creeps for about 20 min, bonus. Always try and wait a lil while before typing a review..I find this pretty potent, newer patients might want to take it slow, vets should be pretty happy, Im hard to please. 4.7 OF 5 for this patient. Tastes like a lemon was on a diesel truck for a haul, I would imagine.

VThis strain specifically makes me feel giggly and hungry, more so than any other strain I&#39;ve had. I mean, that&#39;s how any weed strain should make you feel, but with Hollywood OG, I feel like those two effects are more pronounced than usual. After smoking this, I end up eating waaay too much and giggle to myself whenever a funny thought comes to mind.\u000a\u000aThis isn&#39;t a strain I would recommend smoking before work or school, this is a strain that&#39;ll make you feel STONED like a stereotypical stoner.

Va little too cerebral for this 1 being indica dominant. The only other thing I didn&#39;t like was that the indica in it that is supposed to be dominant just makes u tired,, no real good body high that u&#39;d expect when smoking an indica dominant hybrid. I&#39;d give this a 7 out of 10all this

VDidn&#39;t do much for me, but I&#39;m willing to try it again.  Lol perhaps the name caused me to expect a little too much, I wanted to smoke a hollywood blockbuster of epic proportions and instead got something on par w/ reggie.  But please don&#39;t take my word for it, its def worth a try as I&#39;ve been reading other&#39;s reviews about this strain.

VHollywood OG had a powerful effect on me very quickly.  I found myself nodding off to sleep within minutes of smoking.  If I had anything that needed to get done that night it just wouldn&#39;t have gotten done.  Definitely not a day-time strain.  For anyone looking for treatment of insomnia however I highly recommend Hollywood OG.

VI tried the Hollywood OG from Seattle&#39;s Private Reserve. I smoked a few bowls with two other friends. For two of us it presented with a peppery taste and feeling in our throats and the other said it tasted sour and earthy to him. All three agree the peppery/sour taste is the diesel coming through. We all experienced a pretty intense cerebral high, personally that&#39;s not my favorite kind of high. Will definitely get you high, I prefer it mixed with another strain.
