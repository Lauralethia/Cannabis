VI am transformed into Aslan the Lion Everytime I get to indulge in Narnia from Soulshine Cannabis. I hesitate to make such a bold statement but here goes nada... I solemnly swear that Narnia, Lodi Dodi, and Grape Island Skunk is the Ultimate Gold Medal lineup. Any Cannalover, anywhere in the Universe will be seduced immediately after seeing and smelling these majestic flowers. Soon after the sweet smoke is inhaled there is an obsession that begins. Te Quiero Soulshine! Viva la Narnia!!!

VLives up to its name! Narnia activates the imagination and encourages creativity. This is a great strain for crazy taste experiments and making art. Things seem to have a hallucinogenic shimmer - colors are more vibrant, edges more defined. It also makes me a more empathetic person. For me, it resembles a very mild mushroom trip. There are deep thoughts, a desire to be better, etc. It works wonderfully for my depression, anhedonia, and lack of motivation. Great for artists!\u000a\u000aThere does appear to be some short term memory loss with this one. No raging munchies though, just an interest in sensual experiences... ALL sensual experiences.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. I hit a skinny Raw roller joint about five times. I noted a citrus  note on exhale along with a light spicyness. The first effect was near immediate, a forehead frontal cortex buzz. Half an hour in, the buzz has moved to my eyes, lips, and then a decent body buzz. I think my pleasure center of my brain is being stimulated, I feel an overall sense of pleasure in my mind and body. This will make a good Chase mama around the couch strain.

VI recently started working in the cannabis industry professionally. One of my coworkers kept telling me to try Narnia. I finally got a gram to sample today. Rolled in a Raw cone, the taste is superb. I will say that it made me cough right away, but my partner was fine. Other side effects may include, a slight burning sensation in the throat, or dry mouth. With or without, the high is one of a kind and extremely active. I attempted to calm down and smoked Northern Lights  (a famously heavy indica), and am still wide awake. Adding a bit of Blueberry Haze to the mix, as I type and so far, the only change is that I actually feel more hyped up! This is the Aslan of all sativas. Stock up! :)

VGood strain. Rolled a small joint after picking up from the dispensary and walked three miles to the bus stop. Ended up running because I had so much energy. Lovely buds although they were popcorn buds, they are very keify. Got an eighth for $28, good price for chronic bud. Definitely recommend any time. Haven&#39;t smoked at night yet but am now laying down and feel great, floating in bed. Love this strain. Don&#39;t know how it will do for sleep but may update later, tomorrow.

VI typically smoke at night after I get off work with the intent of getting wound down and relaxed but still staying productive enough to get things done. Narnia is one of my favorite strains- one I consistently ask for at my local dispensary. Its hit or miss as far as availability (I imagine, because of how popular it is) but always a must-purchase when its in stock. \u000a\u000aNarnia is buzzy and energetic without too much mind racing or anxiety. I have noticed some auditory hallucinations (mild ones) right after smoking, but that subsides as the high mellows out. Relaxed, social, comfortable from dank, sticky buds. The high can be really intense at first so I suggest going slow at first. (Excellent for hormonal PMS fog busting!)\u000a\u000aOverall, the experience is an A+.

VVaporized in a Crafty at 352f and a Da Buddha at the 1:00 position \u000a\u000aThis is hands down one of the BEST strains I have found for; stress, PTSD, depression and for me it also helps nausea and GI pain. This is a great social strain, berry happy and chatty effect. Every body is different so it may not help you the same way. \u000a\u000aWhen I vape this I am quickly uplifted, happy, no cares or worries and generally enjoy life. Music, working out and simply doing chores are easily done with enhanced focus. \u000a\u000aI got only a gram of this in 10/15 and it was quickly sold out the next day once I realized I wanted to keep this in rotation. I just found it again today and will go back tomorrow for sure. So if you see this pick it up!\u000a\u000aTLDR; Get it, hands down one of the best strains with minimal negative side effects.(you&#39;ll be thirsty)

VMy Review is geared for &quot;Creative&quot; smokers.\u000a\u000aNarnia! Perfect name for this one! Though a sativa, This personally felt like an indica to the mind, it&#39;s a deep, almost groggy high, if you overindulge the Trainwreck will surely be most dominant. The Jack Herer saves this by keeping the high uplifted and very tolerable. \u000a\u000aIf your a musician or artist, this is a &quot;smoke to come up with ideas&quot; strain, I tried to draw but the Trainwreck side made things a bit hazy to keep focused (could just be me). Overall great strain, would recommend to someone who is looking for an Indica type strain that isn&#39;t an indica. Great creative strain!

VNarnia has an immediate onset and the effects include a punch of enthusiastic positive energy and makes creative juices bubble forth from where ever they go when they\u2019re gone. These effects are longer lasting than typical Sativa-dom hybrids. Also, the flower smells similar to Electric Lady. After about 30-40 mins, the effects begin to adopt more of an Indica vibe. It\u2019s a focused relaxed feel but the effects may differ from person to person. The flowers are light green and possess a higher than average trichome layer.
