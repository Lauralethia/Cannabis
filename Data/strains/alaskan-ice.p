VI want to like Alaskan Ice, it seemed promising for a sativa. But sadly it fails to deliver. \u000aMore like a very weak Harlequin. \u000aIt shows a very high THC output on the stats, but the actual effect never makes it quite there for me. \u000aSo if you are looking for the workout smoke or the anti depression day smoke, this would be more the bottom of the barrel, buy it if there is no Cenex.

VThis is my current favorite strain. I love everything about this bud, the lineage is one of the most powerful out there with White Widow and Haze. The smell is that of a sour bowl of fruit but its the most flavorful thing I&#39;ve ever smelled. The smoke is tasty but I mean its weed so it&#39;s not gonna be the greatest thing ever. The high is a perfect balance that you would expect from it&#39;s parents. Super creative, yet very comfortable body feeling. Definitely a must try.

VI enjoyed this strain over the past weekend first a Friday sundown night cap, to abstaining all day to enjoy fresh high Saturday night. Then I enjoyed a sustained lazy Sunday high, dipping in with a nice glass pipe ever couple hours.  The sweet aroma is delicious the crystals are abundant as advertised.  \u000aNeedless to say it\u2019s a strong varied high perfect for little mission or projects but perhaps better suited for some comfortable RR.  The quality of flowers from Pot Cargo was top shelf and beautiful.  It did evoke some extra trips to the snack cupped and gave me a dry mouth.  But best of all I slept like a baby at night.\u000aI can definitely recommend this strain for the more experienced smoker hands down.

VIt&#39;s a great child strain of White Widow. I definitely feel the euphoric buzz. I exhibit some stereotypical stoner effects such as slight munchies, dry mouth, and giggles. I really like it! It&#39;s got a great, kind of... fresh smell. Really doesn&#39;t smell like weed, more like menthol potpourri. It smokes very smoothly through a water pipe with cold water and ice catch. It&#39;s great for focusing on studying.

VAlaskan Ice is an awesome sativa! It delivers a great euphoric, and energizing head-high. I really enjoyed it while out in nature! I felt a lot of positive introspection, and improved mood. It came in huge nugs, that where frosted in trichomes. It has a very pungent aroma too, that&#39;s kind of earthy with menthol. If I see it, I&#39;ll get again for sure!
