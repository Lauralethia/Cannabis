VI love this strain, just received it today from BC. Was looking for a strain high in CBD&#39;s to help my spinal arthritis, with muscle relaxation, but not too heavy of a high. This is great for it, and not space brained. Think this will be my daily.

VCbd mango haze , sabor especiado y amaderado con toques frutales de sativa old school con un efecto muy ligero que no se hace pesado. Muy estimulante del apetito y bastante relajante.

Vthis is my current favorite bud. I still consider myself a newbie even though it&#39;s been a year of legal here. high cbd on this keeps the thc down and it&#39;s not overwhelming. nice energetic sativa high with a little cbd body high makes your pain go away. highly recommended for everyone by me.

VI have a question to the user community about CBD Mango Haze.  Has anyone grown it from seed?  The profile says it should be 1:1 ratio THC:CBD with an average of 10% each.\u000a\u000aI just harvested a crop and after trimming and curing I measured it with a MyDx Cannabis Analyzer, which has been accurate as far as I can tell in the past.  However the measurement I got for the CBD Mango Haze was THC = 20% and CBD = 0.15%.  While the CBD is a bit higher than any other strains I&#39;ve grown it is nowhere close to profile or what I expected.\u000a\u000aAll the reviews I&#39;ve seen about the MyDx analyzer are good, everyone says it&#39;s been accurate for them.   All the reviews I&#39;ve seen about CBD Mango Haze seems to support the profile of 1:1.\u000a\u000aDoes anyone know if there are tricks or something different that needs to be done when growing high CBD strains vs high THC strains?\u000a\u000aI am somewhat baffled over this and hope some of you can shed some light for me.\u000a\u000athanx

VA had a nice - but stronger than expected high from this. I didn\u2019t expect to be slightly stoned - but it was good. Stayed focused, no paranoia, energized but not jittery. Was fine watching a few episodes of TV - then I did a load of laundry and some cleaning. Feel great. High was mellow, functional. Peaceful and content now. Muscles feel great!

VHas a tropical sweat slightly citrus mango like flavor with a nice euphoric back-round sativa high that is amazing for wake&#39;n&#39;bake&#39;s as well as all day. Any day for medical users. Well when all said and done this is my new favorite sativa strain so far and i am just loving it. If you come across this verity, I would highly recommend it to any one  who wont&#39;s to experience Cannabis Sativa.

VA solid anti-depressant with good flavor and with a hint of mental energy boost (sort of like RedBull CBD). Anyone with ADD or mental depression, should vaporize it before work to improve his/her work life and work experience. This strain and Lilly are my favorite CBD strains yet. Very positive since it excels with providing improved mental stability than a pure Haze. (Vaped with Boundless CFX at 350-370 degrees F)
