Vdidn`t think much of this strain.didn`t get any of the tastes and feelings of previous comments,again could be the grower (Orange State Cannabis).this is supposed to be a pretty kickass strain but it just wasnt there.nice,small hard nugs with an earthy slightly spicy taste and smell.really,this one didn`t do it f/ me.
