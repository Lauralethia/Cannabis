VGreat smell, i got lemon/hash/berry upon grinding it up. Immediate sativa kick after a 0.2gr bowl in the bubbler. Everything appeared much more vivid, a happy lightheaded feeling took over. Very powerful, I believe this batch was over 20% THC and could make a novice smoker &quot;green out&quot; if not respected in dosage. Overall a great sativa.

VLemonberry gives off a strong citrus smell the buds are short the structure is very compact and about the size of a quarter if not bigger. Lemonberry is different from a lot of strains that I&#39;ve tried. One of the differences that I noticed with lemon berry is that the strong body heigh comes out first.  Rights as the body starts to hit me the head high hits me is a little bit of a headache pressure which is something I don&#39;t typically like and I would say this is more of a evening straighten if you&#39;re looking for something that is mellow but not over-the-top happy this hybrid is a good choice if you&#39;re looking for something different normally in the city but it&#39;s first but since the body at first with a powerful impact it&#39;s very unique and different  is a little bit of a headache pressure which is something I don&#39;t typically like and I would say this is more of a evening strain if you&#39;re looking for something that is mellow but not over-the-top happy this hybrid is a good choice if you&#39;re looking for something different.  normally the sativas hits a first but since the body hits first with a powerful impact it&#39;s very unique and different.  Recommend this for people who have a hard time in between to footstools what I mean by that is if you can&#39;t make a decision between one or the other when you&#39;re given two different options.  D interesting idea behind this is it&#39;s been different in a way that you wouldn&#39;t expect so I&#39;m not sure what this would treat pain is obvious that would relieve it with this train if you have insomnia in a little bit of fatigue this would help however it&#39;s not good if you have headaches it&#39;s not good if you are having stress because this is simply not treating it. The taste is pungent and sweet the texture is very clean and has a wood characteristics to it or herbal and spicy. And the baby is very thin to thick depending on how Haryu vaporize it it&#39;s very interesting because when I blow up the CO2 it stays for a bit and then moves on like it has someplace to go. It&#39;s very interesting I would say give it a try  and the baby is very thin to thick depending on how Haryu vaporize it it&#39;s very interesting because when I blow up the CO2 it stays for a bit and then moves on like it has someplace to go.

VLike Jillybean and Girl Scout Cookies, Lemonberry is a very tasty after dinner strain. It tastes like lemony blueberry muffins. This gave me a pleasant body and head buzz. However in higher dosages it caused a lot of dizziness and tiredness. It&#39;s definitely best to have this at the end of your day.\u000aFollow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.

VThis strain is an absolute gob-smacker. First inhale was like breathing candy floss, no individual tastes just sweetness and earthy. Bit of a slow hitter but this will send you into laughing hysterics and will be sure to get you to sleep. The nug structure is clean and very green and the texture is dense but soft outside. 10/10 strain, recommended for those in a bit of stress or feeling down in the dumps, itll be sure to put you in the skies. - Jroh

VJust got my hands on some lemonberry! Very nice smoke. Good for this rainy day. Very cerebral high, mind feels like it&#39;s floating. Head pressure which I saw mentioned in the other reviews is spot on. Head pressure not to the extent of a headache but you&#39;ll feel it. Definitely a good representation of a hybrid strain.
