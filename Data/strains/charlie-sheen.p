VMethod of consumption - Flower, Smoking.\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000aSmell \u2014 I will divvy this category up into three pieces. Full flower, grounded up flower, and smoke.\u000a\u000aFull \u2014 The smell is fabulous. I spent more time sniffing it than smoking it up. It\u2019s very welcoming.\u000a\u000a\u000aGround \u2014 Woodsy tone in floral terms but, it also had hint notes of lemon peel-like citrus.\u000a\u000a\u000aSmoke \u2014 The woodland scent profile mellowed but the sweetness became more evident. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aTaste \u2014 Earthy and unquestionably sweet. If you ever had a dark chocolate that\u2019s sweetened with sugar only, it\u2019s like this without the chocolate flavor. (Taza\u2019s organic dark chocolate toffee almond and sea salt bar came to mind when I tasted this.)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aEffect \u2014 I\u2019m actually disappointed. I had higher expectations of a strain that\u2019s fathered by Blue Dream. This is one of strains that didn\u2019t do it for me. The smell invited me into a, well, almost nonexistent party. It doesn\u2019t give me a heady buzz or a complete body relaxation. However, without these, you could tell it\u2019s in your system. It does make you happy. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aNegatives \u2014 Minimal; Dry mouth and dry eyes but they were barely noticeable. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aMunchies \u2014 3 out of 10. It\u2019s mild, for me personally, and I didn\u2019t feel the need to gorge on anything. However I did have four Oreo thins. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000a\u000aExtra \u2014 I used this strain to mix with other as flavoring. \u000a\u000aAlso, take this review with a grain of salt. It\u2019s a personal review; I\u2019m positive that any of strains I reviewed would effect you differently.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u000aMy medical conditions are anxiety, Crohn\u2019s disease, insomnia, migraines, PTSD, and spinal injury (disc herniation).

VI have been using this strain predominantly for arthritis pain, post-cancer, anxiety and sleep.  I have the great fortune to have a supplier who grows only hydroponic, organic meds.  Charlie Sheen OG is the best of many strains I have used for all the above symptoms.  I also find that, if I want to sleep, I am out... but if I want to get work done, I focus and I am a MACHINE!!!  \u000a\u000aThe buds are super dense and sticky, and the smell is amazing... and amazingly strong!  I have started to make sure I&#39;m seated whenever medicating, as nearly every hit comes with a head and/or body rush.  I learned the hard way when I got the first shiner of my life after face planting from a sting hit.  Seriously.\u000a\u000aOverall, the best.  Two thumbs up!!!

VI picked up a gram of this Charllie Sheen the other day while running around town.  Needed something for my chillum.  The Tender said it was a good mix of pick-me-up and mellow-me-out.  Green Crack and OG Kush,  Yes Please!  I didn&#39;t really check the buds out too much before I smoked.  The flavor was so so.  It tasted good.  A bit like a berry.  But it was raining outside so I could be totally mistaken, ya know.  The high was wonderful.  It was the perfect running around town smoke.  Great buzz for train riding and task accomplishing.  Was able to maintain focus while at the same time riding a heavy buzz.  I&#39;m gonna have to recommend this one to everyone.  Beginners and heaver tokers a-like.  You&#39;ll just have to smoke more if you&#39;re a heavy toker cause its not like super strong.  .

VDespite the predominantly indica genetics, this strain has lots of cerebral sativa effects. Very powerful, even to a daily medical user for 25 years. I would describe the effects as being sativa-like for the first hour followed by an indica-like comedown. This is the perfect after work strain because if you medicate at 6pm, you&#39;re out by 10pm. Awesome strain really. The buds are airy, lightly compressed, bright neon green covered in long reddish trichomes.

Really light flavors and smoke, pretty smooth.  Helped a lot with my inflammation, mild - moderate pain relief, opened my lungs (asthma), worked very well for muscle cramps/spasms, totally felt relaxed, and it numbed my nerves (great for me).  Hit my head really fast... when I came down, it left just as fast as it came on.

VI have not had true &#39;Charlie Sheen&#39;, however, I did try the grower&#39;s choice at AZ Cannabis Society, called, Charlie&#39;s Dream.\u000a\u000aDue to the OG Kush being introduced to the Blue Dream and Green Crack, it is considered an indica dominant strain.\u000a\u000aDisagree with that, but no matter. The taste is over the top and will be your main love, besides the energy high, very motivating type strain!\u000a\u000aAnd ..... hand&#39;s down, absolutely one of the best tasting and most enjoyable strains ever! \u000a\u000aIf you are a connoisseur of Blue Dream and Green Crack, the flavor of this strain will BLOW YOU AWAY!\u000a\u000aAverage highlife span - 2 1/2-3 hours.

VI love the name, and I think it&#39;s totally appropriate. This strain feels like I&#39;m &quot;bi-winning&quot;.  To be honest, its not my favorite strain because it speeds me up in ways that aren&#39;t always comfortable. Definitely a day-time smoke, and in the right situation -- anything that engages your adrenaline, be it sex, an action movie, or reading -- its magical.\u000a\u000aHope this helps!

VThis strain is nice and relaxing, and will certainly get you high. That said, and I&#39;m not joking here, the residual smoke smells unmistakably of semen. I found this very disconcerting and will be smoking different strains in the future.

VI was thrown off by the looseness of the buds but i took my bud tenders word for the superior quality of the solstice supplier at evergreen patient network and boy am I glad I did. I have tried many and this one was especially quick for muscle spasm relief. Pain was greatly relieved and I enjoyed the sleepy 2-3 hour sleep come down after smoking especially for a Sunday afternoon.
