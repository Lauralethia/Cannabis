VThe Purple Chemdawg I&#39;m smokin&#39; right now is the &quot;dopest dope I&#39;ve ever smoked.&quot; It smells SO PUNGENT and the greens taste phenomenal. THE COLORS ARE INCREDIBLE. I&#39;ve never seen weed so vibrant. This nug&#39;s leaves are purple AND blue; she&#39;s hairy, dense, PERFECT. (As far as crystal-ly keif goes\u2013probably 400/420) \u000a\u000aAs for the effects.. they caused me to write this colorful review! My body is very relaxed, but my mind seems to be moving at a fast pace. It&#39;s enjoyable, but I imagine as soon as I get off my phone it will be much more enjoyable! 420/420\u000aWillie D says\u2013 &quot;Smoke it!&quot;

VIt&#39;s about a 50/50 cross between sativa and indica and it has cerebral head high and numbing body effects, but it doesn&#39;t pin you to the couch which I love. It relaxes you just enough and leaves a frosty feeling from head to toe. I&#39;m actually smoking it while writing this review and I must say that it taste like chemicals and diesel, but it&#39;s also very swee with a hint of grape. Overall this is a great strain for either daytime or bedtime use.

VVery nice mix between indica and sativa.  Good for whatever ails ya. Starts out slow with a little head rush behind the eyes.  Then moves to the body with a punch.  I wouldn&#39;t say it was a total couch lock though as I have no problem smoking this before going out. What I love about this strain is its ability to bring you to the same level every time.  Perfect for those everyday smokers with a high tolerance to THC.

VOh to the purple chemdawg. This strain has some great favors and packs a great punch. I enjoy this strain a lot. Let&#39;s kick it off with the look of the flower. It&#39;s a dark green bud with a lot of light accent green and a few golden hairs on hit. The buds themselves have a lot of crystals bursting on them. The flavor out of a desktop unit vaporizer is very earth toned with a light after taste of grape. The after taste of grape is just enough to keep your taste buds wanting more. The exhale is smooth and crisp the flavors burst in your mouth on the exhale. Once done with a bowl I find myself crawling into the couch to enjoy some quality movie/shows time. I do not feel sleepy just very chilled and relaxed. The aroma is on the heavy side but once it clears out the room it&#39;s not to bad.  I enjoy this strain and find myself partaking in it a lot more than I expected.

VFantastic across the board, from the aesthetics to the buzz. I like an herb that &quot;pops&quot; right out of the jar, and this one fills the bill... Wonderful fragrant burst thanks to the GDP in the cross. Buds are tight without being super-dense. Another indica-dominant I don&#39;t mind smoking during the day - relaxing, but the mind doesn&#39;t drift into outer space. Barely any hint of the &quot;fuel&quot; taste people often associate with diesels and their crosses. A bit of creep to it, the best parts of the buzz take fifteen minutes or so to establish... very happy smoke overall.

VIt&#39;s more of a 50/50 cross between sativa and indica to me,  just because both effects balance out well. Great head high with cerebral effects and a wonderful body high, doesn&#39;t put you on the couch, but you can feel it&#39;s force. I&#39;m actually smoking it while writing this review... overall it&#39;s a great strain for bedtime or daytime use.

VAppearance: 5/5 Like a crystal-swept alien planet of dark purple and violet hues, prices of real estate are rising on this strange and beautiful planet and they&#39;re cramming trichomes in with alarming density. Mostly medium-large buds, very sticky and resinous, excellent trim and cure.\u000a\u000aSmell: 4/5 Musky tones of dark coffee, fuel and berries, highly pungent and a strange mix of sweet/gassy.\u000a\u000aTaste: 4/5 Awesome the sublimator, with a strong lingering aftertaste of earthy grapes/berries.\u000a\u000aHigh: 4/5 Heavy, long-lasting and pretty narcotic. Heavy pressure behind the eyes and a nap-inducer if you mess around with it too much in the day. Very good pain relief in the low back, shoulders and neck. Positively no raciness, very calming and relaxing but socially active, great appetite stimulation.\u000a\u000aOverall: 4/5 This is a very special batch, heavy stone, stunning bag appeal, turns your body to soup while keeping the cerebral qualities toasty. Very happy with this.

VYes, this is a very unique &quot;INDICA&quot; based breed with the parents being Jack Herer (strong Sativa based mood/medication reasons standard for this strong sativa) and the Grandaddy Purple being a notoriously couch-locking indica with heaving medication sedating qualities.    \u000aThe combination of these two polar opposites fits together like a beautifully harmonizing 50/50 calming effects with blasts of mental/cognitive focus and creativity. Great for social situations all by itself! Please All,  practice not drinking and medicating if it can at all be avoided. Hope my input will provide some insight and perspective.

VPurple Chemdawg was awesome.  It was a powerful relaxant that left my body feeling light which reduced my pain.  I felt creative and carefree.  The flavour of this strain is sweet, probably from the Granddaddy Purple, with a light chemically flavoured undertone.    The aroma has a clear grape scent with an overpowering deisel smell asl well.   This is a nice daytime strain although not a heavy hitter if you need to combat insomnia.
