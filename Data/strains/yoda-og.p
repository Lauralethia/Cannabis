VI finally found MY medicine. \u000a\u000aI can&#39;t sleep because I have an active imagination because I have depression because my life is out of control because I can&#39;t sleep.\u000a\u000aIf this sounds like you and you&#39;ve tried all other natural remedies, give this a try. \u000a\u000aI first started using marijuana to help me get a good rest for work because I get insomnia from depression and generally a very active imagination. \u000a\u000aI started with Skywalker, then Kong Louis XIII and now to Yoda OG. This strain is the best I had for sleep. It drifts me off into a meditative, peaceful and relaxed state. Before I know it a natural rejuvenating sleep arrives. You don&#39;t even need to use a lot. \u000a\u000aThis one is a bit rough on the throat compared to the others but I cherish it the most.

VDisclaimer: (long winded review but I want to give people a good idea of what this is Bc I thoroughly suggest it)\u000aWarning: unless you don&#39;t have SHIT to do avoid this during day time hours. \u000a\u000aBefore this I&#39;d had some unimpressive &quot;OG&#39;s&quot; so even though the smell punched me through the bag I wasn&#39;t expecting a particularly unique or powerful high. I was  very mistaken. At the time my tolerance was high so I figured on taking a couple Raws to the face no prob. Rolled up &amp; went to an outdoor spot to take a stroll. I started my walk &amp; lit the j, I took 4-5 casual pulls off the joint &amp; started absolutely zoning out. Mind went blank, I stopped walking &amp; started staring at my feet so I had to pause the j. Eventually I finished the joint but I was moving in slow mo for most the rest of the day. The back of my head, eyes, shoulders, &amp; neck were so deeply heavy I was almost asleep standing up at 11 AM. This is MEDICINE, not something you wanna rip a bowl of then go to work. Out of everything I&#39;ve smoked, this is BY FAR the most potent indica I&#39;ve had. (For those that care about smell &amp; taste read further) -&gt;-&gt;-&gt;The smell was LOUD, decomposing, stenchy, damp, gassy. Hard to explain taste but I remember it being very lightly sweet but more on the earthy/wood/spicy range. The standout was that it left me with a pleasant almost coffee like after taste. HIGHLY recommend this. If you been smoking for a while a few hits might not end your day but I&#39;d still consider this a pain/sleep/anxiety medicine, not really an all day smoke. Far too potent. Hope this helps!

VYoda OG is one of my favorite strains. Just like the description declares, it is good for anxiety and insomnia, and a little goes a long way. High quality YODA OG has a slightly tangy finish and does not generally have the negative side effects of some strong INDICA strains (excessive dry mouth and dry eyes with some). The only downside I have discovered is all YODAs are not the same. LOOK at the buds before you buy-if scraggly, go for Afghan or Hindu as they are similar.

But, for people w back injuries and have muscle spasms all over this is a good heady bud that even reaches all the way down my back.

VLineage: OG Kush Strain\u000a&quot;Smoke this strain you must,&quot; says Yoda. One of the most indica heavy OG crosses, Yoda OG is not for the faint of heart (or those who are on the dark side). Expect the classic OG flavor profile with a pungent punch of citrus on the nose. On the tongue, this bud tastes similar to the swamps of Dagobah with an earthy woody flavor that is wonderfully pungent. Yoda&#39;s high is a happy relaxed high that&#39;s perfect for nighttime, and Yoda is known to incite the &quot;munchies&quot;.  Medicinally, Yoda&#39;s gift of hungriness works wonders for those suffering from digestive issues, as well as those seeking relief for stress, pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety, PTSD, Crohn&#39;s and ADD/ADHD.

VVery powerful Indica, like most it knocks out the pain, anxiety and for me anyways, imflamation. It did the trick with a flavor profile that of OG Funk with slight minty undertones. Tastes great in the inhale as well as the exhale. Very good for night time use, but I can function through the day, most likely because I use it before work as well to get me chipper and my imflammed joints, back mainly. Great all around.

Doesn&#39;t teach you to use the force, wield a lightsaber,etc.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Some sleepyness and minor couch lock,but manageable. Regular draw &amp; exhale. Taste is flowery/earthy, little hint of pine and also hints of grapefruit/lemon. \u000a\u000aI would recommend for pain and relaxation. No real sativa head effects other than calming the mind. Pleased I was, try it you should.

VVery impressed with yoda. A great indica that is very strong and sedating. Yoda gets me really high in a way like I haven&#39;t felt in a while. Gets me nice and tired too. Very pretty buds that are very sticky and frosty. If you smoke the right amount there is couch lock and can possibly be a knock out strain for insomnia. As an insomnia sufferer, I highly recommend this strain. Has a little bit of a unique high as well. The high actually gets stronger as time passes, reaching its peak at about 30 min after you smoke. For me, i usually get the peak of the high a lot quicker. So this is a pleasant and different high for me. Awesome strain. I rate it a 4.9 stars as far as indica&#39;s go. Give it a try.

V5/5 would highly recommend!\u000a\u000aIf you have Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) like I do, this is seriously the perfect strain. Just 15 mins ago my legs started getting extremely antsy and I could feel my anxiety worsen. Remembering a review on leafly about yoda og helping anxiety, I decided to try switch out the cartridge I was smoking and put yoda og in. Within 4 hits of my vape pen (I\u2019m a seasoned smoker so it takes me a little more than others), my anxiety had vanished entirely and my legs were absolutely numb. Hell, they couldn\u2019t be restless if they tried! I\u2019m now in a great mood, and while it\u2019s late and I\u2019m sleepy, I\u2019m enjoying this strain so much that I don\u2019t want to sleep quite yet! Going to watch a Disney movie and bask in this goofy and pleasantly numb high!

VYoda is a great nighttime high. It keeps you somewhat talkative but relaxed, where you can stay up or go to sleep depending on your mood - the high will conform to it. Smells amazing but tastes like hay. Use out of a vaporizer for full effect and great taste.

V5/5 would highly recommend!\u000a\u000aIf you have Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) like I do, this is seriously the perfect strain. Just 15 mins ago my legs started getting extremely antsy and I could feel my anxiety worsen. Remembering a review on leafly about yoda og helping anxiety, I decided to try switch out the cartridge I was smoking and put yoda og in. Within 4 hits of my vape pen (I\u2019m a seasoned smoker so it takes me a little more than others), my anxiety had vanished entirely and my legs were absolutely numb. Hell, they couldn\u2019t be restless if they tried! I\u2019m now in a great mood, and while it\u2019s late and I\u2019m sleepy, I\u2019m enjoying this strain so much that I don\u2019t want to sleep quite yet! Going to watch a Disney movie and bask in this goofy and pleasantly numb high!

VI first tried vaping at 380 but it was meh so I got creative and made a vape bong using a plastic tube I bought for 50 cents at Lowes and a water bottle so I could crank up my vape to 420 deg without getting throat burn. I have to say it made a huge difference! I haven&#39;t had that stoned feeling in a long time. I recommend anyone who likes to vape for health reasons but misses that stoned felling, make one of these. Only 4 stars because the strain was good but not the best I&#39;ve had.

The relaxation was so strong I used the desk chair with wheels to wheel myself into the kitchen to make dinner. Getting up seemed like too much work. The effects made me too foggy and relaxed to focus on anything though. That is the one negative. I laughed a lot and slept like a baby, but the brain fog is not my jam.

VThe force is strong with this strain.  Yoda OG is a heavy, psychedelic indica that produces one of my favorite highs.  The body high of this strain made it difficult to get up off the couch, but wiped away pain and stress.  Unlike many indicas, this strain was not mind-numbing, but had an trippy, enjoyable visual component to its high. Together, the mental and physical effects of Yoda OG produce a fun, enjoyable high that made me feel like I was cruising the galaxy from the comfort of my own living room.  This strain would be the perfect choice for watching Star Wars, or any other out-there sci-fi film. Those looking to use cannabis medicinally may find that Yoda OG relieves pain, stress, anxiety disorders and spasmodic disorders.

VThis was the second strain I ever smoked and I split a bowl with my brother so we each got about three hits. Went back inside and waited and felt fine when everything became funny and I remember laughing about how Tommy pickles from rug rats was so fucking scary looking. Then a massive pit enveloped my stomach and I was ravenous for food. I ate so much I gained 8lbs the next day. If you want a classic indica that&#39;s just down right good and trustworthy then YODA is for you. Also the eighth I bought had about four huge nugs in the jar, each one was sticky and coated in crystals making it look like frosted sugar. The smell is a combo of pine and earth. It smells like a fresh green forest.

VYoda will show you the ways of the force. Just three hits did it take for me to start speaking with wacky sentence structure and get introspective and calm. I can see how this strain is recommended for nighttime use, as I could have passed out with it easily. Not a conventional social strain, but strong enough to get you giggly and goofy while hanging out with a few friends if you don&#39;t mind zoning out for long periods of time as well.\u000a\u000aFor me, the high set in quickly with a mildly dizzy head buzz that tapered off after 15-20 minutes. If you don&#39;t like feeling dizzy, you may have to practice deep breathing for this one. Once the initial wave of intensity passes, the effects settle like a heavy fog of euphoric relaxation. Great for listening to music, watching a movie or just passing out. I continued to puff at it through the evening. It&#39;s definitely a couch lock and munchies strain. For me, munchies prevailed over couch lock and I got into cooking some potato pancakes for the whole household.\u000a\u000aNOTE: This stuff really makes me cough. It has very sticky buds, and the high amount of resin and terpenes tickles the back of my throat more than other strains.

VVery good strain. It definitely makes the mind and sight fuzzy in the classic way, it might be advisable to sit while inhaling. The smell is a light mossy pine, this ends up being a more subtle smell of than is typical for cannabis. The too smoke is very smooth, and will slap you in the face with a few big hits! If you continue smoking, this feeling will move over the top of your head to the back until you feel a buzz behind the ears. At this point you are might be meditatively couch-locked with light a smile over your face, consider listening to tribal music and sitting indian-style. Try it.\u000a\u000a

VI&#39;m not usually into indicas, but this stuff is pretty great. It&#39;s just hella relaxing. It also takes away my headaches. And it&#39;s fun to smoke; big puffy white clouds. A lot of people said it made them sleepy, but I haven&#39;t had much of that. It just makes me really chilled out. But I can still do things, I&#39;m not really couch-locked. However, It does make it slightly hard to concentrate on anything for too long without spacing out. I found that it wasn&#39;t very potent and it didn&#39;t last very long. My favorite thing to do is smoke some of this late at night and put on a record and just layback and enjoy. Absolutely no paranoia with this one.

VTasty, it is! I give it 4.25 stars. Tastes...green? That&#39;s the best way I can describe it. Sweet and green! Superb for anxiety and depression, so-so for nausea and pain. But definitely a fun and social kind of smoke, the kind where you want to hang out with friends and chat over video games or movies. I think this would be a really great strain for parties, especially where anyone deals with social anxiety.
