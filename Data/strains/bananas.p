VThe high is a Creeper, taste good and is a great night cap. I was asking myself if I thought I was medicated and then BAM, my spaceship rocket boosters were half way down to the ocean bed. It&#39;s bananas son!

VI really enjoy the full-body relaxation I get from this strain. I have muscle spasms and TMJ syndrome and I felt like my muscles were slowly melting into butter. I felt clear-headed but a bit paranoid with major cotton mouth. I would recommend as a bedtime strain.

VIm reviewing this bananas and cream crumble from &quot;tru|med&quot; in Phoenix and it is truly truly dank. Honestly one of the 20 best concentrates I have ever used in my life. The high is klean enough to remain funktional with a high level of fokus. At the same time something for the end of the day to relax, wind down from pain, etc.... Truly an all around great strain. A definite must try.

VI got the Pure Vape disposable pen in the flavor Banana Smoothie and it was awesome! I haven&#39;t gotten high in forever, so I was a little paranoid at first. This strain legit taste like banana&#39;s which I wasn&#39;t really expecting. I asked the budtender if she&#39;s had these before and she said yes and that it won&#39;t give you much of a cough. This was all true! The only thing is to be careful how much you take in if you&#39;re a beginner because I barely took one puff and I was pretty high for a good few hours. It also gives you MAJOR dry mouth! Overall, I really like it!

VThis strain was nice. It gave me the giggles and left me happy and in a good mood. Overall this strain is perfect for gathering even though is didn&#39;t taste like bananas or anything it still hits hard (in a good way).
