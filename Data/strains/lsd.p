VThe LSD strain is a pleasure for all your senses , it starts the second you open the bag !!! The smell is such a treat for the nose. The flavour and taste was a fresh citrus it was like sucking on an orange / grapefruit . The buzz was strong and consistent a treat for all

V\u2022 Currently enjoying AGL&#39;s T-22.88% indica-leaning hybrid &#128293;&#127802;.. smokers, beware! This is a heavy-hitter all around: flavor|pungency, smoke|exhale, psychotropic|cerebral 5\u2b50\ufe0f-strain DEF best suited for those not prone to anxiety. While it somewhat-helps to slow adhd-motor in my brain, it&#39;s a TON racier than most hybrids, as it revs mental activity, not physical.. best suited for daytime medicating \u2022\u000aLow terpenes, skunky, diesel-y \u2014&gt; if you&#39;re an &#39;ol-timer who loves a harsh, heavy, heady high but not the 12 hr commitment of a real lsd-trip, then this is your &#128168; smoke!&#128076;&#127995;\u2022 &#128293;&#128163;\u270c&#127997;\u2022

VBy far the best herb i have ever smoked. The nugs were pretty good size, and for how potent this herb is its relatively cheap. The nug itself was a nice shade of greed with small orange hairs and a decent amount of crystals. Upon exhale, my body went numb. Now i usually trip mildly from any weed, but this weed, wow. About a minute after exhale i felt a strong tingle sweep across my whole body, followed be nice visuals. The room sort of swished back and fourth, and i had crazy thought about like falling into mirrors and stuff of that nature. An amazing strain i would only recommend to strong smokers.

VThis strain is exactly as advertised. It smells of a nice pine/earthy smell with only a hint of orange but as soon as its ground up, you can really smell the citrus notes. It&#39;s a very smooth smoke, not too much coughing from this one. It takes a bit to feel it come on but when it does, it feels amazing. It starts with a body high that closely resembles a buzzing feeling and then the cerebral effects start to kick in and it&#39;s at first hazy but then calming and uplifting. It felt like all the bad from a long day of work just disappeared and was whooshed away. Overall, it&#39;s one of my favorite strains so far and I would definitely smoke it more. Strongly recommend it, especially if you are one for a more psychedelic experience, then this will easily be your favorite.

VThis strain is a must. Potent and heavy. It started for me in the head with a soaring euphoria then about an hour later, a nice warm body buzz kicked in to round out the experience. The name of this bud really does reflect its naming, due to heightening of the senses. LSD hits on almost every characteristic a patient is looking for: taste, effects and duration of high. From stress to pain this strain will treat you right. In large dosage LSD really will induce an &#39;outer-body&#39; experience so to speak.

Physically, you feel light as a feather...yard maintenance is actually fun.  You&#39;re also in a mental state that I can only describe as bliss.  Focusing is easy.  Spiritually uplifting which is the best thing about cannabis (when it happens) in my opinion.  Definitely buying this again.

VThe particular phenol type I started only grew to approx. 4 1/2 feet. Extremely leafy, but covered in crystals. It smelled heavily of flowery mint with a diesel finish. After cut and dry the aroma changed into a strong skunky diesel, mint still lingering on exhale as well as a bit of lime. As for the high, definitely good for pain, muscles feel a bit more relaxed than I like but lack of spinal pain is a massive plus. Cerebral is an understatement when it feels like I am experiencing the neurons firing while I type this. Does have an effect on vision, I noticed my magnification ability to see small things was clearly improved as I could see what I normally see on a 60x mic, although I am not sure if this is person dependent. One a side note Trichs are in abundance but are not as sticky as you would think. Trimmed an entire plant with one pair of scissors and not once had to clean them. Oddly when you touch the plant its soft as a babies face, then quickly becomes sticky like glue.

VInteresting strain. Didn&#39;t enjoy the first two joints, third one was the charm. That&#39;s the similarity to LSD that I see, you have to weather the storm a little to understand what&#39;s going on and then you can enjoy. Energetic, mind opening and focused high, slight euphoria, does not negate negative thoughts very well and the warmth is short lived. In that respect, I would recommend this strain to try as it is an interesting high and can provide recreational value, but there are much more entertaining strains out there. One thing I loved though was that it brought the techno side out of me, could not listen to anything else. Dominik Eulberg boiler room if anyone fancies a listen whilst smoking this strain. Overall 3/5, I would smoke it in the future but there are plenty that provide more pleasant highs.

This strain can be a heavy hitter; despite the buds seeming mediocre in the crystal department. So take small doses first to gauge the buds potency. \u000aThis strain will be one of the first I grow for sure!\u000aMake no mistake; if you&#39;re looking for a strain that will keep you focused, relaxed, stress, and pain free; LSD will not let you down.

VFinally got to try some of this recently. And I gotta say that for a strain with such an intense moniker, ehhhhh.. gotta say I was somewhat, well... underwhelmed. &#128317;\u000a\u000aObviously with a name like &quot;LSD&quot;, there&#39;s an awful lot to live up to, big shoes to fill when you&#39;re named after a completely different substance that is known for it&#39;s rather.. mind-bending effects.\u000a\u000aThe 3g I bought were grown indoors too. I also purchased two &quot;Space Cakes&quot; (Gourmet Dark Chocolate brownies with approx. ~250mgs of THC each (which I really think was either a padded approximation or the guy just didn&#39;t know what the hell he was talking about. Made from butter using same strain.)\u000a\u000aIt was covered in HUGE trichomes all over  and smelled nice and sweet, but nothing particularly unique scent-wise.\u000a\u000aNow, the taste was sweet, a tad skunky, and a little Lemon/Limey. Really pleasant actually! The effects most definitely take on a psychedelic/visual edge, but personally I found that I had to smoke a pretty good amount to really get myself launched into the orbit I belong in.\u000a\u000aAs far as the edibles went, again- good, not great. Just not too impressed overall personally. \u000a\u000aBut I&#39;m considering purchasing a clone of this strain and see if I can&#39;t grow it better myself! If I do and it changes my opinion on this, I promise to write a new review!\u000a\u000aStay Burnt\u000a- BONG THE RIPPER

VMost potent strain I&#39;ve ever smoked and i have smoked plenty. When i pop the jar open it has undertones of strawberry, bubblegum, grapefruit, diesel and skunk. the buzz is very psychedelic/body numbing, Feels like a beginners stone but stronger if that makes sense. With a medium/high tolerance the buzz lasts me 3-4 hours with a very mild comedown. \u000a                                    Highly recommended!!!      \u000a\u000aOh yeah my dude had b.o.g. seeds version (NYC Diesel x Lifesaver) which is stronger than barneys IMO.

A wee bit dry but it was near the bottom of the jar. Not very stinky, but sweet and floral. Vapor was musty citrus. Mild effects began almost right away, and within 10 minutes of vaping my world was shifting. My senses were extra sharp. Pain was gone. I went from creatively focused to bizarre to day-dreamy and back again. And &lt;blush&gt; was I ever horny!  Every O was bigger and longer than the last. The high has mellowed since then, but my wife doesn&#39;t know that and set a limit. All for $30 an 1/8th!

It is a beautifully balanced strained that can be used Day or night! It tends to creep up a little on you as well! This wonderfully tasty treat is not to be treated lightly if you are a novice and it has a relatively high CBD with some THC&#39;s going up to 24%! A must watch list strain! Highly recommend!

VStrongly Indica-Dominant, Mazar x Skunk #1\u000a\u000aThis dark Indica green bud is covered in trichomes.  Smells of pine and citrus.\u000aTrue to its name, this strain has a bit of a trippy cerebral quality to it, with an increase in visual acuteness and energy  The spacey feeling in the head died down after the initial attack and left the review staff with a very relaxed body that was capable of standing and being active or sitting and being lazy.  An almost analgesic and numbing feeling came on as it wore on, and our reviewers noticed great relief for back pain and tension \u2013 along with that came a late-arriving feeling behind the eyes that carried into the somewhat \u2018down\u2019 ending of the effects.  It was also good for fatigue, general relaxation, and body looseness (great before exercising).

The first hour i was cleaning my room pretty detail oriented, the next thing I know im in another world and the space queen. Cant wait to try this  when at a concert or going out :) Highly recommend if you ever see good quality LSD to give it a try! My boyfriends thoughts are as follows, &quot;this is some of that funky skunky sweet cheese, that will blow your mind. Smoke one bowl be back in your chair in another world thinking about the next thing you want to do. New fav sativa on our list.&quot;

VHad a nice herbal, piney taste upon inhale/exhale of a joint. The high was the strangest I have ever had from smoking weed. Initially I felt a sativa-like rush come on, as per usual, but then I just closed my eyes and zoned-out for a good 20-30 minutes. When I opened my eyes I noticed definite but fairly mild visual changes, almost like an acid trip but nowhere like as strong. Also my head and body felt weird. This strain made me very disorientated and dizzy. I was able to walk fine but I knew I&#39;d smoked some damn hot stuff. This was a very interesting smoke, and I&#39;m glad I tried it, but for me, the buzz is too weird and didn&#39;t make me feel very euphoric or give a sense of well-being, so this is a strain I&#39;d not choose to smoke often.

VOne of the best highs I&#39;ve experienced so far; made me the COMPLETE opposite of drowsy and lazy! I tripped quite a bit, things were moving around a lot and I was more susceptible to hallucinations on this than on any other bud I&#39;ve had recently. I didn&#39;t even notice I was buzzing whilst sat down, until I got up to get some water and I was like &#39;holy mother of god&#39; because everything was going pretty quick and everything felt really good. I didn&#39;t get the munchies on this, which rocked because all I&#39;ve been doing is eat with weed! (which is bad haha) Recently I&#39;ve been feeling really sleepy and heavy when I&#39;ve smoked really dank haze (which is what I&#39;ve been having a lot of in the last week) but LSD weed was so much more uplifting, and made me super happy. Definitely going to incorporate into some edibles and see how this varies from Sour D in some Peanut Butter Brownies!

VMy number one strain. Smoked this out of my caregivers huge bong took two really big rips, and the journey began. We were driving down the street and he was driving me home because I was extremely medicated and as we were listening to rap music, I thought that I was in Grand Theft Auto 5 for some reason, this may have been because I had just gotten the game, but never the less this strain was ridiculous. Do not pass this one up if you can get it at your local dispensary or from your caregiver. Very &quot;trippy&quot; high that last very long.

VRead all the reviews and decided to take it slow with this one: I just took two hits about 15 minutes ago. It took about 5-10 minutes to hit. I spaced out for a good 5 minutes and then looked at the clock and realized I was high, so I&#39;d say it&#39;s good. I feel very clear-headed but also very relaxed in the head. My anxiety and depression seems to have left my body, and yet I am still as completely clearheaded and awake as I would be sober. Someone else left a review that said &quot;I feel completely clearheaded, but also completely stoned&quot; or something along those lines and it feels like a perfect way to describe the high. It is a very spacey high, where you&#39;ll feel your brand literally wandering off, not taking anything too slow and not anything too fast, at just the right place to examine the thoughts around you without overdoing it. Definitely recommend. Will update if I can remember to later tonight.

Vvery good strain to get heavily medicated. very nice heavy body buzz, and and smooth relaxing head high. bud is very golden with loads of crystals and very sticky. pretty smooth smoke on inhale and a little harder on exhale. very hashy, piney and skunky with a nice earthy aroma. no visuals like others claim but I&#39;ve been smoking on and off for over 20 years, but still a very nice heavy overall strain. great for pain and insomnia or relaxation.

VI picked this up from a recreational shop called rainier on pine in Tacoma,WA and let me tell you this is the best recreational shop in pierce county that I know of... They always have some top shelf quality buds at least $12 a gram, it&#39;s kinda pricey but it&#39;s worth it when you want quality selections and feel like going somewhere else... Anyways to the point.. The nugs were covered in trichromes and  it tested at 18.9% it has little blotches of purple overall  it&#39;s an attractive specimen... A little dry was harvested two months ago and was probably bagged for a decent while (only downside to rec marijuana) stored in bags.. But has a earthy, sweet, pungent flavor profile ... Overall a beautiful strain.

VShe has a spicy taste like Mazar but strong cerebral effects like skunk #1. I don&#39;t know if it was just cold outside but after two tokes I started to dance to the dope beat in my head to keep warm. I was warmer and I made some new friends. The only thing stopeing MNB from getting five stars is the same problem Holistic Remedies has with everything I have sampled; they don&#39;t flush their ladies enough to bring out their full essence. They are getting better and once the base demand is filled the growers should focus on honing their craft. Faith in Holistic Remedies has been restored! \u000aBTW I have to thank the growers for taking the high road and renaming the strain LSD to Merry N&#39; Berry (America&#39;s Mayor) rather than choosing to grow Green Crack and calling it that. All though some green crack would be perfect when spring rolls around. They can name that after the Canadian Mayor.

VShort Review: Great lemon pine scented buds that takes a few minutes to take hold but soon lifts you into a cloud filled realm of relaxation and peace that can float you into a deep calm sleep. Caution: Food can be avoided but once you start eating you may find it hard to stop.\u000a\u000aLong Review:The bud was light green with vibrant orange pistils, as it cures longer is has grown darker to an almost purple color near the center of the bud. Upon opening the container it is it it hits you with a rich and heavy lemon pine smell. I ground it was a Space Case and vaped it with a Pax-2. The first hit came on warm and clung to my tongue making it almost feel weighted. On the exhale it left my mouth almost wet wanting for the lemon flavor and smell to return. After around five to ten minutes it takes effect and can lift you up quite rapidly. It can almost be such a rapid change that it you might find yourself saying &quot;Snapple...I&#39;m High As!&quot;. The high last few a few hours with a nice floating sensation that can drift you between conversations. Couches and other comfy places can absorb you in but won&#39;t keep you on total lock-down. Falling sleep is very easy and results in a restful and deep sleep. All and all a classic that I will continue to enjoy for quite some time.

VThis is the craziest weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. I literally tripped balls on marijuana. One of my eyeballs kept getting bigger, my knees pulsed out radio waves you could almost see like the yellow first down line on televised football. Spent the night feeling like my legs were being stretched with my feet glued to their spot on the fabric of the space-time continuum and my body falling into oblivion. Realized this morning that I was feeling my body going through spaghettification at the event horizon of a black hole.  Not even gonna get into the body tingle effects. HOOOOOLEEEEE SHIT.  Pack a bowl, light up and say high to the glowing orb that&#39;s going to interrogate you in your dreams.

VBy far one of my favorite strains- washes the day right off of you! Very nice euphoric cerebral effect and tension release. Makes things that seemed like a big deal before you smoked not such a big deal after all. This strain is excellent for depression, mood disorders and stress- you feel happy for no reason whatsoever and it completely resets your mood. Effects lasted around 2.5 hours and are pretty instantaneous after the first hit. Find your zen, peace, and stress relief with this beauty!

VI&#39;ve been growing this strain continuously for a year.  I was just about to faze it out because I crave variety and it doesn&#39;t yield a lot.  Then, I revisited this site and saw how many people love it, which encouraged me to keep this special strain for the long run.  Everything you&#39;ve read is true and the flavor is &quot;underrated&quot;.  You might want to watch your doses on this one until you get used to it (I honestly couldn&#39;t fathom doing a &quot;dap&quot; of it).  In larger dozes I&#39;ve had some awkward moments when drinking alcohol.  On occasion I&#39;ve had a high that was strobe-like coming on-and-off like a fire hose.  All that said, it is hands down the BEST daytime indica.  If it takes somewhere weird for awhile just let go and surrender to the experience and enjoy what will follow.  pufferfish420

VModerate Dosage\u000a\u000aOverview: \u000aStarts with a pleasant sense of elevation and a feeling that there could be more. This is the only similarity I found with real LSD. And makes me want to smoke more to see if I could reach the stratospheric heights I remember. But... the experience changes into a sense of intensity, detachment and uncertainty.\u000a\u000aTime Dilation: Moderate...\u000aCreativity: Low...\u000aMind: Clear...\u000aFocus: Moderate...\u000aMood: Calm...\u000aEnergy: Moderate...\u000aDuration:Moderate...\u000aInsight: Would be profound but the sense of detachment dramatically weakens the impact... Was finally able to balance it out with some Afghani CBD.\u000a\u000aIf you want something that has more profound psychedelic insight try Nebula, Lemon Thai, Cannalope Haze.

The intent was to plow the wife but we ended up laughing at each other for two hours. Smooth draw, with an almost citrus flavor. The cheesy dank smell from the freshly ground bud was refreshing and pleasant. Definitely going on my top 5 list.

VI got to try this strain when I was on vacation in Colorado. Picked up a lid from Good Chemistry-aurora and the high just me away! This strain is a perfect example of psychedelic weed. It doesn&#39;t affect your body too much in terms of that &quot;stoned&quot; feeling, the high is predominately cerebral and powerfully trippy. Walking around Denver and the mountains with this strain was incredibly fun. LSD makes everything look sort of saturated and oddly interesting, and your mindset is goofy and care free. In terms of flavor, it&#39;s a little funky and earthy. Definitely would buy again!

VPicked up some nice LSD in the boonies today, stinky lemony scent in the jar and a really good size bag with fat buds. If I smoke this one when I&#39;m already energetic then it gives me an energy boost. If I smoke it when I&#39;m tired I find it&#39;s high thc content makes it a burner weed for me and I just want to laze. Took a blast in the bong and walked the dogs at the lake, smoked one on the beach and got a nice cerebral high, a head focused stone that went nice with the cool fall breeze. Was able to motor around for a while in the sand and then headed home without feeling super tired or worn out from the walk. Dry eyes was the only issue for me. I&#39;d prolly rate this one a 3.8 when I&#39;m up and a 3.4 when I&#39;m down hehe but overall I&#39;ve found this is one of the more reliable strains in the dispansaries.

VVery nice strain. This is the first weed I have bought in over seven months. The reason for this is because I was put on gabapetin for nerve pain I was having. However while I was on this medication smoking was impossible. The combination of the two drugs caused some very bad side effects that I did not like. Ok now to the review. I really lucked out having the first green I have had. Excellent body high, and it crushed both some anxiety and depression I have been suffering from. Effects last a decent amount of time and are not in my opinion to be very overpowering. Ahhhhhhh just what I needed I missed my green with a passion

VLemon sour diesel is great for a day and time body if you&#39;re looking for something that will motivate you and get you up and going LSD also known as lemon sour diesel will do that for you.  It&#39;s a very different in terms of the effects.  Think of this as a clean non dizzy clear head high.  The first few times of me trying this bud it left me concerned simply because it didn&#39;t Medicate me to the standard I&#39;m used to being medicated to.  It&#39;s great for first timers not too bad for occasional users but if you&#39;re a chronic user need something a little bit stronger,  overall I feel happy the buds look nice they have lots of fluffy calyxes in structures the taste is floral with a little bit of skunk.  If you&#39;re in the area and want to try something of legend lemon sour diesel aka LSD will be a happy adventure.  The only negative&#39;s iVe found with this is that it makes me a little bit tired and drowsy drive mouth and dry eyes of course. Other than that fantastic!

Effects are immediate in the head, great sense of well being and peace of mind, while at the same time lots of euphoria and happiness.

VDo you remember the first time you got really, really high? I do. I was only 21 and didn&#39;t know much about Marijuana world. I tried to speak three languages at the same time and confused everyone around me. It felt like my face was melting away and my body floating in the water. It was both amazing and a bit unsettling.\u000a\u000aThat said -- LSD strain reminded me of that time. The buds are the stickiest I&#39;ve ever touched. I knew I was in for  something different. At the same moment, I could almost hear my old college professor going &#39;Don&#39;t touch the Buds without gloves! You&#39;re wasting it with oils in your damn fingers!&#39; -- He was always right, but truth be told, I didn&#39;t expect this to be so sticky. The same way I didn&#39;t expect a college professor with a Ph.D. to tell me &#39;Don&#39;t call me a doctor. That&#39;s stupid, I got a first name, don&#39;t I?&quot; \u000a\u000aHe was really intelligent and really down to earth; even when he called half of the school&#39;s MJ users &#39;morons&#39; for touching sticky buds with their bare oily hands. \u000a\u000aI laughed off the name &#39;LSD weed&#39; thinking it&#39;s a marketing gimmick, but I can see why they went ahead and named it after something that&#39;s whole other experience. LSD OG is a very potent Indica-dominant strain that somehow works just as well as some daytime Sativas. You can treat it as a daily or night-time smoke and that said -- LSD is truly something special.\u000a\u000aThe effects are quite cerebral and uplifting. This can be a strain that relieves you from social anxiety and depression, but it can also be as useful for shy and introverted folks who want to get super focused on their favorite book, show, movie or music playlist while tuning out the rest of the world (or even going out and facing their fears head-on.) From about 45 minutes into it, the cerebral stimulation will certainly persist, but you will also feel powerful body-numbing effects that are no doubt extremely valuable to patients suffering from aches and pain. \u000a\u000aYou only need a little bit of it to feel relaxed and stimulate your brain so don&#39;t go balls to the wall trying to ingest too much of it. Save it for a special time, as LSD-strain is a special type of Indica that should be consumed on special ocassions. As far as &#39;negative&#39; effects go. I don&#39;t know what to tell you. I didn&#39;t feel &#39;off&#39; other than for your basic dry-mouth. That said -- Marijuana, over the years, has made me consume a lot more water in my body which yielded amazing benefits as far as skin health goes. I now laugh when people say &#39;dry mouth&#39; is a side-effect. Yeah -- it&#39;s a side-effect the same way a &#39;fart&#39; is side-effect of eating too much fiber. DRINK SOME WATER, IT&#39;LL DO YA GOOD. \u000a\u000aLike my old college professor used to say &#39;Don&#39;t be stupid and mix good Marijuana with something shitty like Alcohol.&#39; He was right, ya know. Alcohol is a depressant, Marijuana is not. Keep some water near you, it&#39;s the nectar of Gods.\u000a\u000aOver-indulgence with this strain is not really recommended from my point of view. It comes from Mazar I Sharif (legendary city in Afghanistan before some evil people decides to destroy it) and Skunk #1. The high-energy buzz for an Indica, is once again, truely something special. Treat it as such.

VAsked the babes at RED MED for something to pick me up as I was going to throw a poolparty with some friends. Tried it the weekend before on my own and I went swimming under water by myself for like an hour. Haha. Amazing! What a kick! Only negative I would say is I had trouble going to sleep. Simply because my brain was so active, awake and alert and ready to party or go mountain-climbing. Needless to say the poolparty was a success. Great strain, highly recommended but felt like a strong Sativa. Be ready to party all night on this.

VPicked up some nice LSD in the boonies today, stinky lemony scent in the jar and a really good size bag with fat buds. If I smoke this one when I&#39;m already energetic then it gives me an energy boost. If I smoke it when I&#39;m tired I find it&#39;s high thc content makes it a burner weed for me and I just want to laze. Took a blast in the bong and walked the dogs at the lake, smoked one on the beach and got a nice cerebral high, a head focused stone that went nice with the cool fall breeze. Was able to motor around for a while in the sand and then headed home without feeling super tired or worn out from the walk. Dry eyes was the only issue for me. I&#39;d prolly rate this one a 3.8 when I&#39;m up and a 3.4 when I&#39;m down hehe but overall I&#39;ve found this is one of the more reliable strains in the dispansaries.

VI personally grew this strain out for a total of 4 months, by far is my favorite right now. 1 female in a 3 gallon smart pot gave me 4.2 ounces of dried flower that had the amazing smell of vine ripe grapes. The high is very energetic and everything becomes more vibrant. She is potent with ThC @ 24% and CbD of 1.4, she is definitely not for the novice. Barneys Farm LsD is my favorite strain at the moment and I suggest that anyone that can indulge take advantage!

VThe LSD strain put me into an intense quiet and meditative mood. I pulled the plant a bit early and the effect was still calming and relaxed. Good for physical pain as well. Smells warm and sweet almost like dough, candy, and pine. Easy to focus and stay operational while on this. Really enjoy this strain overall.

VLSD = [Skunk #1] x [Mazar] (fyi, Mazar = [Skunk #1] x [Afghani Kush] ) ...great flowery flavor with almost a bit of spicyness in the aftertaste &amp; extremely pungent floral aroma that covers the room after a minute or two of having the container open; really smooth when smoked, and the buds i have are totally trychrom&#39;d out..fair number of orange/rust hairs through the bud with splashes of dark purple leaves amidst the medium green..the high is really light so far..i&#39;ve only taken about 3 hits and am not really feeling too much.. (i usually smoke kush strains so 3 hits typically gets me started right..)......k, finished the bowl (maybe7-8hits?); it&#39;s finally settling in..it&#39;s a lot more &#39;&#39;slow&#39;&#39; (i guess) than i anticipated..not exactly a lazy high, but not really energetic either..i guess &#39;&#39;relaxing&#39;&#39; is the best way to describe it..i sps this bud is good for those days off when all you&#39;re doing is playing videogames..i wouldn&#39;t day-time smoke it if you have stuff to take care of though; it&#39;s just too slow feeling..but, aside from the massive creeper effect, this bud is definitely worth it just for the taste &amp; how smooth it is..if your dispensary has it, i&#39;d recommend picking up a gram &amp; trying it out

VThis strain is definitely in my top three.  A very strong cerebral high that kept me lifted. the buds I got were covered in trich&#39;s and made for a very heady high.  I rolled it and smoked it and halfway through I could feel it really hit the eyes.  It was a harsh hit but it was a sweet and kind of sour flavour.  Then I felt it in my face a lot. I was smiley and all around just a happier stress free person.  I did get a little anxious at times but it wasn&#39;t too serious, and was calmed with some smooth music.  I can also report feeling very creative, I had many ideas for sketches and designs while high.  I give the a 4/5 review for the fact that it was a long lasting high, energetic, and sweet.  But also sparked bouts of anxiety.  Other than that a very good strain. I would definitely recommend.

VToo often, sinister forces press on our minds and hearts. Life deals us all blows, and daily disturbances are a reality for many.\u000a\u000aThe cannabis strain LSD is an excellent remedy for stress, anxiety, lethargy, depression and PTSD. I felt energized and optimistic. Watching music videos and eating seafood pretty much proved to be Heaven on Earth, and I officially adopted Steve Harvey as a spiritual family member while watching daytime TV, while (FINALLY) sewing that clothing pile that needed mending.\u000a\u000aAs a self-employed multi-tasker and Mom, it helped things flow smoothly. Paired with a cup of coffee, it was the perfect wake and bake.\u000a\u000aI will definitely keep this strain close by, and in sufficient quantity. \u000a\u000aFire acquired from MCC Noho

Just a couple hits and your mellow and comfortable but keep passing and this Hybrid and it will glue yo ass to the couch! Listening to music is like being front row at the concert and yes everything is funny as hell! My new favorite strain! &#128526;

VSkunky tasting and somewhat very dry and hard to inhale. This is dominant in wood and skunk textures for taste. Makes it ideal for day time use only can&#39;t get up and move around take some of this and be pre-paired to be energized. Great for taking care of chores and the routine if you have fallen off track somewhat or completely off of the rails. Its a creative one for sure keeps me uplifted and happy helps with add, depression and fatigue. very small dark hairs and dark green leaves smells funky and citrus like.

VLoved this strain, I was unaware it was a hybrid. Smoked like Sativa, and gave me the most intense high of the three strains I picked up (The other two Blue Dream and Sage and Sour). I was a little stuck, giggling at the movie I was watching. I&#39;d say for light weight smokers this might be a little too strong to smoke and leave the house. Might be a little obvious to others you&#39;re on another level.

VThis is a great tasting strain.  A delicious blend of sweet citrus notes splashed on a skunky signature base delivering a perfect balance of flavor.  Its high delivers a pleasant cerebral euphoria effect combined with a subtle body buzz but without the couch lock.  Its combination of indica and sativa together with its seductive aroma makes this a strain hard to beat.  Definitely one of my favorites by far.   Growing this strain on the other hand was somewhat a pain in the posterior: very short, stumpy and bushy with a lots of foliage.

Vthis strain truly lives up to its name ive always wanted to try this strain since reading about it in high times about a decade ago so i was pretty stoked when i got my hands on it this strain literally gives you mild visuals reminiscent of the beginning of an acid trip even the anxiety which is the only reason i gave it 4 insted of 5 stars the visuals and the euphoric high definitely out weigh the anxiety and i have anxiety disorder so i really hate that feeling definitely one of the more fun of the strains ive smoked but if you have really bad anxiety stay at home when you enjoy

VI had this particular strain on a moon rock which is a bud dipped in LSD oil and LSD keif. moon rocks can be made with any strain but I have gotten a doc&#39;s og with LSD and it wouldn&#39;t stop smoking. strong high so I couldn&#39;t tell what I felt other than relaxed and Spacey. good for a buzz to lock you down but again the oil and kief were LSD so I felt a small dose of racing thoughts but nothing bad.

Vbeen smoking and growing this strain for bout 8 months now indoor and outdoor , very potent and relaxing. grows very large outdoor and produces large colas,  indoor out produced most other hybrids. \u000avery dank smelling during veg and bloom, bug and mildew resistant, large colas a bit prone to rot if not addressed. \u000adefinitely have sativa on hand to counter this heavy indica.

VSince I first heard the name it made me sceptical... The weed is weed, right? So I didn&#39;t believe the hype. And when someone gave me this to try I got what I expected - a heavy, potent indica strain that slows you down and relaxes your body, makes you drowsy. No doubt it was potent. After I smoked enough all I could think of how high I was, and it made concentration hard - I failed to watch &quot;Magnolia&quot; on this weed. Than before falling asleep I experienced some closed eye visuals. This would be perfect for those who seek unconsciousness on a couch and reliable stress relief.

At one point, I was interpreting what he was saying back to him;  I vaguely recall that being useful to him somehow.  Then I remember waking up next to the dining room table when my friend found me after searching the house.  He thought I was invisible or trying to scare him.

VPicked up an 1/8 for $35 at Arizona Organix. Read a bunch of reviews and was happy to find these nugs. I&#39;m not the flowery, descriptive type. I smoke, heal and enjoy. I took two hits from a pipe and within minutes felt pretty f&#39;n amazing. I was about to get couch locked, but my family pulled me out the door. The buzz lasted a good while, but the intensity fell off fast. Later I smoked a J and can&#39;t say I got the same buzz. No matter. I&#39;ve got enough to try and enjoy a few times, but I&#39;m not sure this strain overcomes my love for GSC.

So I needed something to pick me up. I smoked some before I went to work and I had one of the worst days I&#39;ve ever had and was smiling all day long. I could handle the pressure since I&#39;m pretty much a manager at my store.  The high kept me super happy and gung ho. I felt like I could do anything and the entire time I felt very relieved. nothing could bother me. this strain is great if you have a very tough day

VLSD, where do I begin with this strain. LSD is one of the greatest products that I&#39;ve had the opportunity to try if not the best weed I&#39;ve ever came across. The look of this weed is so signature that every time I see it I already know what I&#39;m looking at. It posses a very earthy, musky, skunk scent which brings me back to real plain and simple weed. LSD is a true gem amongst other strains. The high that comes from LSD is also truly amazing as it sticks true to its name and makes the user feel as though they may actually hallucinating. Everything about the LSD high is perfect and it will never dissapoint. It will forever be remembered as one of the best strains I&#39;ve ever smoked. 5/5. Perfect.

VToo often, sinister forces press on our minds and hearts. Life deals us all blows, and daily disturbances are a reality for many.\u000a\u000aThe cannabis strain LSD is an excellent remedy for stress, anxiety, lethargy, depression and PTSD. I felt energized and optimistic. Watching music videos and eating seafood pretty much proved to be Heaven on Earth, and I officially adopted Steve Harvey as a spiritual family member while watching daytime TV, while (FINALLY) sewing that clothing pile that needed mending.\u000a\u000aAs a self-employed multi-tasker and Mom, it helped things flow smoothly. Paired with a cup of coffee, it was the perfect wake and bake.\u000a\u000aI will definitely keep this strain close by, and in sufficient quantity. \u000a\u000aFire acquired from MCC Noho

VJust tried it for the first time. I was supplied medicinal grade from Auroramj.com. thc 21.67% and cbd .13%. Beautiful buds in an effective 10 g sealed container. Very nice cure and moisture content. the effects are of course what you&#39;d expect from a sativa dominant hybrid. even so I sleep well on it and find the effects uplifting but relaxing. Good for pain. Causes an appetite. Too much and I get a headache. Has some nice spicy, earthy and sweet flavours when burned. Vaping is a more candy sweet kind of XP,  depending on your temp. Beautiful burn with a nice rich smoke. As the roach gets oily it gets a bit coughy, otherwise initially very smooth. Would make some nice BHO due to good oil content. I think I would also make some butter with it. All in all a very pleasant medicinal XP thanks to an exceptional job by Canada&#39;s licensed producer Auroramj.com.

Vthis strain truly lives up to its name ive always wanted to try this strain since reading about it in high times about a decade ago so i was pretty stoked when i got my hands on it this strain literally gives you mild visuals reminiscent of the beginning of an acid trip even the anxiety which is the only reason i gave it 4 insted of 5 stars the visuals and the euphoric high definitely out weigh the anxiety and i have anxiety disorder so i really hate that feeling definitely one of the more fun of the strains ive smoked but if you have really bad anxiety stay at home when you enjoy

I was a little stuck, giggling at the movie I was watching. I&#39;d say for light weight smokers this might be a little too strong to smoke and leave the house. Might be a little obvious to others you&#39;re on another level.

VIv read some mixed reviews on this strand. What I had smoked was indoor and had the strongest smell of any strain iv come across (100+). I like to rate the buds by how many sandwhich bags it takes before you stop smelling it. this was a 4 bagger. The high was a true 1 hit quit. The grower refused to continue cultivation due to overly potent smell. In my 16 years of blazing, nothing has blown my mind like this (except maybe indoor GSC).

VI am an older user and pretty sensitive to the impact on my health and sexuality.  I  would not suggest this for older users as  it has an adverse impact on male sexuality at least.  It gives a very heady high that is very psychedelic.  It has some minor body tingling as well.  I did notice a large, adverse impact on my libido and drive, which also translated to an adverse impact on my exercise routines.  Not  a good product for older users

VI&#39;d call this &quot;omfg, right?&quot;. I read a lot of these reviews for this product and was curious. I can get some for $2 right now, so tried it, despite having low expectations. Well. This really is trippy and psychedelic. Immediate head rush, tightening sensation, followed after about 15 minutes by a body high too. For me, I don&#39;t mind being introspective and quiet. I usually smoke by myself. I do not use weed at all to &quot;socialise&quot;. So this LSD (THC 20.2%) is available for a good price, so I thought I&#39;d experiment. I was a little apprehensive, since some of these reviews are very pointed in their emphasis of the effects of this strain! \u000a\u000aI had the best visual imagery, as others said, light and colours are amplified. I sat and watched the afternoon autumn sun as it moved across the sky, and how the leaves on these beautiful huge trees outside my window changed colour and brightness as the sun moved. See what I mean? I was just tripping! Often, I&#39;d interrupt the silence in my quiet home, hearing myself say aloud, &quot;Oh, my GOD!&quot; as the video inside my skull took me time-travelling through my past, reminding me of people and things I have not thought of for decades! \u000a\u000aI knew it was not recommended, based on what I had read and understood, but I wasn&#39;t going anywhere until I knew what this strain does to (and for) my brain. As it turned out, I could not have anyway! NO WAY I am safe to go out of the house on this! I wouldn&#39;t even consider driving stoned, but this one, for me, I know me! I can see myself getting lost in my own neighbourhood if I go out superhigh on this shit! But I was safely ensconced in my home, food here if necessary (although there were no munchies, for me, with this), chores done (at least, that&#39;s my story, and I&#39;m sticking to it!). So I smoked it in a bong, and for four or five hours I smoked more and more, I overdid it deliberately! I was unable to walk in a straight line, I cannot imagine trying to make sense on the phone or in person unless the person with me had been smoking with me. You know how that goes?\u000a\u000aI was tripping between what I was seeing on the tv screen and what the video in my head was playing! The two were kind of merging. I actually &quot;fell asleep&quot; (actually more like passed out) in my chair which I NEVER do! For about 20 minutes I was totally out. I &quot;woke up&quot; and decided to go to bed! I hit the bong again, about 3.30am, and slept through until 7.45am which is over an hour after I normally get up. No grogginess or fuzzy-headedness, which I did expect after smoking that much yesterday. Nope. No heaviness at all. I will most definitely NOT use this often, but I do think I&#39;ll go and grab a quarter to keep in the freezer. One of the the things I do like about all the strains we have is the way we can so easily customise and personalise the strains to find a way to control how we feel, and what effect we want, according to what we need to do, and want to feel. But this is not an every day strain for me, at all. I do think it will be very fun, esp as the &quot;holidays&quot; come around. I can&#39;t wait to see what secrets this shit unlocks in my brain, as the holidays with the smells and colours and repeats tv shows that are inspired to provoke nostalgia. I will certainly be conducting experiments with this over the coming season, and looking forward to it!

VDefinitely going to be a go to for me. \u000a\u000aThis strain left me with a slight buzz all throughout. I have chronic pain and muscle spasms, and this helped relax and ease my body so I don\u2019t feel as sore or stiff.\u000a\u000aI also suffer from anxiety and depression, and I definitely recommend it for this use. For me personally, it left me feeling with ambition and energy to do things, and being a drummer in a band, I felt good enough to want to play for a couple hours.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s bright earthy smell is strong but pleasant, and will leave whatever area you\u2019re smoking in smelling for a few hours for sure!

VI had this strain in the form of a wax cartridge. I really enjoy this strain because I feel relaxed, but it is more of a Head high. This strain is good for any time of day because of how even of a hybrid it is. It tastes and smells a little dank, so be careful if you aren\u2019t wanting a smell. The high itself has a lot of visuals.

VI explained to the bud tender that I was a recreational user, and that I was a pen and ink artist who needed to concentrate. Her recommendation was LSD. Pretty funny. The smell was bright and promising: there is excellence in this bud! The taste, while not objectionable to me, has a slightly \u201csoapy\u201d quality that lingers in the bowl, even as the weed burns down. Not a harsh herb, in just a regular bowl it burns smoothly. The high is exactly as advertised, some \u201cbody\u201d effects, but mostly in the \u201chead\u201d. Pretty much what I read, and she said. What I would add is to me it awakens my thoughtfulness, I feel \u201cquiet\u201d in my head, but still busy, very busy. I would recommend this to anyone, but for an artist, I would not choose this to finish that highly detailed drawing, or for a mechanic tearing down that transmission, I would go look for some Girl Scout Cookies.

VLSD overall is a fun creative uplifting strain. I try to pick up this kaleidoscopic bud whenever it comes in (the batch I&#39;m reviewing was bought at Lighthouse Organics 7.2 grams for $65 on 17 Jan. 2018). Lime green nugs laced up with dark orange almost brown stigmas all dusted heavy with a blanket of crystal resin trichomes. Big beautiful bouquet of cookies and flowers with a hint of mint and lime. Not sure the THC content but the effects suggest the level is very high. Would recommend for those who respond well to strong cerebral Sativa effects, great for a creative boost, mood elevation, depression and other heady ailments. A definite must try

VI had this strain in the form of a wax cartridge. I really enjoy this strain because I feel relaxed, but it is more of a Head high. This strain is good for any time of day because of how even of a hybrid it is. It tastes and smells a little dank, so be careful if you aren\u2019t wanting a smell. The high itself has a lot of visuals.

VI didn&#39;t get tgis strain as bud, but I did get my hands on some terp sauce made from it and holy shit is this some amazing concentrate. the cerebral effects are very strong, and the body buzz is comforting and well balanced. I do get why they named it LSD as it is a such a strong psychoactive high that it does feel somewhat psychedelic. One of the best highs I&#39;ve had in a while, if you want a great cerebral high with comforting and well balanced body effects that has a uplifting, creative and somewhat psychedelic high you should put this strain on your bucket list.

VHaving some long ago experience with LSD, I felt that the name couldn&#39;t possibly be representative.\u000a\u000aI was surprised to experience a very mild yet unmistakable tinge of a psychedelic state. It was amazing to reach back almost 4 decades and recall vivid memories on this.\u000a\u000aEven though the most common phenotype is considered indica-dominant, I felt no sedation whatsoever. The mental effect was clear, light and attentive. There was NO sense of being stoned, messed up or lost in space (as fun as that can be sometimes).\u000a\u000aI generally don&#39;t taste all the subtleties that some do, but this strain was fairly tasteless and a little reminiscent of alfalfa. Good thing I don&#39;t smoke or vape for the taste.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s now on my A list due to it&#39;s unique character.

VI have grown LSD from Barney Farms twice now and it&#39;s just as trippy every time I&#39;ve tried it and grown it.\u000aThis strain will take your stress and worries and lose them as your brain is transported to a galaxy far far away. This strain is unique in its cerebral effects without making you feel jittery and nervous. You have to give this strain a try, if for no other reason than it&#39;s name \u000a

VMy first attempt at vaporized MM.  I have not used anything beside prescriptions, as prescribed, in about 15 years.  The pain relief and high lasted about 2-3 hours and I watched TV during that time.  I did not have hunger pains but I ended up eating a lot of pizza and cheese bread so it did increase my appetite.  Overall a good experience and I will add a more revised rating after more experience.

Within a few puffs of this my anxiety was none existent, my body relaxed and my mind clear with an overwhelming sence of happiness.  For me this is a wonderful daytime sativa that does not cause me to get tired and really assists with my moods. I got mine from MedicalClub.ca. Check it out!

VI&#39;d call this &quot;omfg, right?&quot;. I read a lot of these reviews for this product and was curious. I can get some for $2 right now, so tried it, despite having low expectations. Well. This really is trippy and psychedelic. Immediate head rush, tightening sensation, followed after about 15 minutes by a body high too. For me, I don&#39;t mind being introspective and quiet. I usually smoke by myself. I do not use weed at all to &quot;socialise&quot;. So this LSD (THC 20.2%) is available for a good price, so I thought I&#39;d experiment. I was a little apprehensive, since some of these reviews are very pointed in their emphasis of the effects of this strain! \u000a\u000aI had the best visual imagery, as others said, light and colours are amplified. I sat and watched the afternoon autumn sun as it moved across the sky, and how the leaves on these beautiful huge trees outside my window changed colour and brightness as the sun moved. See what I mean? I was just tripping! Often, I&#39;d interrupt the silence in my quiet home, hearing myself say aloud, &quot;Oh, my GOD!&quot; as the video inside my skull took me time-travelling through my past, reminding me of people and things I have not thought of for decades! \u000a\u000aI knew it was not recommended, based on what I had read and understood, but I wasn&#39;t going anywhere until I knew what this strain does to (and for) my brain. As it turned out, I could not have anyway! NO WAY I am safe to go out of the house on this! I wouldn&#39;t even consider driving stoned, but this one, for me, I know me! I can see myself getting lost in my own neighbourhood if I go out superhigh on this shit! But I was safely ensconced in my home, food here if necessary (although there were no munchies, for me, with this), chores done (at least, that&#39;s my story, and I&#39;m sticking to it!). So I smoked it in a bong, and for four or five hours I smoked more and more, I overdid it deliberately! I was unable to walk in a straight line, I cannot imagine trying to make sense on the phone or in person unless the person with me had been smoking with me. You know how that goes?\u000a\u000aI was tripping between what I was seeing on the tv screen and what the video in my head was playing! The two were kind of merging. I actually &quot;fell asleep&quot; (actually more like passed out) in my chair which I NEVER do! For about 20 minutes I was totally out. I &quot;woke up&quot; and decided to go to bed! I hit the bong again, about 3.30am, and slept through until 7.45am which is over an hour after I normally get up. No grogginess or fuzzy-headedness, which I did expect after smoking that much yesterday. Nope. No heaviness at all. I will most definitely NOT use this often, but I do think I&#39;ll go and grab a quarter to keep in the freezer. One of the the things I do like about all the strains we have is the way we can so easily customise and personalise the strains to find a way to control how we feel, and what effect we want, according to what we need to do, and want to feel. But this is not an every day strain for me, at all. I do think it will be very fun, esp as the &quot;holidays&quot; come around. I can&#39;t wait to see what secrets this shit unlocks in my brain, as the holidays with the smells and colours and repeats tv shows that are inspired to provoke nostalgia. I will certainly be conducting experiments with this over the coming season, and looking forward to it!

VI am an older user and pretty sensitive to the impact on my health and sexuality.  I  would not suggest this for older users as  it has an adverse impact on male sexuality at least.  It gives a very heady high that is very psychedelic.  It has some minor body tingling as well.  I did notice a large, adverse impact on my libido and drive, which also translated to an adverse impact on my exercise routines.  Not  a good product for older users

VIv read some mixed reviews on this strand. What I had smoked was indoor and had the strongest smell of any strain iv come across (100+). I like to rate the buds by how many sandwhich bags it takes before you stop smelling it. this was a 4 bagger. The high was a true 1 hit quit. The grower refused to continue cultivation due to overly potent smell. In my 16 years of blazing, nothing has blown my mind like this (except maybe indoor GSC).

VAphria&#39;s LSD is everything people said it was and more. All positive. No negative trip here. Better than a mild buzz lets you stay focussed and uplifted.

VFelt a head rush immediately after the exhale. Cerebral high lasted hours. My body felt &quot;heavier&quot;... This shit had me giggling at the dumbest shit on YouTube  (somehow I ended up watching public access tv show prank calls).. Buds are dense, on the darker side, and covered in sugary goodness with a strong pungent smell. Very hunger inducing. Fell asleep nicely after the high started to lessen.

VIt is an amazingly psychedelic as hinted at by the name. Incredible sweet berry smell that is almost overbearing, seriously one of the best smells I&#39;ve found, not just bud. The smell and amazing physical characteristics such as light green leaves with loads of crystals/visible trichomes translate directly into the taste, which is smooth and extremely sweet and flowery. I wish I had more of this stuff because it ranks just under my favorite strain Death Star.

VLSD&#39;s Indica side hits in a really relaxing way. I&#39;ve always noticed it easing the tension off my back and shoulders like a heavy coat. This relief usually slides on up to me right after the sativa side blows the stress out of my mind.\u000a\u000aIf you want a nice high that hangs around and touches you in all the right places you need to at least try this weed.\u000a\u000aSmell is very nice too!

VLSD is a highly cerebral sativa; it&#39;s uplifting, energizing and euphoric, all without any trace of anxiety.  It&#39;s a very smooth smoke. easy on the lungs and throat.  This one doesn&#39;t pack any noticeable body effects, so it&#39;s better for mood and creativity than for pain.  The only drawback is that although the high is potent, it&#39;s not very long-lasting.  This is a elegant strain, not one of the brutes.

VI ordered this strain from Tilray and it took me quite  few uses to really get a good feel for it.  I definitely prefer to smoke this all rolled up rather than in a bowl.  In a bowl i get a good hour of of complete relaxation followed by a desire to munch out and then head to bed.  However rolled up i get a completely different vibe; Im relaxed but not couch locked, i can complete fairly simple tasks, and find my brain wandering in all sorts of different places.  The high is happy as long as you can keep to happy thoughts.  The only bad experience i had on this strain was out camping.  Decided to smoke before dinner, had a couple drinks with dinner and then attempted to smoke again later on in the evening.  This brought on severe nausea followed by my drinks and dinner fertilizing the campground.  I do really enjoy this strains aroma and flavour, definitely a great daytime strain as long as your not looking to be overly productive.

VI explained to the bud tender that I was a recreational user, and that I was a pen and ink artist who needed to concentrate. Her recommendation was LSD. Pretty funny. The smell was bright and promising: there is excellence in this bud! The taste, while not objectionable to me, has a slightly \u201csoapy\u201d quality that lingers in the bowl, even as the weed burns down. Not a harsh herb, in just a regular bowl it burns smoothly. The high is exactly as advertised, some \u201cbody\u201d effects, but mostly in the \u201chead\u201d. Pretty much what I read, and she said. What I would add is to me it awakens my thoughtfulness, I feel \u201cquiet\u201d in my head, but still busy, very busy. I would recommend this to anyone, but for an artist, I would not choose this to finish that highly detailed drawing, or for a mechanic tearing down that transmission, I would go look for some Girl Scout Cookies.

VMy first legal Oregon purchase! What a time to be alive, right? I smoked a small nug with a friend and we had a blast. The flavor profie was that of your standard sour diesel, but had a hint of a citrus taste as you would expect from the name. Aroma was earthy and refreshing. It gave off a nice mellow high. We enjoyed lounging on the couch, watching movies, but once the mild munchies hit neither of us could get up for food. There are some minor almost psychedelic effects, for me I feel like I&#39;m underwater, and had major synaesthesia. Have snacks on hand for sure!

VLSD has an amazing flavor, I have had many sativas with a lemony flavor, but this one takes em all.  I swear when I vaporized this on, it tasted just like sucking on a lemon wedge.  Great sativa activities, it gave me all the sensations of a good blast off.  Then it left me with nothing but relief.  This was from Tilray, I found the flavor too strong for me.  It&#39;s something in the way they dry it.  I was experiencing a lot of nausea during the time, which it was great for controlling, however it affected my appetite for such strong flavor.  \u000aOn a different day, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem.  The sour Diesel brings the earthy dank smell to the nose, but it&#39;s the citrus that shines through upon grinding. \u000a\u000aThis one really accentuates the ties between hops and cannabis.  \u000aHey beer companies, this would make a wonderful summer easy drinking beer.

The lime comes through in the taste along with skunk on the exhale. Started with an active head high with brightened colors and then creeped into a stoney heavy eyed stupor. I Would recommend this strain for kicking back and watching TV while smoking or chilling with friends matching on a blunt. Causes paranoia after smoking awhile, also doesn&#39;t offer alot medically, more of a recreational strain.

VThe definition of hybrid, if ever there was a definition. To me, a solid head high that comes on immediately, followed by tingles and then full on body buzz after a few minutes. Such a powerful split can have you torn between doing errands around the house and what not, and chilling on the couch watching old re-runs. A definite new favorite

VIf you&#39;re looking for something with &quot;psychedelic&quot; effects, you may want to skip this and go with a Sativa. I haven&#39;t found LSD to be as advertised; it&#39;s a pretty standard Indica in every respect. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s still a quality buzz, just not the intense head-high I was expecting. I&#39;ve been using this as a sleep aid for a few months and it&#39;s been very effective in that regard. A couple of bowls 30 minutes before bed and I sleep like a baby.

VLSD not for me.  I prefer a good sativa with the mental uplift it brings.  This strain just did not get that for me.  I am guessing the indica side of this strain is what affected my buzz.   So if you are looking for the mental focus that a straight sativa delivers LSD is not quite there.  Nor was there much more to it than a simple buzz with some body effect and a touch of mental uplift.

VIt&#39;s light leaves and bright orange almost light white coloured in those hues. Very compact buds tough to really use on my grinder kind of clogged it. Vaping the last of my LSD it&#39;s 14.93% THC and 1.10 % CBD it&#39;s tested and has a lot and a batch number they we&#39;re having a sale and who could pass up LSD Pine and smells of fresh lime and grass clippings. Herbal textures and taste of lime and skunk pungent and I kind of have a liking to this type of taste it&#39;s odd, but it just gives me a lot of motivation and happy uplifiting Euphoric effect&#39;s and it lasts quiet a while I love LSD and it&#39;s effects. I am glad to have clean medicine  from a despensary I trust I love how it&#39;s not over powering like some variations. On top of getting the THC levels right this is also THE LSD genetic strain I just love how happy it makes me. Love it for a depression killer and a motivator and pain modifier for sure very interesting; dense vape lingers around for a while almost like a cartoon movie lol.

VEasily one of my top 5 strains. Very strong head high as well nice even body high that keeps you relaxed and alleviates pain.  Smell is reminiscent of a nice smelling flower, especially when ground up.  I definitely understand the &quot;Chemical&quot; taste when smoking it and, while I am a seasoned smoker, this strain had me struggling not to cough with every hit.  What it lacks in taste, however, it makes up for in effect as it hits you hard and keeps you in a happy and giggly mood for multiple hours.

VAh..LSD. Tried this originally in flower form. Let&#39;s just say the high was more vivid than that shitty porn company no buddy fucks with anymore. Very cerebral, very heady. Sort of like when a novice bartender pours a beer. You might say there was more head than one of those vivid videos I mentioned a few seconds ago... my sense of time is also completely askew. Where the fuck are my keys? *Wallet, no keys, got my phone*Shit. Eating saltines now with Franks red hot, and I ain&#39;t even broke! In conclusion, this strain had me like Syd Barrett after the first time he did acid and now I have little floaties in my periphery. Also if anyone finds my keys let me know. It&#39;s for my Chevy Aveo and there&#39;s a few slices left of my hot and ready I&#39;d like it get.

VIf Five Alive and lemon Pledge had a baby, that&#39;s what this strain would smell like. The main flavor profile is nutty and woody, but there is a hint of tart citrus. The high is cloudy and sedative. This strain gives you a light face tingle, but leaves you feeling &quot;high... but so what?&quot; It is relaxing and carefree, but don&#39;t smoke if you plan on trying to be productive. This strain would be suggested for night time use.

VA unique strain that gets old fast. The effects were similar to a very mediocre trip, making it a great smoke; however, a whole gram was tiring. The effects are wonderful and I would recommend for all to try, but it gets boring, so don&#39;t expect it to be a favorite.

VI wouldn&#39;t recommend this strain to anyone. I believe Medical Marijuana serves a purpose to help the person whose ingesting it. This strain is a Creeper first off. It takes about 10mins to kick in and then it fades in with a happy kinda giggly euphoria and a bit spiny and dizzy aswell. Then the sativa hits super hard and starts your heart POUNDING with Huge Paranoia. The heart pounding last for about 30 mins it fades into almost a tingly numb feeling throughout your body and you feel tired but you almost cant quite moving. So your tired and wanna go to sleep but you cant quit twitching WTF. absolute horrible strain. OFF OF 2 Hits wtf. It is potent though.

VNot that special in my opinion.  LSD is definitely not the proper name for this stuff.  I am not feeling very euphoric, but my tolerance is so damn high that I don&#39;t feel most of many effects currently.  \u000a\u000aLike pretty much any pot I have ever smoked in my life, this strain makes me wanna chill and listen to music.  I can&#39;t seem to get enough of Metallica&#39;s self-entitled LP from 1991 since going to The Orion Music Festival in past weeks.  Too bad I didn&#39;t have any real LSD that night.  Now that would be something worth writing summary information on.
