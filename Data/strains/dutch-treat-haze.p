VFloral, fruity, slightly earthy and LOUD. As far as hazes go, this one is top notch. Three hits and I was good to go for the day, long lasting euphoria with pulsating visuals when you close your eyes and sativa dominance is apparent in its energetic wonder.

VThis strain is probably one of the best in Colorado.  It is certainly my favorite of all time.  I like everything about this strain, the look, the taste, the smell, the high.  Sativa dominant, sweet potent smell and flavor.  A very heady long lasting high.  The buds are very sticky and sparkle under light.  Top shelf, for me it doesn&#39;t get any better.

VI had tried Dutch Treat before, but I retained no memory of it\u2014whether it was a forgettable strain, sub-par bud, or just so good I can&#39;t remember shit about it\u2014I&#39;ll never know. So many strains smell like lemons and pine, and Dutch Treat Haze does too, yet without any chemical traces. I know calling a flower floral is redundant, so I will say it is herbal and smells splendid and sweet. It looks fantastic in the jar\u2014very fuzzy and well trimmed. \u000a\u000aI was about to join friends who were drinking (in moderation but enough to be good and buzzed). And since I generally don&#39;t drink, I wanted to feel the relaxation without losing focus on my good friends around me. This strain had that rare combination of both soaring high and the functionality and focus of the best sativas. I didn&#39;t need any stoner-rewinds in the conversation. As they went from buzzed to drinked to drunk, I was rolling back the tape for them. I&#39;d say I got at least three hours before I came back down to earth and decided on a little night-cap indica. In that span of time, I managed to sit them down and decide (by committee) on which hike we were going to tackle at Zion Canyon the next morning\u2014what should have felt like herding cats happened naturally and effortlessly. It wound up being a great decision too (only my ankle disagrees!). \u000a\u000aThis bud had a moderate dose of CBD (1.12%), which make this suitable for mild anxiety and pain. I had no munchies\u2014though I had just eaten supper. I had energy, but no jitters, no blues, no racing heartbeat. I&#39;m a seasoned smoker and know when to save a Dutch treat for an hour later. So still take it easy with this one if you&#39;re new to smoking and/or suffer from panic attacks. Though not the heaviest slugger in the game, this was still very potent at 22.23% THC. Great combo of taste and effects for $35/eighth.

VThis one made us amorous and giggly. We had so much fun just playing in the park. Definitely a good beach day strain or strolling through nature or good, slow sex. We later smoked this one with my 84 year old uncle, and he perked up and was acting 30 years younger. Picked up in Seattle as a pre roll.

VI ended up with a B orC Grade quarter of this enticing strain after . I guess I first learned about it when I was really high probably 15 years ago and it tripped me out. My mind went on a tangent about everyone walk ing around the streets and  in the cafes of Amsterdam could all be smoking the same stuff - Would we all/Do they have the same experience? Is everyone in the same mood? Is there a tangible wavelength of smoke if it settles? How dope would that be... It&#39;s 80%indica, I think, but it acts 50/50. I have energy to write weird sh*t like this... It&#39;s not that strong in my opinion, but it&#39;s a good mood.... Think about it...! lol

I could just be sleepy from the anesthesia they gave me yesterday tho ha. Gonna nap now cause I feel super calm.
