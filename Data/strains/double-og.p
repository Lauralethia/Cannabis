VThis strain was really good, the taste is something im not a fan of, but still, it does relax you a lot, the mouth dry is kinda strong, so keep that in mind.\u000aAfter the effect starts to run out you will feel really sleepy, i just had the best sleeping experience in the whole year, this thing is really good, something you must try out.

VA top three Indica. Body and mind at ease this is great for evenings. Mild flavor on inhale and a nice sour exhale. Big buds as well. I believe the oz was five buds.

VMade me feel very light-spirited.  Not sure if this actually gave me the munchies or if I was just really hungry from the day, but I ATE.  Very dense nugs, with a sweet yet sour aroma.  It definitely had that under the radar skunk smell, and the taste was sweet and earthy like I\u2019d hoped for.  Great for a sweet and sound sleep - made my body feel yummy and lucid.
