VBreak out the coffee, newspaper, or online news (or whichever you trust).  This immediately puts me into a clear, responsible, and somewhat relaxed &#39;heady&#39; high, ready for me to relieve pain and stay focused with every morning that I give it a nod.\u000a\u000aFocused is the word here.  Not cloudy, nor rattled by anxiety or pulsating heart rhythms.  Not worried by what may come this day, but a nice, clear buzz without anxiety.  Blood pressure stays normal, which is not the case will all sativas, just don&#39;t over do it.\u000a\u000aAs an Indica fan I praise this strain for it&#39;s ability to keep one maintained with eyes on the prize, yet leaving you feeling like you just had a most peaceful morning, assuming you don&#39;t use too much of this fine medicine.\u000a\u000aMine cured for about 5 months, giving a most pleasant smoothness, with trichomes bursting out of every pore.  After a month or so it still smelt like fresh cut grass, but with many months of curing it became a top-shelf strain, worthy of the same bud than wins top-dog at many competitions.\u000a\u000aIt was more like candy after a 5 month cure.  If you are lucky like me you will get some fresh-cut bud that you can cure yourself to make it worthy of 10 stars, otherwise it is much like anything else that you get commercially, without proper curing.  Either way this has potential to become the next best thing in the Sativa world.  Much luck with this strain, and much Love!

VECSD , is on the milder side of potency , but not too mild  , its a sativa that keeps you happy , focused , uplifted , with just the right amount of euphoria ; it&#39;s not so overwhelming that your zombified with such intense euphoria . A perfectly balanced Sativa , better than original sour D. in my opinion . \u000aAs a 99% Sativa smoker , this is definitely one of my top 3 favorites .

VThis strain continues to blow me away in every facet one rates their bud on.  Dr. Greenthumb has a cut that&#39;s tested 30% THC (not sure if it was just THC, THCA, or sum of both) which is nuts! This strain also looks amazing along w/ smell n taste. Done correctly it&#39;s just a flawless strain IMO, but newbys beware it can b intense cerebrally. So mayb skip this one if ur new to the scene.

Also smoked a bowl-- clear headed but very euphoric, almost like a pain pill. It made me super happy. Very potent stuff. After a good two hours of this feeling of bliss, I fell asleep fit the night.

VGrowing up around the NYC area in the 90s/00s, weed was weed until Sour Diesel. For me and a lot of people I know, it was the first strain you could tell immediately if it was actually the strain they said it was or not (pre-dispensary days) thanks to it&#39;s distinct diesel/citrus smell and flower-like crystal covered nugs. Gets your mind spinning with a pain relieving body buzz. Tried to look online to see the difference between ECSD and Sour Diesel... good luck on that, but ECSD is exactly what I remember. It&#39;s been surpassed but still a balanced classic.  4.5/5

While it was a bit harsh for me on the uptake, the sweet sweet exhale was crisp and right-on \u2014 a true diesel at heart.. full-on earthy and lemony-citrus. Agree that this one is best-left to the &#39;ol timers, and it&#39;s definitely not for those with cannabis-induced anxiety. (+ I specify bc I have general, social anxiety.. as well as ptsd + trauma dreams.) Def recommend for fellow diesel-lovers (with a tolerance!) &#128077;&#127997;&#128077;&#127997;\u262e

VI&#39;m a everyday smoker and can see the positives everyone speaks of, but personally the head high was not a pleasant one for me. It was somewhere between headache and anxiety with just discomfort. I smoked to pep me up before cleaning and had to smoke indica just to regulate. Maybe it was just this batch, but be cautious if sativa does not agree with you. Great taste tho

The perfect strain for someone who struggles with motivation and depression. You kinda crash after witch can be good in some cases.

Very, very nice strain....provides a happy, buzzing, focused feeling. At one point, I almost felt as if my brain did a back flip it&#39;s that cerebral lol (not in a bad way). It lasts a long time but I find it makes me feel a bit burnt out when wearing off so I only used it in the evenings after work.

VI think this strain is dope. One fat one did in 6 seasoned smokers. I&#39;d say the THC level was around 17% THC by volume.

VThis strain has instantly become my favorite Diesel!  Definitely the best tasting of the Diesels IMO, love that spicy little kick you get at the end.  \u000aGreat morning medicine, very positive and motivating head change.  I feel focused and ready to go!

VLove this!  I couldn&#39;t get over how smooth this was to smoke; was not harsh at all, even at the roach phase.  Didn&#39;t really get the munchies,  I felt happy as hell, invigorated and major giggles.  Went for a long walk with my boyfriend and didn&#39;t feel lethargic at all.  Highly recommend!

VA light sweet flavor. Makes you really creative - had epic idea after idea, and it keeps you energetic. Not sure if it&#39;s a good sleeping bud, going to find out and post another review tomorrow. One of the best buds you can get in the East Coast.

VA true diesel strain. Has a fruity diesel gasoline smell. Along with diesel taste to go with. Real uplifting stoney cerebral high. Lasted for couple hours with no burnout. Great offshoot of diesel.

VLike that third tier friend you call when you have no one else to hang out with, Sour Diesel is always there, but hanging out can sometimes be an ultimately disspiriting experience. This strain always leaves you feeling like you should move to a another city to start over, as you sip your iced coffee and stare at the sun extinguish itself over the Williamsburg bridge. Still, this old standby is good for movie watching and bike riding. Less good for social occasions, which turn one into a blurry-eyed silent monster.
