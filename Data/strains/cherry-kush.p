VI&#39;ll give Cherry Kush 5 stars simply because it tastes great, and I know if I need a good night sleep this girl will put me out like a light. The Cherry Kush I obtained has a deep, dark, indica effect. Not something I would do in the day, unless it was nap time. Very cherry flavor mix with a classic Kush flavor. Try it using glass to get the full flavor.

VVision immediately brightens and widens. Combined with a slow, but honed focus, you assess things as individual scenes - settling into a single perspective with no periphery. I smoked a lot at once and the effects came on quickly and enjoyably, with the exception of an uncomfortable twinge in the chest saying I did too much at once. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll settle, especially as the body high kicks up, but mind the warning. Music sounds great, extremely similar to how it sounds on acid; smooth and thick, tactile and affecting. Very good, but not best ever. Perhaps the greatest aspect is the headspace once it settles; it\u2019s certainly deadened/foggy, but also cozy, comfortable, moody, and cheerily content. Getting memories of happy times as a kid. Love the mood elevation and love the kush sensory accentuation. WARNING: Tried another batch over a year later and found it to be one of the most racy and uncomfortable highs I\u2019ve ever had. Especially at the beginning, it made everything annoy me to an excruciating degree. However, it did settle into a surprisingly euphoric hazey come down for the last 3/4s of the high. Fabulous appetite stimulant that erases your ability to feel full so you can keep eating and eating.

VI&#39;m One to believe &quot;there can be only One&quot;. And a good concentrate just needs one chance to step up to &quot;the plate&quot;. One sniff, One look. One dab on a homemade Kanthal micro vaporizer coil with a stainless steel mesh wick.  And if it&#39;s as good as this Chery Kush Oil you lean back, and you know you&#39;ve found yourself One nice corner of the Cannabis phenotype map. \u000a\u000aThough I&#39;m a big fan of the so-called &quot;Sativa&quot; branch, with its stimulating profile, I&#39;m forever looking for the perfect pheno among the Diesels, the Durbans, the Red Congolese, THAT neck of the woods. \u000a\u000aSo how about an Indica, one with less personality than most? One that will let you be yourself, but just a better yourself. Not a stoned, and not a rushed yourself. Not having to pilot through a periscope self. And certainly not a confused, brain salad kind of yourself.  Just a mellower extrusion of your best self. Well, here&#39;s One: Cherry Kush. \u000a\u000aAs one other reviewer said, and I paraphrase, if you&#39;re the kind who gets paranoid, I promise you this one won&#39;t do it. Agreed. I do rather like the &quot;me&quot; this brings out, the body sensation is divinely heavy, muscles and nerves like after a massage. Racing? no. Confused? no. Giggly or Social? no. Colors and sounds do pop. The mind is working well. The world seems more right. \u000a\u000aSleepy? No, later. Working to extrapolate, holding another (serious) toke, strong urge to cough, it feels like a blanket, the mind slows, and there&#39;s sleep ahead. I&#39;d say the last stops on the line for this strain would be couch-lock, then maybe sleep. Just like any Indica, but really sweet. \u000a\u000aI do detect a light and unobtrusive headache above the temples.\u000a\u000aSummary? A lovely Indica oil with a non-dominant personality, a helper. Mellow, friendly &amp; engaging, brightens senses, colors, a great evening cannabis, with a rich flavor.

VThe quintessential indica: strong, fruity nose; red hairs and dense trichomes; and a rich smoke that doesn&#39;t cause a cough. Effects began within 1-2 minutes with an immediate &quot;chill&quot; feeling with a veneer of euphoria. Senses of touch and taste were significantly elevated.\u000a\u000aGreat for watching a movie, sleeping, or sex. Pairs well with crisp and more mineral whites like a verdicchio or a chenin blanc from California.

VI originally purchased this as &quot;All Star&quot; which isn&#39;t an actual strain, but a brand of Cherry Kush. And come to find out there are people who call this strain &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; out in California, but in Phoenix Cherry Pie is the strain listed on Leafly (Durban x GDP). So name problems abound.... \u000a\u000aStill it bears some resemblance to Cherry Pie\u2014big, fluffy yet sticky, and about as purple. This particular bud has a dense trichrome forest covering every nook and cranny of its calyxes. It is potent just to look at. \u000a\u000aThe smell and taste of this bud has that Flintstone-vitamin sweetness amid the pine component from its OG Kush parentage. I notice that &quot;cherry&quot; is not an option on the taste selector below on this menu. This is probably fitting; I have never tasted a strain that made me think (let alone exclaim) &quot;Wow, cherry!&quot; I&#39;ll grant this one has a tart fruitiness that reminds me of sour grape as much as cherry. This strain is also fun to mix with Blueberry Kush, which really does taste like blueberries. It pairs well with a mixed berry smoothie. Because who doesn&#39;t love berries?\u000a\u000aThis has strong indica-like effects, but I&#39;m not lost in the labyrinth of my own mind. I can focus well enough. Still, I wouldn&#39;t plan on doing anything beyond a few dishes (after making a smoothie) and getting your shit ready for the next day. You will want to get something to eat before too long, and then get horizontal. This strain is great for taking things down a notch as sleepy time draws near. Tomorrow&#39;s cares stay with tomorrow.

VThis was one of the first Cherry strains that I had and it was amazing! It&#39;s a very euphoric and uplifting high that will not leave you stuck to the couch! It makes everything you do 100 times better and if you&#39;re with friends, you&#39;ll laugh more than ever. The after effects just slowly settle you down back to your normal self which is a good thing meaning you wont have to smoke more just to wake yourself up from a high that puts you to sleep on the couch.

VMy cherry kush came covered in trichomes, orange hairs, and purple/green, this was one of my favorite strain to smoke. The smell will fill the room, so make sure it is sealed properly. I have never smoked any strain with such an intense sweet, cool, and somewhat minty taste. Smoked from a joint it hits hard and may make you cough, but if you smoke it out of a bowl you should be fine. The high feels like an intense rush of euphoria, and only affects me like a sativa. It feels very comfortable, clears my head and turns me into a goofball, and it doesn&#39;t give me the jittery feeling many other strains give me for some reason. The only downside is that the effects last a short period of time for me compared to other strains. Overall, one of the prettiest, smelliest, tastiest and potent weed I have ever smoked. One of my favorites and would definitely recommend to get some whenever possible.

V Cherry Kush lives up to the name, its smoke is incredibly sweet and tastes a lot like fruit and cherries. Its high is a creeper because it will hit you about 5 minutes after the first hit and hit suddenly and hard. High is very happy, content ad thoughtful with a bit of couch-lock. Very potent.

VMy favorite strain. I can never find it. Found some today and its so fire. I&#39;m from Oregon and the tree here I feel is some of the best on earth. Cherry kush and cherry pie are two different strains though. Cherry pie is grand daddy purple and Durban poison. Cherry kush is purple Afghan and O.G kush. I really hate when people call it the same thing. Like every website is wrong. Cherry kush is normally a green color where cherry pie is normally purple.

VLove the taste it&#39;s very sweet with alot of berry flavor and you deffinetly get those hashy Afghani and earthy Kush flavors the smoke is thick and silky smooth. Cherry Kush starts out upbeat and cerebral   with a nice pressure in the forehead and temples, there&#39;s a deffinet uptick in the mood department, then slowly the energy fades as your muscles begin to relax and a warm numbness radiates down the spine... I really do enjoy a good Indica hybrid

Slightly sweet tasting on the draw and smooth as silk. It burned sure and true...no runs. The buzz was almost immediate. It started out just a mellow tingly sensation and then we both noticed the indica dominant effect, i.e. really kick into gear with a superb body buzz and a big case of couch lock. We were laughing at the head to toe wave like sensations rolling through us. Impressive as hell. Slept like babes once we dropped out for slumberland. We both will be looking forward to much more of this strain.

VPicked this up in a pre-roll...one of Willie&#39;s Reserve. A little pricey but who cares y&#39;know.  The lovely Mrs and I sparked this up and were more than pleasantly surprised. Slightly sweet tasting on the draw and smooth as silk. It burned sure and true...no runs. The buzz was almost immediate. It started out just a mellow tingly sensation and then we both noticed the indica dominant effect, i.e. really kick into gear with a superb body buzz and a big case of couch lock. We were laughing at the head to toe wave like sensations rolling through us. Impressive as hell. Slept like babes once we dropped out for slumberland. We both will be looking forward to much more of this strain.

VTaste:10/10\u000aSmell:8/10\u000aLook:8/10\u000aThis strain can be used for both being active and lazy. My fianc&#233; and I smoked a blunt of cherry pie after a fight and totally forgot why we argued and made up and went and played a game of tennis with my sister. Felt real light on my feet during the game like I was floating and was joking and laughing a lot while we played and then we got really hungry after and came home and cooked a pizza and also made soup and had cookies and other munchies. Smoked a joint after eating and felt relaxed and watch a chick flick with my girl while she did her nails. Chill night looking forward to cuddling soon &#128521;

VI am ADHD and strains tend to not react as expected.  Cherry Kush has become my go-to for both pain relief and for combating the insomnia with which I am plagued.  For me, it is particularly enhanced when using high CBD strains such as Harlequin, Cannatonic, or Harle-Tsu along with the Cherry Kush.  The high is quite mellow and pleasant.  Full body relaxing but no couch-lock.

VVery strong sweet piney smell. Green buds with orange hairs and hints of purple.  Sticky when breaking apart.,  I got this gram from Terra Canna farms and just like everything they produce, this bud looks like a piece of art.  THC percent was 15.17% so it made for a good mellow high.  I smoked a bowl right when I got up this morning and I feel rather clear headed and motivation driven, as evidenced by the length of this review.  Recommend this bud for daytime smoking or for people who just like the mellow highs, man.

VA great Indica don hybrid that knocks me out. A darker shatter, but still potent and flavorful, the fist thing that comes to mind when I smell the oil is a spicy/sweet cherry cigar. The initial high is definitive hybrid, but after about 20 minutes the indica begins to drag down. I cannot use this during the day as it will definitely make me take a nice nap. Medically it helps with pain quite well, but no other relief really. A great nighttime strain to cash out with.

VRecently tried a zip of this from one of the better local dispensaries. Dense heavy bud structure with a heavy frosting throughout. Very resinous and perfectly cured for my personal taste. Outstanding smell and flavor. The smoke when deeply inhaled has a tart cherry flavor upfront on the tongue with a slight sweet finish. I found it to be a nice relaxing head high and after a slight delay it settles into the body. I would recommend this strain if you can find a good high-quality example.

VCherry Kush is one of my favorite strains..always tasty with a heavy high..IT IS NOT the same as Cherry Pie.. Cherry pie is a completely different strain..an inferior strain that is made from grandaddy purps and durban poison..Cherry Kush is Purple Afgani and OG Kush and it is always far better in every way from the Cherry Pie.

While I didn&#39;t go to sleep on it, I think I could have easily gone to sleep despite my insomnia had I wanted to go to sleep at the time. Wanted more of this strain but my dispensary said they ran out fast. Guess its a popular strain!

VWe both found ourselves smoking three times as much just to get the right high. It left me feeling agitated and with a quick temper, especially when driving or faced with a dilemma. I also suffered from a wretched nausea every morning that lasted into the afternoon. I eventually realized that it was because I was smoking so much to feel something. Once I switched strains, the nausea subsided.

VI am ADHD and strains tend to not react as expected.  Cherry Kush has become my go-to for both pain relief and for combating the insomnia with which I am plagued.  For me, it is particularly enhanced when using high CBD strains such as Harlequin, Cannatonic, or Harle-Tsu along with the Cherry Kush.  The high is quite mellow and pleasant.  Full body relaxing but no couch-lock.

VA great Indica don hybrid that knocks me out. A darker shatter, but still potent and flavorful, the fist thing that comes to mind when I smell the oil is a spicy/sweet cherry cigar. The initial high is definitive hybrid, but after about 20 minutes the indica begins to drag down. I cannot use this during the day as it will definitely make me take a nice nap. Medically it helps with pain quite well, but no other relief really. A great nighttime strain to cash out with.

I smoked out of glass bowl and found the med worked better and tasted better than being rolled. Definitely in my top 3 right now. Very dense flower. Abit hard to grind but well worth it. I recommend anyone suffering from severe anxiety,pain,insomnia,to definitely at least try. Love it!! Will be my go to again kush.

VCherry kush has easily made it&#39;s way into my top 15 strains. Not only is this beautiful bud appetizing by name, it has the taste and aroma to back it up as well. Its almost unfair how great smelling it is. The smoke is very mellow. not harsh on your throat at all. doesn&#39;t leave any strong residual odor. If you have access to this strain, you cant go wrong with it. Definitely a must in my books.

VOkay, I&#39;ve never had a strain called Cherry Kush, but I did get a hold of some stuff a year ago called Fire Skunk for $50 an eighth. I&#39;ve been scouring the internet for the past year looking for info on this illusive &quot;Fire Skunk,&quot; and can&#39;t find it. This strain here, and all of it&#39;s reviews, ratings and whatnot, everything about it, makes me believe that I had some Cherry Kush. I was told that the strain I purchased was Skunk #1 with cherry whatever(strain, flavoring, I don&#39;t know), but I know what skunk #1 smells like, and what I had wasn&#39;t it. So, I get the jar home, open it up, and it&#39;s this god awful stench of chronic, Thee STRONGEST, I&#39;ve ever smelled, with a slight sweet tinge to it. I close the jar back up. My mom comes home twenty minutes \u000alater, &quot;You better not be smoking that shit in the house!&quot; As soon as she walked in the front of the house this happened. She came in my room, she almost gagged, I opened the jar and she had to leave the room. Later that day, I went out back for two hits, and twenty minutes later I was asleep. I don&#39;t remember anything else from that day. POTENT, and damn good for insomnia. If I didn&#39;t have Cherry Kush, I don&#39;t know what I had.

Sticky when breaking apart.,  I got this gram from Terra Canna farms and just like everything they produce, this bud looks like a piece of art.  THC percent was 15.17% so it made for a good mellow high.  I smoked a bowl right when I got up this morning and I feel rather clear headed and motivation driven, as evidenced by the length of this review.  Recommend this bud for daytime smoking or for people who just like the mellow highs, man.

VWas in severe back pain and sciatic pain. After two hits, I feel relaxed and my pain is tolerable once more. The nuggs are nice and sugary, and pretty freaking hard to grind up, which should tell you how thick the nuggs are. I recommend this strain for back pain sufferers.\u000a\u000a

VRecently tried a zip of this from one of the better local dispensaries. Dense heavy bud structure with a heavy frosting throughout. Very resinous and perfectly cured for my personal taste. Outstanding smell and flavor. The smoke when deeply inhaled has a tart cherry flavor upfront on the tongue with a slight sweet finish. I found it to be a nice relaxing head high and after a slight delay it settles into the body. I would recommend this strain if you can find a good high-quality example.

VSo personally I&#39;m a fan of fruit comeback. The cherry notes to add to a very flavorful vape. I will test this with a few different food items I believe that will pair together nicely. Nice uplifting feeling at first, like those first few sips of your morning cup of coffee. A nice cerebral effect then takes places 10 minutes in. I am now more focused and thinking deeper on how to do the best I can in life. I&#39;m using a co2 oil because I need the strength. I use an ipuff vape pen, great for its using a little or a lot of oil. I like it because I can try one strain and when that burns up I can try another.  Twenty Min and 10 good initiations and my pain is starting to drop, stress slowly melting away. Feeling motivated! \u000a\u000a

VI would say this is a 4/5. Just like other Kush varieties, Cherry Kush is extremely smooth in both inhale and exhale. Sweet with a tinge of citrus and berry. Effects are certainly felt from the Kush side of things, but I can also feel the upliftedness coming from the sativa that&#39;s also rooted in this strain. Great mixture of highs, and overall an awesome hybrid

VA friend of mine came by and she had two different types of cannabis (aka) marijuana, she let me try about, the first one was Cherry Kush, very mild, nice mellow high, had a good pick me up to it. The next one was Lime something I really can&#39;t remember the last part of the name, but the both of them really work extremely well together, my depression &amp; anxiety were so very low, I felt like I did when I was younger, the entire time I enjoyed my high, I also got out of my house for the first time in 2 years, my  agoraphobia locked me in side my home, it took my Caregiver Talisa Thompson to ease me out slowly and when I started smoking weed all I can say is WOW I ME AGAIN AND I&#39;M SO GRATEFUL.
