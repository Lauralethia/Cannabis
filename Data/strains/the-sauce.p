VI recently tried this using water pipe.  this is very loud medicine and it tastes very smooth. Effective immediately clean head high that matches the smooth Flav.  Felt creative,  inquisitive and peaceful.  High didn&#39;t last too long.  No munchies or sleepiness.  depending on tolerance may have to does more frequently

VThe sauce is kind of earthy with a bit of a tang. Fairly smooth. Bright green buds with lots of red. I suffer with severe anxiety, and have been understanding a lot of stress lately. The nausea and muscle tightness have been bad. The sauce helped relieve the tension and helped my brain relax a bit. It actually slowed down enough that I could take some time to meditate and let myself fully relax. Almost as good as the feeling after a massage. It also helped with appetite and headache

VThe Sauce&#39;s GG4 genetics make themselves known with a quickening that comes over the top of your head then plunges down into your consciousness with a strong sense of well-being and focus.  Definitely a day time strain -- great for work or hanging with friends or taking on the world. A hint of lime fringes the diesel on both the nose and the taste buds.

VNormally a couch lock indica girl, but this caught my eye.  Tried a 1g pre-roll from Green Pharms in Mesa, AZ.  I AM IMPRESSED! \u000aDefinite creeper.  Fascinating high that quickly turns sedative if you overdo.  Which is just as great as the initial sativa kick! I can totally function, a bit dizzy at times (bonus&#128521;), kills my chronic pain, helped me eat &amp; time for nookie.  Will get more!

VMade me feel like a zombie \u2013 spaced out with an intense sense of focus but there was no happiness or euphoria at all. There was no deep thinking either and I just felt strangely blank. No anxiety to report. I picked up the strain because it was given high marks for inflammation, but I only found it moderately effective for Crohn&#39;s disease and M&#233;ni&#232;re&#39;s disease. As others have said, it is hard to believe this is a hybrid as it feels almost entirely Indica. It made me incredibly sleepy and I will probably only use the strain to fight insomnia. In all, the sauce is not the boss- it is just OK and I would not necessarily seek it out again.

VWhere do I start? This strain is something special. It\u2019s has a real uniqueness to it. A textbook sativa, but without any chance of the usual worries of paranoia. The smell is piney and citrusy, while the smoke is quite earthy, and chocolatey with notes of sour lime on the exhale. \u000aNow I\u2019m not much of a sativa fan. I love my heavy hitting indica and very rarely even consider going with the orange instead of the purple. But my friend said I would be insane not to try it. And boy was he right. \u000aThe smoke is super smooth, with hardly any urges to cough. The high hits very quick, but with a gentle touch too it. The clean buzz it provides has fends off all feelings of paranoia. Clear headed and very, VERY euphoric. After the head settles you feel a warm buzzing feeling of energy in your stomach, and before you know it you\u2019re ass deep in the back of the fridge. \u000aI strongly recommend this to any and all consumers who suffer, or who have suffered in the past from paranoia, anxiety, stress and depression. It will alleviate all symptoms, while allowing you to remain clear and functional throughout the day. You won\u2019t miss a beat, even after a whole joint! This one may just make it into the top ten! Definitely will be keeping this around for regular day time use. Get you some. Cheers\u000a\u000a-BoaReviews\u000a\u000a

V* In MD this strain is available as The Guice with similar lineage.\u000aThis strain changed my life! This is the absolute first strain I have tried that I could consider &quot;medicine&quot;. Its like having a brain and body tune-up from some cosmic mechanic. Strong euphoria and relaxation that provides a second-wind of energy hours later. True perfection. I purchased a vape cartridge and typically dose 2 solid hits. 5-20 min, initial onset comes with a mind warping head rush that seems to disconnect your body from your brain. Fasten your seatbelt, find a quiet place to sit down. 20-45 min. Motor/social skills start to come back with waves of teeth clenching euphoria and a wash of confidence, positivity, creativity and well-being. 45-2 hours. Increased focus allows me to buckle down and get to work. emails, computer work, cooking, cleaning, list making, strain reviewing. 2+ hours. As euphoria and well being start to align and level off, I&#39;ve never felt more like the best version of me before The Guice! The rest of my day is productive, happy, and positive. My mood and appetite are stabilized and I don&#39;t feel a need to over consume coffee and food to propel me through the workday. ( I have lost 10lbs since using Guice regularly. 4+ hours - probably the thing I love most about this strain is its &quot;second wave&quot; as I call it. 4 or 5 hours after medicating and I feel refreshed, tuned-up and ready to hit the trail for a long dog walk, afternoon run, or even the gym. For me there is no fatigue, or fogginess. This of course sets me up for a low-stress evening at home and a better chance at a great nights sleep

VThis is registered as a sativa dominant strain but if you thought it was an indica you would not be far off if as I am concerned.  I understand that this is a combination of Gorilla Glue #4 and Green Ribbon. I would say that the description from the dispensary and First State Compassion Center in Delaware is correct regarding ant-depression/anxiety.  I would also say just a little goes a long way as far as pain management. I like &quot;floaty&quot; strains and if you have something to do, this is probably not the time to use this strain... Think campfire or perhaps Yule Log on television while playing your favorite music. The buds from First State Compassion Center here in Delaware are very frosty and you can tell that it is potent by sight alone. If you wanted to write something (say this for example) you could do it but do not try writing anything important (work duties etc...).

VI don&#39;t usually write reviews but I got a full quarter of this strain &quot;The Sauce.&quot; My jar label says harvested on 5/5/2017 batch 1705CH0154.0753 and I bought it July 13th at the Shango in Hillsboro. \u000a\u000aI was really disappointed by the amount of hard stems in the buds. Like seriously- out of 7g, literally a full gram was stems. Now, I&#39;m not unreasonable and I&#39;ve grown my own so I understand the clipping process, but even I could tell that these were not the typical bud stems, these were HARD stems from the main body of the plant that they failed to trim out. The smoke was decent I guess, I&#39;ve had better, but the stems really made smoking it a lot more laborious because every bud had to go in the grinder and the stems kept jamming it up.
