VThe same day I got my Red Card I was turned onto Purple Diesel because I was browsing a local medical dispensary and noticed it right away because of it&#39;s big nicely grown buds. I didn&#39;t even have time to research the strain, I was immediately hooked!!! Great for my MS fatigue, picks me up, and lets me go on with my day.

VOverall rating 6.5\u000a\u000aAppearance: Quite nice. Trichromes present, but not very large and they sparkle dull. Not a strong odor. a hint of sour perhaps the  Dense nug weighed out at 3.7g.\u000a\u000aThe batch I received from a local dispensary wasn&#39;t grown with too much care so... \u000a\u000aThere&#39;s that. There&#39;s a bit of sour citrus in the flavor, yet the diesel comes through too. \u000a\u000aThe high hit me BAM right behind the right eye and shot into the temple. Immediate headache lasting 2 minutes before settling into serious body high, making me acutely aware of my posture. Probably GREAT for yoga.\u000a\u000aIt made my mind feel good in the sense that it made me totally retarted. This medicine formats the hard drive that is your brain&#39;s care-o-meter. I don&#39;t remember what i was thinking that whole time but it wasn&#39;t any deeper than a plastic kiddie pool.

VOf course I loved Purple Diesel when I got to try it in a pre-roll today. I love both parents. My very favorite indica and one of my top sativas had a love-child and I like it. Munchies are a problem though.\u000a\u000aNo anxiety, energy, HUNGER.

VOkay, first time review here, but long(ish) time user. I used my vape for about an hour and I&#39;m feeling content. I know some of you might think content is average, but those of you that know what i mean should try this strand if your just trying to stop thinking and relax.\u000a\u000aI have ADHD and PTSD and both are being covered by this strain. I am highly impressed with how, just content, it makes me feel.  If you&#39;re looking  to clock out and listen to music or watch a movie, I recommend trying Purple Diesel.

VLove this strain.  Energizing...You feel motivated to get things done even though you are blitzed.  You&#39;ll actually have fun doing mundane chores.  You feel light on your feet as you float through the day.  Powerful...I would not want to drive at the moment..  You can&#39;t stop smiling and everything seems hilarious...Fosters creativity.  What&#39;s not to like?...I&#39;ll be buying it again.

VPurple Diesel has a spicy kick in the back of the tongue. It gets my wife an I aroused in a big way. We love having sex on the Purple D. Time warp is big for me as well. We watch crazy movie&#39;s like Kung Pow - Enter the Fist on Purple D and they are awesome. \u000a\u000aThe head high is nice but not as smooth as other strains like sour diesel. The euphoria is average. When it&#39;s available I buy some to have in my stock. As I try new strains like Purple Haze and Alaskan Thunder Fuck it moves down my list of favorites.

VPurple Diesel has a strong fuel aroma with sweet earthy under tones, it tastes just like Sour D, the effects come right away with that uplifting euphoric motivating buzz that just makes you wanna get shit done but after a good 45 minutes you find your self calm down and relaxed this is one of my favorite hybrids because its tastes and smells are so satisfying,  but also brings good medicinal relief for people with anxiety, stress and pain during the day. Perfect mid day medication 5 out of 5

VGood stuff. I use this before playing basketball - taking about 3 medium draws on a pipe, then heading off to the gym. It helps me play a much better game. I&#39;m so much more focused and have noticed: 1) higher ability to anticipate plays of the offense and defense 2) jump shot is more &quot;on the money&quot; 3) I play harder, less likely to get lazy on a given play. Another nice thing is that even though I&#39;m playing very competitively, I&#39;m less likely to get angry at things like people fouling me - it rolls off and I keep just playing.

Ok I love this strain obviii and you will too, bye. \u000a\u000aIt smells really fruity but a mild type of fruity smell. The taste of it is like...earthy or grainy in a way.

VWas able to get my hands on some of this recently.  All in all, this is great for daytime use.  It will relax you, but not make you tired or lazy.  If you take a stronger dose, you&#39;ll get a rather nice euphoria out of it, along with decent pain relief.  Lower doses will give you a degree of pain relief, but no euphoria.  My fibromyalgia pain dropped a good almost 2 points after vaping this.  This helped ease my nausea, as well as making me feel happy and content.  I would recommend this strain for anyone needing some good day-time relief for their symptoms.

VLove The Start to Finish flavor of this Strain however mine was a 50/50 Hybrid coated to the core with crystals even the stems were completely covered in thick fuzzy crystals just dripping off these perfectly cured nuglets even after the buds are picked from them the stems would coat your fingers alone. Upon fist smoke of the true purple indica blended with true sour diesel sativa was like my favorite fruity pebbles with a hint of expansion in the smoke that hels its flavor even in a bowl thru to the ash which is rare. i often find myself mixing this with other stong odored strains to sweeten them up like sugar to my coffee and great morning noon or night always very effective for pain, appetite, and sex drive even if feeling limber enough even if its the Purple D talkin. My favorite J ever I must have one rolled at all times is Purp D  mixed with Cinex Sativa dominant hybrid with a sweet pungeont lemon petrol mango pine sol, when mixed is like Heaven, Like a desert joint for anytime with real good cerebral and body high but no couch-lock ever..Sweet!!

VI really like this strain. I just recently had shoulder surgery and it definitely helps with the pain once it kicks in! The only thing is, that I have to concentrate on relaxing the effected shoulder due to the energy it gives me and the lack of pain i feel. Will be getting again!!! &#128548;

VThe purple diesel i got smelled great. The flower itself was cured properly and had small indications of purple leaf. I feel quite uplifted and happy in only a way a sativa can make you.

VThis strain is lovely. I found it to be pretty mellow in energy, the feeling is much closer to a 50/50 or 60/40 hybrid for me. It had a nice uplifted mood to it and made me very happy. Not the most clear headed strain but motivating and alert. It was definitely a creeper, I could have probably smoked less than I did and been fine. I found the cerebral qualities to be pretty heavy hitting at first but mellowed out after not too long. I was then left with a relaxed body and functional mind. The body high on it was fairly slight but it was relaxing. It was a nice evening smoke to relax, motivate some creativity and not be couch locked.

So I went for an amazing batch of this strain and wow.. no paranoia no heart racing very clear headed, time bending high. This is my new go to strain, especially because it releives all my back pain and relaxes my muscles preventing back spasms.

Body high allowed me to eat a decent breakfast. Head high calmed me down &amp; allowed me to enjoy early Sunday afternoon wit my family. Gave me energy too which really helped get my @$$ moving, it was great! I could see how having too much might slow ya down tho. Maybe more of a 50/50 than a Sativa or an Indica dominant. High lasted 3 + hours which was great for any strain! I&#39;d highly recommend for anytime but bedtime/nighttime use for pain/nausea/anxiety. Meds from this dispensary have always been kick @$$!

Diesel comes with time and makes the effects better and better. I felt very relaxed, happy and uplifted. Really good to take the stress away and anxiety. No side effects at all.

VI love this strain! Personal taste, but it makes me incredibly creative... Music wise, dance wise, the one I smoke has some real strong sativa genetics because as soon as it kicks in (takes some time) I am in full auto and ready to blow everyones minds! It gets me relaxed too and I use this a lot whenever I play Xbox. Good point for this one is... No couch-lock whatsoever... But beware, after a while whenever you start to descend, makes you reaaaaaally sleepy.

VThis strain is fantastic, beyond fantastic in fact! Just smoked a half blunt of this with 2 other strains in it and the Purple D high way overpowered the other 2. I had been in a lousy mood all day, with none of the Sativias&#39; I smoked all day lifting it at all. After smoking that blunt though I began to feel light, happy, and the mood I had been looking for all day finally graced me with it&#39;s presence. The high is extremely potent, uplifting, and mildly euphoric yet not overpowering at all. I will definitely be grabbing this strain if I ever come across it and recommend buying it if you come across it!

VPurple D is one of my favorite sativa-heavy strains of all time. Hits hard and is a great daytime smoke. Very cerebral and makes day-to-day very relaxing and stress-free.\u000a\u000aAnytime I see Purple Diesel, I grab it. Fusion Medical Marijuana is currently doing $10/g on Purple D, I highly recommend grabbing some!

VI&#39;m not a huge fan of Diesel, but I am a huge fan of anything Purple.  Tastes pretty good.  Dank as fuck, of course.  Got it for free which made it all the better.  Had a headache after the high.  Not a big deal though.  Smoking another gram or two once the headache occurs takes care of the problem.

VNot bad but not great, this sativa dominant hybrid looked nice with small clusters of trichomes layered over small, dark lavender hued buds which smelled like a dirty grape. Unfortunately, the taste was similarly bland and the effects weren&#39;t as strong and long lasting as I expected. I was told that this Purple Diesel that I bought was from Granddaddy Purple and NY Diesel, which is why my experience differs from other people here. I wish I had the bud everyone else is describing.

VThis really is a powerful strain in many ways.  Strong, sweet flowery fragrance from the buds which comes through in taste with a deep gas taste on exhale.  The full portrait is not given with a sniff from the jar alone because the exhale is where it is at.  Beautiful 1 dollar .5 prerolls for the Superbowl so awesome deal, but did not get to see the flower to note on appearance.  Mid teens as for percentage a very deceptive number giving this strains slow onset &amp; a buzz that felt more mid twenties.  \u000a\u000aGreat medicine for both a painful body &amp; a dragging soul.  Up lifting, silly, easily recreational, no doubt a med with both being used in moderation.  Easily overdone. If using as a social lubricant my suggestion would be to mix with a more focused sativa like Green Crack making a great salad.  Purple D is a really pretty tasting flower which is mostly heady with full body blasts of pain relief lasting steadily for a nice 4-5 hours.  Lovely

VThis strain was richly purple with vibrant, grass green highlights and toffee colored hairs; dense and sugary with a heavy blanket of trichomes. The diesel genetics are loud, but softened with notes of tobacco and sour grapes. In glass, it reminded me of brandy on the inhale, with the diesel hitting just after the exhale, leaving a sour coating on the tongue - not unlike a hoppy craft ipa. In terms of efficacy, balance is near perfect, with the diesel hitting the head and shoulders; the raciness curbed as the kush begins to seep into the torso and limbs. Easy to ride out if the consumer chooses, leaving the body feeling similar to that experienced after a long day at the beach. Great daytime potential, especially for someone suffering with heightened nervousness. This strain is great in the morning, but I utilize it more in the afternoon, whether to play some WoW, watch a movie, or cook a decent dinner. If you need something a bit more to &quot;sit you down,&quot; increase dosage a bit. This was a premium sampling, with tight LED style hybrid bud structure, and an absolutely perfect trim and cure. Grown properly, this is a special strain.

The purple indica influences help to provide a beautifully balanced high that is still heavily focused on the sativa experience, from the diesel influence.  \u000aThe smell and taste (in a Volcano Vaporizer at 385 F) were like grape soda, and the stuff had a real diesel smell in bud form and especially when it was ground up.\u000aThe high was short but extremely contemplative, visual, creative, and fascinating.  It felt very mystical on multiple occasions.\u000aOf the 25+ strains I have smoked, this gets the prize far and away.

VThis strain smells so lovely. It smells spicy but piney, then shifts into strong diesel undertones and finishes off with a sweet (sometimes fresh, berry-ish) scent. It&#39;s a very leafy, minimal hairs, light bud. The leaves are 3:1 purple to green leaf. The purple is deep and dark, and the green is deep but bold. It smokes very smoothly in itself and takes effect slowly and steadily. The effects are noticeable but not cumbersome/overwhelming. It is pleasant for both the day time and the night time. Great for soloists especially.

VA hybrid of Sour Diesel and Pre-98 Bubba Kush - two of the most opposite strains you can find that, when combined, elicit a very contrasting, befuddling high.\u000a\u000aAfter smoking, my immediate reaction was &quot;Woah, what a different come on!&quot; Feels like the skin on your head&#39;s being pulled back along with your lower jaw. How weird!\u000a\u000aIt erases your mind immediately, yet you&#39;re strangely still able to focus and express yourself. Hah, man...what is up with this high? I&#39;m really liking how DIFFERENT it feels from most other strains.\u000a\u000aHead is in a cloud both physically and mentally...yet Bubba&#39;s awesome presence still cuts through somehow. Pretty couch-locky in that your body feels rooted and it&#39;d take a lot of motivation (that you don&#39;t have) to get up.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s the kind of high where you&#39;re especially in your own head -but so gone nothing has time to sink in. So, at the will of your whims. Not the safest or easiest of highs. Definitely has noticeable edge throughout (thanks Sour D).\u000a\u000aDue to the couch lock and edginess, I can&#39;t recommend for daytime, hiking, being active, in public, or socializing. And since Sour D&#39;s not great for accentuating movies/music/art, you can do much better with other strains. It does succeed as a wholly unique high that&#39;ll trip you the fuck out. Definitely worth TRYING, but I&#39;d hesitate committing to a large quantity.

VI had a few rips of it the other day and I gotta say it has a great and pungent taste to it, and the high is VERY potent. Though it was potent, it didn&#39;t last as long as I wish it did. Pretty harsh, but flavorful. Most likely because it was outdoor, but I prefer outdoor anyway. For being a cross breed of gdp and (one of my top 5) Sour D, i was actually unsatisfied. I&#39;d much rather have pure Sour D.

Music wise, dance wise, the one I smoke has some real strong sativa genetics because as soon as it kicks in (takes some time) I am in full auto and ready to blow everyones minds! It gets me relaxed too and I use this a lot whenever I play Xbox. Good point for this one is... No couch-lock whatsoever... But beware, after a while whenever you start to descend, makes you reaaaaaally sleepy.

VPurple diesel get the job done, if you want a strong strain to relax without the couch lock this is for you, 4 bong hits and I&#39;m mellowed out happy and chilling nice euphoric high.. I use it to destress after work, if smoked(or whatever method of consumption you desire) in larger quantities you&#39;ll experience some drowsyness but nothing too severe, its perfect if you have insomnia...

Its very potent and for me seemed like a indica dominant strain but definitely had sativa effects to. the taste is phenomenal and is just as described on the page with a hint of citrus.

VThis strain is fantastic, beyond fantastic in fact! Just smoked a half blunt of this with 2 other strains in it and the Purple D high way overpowered the other 2. I had been in a lousy mood all day, with none of the Sativias&#39; I smoked all day lifting it at all. After smoking that blunt though I began to feel light, happy, and the mood I had been looking for all day finally graced me with it&#39;s presence. The high is extremely potent, uplifting, and mildly euphoric yet not overpowering at all. I will definitely be grabbing this strain if I ever come across it and recommend buying it if you come across it!

VIf you are a Diesel fan, you will be happy with this strain. I feel like the Diesel was more present than the Bubba but don&#39;t get me wrong, the Bubba is the first thing to kick in. Diesel comes with time and makes the effects better and better. I felt very relaxed, happy and uplifted. Really good to take the stress away and anxiety. No side effects at all. Had a glass of water and I was ready to enjoy the next hour. Great day strain or great to relax after a hard day of work.

Stress all but evaporates. I feel calm, collected, and confident in general. \u000a\u000aT+15 mins: May as well be T+30 mins, judging from how I&#39;m losing track of time.

VI had some of this last night. It was a really fun one to smoke. But recently I&#39;ve heard that people shock their plants to do this...or things that stress them to grow this way and that that lowers the quality of the weed. I&#39;m pretty sure I had some of that. I was stoked to smoke it, but it just wasn&#39;t even as crazy as regular Diesel. I really doubt it&#39;s cuz I smoked some other strain later, but it wasn&#39;t as good as I had hoped. Still, fun.

VNot the purplest of the purple strains but it had it streaks of color..The leaves are all frosty and when you crack them open your blast with intense chronic smell.  It was grown by  Green Thumb Gradens and they always do a great job on there strains.. They grow for Have A Heart which is a sweet store and i would recommend it to any one..

VGot seeds, lucky. First, one of my new favorites, has a clear headed high similar to 707 Headband, great for mental focus. Smell is berry big time, starts sativa ends indica. Got almost sleepy at tail end of the effect, but super alert at the start. \u000aSo, about the seeds. One of the nugs I got had some and the rest were perfect. Grew at home and harvested. Real easy grow, too. Produces great and high quality with just fresh natural soil.

VReally really gudd, first weed I smoked while laying down and chillin, I had a body melt, indica related reaction rather than a uplifting, sativa reactant. It was really good tho lol. Didn&#39;t wanna get up after the smoke. Got in my bed and was sleep automatic after 5 mins in. Intake was alright, not the best tho.

VTo the cognoscenti, the name says a lot. It&#39;s a Diesel with a purple Indica back. I found this in Eureka, I was driving through. The address and GPS took me to a shoe shop with a relatively surly occupant. I waited patiently as he whipped a customer into shape over the phone, laying down the law on shoeology. They sell serious footwear. Having driven in nano-clean from Canada, crossing dangerous regions like Montana and Idaho where they have firing squads for people like us, I was willing to go along with anyone&#39;s method. But I was trying to grasp the situation, imagining old Cerberus pulling a curtain aside, revealing rows of mason jars of medicinal buds in the closet, above the boots. He finally got off the phone and cracked his massive head towards me. I tried &quot;collective&quot; ... he gave me a chilling visual evaluation and said &quot;I thought so. The pot shop. In the back&quot;. I asked why he &quot;thought so&quot;, but he wasn&#39;t going there. It was clear he knew the drill. &quot;Out back&quot;. \u000a\u000aI was happy to find the crew out back gentle and scattered. Lots of kids and a mother hen. They even had half-grams. I got several to try, including the dread Green Crack that they apologetically also called green something harmless. But one of my better purchases was a sun-grown and desiccated Purple Diesel. A Diesel - up, focused, energetic - with sedative and body melt notes. That&#39;s a complicated hybrid. Imagine a driving, four on the floor, synthy Electronic Dance Music - with a liquid fretless bass line. After the shoe-man, it was just the thing to get us back on the road. It&#39;s a composition I swore I&#39;d be checking out again. I&#39;ve encountered it since then as &quot;Purple D&quot;, need to study it some more.

VFirst,\u000a\u000aWould people stop wasting paragraphs talking about the smell and flavor. Like beer- I don\u2019t drink it for the taste. \u000a\u000aI vaped this strain (as with most now) and found it to be a good balance - a sour d version of like a blue dream.  Clear headed (mostly) and a little energetic \u000a\u000aNo jitters, etc and I smoked a fair bit @ 84% THC. \u000a\u000aWould recommend for a I\u2019d like to get mildly stoned day or night.
