VOriginally Posted By Mr Soul:\u000a(Co-owner of Bros Grimm)\u000aQuote:\u000aIn 1997, I discovered a few seeds in a bud of Jack Herer I bought @ \u201cSensi Smile\u201d Coffeeshop in Amsterdam [Owned and Operated by Sensi Seeds] while there to buy seeds. \u000aI didn\u2019t expect much when I grew them, but one of those seeds from the JH bud produced a very special female that I call \u201cPrincess\u201d.\u000aTherefore Princess\u2019 mother was a Jack Herer (IF we can believe what Sensi Smile printed on the package) and her Father is a totally unidentified mystery plant.\u000aI also got 2 more females (Genius &amp; Cafe\u2019Girl) &amp; several males from those seeds. I used pollen from one of the males on a heavy-yielding, dense, resinous Shiva Skunk (from Sensi Seedbank) female, then grew the resulting seeds to get males to produce pollen to cross Princess with, beginning the Cubing process.\u000aThe First Generation of seeds from Princess were called P.50 because they were 50% Princess. I used males from the P.50 Generation to Back-Cross to Princess to get P.75 and again Back-Cross with the P.75 pollen to get P.88 and again with the P.88 Pollen to get P.94 which is \u201cCinderella 99&quot;, a Cubed version of Princess.\u000aThe name \u201cCinderella\u201d was chosen because of the Parallels between this story and the well-known Fairy Tale in which Cinderella becomes a Princess despite her humble beginning. It\u2019s also VERY similar to the story of the \u201cMorgan Horse\u201d\u2026go Figure...

VA tropical tiger. Cheery, pale jade buds with Amber hairs that threaten to over take the nug. \u000a\u000aThe smell is intoxocating. Damp, misty, humid, but fruity. the spray when you bite into a mango, or chop into a pineapple. A mossy, thick dankness on the back end. Paradise.\u000a\u000aSpring cleaning for the palate. Pine, tree fruit, and citrus, combine with a pinch of ammonia that is floor cleaner in the best possible way. \u000a\u000aBe cautious, this is not beginner friendly. High is slow to come, but is long lasting, and doesn&#39;t seem to have a limit for how high you can go. Wait 10 minutes before next toke, or you may float into &quot;way too high, for way too long&quot; territory.\u000a\u000aFor the experienced, or moderate, however, this is a even, uplifiting, vivid high, that makes any sensory activity captivating. \u000a\u000aBest with fresh seafood, or brunch, concerts, and 70 degree weather.

VLike everyone else said here, this most definitely is a potent strain, which explains why you see it as a parent in several other strains. I took about four hits off a mini-bong an hour ago and I it&#39;s still going strong. A fantastic strain to watch a movie, play video games or listen to music to. It also wouldn&#39;t be a bad strain to smoke on a hike or go dancing with. \u000a\u000aThe ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the smell, which reminds me of vomit. The smell even gave me pause at the dispensary, though strangely the taste isn&#39;t that bad and the buzz is fantastic.

VFirst strain I felt compelled to review - I&#39;ve had a about 3 months (since getting a medical rec.) to test the effects of different strains.  Currently this is my favorite &quot;active&quot; strain to medicate with; I&#39;ve tried green crack, atf, Jack H., Sour D, Super S.D., and a few other Sativa/Sativa-dominants, and the reason why this is my favorite has to be the amount of focus that comes with it. I mean other strains have very strong creative characteristics but may leave your analytical mind not as sharp as it could be, but with C99 I can go into a business meeting without a problem.  No crash either and it DEFINITELY stimulates you to the point where you crave less coffee and caffeine. Also the batch I got was good - tested at 25%thc and 1.2%CBD at High Rollers in L.A. The only downside (and this is totally counter intuitive) is that it killed my apetite; one time to the point of needing to medicate to work up an apetite with another strain. First strain I&#39;d recommend for a diet/training program, for sure.  Gets you going, focused, and concise with your thoughts.

VWas excited to try Cinderella 99 because it&#39;s half of the genetics of Cinex, one of my favorite strains. Fun, sociable and highly creative. Had at least a half dozen great flights of creative whimsy and sparkling ideas over a two-hour high. One of the most creative strains out there if you&#39;re into philosophy, writing, brainstorming and &quot;what ifs?&quot;. Indulge your inner nerd. Quite inspiring, fun and talkative. I shouldn&#39;t have given this strain a 5. It&#39;s more like 4.5, because the buzz isn&#39;t that long lasting. Mild munchies. Not good for sleep. Very very Sativa dominate.

VFor the longest time people were describing this strain as a racy sativa. As such I avoided it.\u000a\u000aFinally tried some from Helping Hands dispensary. I do NOT find it to be racy. CIndy 99 feels more like a well balanced hybrid albeit on the more uplifting side. I&#39;ll describe this using two adjectives: UPLIFTED &amp; RELAXED. Also, GOOD FOR PAIN. A really FUNCTIONAL STRAIN. Cheers!

VI think this has to be up there with Jack Herer as a favourite daytime medicine of mine. I purchased an ounce for 200$ from UEM in BC, and I was very excited to try it so I literally just finished taking my first bong rip of it. I am decently high,  feel calm, yet like I could do things right now. There is a euphoria about this high, and you get a warm, stoney feel behind your eyes. A floaty feeling in your head. For me, it is very heady but also has bodily effects. The high also came on quickly upon exhale. As for the smell.. I can&#39;t say I can attest to the fruitiness or floweriness much. Perhaps a bit, but my nose is overwhelmed with a really stinky cheese smell. In fact I have never had bud in my entire 8 years of smoking that smelled quite like this. All in all, I would repurchase and recommend this strain to anyone looking for a great day time med. I have obviously been focused enough to finish writing this review, and as someone struggling with focus and concentration, that is saying a lot. AAAA+

VThis is hands down the best sativa I have tried. I don&#39;t notice any indica effects with this, as it is listed on here as a hybrid. And for someone that usually sticks with indicas, I think I may have just been converted!\u000a\u000aThe whole experience of smoking Cindy was amazing. First off was the way she looked: Healthy green covered in sugary frosting, almost all white which overpowered the green. Extremely dense buds for a sativa plant. VERY sticky! Best was upon breaking her up. Explosion of fruity smells, I could have gotten off on that smell. \u000a\u000aWas extremely medicated off one bowl out of a bong. Didn&#39;t want to listen to anything but techno and upbeat music. (usually I listen to dub and rap lol). I was so happy, relaxed, and extremely focused and full of ideas! It has been two hours since I medicated and I am having a hard time remember all the wondering things I wanted to write about this strain! \u000a\u000aI will DEFINITELY be keeping this strain around. AMAZING for depression!!! One love.. -EuphoricVoyage

VI&#39;ve heard a lot a things about C99 and tried a few offshoot hybrids like Cinex and Cindy-Jack. For as high as other people rate it, I didn&#39;t care for it much. The sample I had was dank, so I&#39;m pretty sure it wasn&#39;t the quality. I vaped it at 380 which produced a fairly thick vapor. I didn&#39;t feel anything for the first several minutes, then I began to feel the cerebral effects. It feels like my brain is wrapped in a blanket or I have a head cold. This strain makes me a little anxious and jittery but seems to provide a ton of energy. My thoughts are pretty clear. This strain gave me the munchies so badly that it increased my nausea instead of reducing it. Does not seem to have many pain control properties. Overall, this strain might be good to treat fatigue and maybe depression. It would be good as an appetite stimulant, but not for nausea. Not recommended for anxiety or stress. IMO not useful for pain control. This strain seems similar to the Green Crack strain. I&#39;m going to have to try and review this strain again. Maybe it was an unusual experience with this strain.

VC99 is my favorite strain so far. It&#39;s a very uplifting, motivating high. Fantastic anxiety/depression strain.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately THC Care Provider doesn&#39;t have as good C99 as BOTH collective (only other place I&#39;ve tried it). THC CP&#39;s was really dried out and kind of harsh, whereas BOTH&#39;s was super sticky, better tasting, and more potent. \u000a\u000aI do have to point out that THC CP&#39;s is $8/g, making it $4/g less than BOTH&#39;s ($12/g). That&#39;s a big difference.

C99 has a strong long-lasting head high that won&#39;t stop and creates a nice space for you to organize your thoughts.  Cindy has a Thai parent, has a great smell / taste and will give you an expansive high.  She is the best I ever had and stacks up well with Super Lemon Haze. ns

VWow, this is what I can say about Cindy 99. First of all she&#39;s got very sweet undertones, little skunky and piney. Taste is very much like the smell. Effects somehow seemed a tad more delayed then they should have being a sativa but you also feel subtle effects from the first hit. About 10 minutes and one bowl later, the cerebral buzz is phenomenal and a good tingling in the chest neck and upper back. This is a very potent strain I would definitely get again for the sheer fact her sweet skunky smell and her great long lasting cerebral euphoria.

VStrain: Cinderella #22 (Unknown Jack Herer phenom type / I would love to know more, just like everyone, right? -- Sativa Hybrid)\u000aTHC: 26.94%\u000aCBD: 0.03%\u000aGrower: LTRMN\u000aLocation found: KaLeafa\u000aDate purchased: 4.21.16 \u000aPrice: $23.00 for an \u215bth (after -20% off Thursday discount and Loyalty Points)\u000aWeight: 3.7g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: This particular strain is a light and airy resemblance to the original C99 I know, love and desire. Light to the point of nearly being sweet. The earthy Jack is present but not the swarming overwhelming of some variations I have seen and sampled. Light, sweet, rich, earth. When the budtender opened the jar over five feet from my nose in the store and a fan swept the aroma towards me, I knew I found the right one. \u000aLook: Dense light green nugs with light orange hairs and a lot of crystals. Trimmed right down but not sure if it was machined.\u000aTaste: The earthy flavor was stronger on the inhale than the smell and that is not usually the case. It was a nice smooth version of this wonderful plant. \u000aRecommendation for medicine: Cindy99 is an all day uplifting strain.  For me it is wonderful for PTSD relief. There are many reasons this is a staple in most peoples&#39; collections. Good for being happy, smiling, creative and being. It is not all that euphoric compared to a bunch of other Sativas I choose to consume but it one strain that keeps me loyal to cannabis over any other compound we have discovered so far!

The most clear head high ive ever had. I wrote a very nice song under the influence of this strain. Gives you a confidence, not quite as strong as green crack, but clearer. Great to wake &amp; bake to, great do academic things off of, it may even replace green crack as my strain of choice when doing things for school. It isnt the strongest high or longest, but a very nice pleasant wake &amp; bake/productive sativa.

Vafter systematically trying 70+ strains, this one&#39;s stayed in my top 5, reflecting my preference for creative strains. some of my other favorites are cinex, bubbleberry, and cactus. cinderella&#39;s less &#39;head-y&#39; (or, as a friend once called it, &#39;mental&#39;) than cinex; there&#39;s more of a body high - but it&#39;s still creative as all get-out. the closest thing to it in my experience is bubbleberry, another great strain for getting out the art supplies or musical instruments. cactus has a bit more body-high (it&#39;s indica-dominant), but always gets me into a project (curiously, cactus has often made me work on &#39;decor&#39;, as opposed to drawing or playing music - weird, huh?). despite the prevailing opinion that sativas are better for creativity, I actually haven&#39;t found that to be a reliable predictor. one budtender told me he thinks the terpene limonene is what makes a strain creative - but I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s that simple; you just have to try them a few times to see what they do - and cindy 99 is reliably project-y for me, but, of course: YMMV.

VVery Interesting strain. The order of high stages seems very out of order lol. Very euphoric strain. Similar to sour d, not quite as strong or fun, but more creative &amp; clear headed imo. The most clear head high ive ever had. I wrote a very nice song under the influence of this strain. Gives you a confidence, not quite as strong as green crack, but clearer. Great to wake &amp; bake to, great do academic things off of, it may even replace green crack as my strain of choice when doing things for school. It isnt the strongest high or longest, but a very nice pleasant wake &amp; bake/productive sativa.

VWow, this is what I can say about Cindy 99. First of all she&#39;s got very sweet undertones, little skunky and piney. Taste is very much like the smell. Effects somehow seemed a tad more delayed then they should have being a sativa but you also feel subtle effects from the first hit. About 10 minutes and one bowl later, the cerebral buzz is phenomenal and a good tingling in the chest neck and upper back. This is a very potent strain I would definitely get again for the sheer fact her sweet skunky smell and her great long lasting cerebral euphoria.

VIt&#39;s very sweet has light tinges of sweet berry and citrus a little bit of floral and Rose and Honey I can taste. This is very lights I would prefer the strain to be a little bit heavier although it does relaxe me. If you was a little bit more energetic and the high was a little bit more strong I would suggest to take this lightly as it may relax you to the point of not doing too much of anything I&#39;m glad Cindarella 99 is here. For the first time of the legendary strain I would say it is pretty light however I prefer more of the heavier sativas. If you&#39;re having trouble focusing but still do not want to care what you&#39;re doing I would highly suggest this strain.

Vsmells skunky with fruity/mango undertones.  Pleasant smell.  Taste also skunky with mango hint.  I had quite the effect!  Started slowly euphoric, talkative, slightly psychedelic but not immobilizing; environment seemed 2-dimensional / through a fish eye.  All the while slightly energetic.  Through the first hour / 45min, increasingly energetic - if taken with coffee, do so with caution!  I found it to heighten the effects of caffeine, and I drink mine black daily.  After this first hour or so, I found myself experiencing OCD symptoms - I couldn&#39;t decide on which song to listen to on my iPod for about 30 minutes.  After this 30 min phase, the energy shocks back, quite racey, feeling burnt out after the second hour.  Some food picked me right up, however - so I would keep food handy!  It made me slightly hungry, but I chose to fight it and continue my day, which was my mistake.  Would give another shot - insomniacs beware!

VThe Cinderella 99 strain is easily the nicest strain I have smoked so far. \u000a\u000aThe flowers have a nice citrusy and earthy aroma, with a bit of a parsley/oregano smell as well. It absolutely does not smell like your average &quot;skunk&quot; bud. \u000a\u000aThe smoke has a light citrus taste, and is very hot. Make sure to use a water pipe and ice. \u000a\u000aMoving on, the high is amazing. I smoked one bowl and it left me feeling happy and creative, and then a second 1 and a half hours after the first. The second bowl left me with a strong feeling of couch lock, and gave me a sense that my mind was separated from my body. about 3 hours after the second bowl I was asleep, and I woke up feeling great and refreshed. \u000a\u000aMake sure you have a lot of water around because you will be extremely thirsty after smoking this strain.

VI have severe anxiety with panic attacks and depression. Meds from the Dr were not helping alone. This strain helped me get back into a normal way of thinking, a normal way of life. I experienced great calm &amp; was very happy &amp; positive while smoking it. \u000aOn top of this it has a great taste, great buzz, lasts a while, &amp; the nuggets look very nice. I like that it comes in an auto flower too! \u000aI have decided Cinderella99 is my all time favourite weed. I think I would choose it over all others.

Kiss her with any amount of frequency during the course of the day and she will take you on a dragon ride.\u000a\u000aVaping her on 10.4 W will give you a perfect hit of a very large cloud; remember to exhale or you will experience the aforementioned dragon ride if you are not a daily smoker.\u000a\u000aI will most definitely put her in my favorite column.

Van awesome bros. Grimm strain. heavy sativa with a overripe mango odor. this lady has some power. a little psychedelic even, and this with the racing mind can lead some to paranoia. novices should go easy. use the novice approach if sativa sensitive, as she will swallow you into space, leaving your mind spinning and racing away. one of the best Sativa&#39;s.

VReally got my mind racing. Weird, yet enjoyable high. Jack Herrer x Shiva Skunk. Could feel the jack herrer genetics in the high, which is great since jack herrer is one of my favorite strains. This bud is good for wake and bakes, and is a good substitute for coffee. There is no burnout from this bud, and i was in a good mood even after my high wore off. The nugs are very sticky and hard to break up and roll with since they get all over and stick to everything. The bud has a really nice taste to it though, and smokes nicely through a not to tightly rolled blunt. When rolling a blunt of this stuff though leave yourself plenty of time. took me almost fifteen minutes to roll when it ordinarily takes me 2-3. most of this time was spent breaking up the weed.  grinder wasnt working that well so i had to break out the scissors. \u000anice smoke. potent high that leaves you active and awake.

Vaped this about 10 minutes ago (or maybe longer...time passage is very hard to track right now) so okay let&#39;s say it&#39;s been half an hour. Or so. Anyway, I&#39;m a little dizzy and its hard to think clearly or make a decision. My computer wasn&#39;t where I wanted it, and my solution was to move the table instead of just sliding the laptop over a few inches!

VCinderella 99 is an awesome hybrid strain.  Even though its a sativa dominant hybrid, the indica is certainly noticable.  I personally love this strain for many reasons, one being that its super potent, another being that whether you are looking to go on an adventure or just wanna watch a movie, Cindy 99 is perfect for you. My personal experience, this strain gave me the munchies, had me super relaxed almost as close as you can get to sleepy without being sleepy and it helped calm me down. I recommend this for veteran smokers and for people who have a hard time getting an appetite or just need an extra push in their motivation and day.\u000a

VReally got my mind racing. Weird, yet enjoyable high. Jack Herrer x Shiva Skunk. Could feel the jack herrer genetics in the high, which is great since jack herrer is one of my favorite strains. This bud is good for wake and bakes, and is a good substitute for coffee. There is no burnout from this bud, and i was in a good mood even after my high wore off. The nugs are very sticky and hard to break up and roll with since they get all over and stick to everything. The bud has a really nice taste to it though, and smokes nicely through a not to tightly rolled blunt. When rolling a blunt of this stuff though leave yourself plenty of time. took me almost fifteen minutes to roll when it ordinarily takes me 2-3. most of this time was spent breaking up the weed.  grinder wasnt working that well so i had to break out the scissors. \u000anice smoke. potent high that leaves you active and awake.

VThis should be the strain carrying the title green crack, first pineapple flavored rip from a bong makes my ears pop and the tripple espresso like stimulation takes over but slightly messier as coffee doesnt make you forget where you were going!  Fairly potent, capable of bordering  low end mild psychedelics if enough is smoked.  colors are more vivid senses are hyper aware, a bee flying by sounds like a scud missle zinging by.  To the growers: this strain offers 85 to 90 percent of the full on benefit of a pure sativa but with much faster flowering time (8 to 9 weeks) as opposed to 12~16+ weeks.  Can go straight to 12/12 lighting from seedling.  A very big breakthrough in cannabis breeding was the result of creating this strain.  kudos to the breeders hard work, sweat, and more sweat.

Good temporary fix  for depression. Doesn&#39;t make your head too fuzzy so it&#39;s a good one to use in social settings. Mostly just makes me feel happier without feeling super stoned.

VFirt time trying this and I love it.  The batch I got is really light and fluffy and has a kind of tropical/citrus smell to it.  A little of a citrus taste but not much.  The effects are very pleasant.  I feel very relaxed but ready to go at the same time, if that makes since.  I also feel focused.  I tend to go for sativas or sativa dom hybrids so this one is perfect for me.  I feel like I would be able to be vey productive with this strain.  Highly recommend to those who are looking for a good day time strain.

I was dealing with debilitating chronic pain and nausea, and this got me through my education without compromising my grades. What a wonderful gift! Upbeat, daytime strain, allows you to think and focus with a normal level of mental functioning. To be fair, too much can lead to a bit of anxiety/paranoia, as most sativas do (to me anyway lol). After a while of just being on Cindy, I did have to switch it up with a heavy indica just to slow down a bit...Cindy might be too overstimulating for some. But overall, one of my fave strains. It has a purpose (getting you motivated and moving) and when you use it correctly, it always comes through.

VA creamy menthol hit that doesn&#39;t burn your chest at all if using a waterpipe..but harsher from a single hitter, this baby doll of a bud brings a fit of giggles for me at first, then drags me through a quick alley dip past paranoia ...then shows me her secrets by carrying me into the most amazing high I have had in decades. Truly reminds me of some of the great Thai stick we had back in the late 80s.  Craziest strain to me with the best of both worlds. I cannot recommend this high enough. Blew me away... super for socializing and smiles so I see the day high side, but if smoked before bed you get a smooth, uninterrupted sleep with no dreams. Beautiful bud for insomniacs. when you get tired you get TIRED and sleep like a baby and 4-5 hours of sleep with Cindy brings a waking that will be rested and relaxed. Gorgeous to look at, with red in it so red and dark that  it looks like blood clots spreading through her. Hands down the strain I will choose over all if available.

VYou know the strain is good if your willing to put up with a harsh burn of a particular batch. This one is enjoyable in flower form but I must say I tried it in Rosin form by Legion of Bloom and the high was so smooth and because your not sitting in the smoke of a burnt plant after exhaling I sure don&#39;t feel the dry eye or cotton mouth as much with concentrated forms... my opinion though is totally biased because of the Disney princesses I loved her before I ever smoked her.\u000a\u000aThis Sativa luckily for me does not have that anxiety packed punch. It&#39;s very calming and uplifting. If you have anxiety and are looking for a day time high that won&#39;t leave you barricaded yourself in your bedroom.

V@mike_the_budtender with another strain review! Stone mountain is the producer here. This is a unique Cinderella it has a slightly darker tone to it with super bright crystals that make it shine. It&#39;s a subtle high that comes on gentle, making it a perfect strain for beginners or anyone with anxiety. It creates a perfect happy, uplifting, bliss. I strongly recommend this strain.

VI have tried this strain twice; the 1st was a cut from Cascade Farms; and the 2nd was an unbelievable organically grown cut from a local Co-Op. The 1st was well; bad. The 2nd was 5*+ Top Shelf A+ bud which shamed the cut from Cascade. The effects were very potent and cerebrally invigorating; making it very easy and fun to focus on tasks and activities. The taste was reminiscent of tropical fruitiness with floral undertones.

VExcellent even for the casual smoker. One of my favorite wake and bake strains. \u000aI rolled mine in a king sized juicy jay, cake flavored paper.

Be sure to have a bowl of snacks ready, or you might find yourself spending long periods of time lost while looking through your pantry and fridge! \u000aThis strain is often found to be purchased at the 3rd tier level, the value of this strain belongs among the 1st tier. \u000aThe growth pattern is unique, trapping loads of THC within the bulb like buds.\u000a\u000aThe Casual Connoisseur\u000a-BadFish Slims

VEasy, but uplifting high. In moderate amounts, stress just melts away, which makes it a nice nightcap. Good sativa for sleep problems because large amounts give a strong body high, and the stress relief really helps with stress-related insomnia. Friendly tip: keep a snack nearby.

VI have tried this strain twice; the 1st was a cut from Cascade Farms; and the 2nd was an unbelievable organically grown cut from a local Co-Op. The 1st was well; bad. The 2nd was 5*+ Top Shelf A+ bud which shamed the cut from Cascade. The effects were very potent and cerebrally invigorating; making it very easy and fun to focus on tasks and activities. The taste was reminiscent of tropical fruitiness with floral undertones.

VThis is one of my favorite hybrid strains. Typically, I\u2019m cautious of hybrids because of the effects sativa has on my PTSD, anxiety and manic depression. I did not experience the usual body high with the racing thoughts, which makes it difficult to fall asleep. \u000aI experienced a little throat irritation. The taste is a little woody, with something sweet ( actually tasted sweetness on my lips). Body high is great with Cinderella 99. Not a heavy indica type body high but the tension in my back and legs disappeared. The head high isn\u2019t chaotic. I felt motivated to finish some chores before bed and write this review. I will definitely purchase this strain again.

VI affectionately refer to Cindy as &quot;scholar pot&quot;...why? Because I took all my university exams while on it, and aced them. I was dealing with debilitating chronic pain and nausea, and this got me through my education without compromising my grades. What a wonderful gift! Upbeat, daytime strain, allows you to think and focus with a normal level of mental functioning. To be fair, too much can lead to a bit of anxiety/paranoia, as most sativas do (to me anyway lol). After a while of just being on Cindy, I did have to switch it up with a heavy indica just to slow down a bit...Cindy might be too overstimulating for some. But overall, one of my fave strains. It has a purpose (getting you motivated and moving) and when you use it correctly, it always comes through.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. I had a nice date with Cindy. She wasn&#39;t flashy, more mousey, the girl you might have looked past in your youth but regret missed opportunities when you reached a more mature perspective. Cindy is an easy smoke, gentle on your body. Even with my light asthma she gave me no troubles. She reminded me of my favorite, White Widow, but more subtle, gentle, forgiving. Cindy will go anywhere with you, morning, midday, or late in the evening. She can wear flannel or put on that little black dress and surprise you with a few more curves than you thought she had, and party late or tuck you in early. She doesn&#39;t mind; she&#39;s not demanding. She&#39;s up for whatever you are. I was not wowed, or knocked over, I was pleased and impressed at what a go-anywhere girl she is. For me she&#39;s right next to Oaxacan for my all-purpose companion. She was pretty good the morning after, too. No real hangover and I felt well-rested. Don&#39;t let her get away, you might regret it. The mousey daughter of Jack Herer is a fine catch and a sweet girl, a true girl-next-door.

Such a great high very euphoric bubbly but yet heavy. After this occurrence I bought a bit everyday and kept it for an evening smoke when relaxing with friends or just chilling alone as it was great socially and comfortable alone.

VI picked some of this up by accident one time and was pleasantly surprised, it was a smooth citrus taste and a gradual high although once it hit it HIT hard! Such a great high very euphoric bubbly but yet heavy. After this occurrence I bought a bit everyday and kept it for an evening smoke when relaxing with friends or just chilling alone as it was great socially and comfortable alone. One of my all time faves and I would recommend it to all.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. I had a nice date with Cindy. She wasn&#39;t flashy, more mousey, the girl you might have looked past in your youth but regret missed opportunities when you reached a more mature perspective. Cindy is an easy smoke, gentle on your body. Even with my light asthma she gave me no troubles. She reminded me of my favorite, White Widow, but more subtle, gentle, forgiving. Cindy will go anywhere with you, morning, midday, or late in the evening. She can wear flannel or put on that little black dress and surprise you with a few more curves than you thought she had, and party late or tuck you in early. She doesn&#39;t mind; she&#39;s not demanding. She&#39;s up for whatever you are. I was not wowed, or knocked over, I was pleased and impressed at what a go-anywhere girl she is. For me she&#39;s right next to Oaxacan for my all-purpose companion. She was pretty good the morning after, too. No real hangover and I felt well-rested. Don&#39;t let her get away, you might regret it. The mousey daughter of Jack Herer is a fine catch and a sweet girl, a true girl-next-door.

VCindy 99 is one of my faves at the moment. Very intense to me. Powerful. I am a frequent smoker but not a daily smoker, so it may have hit me heavier than a regular smoker. Very trippy and takes you out of yourself at times. Had strong muchies. I LOVED the effects. A good strain for vegging out with an excited spacey mind and relaxed body. Top of my list. I mixed it with SD at one point and it was different of course, but real good.

V@mike_the_budtender with another strain review! Stone mountain is the producer here. This is a unique Cinderella it has a slightly darker tone to it with super bright crystals that make it shine. It&#39;s a subtle high that comes on gentle, making it a perfect strain for beginners or anyone with anxiety. It creates a perfect happy, uplifting, bliss. I strongly recommend this strain.

VI affectionately refer to Cindy as &quot;scholar pot&quot;...why? Because I took all my university exams while on it, and aced them. I was dealing with debilitating chronic pain and nausea, and this got me through my education without compromising my grades. What a wonderful gift! Upbeat, daytime strain, allows you to think and focus with a normal level of mental functioning. To be fair, too much can lead to a bit of anxiety/paranoia, as most sativas do (to me anyway lol). After a while of just being on Cindy, I did have to switch it up with a heavy indica just to slow down a bit...Cindy might be too overstimulating for some. But overall, one of my fave strains. It has a purpose (getting you motivated and moving) and when you use it correctly, it always comes through.

VAbsolutely one of my favorite strains, easily. This strain is beautiful from start to finish. Appearance wise, a stunner, with lots of orange &quot;hairs&quot; and plenty of visible crystals. It has a complex smell and a wonderful taste, and a nice euphoric, creative high. The rosin yielded from pressing these nugs is delicious, too.

The first time I did it, I was foggy-headed for a bit then relaxed and happy.\u000a\u000aAlways puts me in a good mood and gets me a little riled up.

Very strong, and if I&#39;m not careful to respect it, can creep up with anxiety like a mini panic attack. Now I just know my limit.   When I&#39;m feeling right,  if I don&#39;t puff a single puff more then needed to get me comfortable,  I don&#39;t get the anxiety.  Fun, very happy and motivating lift.

Tastes like grapefruit and pineapple with hints of exotic tutti-frutti-licious. Caution  must be taken when smoked, you don&#39;t get a buzz straight away; first wave straight after 1st toke,second wave 5-10 minutes later. \u000aHighly energetic buzz.6.8/10 potency if you&#39;re experienced, 7+ in you&#39;re a newbie.

It&#39;s in your best interest to &quot;FIM&quot; your plant early for more bud tops. She is covered i mean COVERED in trichomes and glistens at an early age. The high is great, its my go to smoke for an early morning buzz. If you get a chance to smoke any variant of the Cinderella 99 strain take it on and keep an eye out for my MtJoy strain.

VIs there a more perfect stoney ganja out there? Immediate effect of stoniness, then uplifted and clear focus and then settling into a steady stoniness. This one is a winner. Only drawback (if this is a drawback to you), is that it brings on some serious munchies.

VStraight cindy is a princess for a reason. Jack alone to me, is really piney like christmas time. (Christmas Buds, anyone?) But you can tell she is Skunk/Haze dominant for sure. Pungent and fruity with notes of spice and classic cat piss haze accentuated by the NL. She is true breeding and stable, so there&#39;s a reason shes hybridized a lot. Mr Soul of Brothers Grimm did a great job here. He really wanted the Shiva Skunk to be dominant so he out-crossed to it, then cubed it back 3 times to the original Princess (bagseed Jack Herer from the Dam?) effectively ending with alot of her genetics. Effects are extremely sativa with just a slight edge of some of the  Afghani. Classic smoke right here. Question is who has Cafe Girl and Genius still, i know Subcool worked with the Apollo 13.

VI don&#39;t generally go for hybrids; having ADD (not hyperactive) Straight sativa strains work best for me, while indicas give me anxiety next day. Durban Poison is my go to. Cindy 99 reminds me of Cherry Pie; a very sativa-ish hybrid that works to clear my head, but eventually puts me to sleep. Maybe a little anxiety the next day? This is potent stuff that I would definitely NOT recommend for a novice.

VC99 is good weed albeit not my 1st, 2nd, but maybe third or tragically often last.  If at all.  Like that 2 in the morning &quot;last call&quot; warm body sitting across the bar smiling and looking incredibly good through the thick booze goggles.  None of this discounts the blissful creature that satisfied your inner sex machine.  Pause, a moment to choke a toke in honor of the Godfather of Soul, James Brown the original loving machine.  And as he might say\u000a\u000aThat ass is fine, think I&#39;ll tap it one more time......\u000a\u000a&quot;Cindy&quot; is just that for me always getting my pulse up being active.  A little bit animated like Hawaiian with the focus of Jack.  Probably go for this flower if all other options are exhausted for several reasons:\u000a1. Very light on smell with even less on taste.  Not screaming terpenes none of the 6-7 times we messed around\u000a2. This lady flower comes fast....with her buzz.  Leaving in the same manner so this guy just keeps wanting more and more......until she is all gone.  Usually puff the shit out of hybrid sativas like this\u000a3. Tastes have gone slightly more indica plus having been around the block with Cinderella a decent amount of times why not give the new pretty flowers a chance?\u000a\u000aNo complaints about my heavy hitting potent bombshell, none at all, this high end affair will continue.........

VI see some people saying this is a great daytime strain, but for me it&#39;s an absolute face melter, I get couch lock not from a heavy body high but from from being completely absorbed in whatever is going on. A super powerful sativa high, and an indica edge that builds over time. Very long lasting. Mild citrus taste and smell

VA mild hybrid.\u000aI&#39;d recommend it for patients who want to be able to work without paranoia or couch lock. Buds look Hybrid upon inspection, but when ground they look almost like old school &quot;dirt&quot;. This is a positive mood strain that I did enjoy, but it is not as potent as the reviews claim, and it&#39;s 0.4% of CBD isn&#39;t worth mentioning.\u000aFlowers smell of Lemon, Pine, Windex, Citrus, &amp; Spices.

A earthy taste with a citrus like kick. Even in a blunt the taste is recognizable. A great sativa high that makes you energetic and creative. definitely would be one of the first strains I pick off the shelf. I hope I get to stumble upon this strain again. Smoke vets who like to smoke for long hours will find this to be a favorite for listening to music and toking all day. I get bursts of happiness and see clarity in things that conflicted in my mind. Would recommend for anxiety relieving seekers.

VGood taste and quick result (the bud was pretty dry, so I&#39;m surprised at the potency).  Heady high that leaves me feeling fuzzy but content.  My eyes are dry and feel puffy, so I likely look sleepy but I don&#39;t feel couch-locked.  There&#39;s dry mouth, too, but thus far the high is lasting longer than what I&#39;ve experienced with better known strains, such as Maui Waui.  I know that Leafly said this is a good daytime strain, but that fuzzy feeling is persisting.  Wouldn&#39;t want to smoke this and try to have a deep conversation.

VThis strain can be extremely powerful. I am pretty new to smoking, and this was the second strain I tried with some friends. I took only three strong bong hits, and the effects where nothing like I was expecting. \u000a\u000aThe high came on about 15 minutes after my first hit. My body felt loose and moving my head around felt fantastic. As I finished my last hit, I realized I smoked waaaay too much for my experience level. The best way to describe my high was as if the physical boundary of my body slowly erased itself. I felt as if I was melting into the sofa I was on, and that I was being reduced into a spiritual essence. When I stood up, I felt as if I was going to fly off the ground. Every step I took felt as if I was melting into the ground.\u000a\u000aThe closest sensation I could relate this too was being extremely drunk with the spins, except instead of feeling like death the next day I felt lethargic but actually really good. I can understand, after smoking this strain, how some ascribe a sacredness to cannabis. This is definitely a strain that can can be used to enhance mediation and spiritual practices.\u000a\u000aJust make sure you are careful with this strain. It can be very powerful if you are not ready.

V:D. Well, this bud has a clear invigorating sativa leaning high and is also great for pain at the same time: it doesn&#39;t get much better for daytime medicine! Just make sure its Female seeds version (actually smells like pineapple/grapefruit/mango) and dried then cured for at least 3 weeks.. Not the most psychedelic in the world but it has real deal landrace sativa type medical benefits though and it breaks through the tolerance threshold for all day medical use. Fixed my fibromyalgia  pretty quick but if you need to go to work combine this with 4 ibuprophen to prevent inflammation in a certain region of the brain that most non-pure-landrace-sativa-strains cause(this will help keep you more focused as research has already shown). Ok so the holidays are on their way and there are alot of people in post surgical type pain out there so I decided to test if c99 w/ibuprophen could treat this type of pain.. And so I smoked a bowl and then kicked my vacuum. I didn&#39;t do it for me, I kicked my vacuum for all of you.. So I actually just kicked the vacuum really hard barefoot, :/, and honestly.. I couldn&#39;t feel a thing! Merry Christmas planet Earth ;)

Vi love this strain. i am currently growing from a c99 seed i found a year ago in a lucky 8th and love, love, love it. she grows fast and flowers early. her buds tops are huge. It&#39;s in your best interest to &quot;FIM&quot; your plant early for more bud tops. She is covered i mean COVERED in trichomes and glistens at an early age. The high is great, its my go to smoke for an early morning buzz. If you get a chance to smoke any variant of the Cinderella 99 strain take it on and keep an eye out for my MtJoy strain.

V&#39;&#39; &#199;indy &#39;&#39;excellent daytime strain, very rewarding to grow due to fast growing fast flowering.A hybrid Sativa (40+days flower). Tastes like grapefruit and pineapple with hints of exotic tutti-frutti-licious. Caution  must be taken when smoked, you don&#39;t get a buzz straight away; first wave straight after 1st toke,second wave 5-10 minutes later. \u000aHighly energetic buzz.6.8/10 potency if you&#39;re experienced, 7+ in you&#39;re a newbie.

VI love sativa heavy Cindy99 :-)! This strain has the belt to prove it&#39;s heavy weight status, it&#39;s just not in resin or super high thc content. The smoke is favorable as far as taste, the cbd/thc content is well balanced and keeps me focused with an edge of non-anxious energy.  ONE OF THE BEST strains I&#39;ve grown, nothing exotic or crafty, just a very Solid sativa/hybrid. I do say the yields are very ideal for a outdoor setup that&#39;s well maintained, this is where it gets its HEAVYWEIGHT status!!!

VCindy 99 from my favorite green thumb botanist is easy my all time favorite &quot;I don&#39;t need no other woman&quot; go to.  I&#39;ve been at this hobby for 17 years now, I&#39;ve had many strains.  Cindy is the best.

VCindy 99  was a nice uplifting experience with a bit of daydreaming. This strain was really good for a functional energetic high that did not impede on my daily physical tasks, I was a bit unfocused and enjoy that on a creative day off. I enjoyed the effects but it just wasn&#39;t the heavy hitter I needed for a 5

VOne of the greatest sativa crosses i have ever tried. Very up lifting. There isn&#39;t that confusing dead-eye high that you get with Indica highs. Its a very smooth, energetic, euphoric-type high that will allow you to still function and concentrate. I would say one of the top 3 (in my humble opinion) sativas available. Lastly, if your a cross-breeder, I would also highly recommend using a Cinderella99 mother in your experiments... You won&#39;t be disappointed!

As expected it tasted great because it is Cindy 99 and super fresh tasting. Really smooth going in and after effects. You can do a nice big dab without feeling like you&#39;re gonna cough. If you follow your nose, this one will probably please you.

VDeep thought hits you like a ton of bricks. You sit in your favorite chair, and as something like a lead curtain falls over your face, you somehow have enough energy to maintain. You could be thinking about the past, about people you love, with the hope that God will bring you your friends during your years at Stratford High. Every inclination you had about catching up comes together and a profound sense of nostalgia overtakes you. You may wonder, days later, why you reached out to those friends long since departed. But something in you is glad you did. This is good.

VCindy 99 all time favorite! For years ive had the pleasure of medicating with her. Deep at night this sativa can make crickets and city noises a swirl of paranoia excitment. A bit hazy and prone to intense cotton mouth so gotta keep my eye drops around and always hydrate myself little more than usual. The cerebral hazy effect last for about an hour and slowly transitions to another hour of cotton mouth and slight hunger binge. Cindy definately has this sweet piney pungent, very pungent strong aroma. Dense big fluffy nugs, vibrant orange hairs with trace amounts of purple from trimmed leafs. Have had the pleasure of smoking multiple batches of the same strain in succession at once from the same grower and have been able to really key in on a well grown, properly flushed, dried, and cured batch. Had this strain tested at C4 Labs and have came back at 14.56% THC.

Vpicked up an eighth in Tacoma WA, Stone Mountain brand. Listed as 22% THC. First off, this one defiantly felt like it was punching above it weight! Strong strong stuff, and a great high. Very euphoric, and for me at least a good bit of couch lock. For me it is one of those strains that If I use at night, the next day, I feel very clearheaded and focused, and I do have a good bit of ADHD and I that this strain helps a lot. The only reason that I don&#39;t give it five stars, is that I did have some issues with negative, introspective B.S. Other than that, fantastic! Enjoy.

VCinderella 99 is my favorite strain. When I share this strain around with friends, they all are impressed with the flavor and effects of it.\u000a\u000aFlavor is citrusy, but unlike Orange Crush, doesn&#39;t have that soda sugar quality to it. It&#39;s tart, almost like a lemon or fresh orange flavor. \u000a\u000aFeelings I&#39;ve consistently gotten was an awake mood. Bright, uplifting. It&#39;s almost like I naturally feel like I&#39;m sitting on spongy grass, or laying on it. My sensitivity to temperature is nicer, usually feel like I&#39;m in a fresh spring morning where the heat of the sun feels sharp. Almost like under a tree.\u000a\u000aI might make a new review or edit this later. I&#39;ve only bought 1 gram of \u000ait, been using a Magic Flight Launch-Box and have been improving my technique every day with meditation. Been trying strains all over and have articulated with friends in great length over the feelings and tastes we have. So this will just probably be a rough of how I dig a certain strain and taste.

VIt was reefered to as Cindy99 when I bought a quarter in Colorado, immediately noticed on smoking that it is a really harsh. Not easy to inhale via joint or bowl\u2014 I really would not recommend to first-time or newer users, because you will probably cough or smoke-rape your throat to shards of glass\u000a\u000aHowever, the high I got off it was pretty... it worked? It spaced me out mainly.\u000a\u000aI tried writing songs on it at various times, didn&#39;t really get any good results. \u000a\u000a3/5 because:\u000a1. It can be hard to hit, even for an experienced user (or maybe I just suck at smoking weed right fam)\u000a\u000a2. Reminded me of those ol&#39; mids n&#39; reggies days bought at trap houses on the front porch so nostalgia points)\u000a\u000a3. Not too expensive, pretty to look at, will unsober you.\u000a\u000a4. Smells good.\u000a\u000a5. Healing House guys and girls were great and very patient and helpful. \u000a\u000aRecommended? \u000aEhh

VSolid sativa energy in this citrus, pine smelling strain. medium sized tight nugs. Smells great and smiles come easy with smoking. Medium stoniness, feel a little hazy.

VA great, creative high but beware! A nap is necessary for the tail end of this high\u2014I could barely keep my eyes open by the end! So not great for when you have a lot to do

VI always wondered what made this a sativa dominant hybrid. what confuses me is that this strain is a cross between Jack Herer and Shiva skunk which is indica, but Jack Herer is also a cross between Shiva skunk and Northern Lights #5, so wouldn&#39;t that make C99 an Indica dominant hybrid being that it&#39;s crossed with twice the Shiva skunk? please let me know if anyone can clear this up for me!
