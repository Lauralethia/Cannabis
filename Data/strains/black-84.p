VFound this as UW Black and impressed on how strong this little indicia strain actually is. Earthy-Woody taste with a piney aroma, super relaxing for both mind &amp; body. At first it was a bit harsh but as it burns it mellows out, personally I found it best topped with a bit of rich wax/oil and it quickly went to &quot;lights out&quot;.

VReal heavy stuff, but great if you&#39;re just trying to crash after a long day. It has a lemony taste to it too. Definitely something I&#39;d buy again.

VStrong heavy Indica strain.  This one hit right to the head with a nice heavy high that finished the night off right.  I hit the couch and sank right into it... I should have no issue going right to sleep tonight.

VI got this strain due to the high THC content (24%). The flavor is not the best, but the head high is good.
