VThe taste is super distinct, actually hash-like. It burns so well too. The high is hazey and just chills you right out. I remember smoking a bunch at my school in the winter and it really helps warm your body up compared to other strains. Try lemon hashplant as well, its the same type of high but with a lemon smell and taste as you would imagine.

VI am dealing with the painful inflammation process from rheumatoid arthritis, so I look for spicy, earthy strains that are heavy on the caryophyllene and myrcene terpenes to control the inflammation and pain. This bud filled the need very well. It put out at least 3 bags of vapor. The spicy terpenes tend to make me sneeze, and this gave me several good sneezes.

VI had a couple medium-sized vaporizer hits (Aerizer air at &quot;orange temp&quot; (about 385?) ... I soon realized I had more than I had intended -- I want to treat PTSD but not get too  high.   Anyway, walking along the street,  i was captivated by the flower arrangements. i got tears in my eyes at the exquisite beauty of 3 of the bouquets. I stared for a couple minutes taking in the beauty of the natural flowers... lol as you can see It is kinda psychedelic and enhances emotions.  Followed by a 2 hour high (pleasant), a 2 hour mild phase (pleasant to neutral) then turned to a depressed state.  I soon went to bed and immediately had a nice sleep waking up OK, but kinda still down. Oh well, guess i gotta go more slowly and not take so much. Maybe only half as much next time.

VThis was my first legal, medical purchase. I found it really nice for controlling migraines, but I wished it had more of a head high and less of a body high. I felt really clumsy and dizzy, but I was very mentally clear about it. Definitely a good high if you don&#39;t have to go anywhere though! Nice to watch movies &amp; fall asleep to. Definitely helps me feel relaxed &amp; sleepy.

VThis is a very good strain for medicinal purposes, good pain relief and stress relief but conks you out really good so I wouldn&#39;t recommend this for a daytime smoke. Toss on a movie before bed time take a toke or two of this and melt into your bed.\u000a\u000aI have NEVER been able to smoke pot. Every time I have attempted to I ended up with panic attacks and major anxiety. To the point I would curl in a ball and overthink my self to sleep. \u000a\u000aAfter a lot of research I learned that Sativas are much more likely to cause these bad effects I experience so I have been trying to find an indica for a really long time. I finally found some hash plant and it is the first time I have smoked pot and not had a panic attack. It was VERY relaxing and helped me sleep.\u000a\u000aI did experience slight paranoia and anxiety at the peak of the high but it quickly dissipated and turned into a very euphoric enjoyable high.\u000a\u000aThe only downside is it made my mouth VERY dry and I suffer from dry eyes in general so this made my eyes very itchy and dry, I picked up some eye drops to counter this tonight. \u000a\u000aI also recommend washing your hands after rolling this I think part of the reason my eyes were so itchy was because after rolling it all the crystal and plant material stuck to my fingers like crazy and I think I got some in my eyes. \u000a\u000aThis is a VERY potent and STRONG strain, having suffered many panic attacks from smoking pot I was very careful and only took a couple tokes and REALLY enjoyed the high, but my partner in crime tried to be a hero and smoked the rest of the join to her self, she spent the night on the floor in the washroom and is a fairly regular smoker who usually doesn&#39;t have any bad reactions.

VI&#39;m actually reviewing O.Pen&#39;s oil concentrate of BC Hash Plant, using a brand new O.Pen Vape Variable Voltage 2.0 pen. \u000a\u000aFrom the very first 8 second hit, I was impressed. Actually hitting a bit harsher than I expected, and had a bit of a coughing fit. But after that, within about 10 minutes, a nice, face tingling high came over me. I was nice and relaxed, euphoric, had a lot of clarity and was able to function well, and make decisions. I would not consider operating machinery, or try to get a small pizza out of the oven. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s been a good 2+ hours and this high is still going strong, which has not been my experience with most other oil concentrates I&#39;ve used in my vape pens. I don&#39;t know yet if it&#39;s the pen or the concentrate, or the strain, but this one is a winner. One of my favorites, for sure!\u000a\u000aBonus, for me at least, no munchies, no droopy dry eyes, and no paranoia.

Vthis is an excellent strain, which I recently obtained. it was lab tested at 23% THC and in tight, conical buds glistening with abundant trichomes.  I vaped this from a pax2, which produced light and smooth vapor, which I found surprising, as I had been anticipating far more heavy clouds.  however, it hit quickly with a remarkably clear and relaxing high. I experienced no appreciable couch-lock but, rather, a sustained head and body high that lasted close to three hours.  overall a very fine strain that I will gladly obtain again.

VHash Plant definitely has tight soft nugs, laced with lots of tackiness. The burn is rich with musky tones and dark resin flavors. Hash Plant flower is very brittle during breakdown and fluffed nicely into my paper. Easy to roll because it&#39;s so sticky, it burns slow and even. I experienced an uplifted feeling, but I&#39;m lit so...I always notice a slight head change but the body felt good. All I wanted to do was stretch my sore muscles. A week of workouts and you need a strain that helps you work through the &quot;kinks.&quot; I&#39;m always looking for strains that help me reach a meaningful mind/body connection, and Hash Plant has it. If you&#39;re looking to get super functional, Hash Plant may spoil your plans. Administer this strain close to home and seek out your comfortable wear. I&#39;ve seen a few different varieties of this strain, check my other reviews for those. ~please like and follow if this review was helpful.

VAmazing for making any concentrates. It tastes like it smells. It&#39;s a harsh strain, but really good. It&#39;ll put you to sleep, but it gets rid of headaches and moderate to severe pain very well when used in concentrates. The high lasts a couple hours too.

VThis particular sample of mine came from a local dispensary.  I&#39;m not aware of the genetics of my sample, and it&#39;s important to point out that there are several different sub types of hash plant which are loosely (in some cases, not clearly) identified.  Several seed companies produce a strain called, &quot;Hash Plant&quot; and they do not all share the same genetics.  For my sample, this really lived up to its name.  Buds were gorgeous and the smell and taste were a good strong hash taste and smell.  I really didn&#39;t expect this strain to deliver being a hash smoker myself, but I was pleasantly surprised.  While HP has a great body stone, my initial reaction to it was similar to that of pure sativas, with a great, uplifting emotional high followed quickly by the strong body stone.  Based on my sample, I rate this strain in my top three personal favorites in this order;  Afghan Kush, Panama Red (extinct, pretty much), Hash Plant.  I will definitely be picking up more of this.

VI recently got a medical marijuana card for anxiety and stress. I decided to go to an Electronic concert, and smoked around .4 grams of this before, and was very energetic and euphoric but had a slight headache as I usually do with heavy indica strains.\u000a\u000aI smoked it for the next two days, and was astounded by its incredibly power and body high as well as long lasting high. I was very hungry, probably consuming sixty dollars worth of food in 24 hours, and had a great time and not a difficult comedown.\u000a\u000aAfter I took above an average dosage and I began to feel dizzy, like I was beginning to &#39;green out&#39;. Very powerful, harsh-tasting strain, gives you bang for your buck!

VI decided to try this strain because when I was living in the Netherlands hashish was the typical smoke and I love how it smelled. so I raced home after work and quickly smoke a bowl from my water bong. I had intended to go to my physical therapist after. I ended up canceling because I was higher than Jerry Garcia and could barely get around the house. I gave this strain of 4 out of 5 for potency. weed virgins beware this strain can kick like a mule. I t is definitely not a smoke-n-drive strain and should be consumed slowly so you can monitor for effect if you do not want to end up non-functional.

Found it again in 2012 and it was definitely the same phenotype but probably a different grower. The smell and taste were still there but not as overpowering as the stuff I grew up on. Tried some outdoor Hash Plant a couple months ago and the smell and taste were there just not overpowering either, probably due to how it was cured. The high is one of a kind. It always just leaves me feeling in a state of bliss. Great for those stressful days and trying to dull aches and pains. Definitely one of my favorite strains of all time. The taste is one of a kind, when you try it you won&#39;t ever forget it.

VWow! I can&#39;t stop staring at this beautiful strain grown by Mesa Organics in Pueblo. We were in love with Hashplant from the first look. The trichrome blanketed buds and fresh aroma of this strain captivated the senses. Hashplant offered a very balanced cerebral and body buzz. Very uplifting yet relaxing. In our opinion it would be a great strain for nausea, headaches and inflammation. All anxiety and stress melted away with just a few tokes of this delicious strain. Highly recommend to all!

VThis strain has an earthy and woody flavour with a hint of Afghani hash.  After exhale, this beautiful bud has a sharp and spicy flavour that is smooth and creamy.   I like this strain to assist with relaxation and my moods. It also assisted with relaxing my stiff and sore muscles.    This strain is not strong enough to help me with sleep.  I enjoy this stran and would purchase more in the future.

VOne of my favorite strains. Cuts through stress. Uplifts mood. Relaxes the body. Reduces anxiety. Effects are similar to OG Kush but Hash Plant is very much its own unique high. The flower&#39;s smell is a pungent resinous skunky hash that will overtake the whole room quickly. I found Hash Plant in flower form from 2000 to 2003. I remember each time I smoked it back then it was like someone just brightened the room. It can really elevate my mood. Big dark green resinous sticky smelly buds. Recently I had the pleasure of experiencing it in concentrate form and it was superb. It&#39;s an indica but I can use Hash Plant all day long and it  helps with my ADHD (focus/motivation/sitting still). Without a doubt helps with my PTSD (relieves: social anxiety, generalized anxiety, insomnia, stress, panic, obsessing thoughts) throughout the day and into the evening. This is a strain that&#39;s in my personal top 10 and I&#39;d like to have access to in perpetuity.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Great for pain relief and insomnia. Effects happen relatively fast and last for a good amount of time. \u000a\u000aCons: Will make you tired/sleepy so more of a night time strain unless you are looking for this effect. \u000a\u000aOverall: Smooth pull and exhale, has a piney, earthy taste and smell. Tingling feeling in legs and body, but relaxing. Not really any head high, other than relaxing and eyes becoming heavy. Would highly recommend for pain. Couch lock is due more to sleepiness. This is my go to strain when I need major pain relief.

VThis is a review for &quot;Hashwreck&quot; by Leafwerx, concentrate- 1g cart ultra-refined oil\u000a\u000aI couldn&#39;t find the &quot;Hashwreck&quot; strain documented here on Leafly, but I believe the budtender said it was a cross between Hash Plant &amp; Trainwreck. Allegedly a hybrid, this strain of ultra-refined oil by Leafworks is amazing! They were sold out just a few days later! The tech of the cart is great too, with a ceramic element, low sitting intake holes (get every last drop!), &amp; a decently heavy hit on my battery&#39;s low setting. This &quot;Hashwreck&quot; strain was really great for addressing pain issues as well! It also provided a well balanced, spacey hybrid high, but not too stoney to be completely put out. Unless you vape too much of course. :)\u000aHappy tokin&#39; \u270c&#127995;

I totally felt the total indica body high, but nothing on the &quot;cerebral high&quot; part of things, obviously because is a 90% indica. Definitely recommend for those patients seeking for pain relief.

VA wonderful daytime indica, leaves you very relaxed and pain free without a crushing couch lock effect. The nugs are dense , a deep green color with some purple splashes and sticky to an almost comical level. Smell wise it&#39;s almost a sweet earthiness, mixed with almost mint or tar.... maybe cough syrup? Flavour is almost mossy, with some pepper and tar thrown in for good measure.

Medicinally I need something for depression and anxiety and this is pretty good for my symptoms.  the only reason it got 4 stars was because it does make me a little lazy.  I have no priblem doing tasks on it but need cinvinving to get iff the couch sometimes after a large medication session.  wonderfu flavor and aroma.  pungent.

Vthis stuff is delicious! it is by far one of my favorite tasting and smelling buds and watching it twinkle and glisten in the sunlight always makes you excited to roll one up. this is great bed-time or after-work smoke - a heavy dose will definitely make it hard to get back up off the couch again, so plan for it. \u000a\u000aIt has a berries and cream type flavour with a buttery - almost cheesy tinge to it. definitely a great strain for anyone with insomnia or muscle discomfort.

VA real chill strain. It&#39;s a bit of a grower. I thought about rolling a second one, and by the time I went back inside, the hashplant had kicked in, and there was no rush for a second one. A laidback stone, that&#39;s perfect for kicking with a buddy, or going on a nice hike in the early evening. Or whatever you do that you find calming and relaxing. \u000a\u000aIf you want a night in on the couch, this is good for that, too, but I find it&#39;s better to go do something to enjoy the full effects of this wonderful strain.

VLoved it! This is the 8th strain I&#39;ve tried since getting my card, and I think it&#39;s my favorite. I usually use MM to deal with nausea and anxiety. But I&#39;ve been having a lot of bad neck pain this week, so I picked up some of this from the dispensary. Not only did it take care of the neck pain, but I was crazy sexy frisky all night and the next morning. I&#39;m glad someone else mentioned the nudity aspect...I really didn&#39;t want to keep my clothes on after smoking this! Ha ha. Although I slept well, it didn&#39;t make me sleepy, as I&#39;d expected from an Indica. Indicas and Indica-heavy hybrids often just konk me right out, but this was great. It actually seemed to perk me up a bit. I did a lot of writing/journaling right after smoking, and interestingly my handwriting was tight and legible...it usually gets a bit loopy and sloppy after I smoke/vape/eat. And the content of my writing was actually intelligent and coherent. Some surprisingly good stuff. Taste was a little harsh, but I&#39;m definitely an effect over taste kind of person, so didn&#39;t bother me much. Haven&#39;t tried it in my Pax 2 yet, but interested to see the difference. My gut tells me that if it was going to be used in an edible, might be better in something savory rather than sweet? Maybe I&#39;ll experiment a little with that. Quick pain relief, long-lasting libido and arousal, articulate/intelligent creativity boost, and pleasant body high without super sleepiness...I&#39;m sold!!! P.S. Ladies, I&#39;ve found that it also zaps my wicked menstrual cramps like magic. Hallelujah!

VEach human body has different chemistry, just like the different strains of our medicine. Hash Plant hits all the right notes for me and my chemistry. It provides a happy release from depression and anxiety combined with soothing pain relief for the body. It is a harsh hitter to be sure. However, I prepare fresh, decarbed buds in coconut oil as a sublingual tincture. This method provides the relief and experience I need.

I totally felt the total indica body high, but nothing on the &quot;cerebral high&quot; part of things, obviously because is a 90% indica. Definitely recommend for those patients seeking for pain relief.

VThis is a review for &quot;Hashwreck&quot; by Leafwerx, concentrate- 1g cart ultra-refined oil\u000a\u000aI couldn&#39;t find the &quot;Hashwreck&quot; strain documented here on Leafly, but I believe the budtender said it was a cross between Hash Plant &amp; Trainwreck. Allegedly a hybrid, this strain of ultra-refined oil by Leafworks is amazing! They were sold out just a few days later! The tech of the cart is great too, with a ceramic element, low sitting intake holes (get every last drop!), &amp; a decently heavy hit on my battery&#39;s low setting. This &quot;Hashwreck&quot; strain was really great for addressing pain issues as well! It also provided a well balanced, spacey hybrid high, but not too stoney to be completely put out. Unless you vape too much of course. :)\u000aHappy tokin&#39; \u270c&#127995;

VOne of my favorite strains. Cuts through stress. Uplifts mood. Relaxes the body. Reduces anxiety. Effects are similar to OG Kush but Hash Plant is very much its own unique high. The flower&#39;s smell is a pungent resinous skunky hash that will overtake the whole room quickly. I found Hash Plant in flower form from 2000 to 2003. I remember each time I smoked it back then it was like someone just brightened the room. It can really elevate my mood. Big dark green resinous sticky smelly buds. Recently I had the pleasure of experiencing it in concentrate form and it was superb. It&#39;s an indica but I can use Hash Plant all day long and it  helps with my ADHD (focus/motivation/sitting still). Without a doubt helps with my PTSD (relieves: social anxiety, generalized anxiety, insomnia, stress, panic, obsessing thoughts) throughout the day and into the evening. This is a strain that&#39;s in my personal top 10 and I&#39;d like to have access to in perpetuity.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Great for pain relief and insomnia. Effects happen relatively fast and last for a good amount of time. \u000a\u000aCons: Will make you tired/sleepy so more of a night time strain unless you are looking for this effect. \u000a\u000aOverall: Smooth pull and exhale, has a piney, earthy taste and smell. Tingling feeling in legs and body, but relaxing. Not really any head high, other than relaxing and eyes becoming heavy. Would highly recommend for pain. Couch lock is due more to sleepiness. This is my go to strain when I need major pain relief.

VWhile in Vancouver, BC - I picked up some seeds from The Vancouver Seed Company . My buddy who is an experienced grower grew some of these seeds indoors. The weed really didn&#39;t smell like hash AT ALL once fully budded. I suspect it is not Afghani based but more of a Indian or North African strain.The plants were short and didn&#39;t give a good yield. High was above average but nothing special. The weed did stink up his whole place with a weird smell of skunk and bad old lady perfume despite odor control attempts.  It was crossed with a sativa and the result was much better yield wise and buzz wise. 5/10

VThis one was not a win. It literally had no effect on me whatsoever. I tried it in every bong, pipe, bubbler or vape pen I owned because I wanted to love this one. After all that, I felt exactly the way I did when j started only I was a bit more bored. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m thinking there had do have been something amiss with the specific plant that what I purchased from came from. If I see it again, I&#39;ll try a little for the sake of fairness and update accordingly

Vfrosty bud with long, almost neon orange hairs. The hairs are unique in not only their lengths but the way in which they come out of the bud is very \u201ccrazy\u201d pattern.  Very wild and very vibrant. The best way I can describe the smell it is to say it was a funkier version of a Jack Herrer or Snowcap. Fruity pine tasting and just a great happy uplifting high.

VThis is the first time I have had the chance to pick up some Hash Plant. I was skeptical about it being an Indica/Indica Hybrid (as I prefer Indica/Sativa hybrids). It was very smooth with a clean sweet taste and after tones of earthiness. It kicks in fairly quick and starts of with a nice energetic, but not drive yourself crazy energetic. As it peaks you get a very pleasant, euphoric and relaxing buzz. Coming down, you get very relaxed - slightly sleepy - but DEFINITELY not couch-locked.\u000a\u000aI give it 5/5 stars, especially being an Indica that I really enjoy.
