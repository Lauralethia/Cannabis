VJust got ahold of this strain for the first time and found it quite nice..Dense and compact buds, sticky and with a wonderful sweet aroma with a fuelie background note. I used it in my herbalizer and the vapor was so smooth and oh so &#128523;.Beautiful soft berry/citrus flavor from some nice thick vapor, immediately relaxing for me, I drifted off into a mellow and relaxing sleep.

VThis bud stays true to that berry taste. One hit wonder type. Best if used right before you go to sleep, or I noticed works a lot better then a sativa taking for anxiety later in your day. This is my go to strain for sleep. Doesn&#39;t take much, saving you more money. A must try!

VWhile White widow is one of my favorite strains, this mix of Black Domina and her isn&#39;t quite on par with what I expected. Very sedating and mellowing, witch was it&#39;s only saving grace. Found the lemony flavor pretty nice, but all other flavor was just meh.  I have not tried Black Domina yet, but am interested in trying just her. Nice, but if there are other choices, I&#39;d keep my mind open about it!!

VSubtle citrus tones make way to a heavy skunk-scented smoke. Cerebral effects include heavy eyelids and an overall sense of well-being. This strain pairs well with any purple (blueberry my personal choice.) Flowers may not be dense but they are potent enough to feel effects. This strain falls into my &quot;sleep/night&quot; mix.
