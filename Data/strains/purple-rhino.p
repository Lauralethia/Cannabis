V5.0 top of the top if not the best. The description by leafly is spot on. &quot;White Rhino&quot; was my favorite at my first dispensary (like they said high thc% for patients ailments) mixed w purps another of my favorites literally (I love the color ect). Mix in a little sativa in the bowel and your good white rhino makes the hi last long time while the purps intensify it.

VUpon arriving at the procurer\u2019s establishment, I realized I smelled a lavender scent with a slight pungency and skunkiness about 10 feet away from the closed front door. This was definitely some, \u2018loud\u2019 flower but in a sweeter, more floral sense than the typical Skunk and O.G. profiles that are more common. When smelling these flower buds closer, the pungency of the White Rhino can definitely be detected along with lavender (linalool) and humulene notes from The Purps being clearly noticeable.\u000a\u000aAppearance: men, give this flower to your girlfriend/partner/spouse. It is straight purple to the max with occasional orange stigmas. Heavily coated in white trichomes with a solid structure reminiscent of the White Rhino that yells, \u2018Flower!\u2019. Hands down, this is one of the most appealing flowers I have ever seen in my life. I have yet to see this depth of true, real purple pigments in Cannabis to-date. This is real purple (i.e., not secondary to alterations in temperature, lighting, humidity, atmospheric pressure and/or other cultivation factors).\u000a\u000aTaste: definitely pungent; slightly earthy and nutty. The sweetness of the Purps stands through indeed. Definite taste of lavender. This strain leaves the sensation in the chest and throat of, \u2018potency\u2019 and intensity. Exhalation leaves the tinge of the classic, \u2018Purple\u2019 flavor.\u000a\u000aEffect: sit down for this one. This flower strain definitely has a kick to it, and if partaking in larger quantities, the intensity enters into the realm of numbness and sedation to an extent that can, honestly, surpass even an, \u2018alcohol-level\u2019 tipsy (much cleaner, safer and better for you though, obviously). This is powerful stuff \u2013 no joke. I shared one gram with another person, and after we were done, though he went straight into the other room to have sex (with his now wife), I realized, while walking up the stairs, that I literally felt, \u2018drunk\u2019 (I didn\u2019t make it up the stairs as quick: didn\u2019t have as much incentive! LoL). The session ended with me completely numb, head to toe, and fully sedated \u2013 all of which persisted for a prolonged duration as well. Another one of those strains that, unless intaken in a conscious manner, can induce sweating, dizziness, weakness of the knees and many other characteristics that stronger intensity strains can produce similar to dabs.\u000a\u000aOverall: a hallmark strain that deserves top-praises in Cannabis hall-of-fames. I\u2019m not typically particular to Purple strains, but this one was so intense, solid, persisting and utterly relentless that I have to say it deserves a standing ovation. You inhale this stuff in an attempt to, \u2018take on\u2019 it head on, it will go beyond leaving you agasp: it will Bruce Lee-Chuck Norris roundhouse you against the wall (to the floor in this case: caution, as mentioned).\u000a\u000aWould I buy this strain again? By the kilogram.\u000a\u000aRecommend to Connoisseurs and Sommeliers? Absolutely.\u000a\u000aRecommend to first-timers and/or inexperienced consumers? Probably not a good idea. May be a bit too intense.

VI&#39;m having surgery tomorrow to remove a large ovarian cyst. This strain has been invaluable to my effort to manage my pain. The cyst causes me to have severe nausea/vomiting and lose my appetite, so this strain helps me keep food down, and helps me actually want to eat it. It almost works better than the prescription painkillers I was given.

VFresh, earthy taste. Has a smooth transition as it eases you into an uplifting eurphria that lasts for 3 hours. Very calming and relaxed, (slightly) sedative come down. This predominantly-indica hybrid is perfect after a long day or before bedtime.

VI did not quite feel any relieving effects from this strain, definitely given the impression it would be strong by the smell, the appearance and rating at the dispensary. It was like any average - sub par strain. I only became a little buzzed and it wasn\u2019t for very long.
