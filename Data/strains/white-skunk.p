V10 White Label seeds and I got three phenos. The first was a small super-solid-silver christmas tree looking thing that I think may have been a White Ice? Twas very potent, unique skunky smell and taste, strong stone. Finished very early 6-7 weeks. \u000aClones kept getting increasingly better. Second pheno was hermie and lacked the same quality as the first, average. The lucky last White Skunk seed turned out to be WHITE, crystal covered average sized buds that take 9-11 weeks, very smelly and tasty, crazy unique skunky orange scent kinda similar to the first pheno, nice daytime smoke positive talkitive high.

VIndicas usually aren&#39;t my favorite but this strain is great, it has a smooth sweet flavor mixed with a pungent skunkyness. The high is great, very relaxing and euphoric with a pleasing behind the eyes effect. A good strain to sit on the couch and watch movies to.

VI&#39;ve been trying to find a strain that will get me high, I&#39;ve developed such a tolerance that I wasn&#39;t able to get high but a few grams of white skunk and I&#39;m n feeling better, great for anxiety and depression but will probably couch lock you

Vdefinitely taste like a skunky citrus weed. Great head high and really helps your muscles relax great after a work out, energetic but still able to enjoy watching TV after a good bath before heading to bed. Average taste unless you really enjoy citrus but great strain over all. THC 28.9

Vnot a huge indica guy, but this strain struck me heavy and hard while also giving me a bit of a sativa mind-movement sort of thing, but i was relaxed the whole time. best strain I&#39;ve had in a long time, especially compared to other indica strains. wouldn&#39;t use it if i have to socialize, but i might be able to manage doing some light work with it. dry mouth is the only bummer i really noticed. have plenty of water at your disposal when you smoke this! but again, if you enjoy the relaxing feeling of indica and the motion and activity of sativa, this strain might be the best you can find to fit the bill. really, really, really helpful with anxiety. big time. helps a little with pain, but all of my very intense anxiety was what i mainly noticed disappear.

VIf it smells like a fruit loops that have been sitting in milk and turned soggy, mixed with a skunks rear end, you know it&#39;s the wonderful White Skunk. This Strain is incredible for treating Anxiety and pain. It also combats depression nicely. Strain can get quite intense in larger doses. Would Recommend to anyone

Vand buddy and me just finished legally growing a crop of this. I suffer from chronic pain, as well as neuropathy from two brain surgeries. House of Sun mental side effects from that as well as PTSD excetera. point being is this medication quelled all that for me. it just relaxes me to the bone. The only downside I really notices some dry mouth and a little bit of a headache most like a headband strain. headache dissipates after a while 5 - 10 minutes as the desirable symptoms start to kick in. definitely worth it a go, especially if you suffer from any type of pain
