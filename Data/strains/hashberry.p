VThis review is for the strain Chocolate Hashberry.\u000a\u000aMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer.\u000a\u000aPros: Strong pain relief and euphoric head high. More hybrid than straight indica. Good if you need to eat, made me quite hungry. \u000a\u000aCons: Dry eyes and some dry mouth. Little groggy after waking up, still felt some of the head effects.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Smooth draw and exhale. Taste was sweet/earthy. I could taste a light hint of dark chocolate/coffee flavor. Gradual build into euphoria, starting with a light headband effect around the brow and then behind the eyes. Body pain melted away. Effects were stronger than I expected. Head high was almost too much, but leveled out. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this if you need pain relief/relaxation combined with some euphoria. More of a nighttime strain due to sleepiness.

Vnice dense flower with a fruit aroma; took a strong twist to break the flower down ( a very good sign). Now the exhale on this is a very thin smoke, and for that matter a tad flat on flavor but has a nice feel. Was using this in day and had no problem writing this review. For the record it&#39;s not a knock you down strain like you might think with it&#39;s name and all but it is a nice strain for daytime use. Would I get this again &quot;maybe&quot;...

VI tried it alone and decided I like it more when I mix it with a little CBD from another strain. I have anxiety really bad, so when I get too high I have problems staying calm. So, with the ability to use a high CBD strain with it, this is a really good strain for me.\u000a\u000aKind of separates me from my mind clutter for a while and instead I can focus on different things that are less stressful. Very calming in that way.

VI need to disclose, first, that I got this strain from a sketchy although legal dispensary. They threw lots of stems in the bag, didn&#39;t seem to care about the product or the customer, so it could be an altered experience. Or it could just be the straight truth perhaps, just because it was a cheap dispensary doesn&#39;t mean the weed was necessarily bad.\u000a\u000aHashberry would give me slight dissociative effects and paranoia/anxiety at even moderate doses. There was little to no euphoria, and on the comedown it was a very harsh crash that made me feel almost not in control of my actions. I&#39;ll probably never try this strain again, I had bought a whole quarter ounce since it was so cheap, ended up giving probably 6g of it to my friend.

VFantastic strain. It isn&#39;t too heavy of an indica that it knocks you down, but rather more of a mellow, relaxed, uplifted effect which allows for enough energy to have conversation while maintaining a nice level body relaxation.

Vnice dense flower with a fruit aroma; took a strong twist to break the flower down ( a very good sign). Now the exhale on this is a very thin smoke, and for that matter a tad flat on flavor but has a nice feel. Was using this in day and had no problem writing this review. For the record it&#39;s not a knock you down strain like you might think with it&#39;s name and all but it is a nice strain for daytime use. Would I get this again &quot;maybe&quot;...
