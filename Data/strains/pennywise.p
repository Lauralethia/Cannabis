VThis is a very important medicinal strain.  The calming and anti-inflammatory effects from the CBD are very strong, and while the THC is still present in an even ratio, it&#39;s effects are very clearly being modulated towards the more &quot;healing&quot; side than the &quot;high&quot; side.  The aroma is skunky, with a hint of woodiness.  The flavour of the vapour was earthy and spicey, reminiscent of its Jack Herer parentage.  It&#39;s name is actually quite ironic when you think about it.

VI discovered PennyWise at the Downtown Dispensary in Tucson.  What a find! \u000a\u000aI deal with degenerative joint disease, degenerative disc disease, and PTSD.  Pharmaceutical medicines often don&#39;t agree with me (and usually don&#39;t work, and have awful side effects).  When I whiffed this excellent medicine, the aroma reached out and sucked me right into the jar.  I bought an ounce.\u000a\u000aIn six weeks, I&#39;ve gone from taking three different kinds of sleeping pills to...NONE.  After literally 40 years of night terrors I can finally go to bed like a normal person and fall asleep and sleep through the night.\u000a\u000aThe anti-inflammatory medicine I&#39;ve been dutifully swallowing for years and years...I&#39;ve tapered off that.  My joint pain is no worse, and is getting steadily better, the longer I use my PennyWise.  My stomach is much happier, too!\u000a\u000aThis is beautiful weed, people.  Whether you suffer from bodily pain, life trauma, or both, I hope you can find some of this healing medicine.

VHere is another good one! 1:1 strain which helps with pain and nerves. This is also a night strain, you&#39;ll want to hit the bed within an hour or two. If you are looking for a night time strain which is high in CBD, this is a good one! Oh, and NO anxiety or parinoid feeling at all. It reminds me of a Mars OG with a hint of GDP.

VMy dispensary had lab tests for this that made it appear to be 1:1 cbd-thc ratio. Those are the kind of tinctures I buy so I figured I&#39;d give Pennywise a try. BEST STRAIN I&#39;ve used for rheumatoid arthritis.  It provides rapid relief and unlocks any stuck joints within 15 minutes. It also provides a nice indica body high/moderate stone that is a little lighter than most indica&#39;s I&#39;ve used because of the CBD&#39;s relaxation, but it is still sleep inducing if I have enough. If I have just a little then I can stay awake and not be high, but I do generally use it at night so I can lay down afterwards. And in case you were wondering, yeah, you CAN get high on it. REALLY HIGH. You just might need to have a bit more because of the lower THC content.

VWelcome to pennywise, a smokers smoke. Best described as An Iron-fist with a satin glove. Thick and robust on the inhale, soft and smooth on the exhale, pennywise is a powerful strain with a strong nose that induces a numbing effect very different from other indicas. Perfect for relaxing and letting go,  pennywise has you from the first toke. Where this strain makes its mark is on the surprising power with the obvious lack of harshness. Not much more you can ask from a stain. Recommended for the experienced smoker.

V&quot;Oh wow, am I high? ..yeah.. I&#39;m definitely high.. but there&#39;s something else there that makes me feel dizzy yet functional.&quot;\u000a\u000aThese were my immediate thoughts, 10 minutes after vaporizing that earthy herbal goodness known as Pennywise.\u000a\u000aThe high is complex, with a mental buzz and a dizzying sort of clarity, if that makes any sense. Smoking too much though can  cause headaches and provoke a bit of physical anxiety, which is odd for a high CBD strain, though it wouldn&#39;t be surprising given the plant&#39;s sativa lineage after all.\u000a\u000aThe taste is satisfyingly robust to the palate, smells distinctly tart like grapefruit, has a moderately decent bag appeal, and is just perfect for bouts of insomnia, muscle tension, inflammation, and curbing negative emotions.\u000a\u000aGreat medicinal properties, though it&#39;s not the best tasting cannabis I&#39;ve ever tried, it&#39;ll definitely be one to stock up on when you just need to chillax!\u000a\u000a420

VIn my search for a low paranoia strain that could still lend some euphoria, I&#39;m pleased with Pennywise. I felt happy, a little silly, carefree, and no anxiety or paranoia or spiraling thoughts.\u000a\u000aIn my limited experience I found the strength to be pretty moderate. I wasn&#39;t in danger of one or two pulls too many putting me way too far over. The more intense part of the peak was also moderate in duration, but the relaxed general happiness stuck around for a long while. I figured that&#39;s the CBD speaking.

VMild smell and flavour. Flavour was a little bit like the light green pressed Moroccan hash we used to get in the 70s, almost like faint perfume. Vapor went down easy at first, but started to get pretty harsh half-way through.  \u000aEffects- Quickly relaxing, not bad for joint pain and excellent for inflammation and muscle tightness. I was thinking straight. I was focused on one thing for periods, almost in the groove rather than high, like a light sativa. I had fleeting moments of strong intoxication and naturally got back in the flow. Extremely dry throat and effected my vision a lot after about an hour. Sleep will come soon, I bet.

VPennywise is THE ideal strain for managing day time pain. It&#39;s CBD to THC ratio is more balanced that other strains with a slightly higher CBD%. By itself, PW will gently ease low to moderate pain levels of 1 to maybe 5, if you&#39;re familiar with the happy/sad pain chart. Combine a high CBD editable, like the gold foiled taffy with upwards of 80mg CBD, to help severe or chronic pain levels of 6 or higher . If your goal is pain management without lethargy, Pennywise may just be your marijuana soul mate, too. \u000a\u000aP.S. Figuring out what about Pennywise works for me has increased my understanding of my own chemistry and how to identify other strains to try. I now know to look for strains with similar 1:1 ratios if I don&#39;t want to feel sleepy. If this sounds like something you want to try there are two other strains I&#39;ve tried with similar ratios: Charlotte&#39;s Web and Nebula. Though I find Pennywise to be the most effective with the least amount of crash.\u000a\u000aThank you to the growers of this awesome strain!

VI have to say, I was completely blown away by Pennywise. It&#39;s a 1:1 cbd/thc coming in at around 7%, so I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting very much. I purchased it as a bit of an afterthought, wanting to sample a strain with high cbd content. Looks and smells great, and is really pleasant to smoke. The effects are really remarkable. It is energetic and uplifting in the manner of a lot of sativas, but whether it&#39;s due to the low thc content or the mitigating effect of cbd, it produced absolutely zero paranoia or anxiety. Quite the contrary in fact. I was happy, talkative and productive. Very social. Just a great strain for people that want to treat depression or fatigue, but are prone to anxiety. It&#39;s not intense, but for me that&#39;s not always a bad thing. I enjoyed that I was able to smoke quite a bit at a time and never feel too overwhelmed. Honestly, it&#39;s the sort of strain I&#39;ll probably buy in bulk to have on hand for everyday use. It&#39;s made me want to seek out other 1:1 ration strains.

VMy nickname for this strain is &quot;half&amp;half&quot; referring to the typical THC/CBD ratio. My first taste of Pennywise was 14% thc and 10% cbd. It was the most balanced high I&#39;d ever felt. \u000aToday, a flirty jar of Pennywise caught my eye.  The ratio is about 6% thc and 8% cbd. It is just as wonderfully balanced as my first exposure. The cbd helps a lot for chronic pain,  and adds a relaxed feel to the high.  Lower thc is also good for people who have paranoia  associated with smoking cannabis. \u000a\u000aFor sure this strain is in my top 5 favorites.  Always worth a try.\u000aOr not,  more for me. \u000aI&#39;m always sad to hear it&#39;s sold out.

VI found the second time very similar to the first time. I found myself relaxed and with less pain, but wanting the effects to be a bit more THC. I was almost going to reduce my review to 3.5 stars.  Why didn&#39;t I? Today I blended about 30% Island Sweet Skunk into the Pennywise, loaded a pipe and vaped it. The skunk offered a bit of flavour and softened the vapor.  Just what I wanted, a bit of head effects.  The strain can be used to dump a big hit of CBD into whatever else you have, giving it tremendous value as  a mixer. I am going back to get an eighth just for that purpose.

VI officially love this strain. This is the the first weed I\u2019ve smoked in decades and the experience was magical. An instant euphoria hit me in minutes followed by this amazing calming effect. My whole body felt like a giant stone after only a few hits. I quickly grabbed me some VEGAN ass nachos and water and descended into my couch. I was couch locked for hours, giggling calmly and happily to myself. Also, immediately after smoking all the soreness and pain I have drifted away and was covered by this amazing body high, a calming buzz. When I started smoking it I had a huge migraine and within mere minutes I could feel the migraine recede to the back of my skull into nothingness. For the first time in years I had calmness and peace, pain free, and was filled with happiness. What an amazing strain.

VI hesitated on the 4 star review. It could have been 3, 4 or 5. The pain relief was instant, easing my muscle pain and giving me overall more mobility in a positive way (I have EDS type III hypermobility, but can&#39;t walk correctly most days). The problem was that my heart rate spiked from 65 to 120 and my BP dropped from 105/72 to 94/60 within a few minutes. That eased over time, but I have IST and my heart doesn&#39;t need any extra stress. On top of that, I had some brain fog. So you see my conundrum. Pain relief: 5 star, added brain fog now drops to 4 star, with the HR and BP issues, it&#39;s a 3 star (much to my dismay).

VI really like Pennywise, it\u2019s a great Indica CBD strain for sleep and pain. For me, Indica CBD\u2019s work best to help me sleep and to help with pain,tension etc. while Sativa hybrids help with anxiety and pain during the day when I don\u2019t want to feel high and I need to be productive.\u000aI vape this flower by itself, but I really like to mix it with Manito Kush or Shiatsu flower. \u000aBy itself it gives a nice, soothing and mellow high that isn\u2019t over powering and doesn\u2019t cause paranoia or racing heart. If I smoke a little I feel relaxed and just a little high,but mildly so and it relaxes muscles, calms nerve pain and settles the mind. If you want a stronger effect just adjust, I actually like to puff on this and just relax and enjoy without worrying about getting too high. Due to the 1:1 ratio (9% each) this strain is easy to adjust to your own needs. This is great to blend with THC dominant strains or consume on its own.

I can also recommend just smoking a little of this for a nice quiet movie night or netflix session with your loved one or friends. just all around a wonderful feeling on this stuff. oh and for sure makes you a bit more creative thinking. &lt;3 This is my new favorite strain.

VI need high CBD strains for MS and fibromyalgia. I prefer 1:1 ratios, which Pennywise has. It works great for me when I need to be calm or chill out. During the day, it&#39;s a little too sedating, especially because I feel tired most of the time anyway. It doesn&#39;t make me anxious, paranoid, or give me a headache. The taste is unremarkable, but I found that it grew on me.

VAs a sufferer from constant stress and anxiety, this strain does wonders on relaxing me for a day or two. I&#39;m not normally relaxed, but this makes me feel normal. The high is clear, you stay focused, with some little funny moments from the rest of the THC effects. I think medically this is the best weed I&#39;ve ever smoked.

There is little to no stoned or high feeling, but level of pain relieving relaxation is strong. Until new user adjusts to this overwhelming body comfort it will induce sleep so heads up!

This is another one of those wonderful strains that makes you feel like your whole body has been brought into alignment. It did spike my tinnitus a little bit but nothing that was long-lasting.

VPennywise is a nice high CBD strain with roughly a 1:1 ratio of CBD : THC. I believe it does lean toward indica, so it is more of a lazy day / late evening medicine than it is a morning pick-me-upper. \u000a\u000aWhile it doesn&#39;t knock you out in the way that most non high CBD indicas do, I still don&#39;t partake of Pennywise in the mornings, as it does relax me a bit too much for my own good on days that I would prefer to be productive. However, it is almost the perfect strain for me to vaporize *right* after work, as it helps my muscles relax, my mind settle down, and yet keeps me functioning enough to take advantage of the remaining hours of the evening.

VPennywise, being a 1:1 ratio strain is pretty good considering I have a high tolerance to Marijuana.\u000aQuite surprising that it actually produces a nice, even, mellow high, and it calms my nausea.\u000aThe buds are nice and tight. Small and round, light to dark green in colour. Nice trichromes on my sample.\u000aThe smoke is smooth at the beginning of a spliff (joint), but becomes thicker and more choaky towards the end of your session. Enjoyable though, not too harsh.\u000aNice medication for a different spice in life, but not extremely potent. My sample wasn&#39;t anyways.\u000aI would still purchase this strain again however. A nice morning strain when you require a brain to think with.

I&#39;ve recently bought this as a concentrate and it stands up to this experience:\u000a\u000aThat said, this strain is really nice.

And way the pennywise I got was from L&#39;eagle dispensary and is was told was a HIGH CBD strain testing at 9%CBD:5%THC supposedly, but for a low thc strain it kicked it hard then a bitch I wasn&#39;t prepared for that. I prefer all the good relaxed qualities then the energetic rooftop high and anxious rapid heart beat that I got BECUASE tho other my enjoy that and handle it better then me I hate it! I just wanna relax and relieve anxiety and stress ya feel me lol.

VI have usually tended toward THC high hybrids, but I heard that CBD is better for pain relief, so I decided to try it. That and it was one of the lowest priced strains at my local dispensary. I love it! The highs I\u2019ve been having lately have been leading to deep, unsettling thought patterns. With Pennywise, I feel lighter, significantly less pain, and well functioning. This has to be my favorite strain so far. It\u2019s the first one I\u2019ve written a review on. :) I am happy to say, \u201cWe all float down here\u201d.

VAs a Crohn&#39;s Disease patient, I&#39;ve experienced more than my share of pain and discomfort in my 20 year diagnosis. I&#39;m a newly prescribed cannabis user and this particular strain changes my life on a daily basis. I was told 1:1 ratio is essential for Crohn&#39;s relief and this is dead on truth. \u000a\u000aWith Pennywise I experience less pain, less digestive symptoms, more clarity than other strains. This is the only one that makes me feel better without being out-of-it like other strains. The lady on the phone at my dispensery nailed it with her description: &quot;a comfortable body-high with a clear head&quot;. Despite being afraid of clowns, I&#39;m glad I tried Pennywise ;)

VI was an expert smoker for many years, tjen after a traumatic experience I commonly got panicky and paranoid when smoking. My husband does not use often/at all. Maybe once a year. This strain was just perfect for us. My husband had an edible (5mg THC/0mg CBD) the day before and felt slightly anxious, he preferred this strain much more than the edible. Clarity and a soft high meet here! It doubles as a beautiful intimacy strain. DON&#39;T BE SCARED BY THE NAME!

VThis strain ( or maybe just the batch I got ?) smells very strong, even vaped or just the buds themselves in my jar. The taste was not unpleasant, very earthy, like grass. I have trigeminal neuralgia and this strain really helps with pain. I found the effects to be a bit slow to take effect but they lasted a while. I was clear headed but a bit slowed down. Very relaxing and great for pain.  It gave me a serious case of the munchies though.. once I ate sushis, a bag of chips and two grilled cheese within 3 hours after having Pennywise.. that was bad.

Very mellow and clear headed high, my headache is gone completely and my nervousness has lessened.\u000a\u000aHowever, this strain is not suggested for those seeking something that gets you high like something with high amounts of THC would. It does have a high CBD content, which is good for those seeking the body high.

And way the pennywise I got was from L&#39;eagle dispensary and is was told was a HIGH CBD strain testing at 9%CBD:5%THC supposedly, but for a low thc strain it kicked it hard then a bitch I wasn&#39;t prepared for that. I prefer all the good relaxed qualities then the energetic rooftop high and anxious rapid heart beat that I got BECUASE tho other my enjoy that and handle it better then me I hate it! I just wanna relax and relieve anxiety and stress ya feel me lol.

Small and round, light to dark green in colour. Nice trichromes on my sample.\u000aThe smoke is smooth at the beginning of a spliff (joint), but becomes thicker and more choaky towards the end of your session. Enjoyable though, not too harsh.\u000aNice medication for a different spice in life, but not extremely potent. My sample wasn&#39;t anyways.\u000aI would still purchase this strain again however. A nice morning strain when you require a brain to think with.

VThis is my favorite strain to date!  I am very prone to getting anxiety with certain stains and I don&#39;t experience any with this one. I use it at night right before I lay down to sleep.  I usually have insomnia, but this strain calms my brain and makes me feel relaxed and happy, and I have no trouble sleeping. Another thing I love about this strain is how horny it makes me.  Sex feels absolutely incredible when I&#39;m high on Pennywise. I highly recommend this strain!

VI have suffered with severe anxiety disorder and depression for the last several years, so it wasn&#39;t unusual for me to be awake and restless at 4:00 am. I decided to get up and pack my DaVinci Ascent with about 0.4 grams of Pennywise and I could not be more satisfied. \u000a\u000aThe onset was both clean and immediate. I felt relieved of stress, relaxed, and even focused. For other medical patients or even the casual smoker, this is a great product. The 1:1 THC to CBD ratio is fantastic. This makes sense, given it&#39;s a cross of Harlequin and Jack the Ripper.

The 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD are extremely effective, sure to please. I passed mine around at backyard parties, around a fire, instead of a joint. Easy peasy, no coughing among non-smokers, no wasted anything. Top quality vape device and contents. Perhaps the best way to inhale THC / CBD that I&#39;ve tried, and I think I&#39;ve tried it all.

VGot some if this as a vape pen. Nice effect, super relaxed. The high cbd amount countered the thc amount so there wasn&#39;t much of a high, just complete relaxation. i decided to lay down and fell asleep with minutes, got a great night&#39;s sleep too.

VAmazing.  When I got it the caregiver informed me of it&#39;s  lower THC level so I wasn&#39;t expecting to get high.  After a few minutes it hit me but after the initial &quot;oh, well hello there&quot; I mellowed out and relaxed.  Very calming and well rounded buzz.

VI smoked a big joint of this and it was a mellow yet meaningful high.\u000aThis is a good cbd strain and I found  it to be a manageable high without pulling me down with paranoia or getting me way to high. \u000aEvery penny counts but pennywise is even better stuff, I love it!\u000aI can afford to get high on this again with no worries.

VSince I don&#39;t. smoke to relieve physical symptoms, just mental, I found this strain to be on the weaker side.  It would be perfect if you need pain relief without the strong mental high. It is relaxing, but that&#39;s about it for me. This would be perfect medication for those who need it, just not for me.

VBland, with less pronounced flavor and effects than other CBD strains I&#39;ve tried. This was my second chance purchase (different grower and dispensary) and I&#39;m still not impressed. A recent gram of Critical Mass CBD was far superior, tasty with 24% CBD!

VFor a high CBD strain, Pennywise is pretty good. It will keep you mellow all day and it really calms anxiety. If you&#39;re a light or newbie smoker this strain will give you  a mild buzz and will leave you functional. A great strain to smoke for the medical benefits or for newbies getting into smoking the herb.

VAbsolutely my most favorite strain. Wonderful during the evening right after work &amp; right before my shower. I can easily smoke bowls of this all night long &amp; goof off with my family. I\u2019m more interested in what everyone\u2019s doing &amp; more silly which my family seems to love. ZERO anxiety or paranoia which is A+ for me. I have complete control over my body and thoughts, while enjoying a subtle body high. It\u2019s perfect for ending your day. And when you\u2019re ready for bed, you have this perfect relaxing body buzz to drift into sleep!

VSmaller bud, indicative of a aero/hydro grow.  Really sticky, lots of brownish/orange hairs.  Smells of lemon furniture polish (Pledge).  Nice draw.  Initial taste of pine/earth aftertaste berry/citrus.  I would recommend this for PTSD and other anxiety disorders.  Leaves you feeling content and  able to face the day.  Not the best for insomnia.  It is relaxing, but I find that it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to any kush.  Nice for sitting and meditating/personal inventory.  4.2/5

VThis strain, though high in CBD, still produces more of a head high than I expected, which made Beijing Hot Pot night a bit more interesting than I intended for. Let&#39;s just say there were no leftovers. I felt really relaxed and thoughtful and worked well for my pain. I prefer the mama strain, though (Harlequin) to this one.

VClear and mellow stone with a slow onset of a heavy body and an immediate sense of chillax. The analgesic and relaxing properties of the CBD rich Harlequin mother come through nicely and the invigorating pep you get from the JTR high makes this an amazing all day smoke for with real medicinal value.\u000aTaste/Aroma: Phenotypes range from a fresh ground coffee/pepper to a lemon bubblegum. The smoke is harsh and irritates mucous tissues.
