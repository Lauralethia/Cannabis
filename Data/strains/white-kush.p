VI tried WK because I was interested in the Pax Era vaporizer and WK seemed to be the best strain for my need, that being treating insomnia. It is interesting how strains have common yet different effects of different users. There are other strains that do not claim to be as effective to induce sleep but are more effective for me. PK works best for me, Kos is also very effective, and WK is somewhat effective. \u000aWK is very smooth, nice flavor, no cough inducement, like the taste on exhale a bit of vanilla, and just a mild good old marijuana taste. Not as strong a head high as PK or KOS and not as effective for insomnia, at least for me. I will buy another pod, nice strain.

VOne of my new favs. Some of the dankest weed I&#39;ve yet to smoke too. Great medium sized caked out white buds with a earthy spicy aroma. The taste is similar to the smell with a slight pepper taste lingering after the exhale. If your a fan of heavy hitting kush do not pass this one up! beginners may get major couch lock though.

VHungover? Feel like an impromptu nap, this indica will help you snooze, no drool. Great for a post work out relaxation treat, where you are happy rehydrating or stretching.\u000aThis dense bud is kushy and cozy. Body warming sensations of gentle tingling in lower limbs, the head feels heavy but is easily lifted by hazy sounds. It appears to me that the flower shows an intense deep green leaf. A layer of white crystals sits on this hearty nugget with amber hair sticking out. I can see shades of purple and smell a pronounced spicy skunk perfume. Earthy aromas, earthy smoke, tastes a bit sweet and blows a medium thick grey cloud.

Has a sour smell overall. Very appealing smell. \u000a\u000aLook: \u000a      This bud is very dense with little clumps but also flaky, crystally leafs around the outside. Long stems with thin nugs. \u000a\u000aHigh:\u000a      This strain makes you feel very zoned out and focused on whatever activities you are part taking in. Very big body and head high.

VI think that this strain is tasty and smooth slow burning  potent blunt filler. Its smoothness makes smoking not so harsh on the throat like some strains they seem leave a savage cough behind almost taking its victims out of that sesh. I have to make a note that Purple Kush is much more satisfying to me out or the Kush Family strains that are most common these days along with OG Kush, Pink Kush and Strawberry Kush strains. Kush is my favorite cannabis to enjoy when I am in a relaxing mode about to take a minute from life and fade away into my shadow high as camel balls lifted up. Four Stars for this strain is a generous rating.\u000a\u000a                              -Smokin On All Day All Night -\u000a\u000a                                                Mr.Crook

VThis is an indica that is supposed to be very sedative, but I found it to be nothing special.   The high was not sedative and did not assist with sleep. It was relaxing but not able to slow my mind down or assist me with my altering my moods.  I found this strain to make me very hungry and too earthy tasting.

VProbably by far one of the best strains I have ever had. The huge nugget (1/8 oz) was very frosty and light green. And don&#39;t even try picking it or breaking it up for a joint or blunt, this stuff is beyond sticky. Took a good 5 minutes to get just a gram broken down enough. Smoking this strain through a bong/water bong/vaporizer is the best way to achieve full effects, as a joint/blunt &quot;wastes&quot; the bud.

Gonna smoke some now and wouldn\u2019t you know Mazzy star came on on my way home.

VIn legend, there are strains which help heal the body and White Kush does that! I tried it in flower and then when I saw it in concentrate I remembered how Euphoric it was. I took it at night which gave me an amazingly euphoric high. It&#39;s going to be like a bunch of flowers hitting you in the head at once but instead of hurting it will feel really great. White Kush might as well be called, &quot;The Insomnia Strain.&quot; When I woke up to go to the bathroom, instead of feeling all groggy like from a hang over, I still felt sleepy but I also felt my body feeling really great like as if it is healing or something. If you want an A+ Night Sleep go with White Kush!

VHungover? Feel like an impromptu nap, this indica will help you snooze, no drool. Great for a post work out relaxation treat, where you are happy rehydrating or stretching.\u000aThis dense bud is kushy and cozy. Body warming sensations of gentle tingling in lower limbs, the head feels heavy but is easily lifted by hazy sounds. It appears to me that the flower shows an intense deep green leaf. A layer of white crystals sits on this hearty nugget with amber hair sticking out. I can see shades of purple and smell a pronounced spicy skunk perfume. Earthy aromas, earthy smoke, tastes a bit sweet and blows a medium thick grey cloud.

VVery aromatic and heavily frosted buds! The flavor is heavy on almond, vanilla and earthy hash. Definitely save this for late night, it will put you to sleep for sure.

VLove this strain a real winner quite sedative. The taste on the inhale is an almost blueberry affair whilst exhaling is spicy and fizzy cola like an amazing strain and strongly recommend.

VI really did not like this strain, sleepiness and munchies are crazy with this. It makes you munch like you had no food in last couple of days and than you feel extremely sleepy. Use this strain to treat insomnia or anorexia otherwise do not mess with this guy for fun or to get high, ruins it.

VHeavy heavy relaxation. This will really help if you need to sleep or have what I call restless mind. If you tend to prefer Indicas, this can also be fun during the day, but requires moderate activity to avoid casual napping. Flavor has hints of almond.

VStill remember the first time I smoked this. My buddy and I smoked a J out on a pier in Jersey looking out over the New York City skyline. After 5 five minutes, I turned to him and said &quot;Dude, how long does this stuff take to hit you?&quot; Then I immediately started giggling like a maniac. By far the best strain I&#39;ve tried to date. Never felt more relaxed in my entire life
