VThe one true weed. Skunk chnged my life when it materialized in the 90&#39;s. Every time I smell it&#39;s unique aroma I&#39;m transported straight back to the first time I tried it as a teenager. Truly unmistakable. Until then, I never knew pot could be so brilliant. I benchmark all other weeds against the original skunk. Love, love love it.

VIf you smoked Skunk 1 and say stick with the hazes then you undoubtedly didn&#39;t get to smoke the true old school skunk1 as the true skunk 1 is superior to all strains in flavor, power and overall quality! I disagree with anyone that says haze is better had the more modern skunk 1 as the old school strain is extinct for the most part!

Vfuck, i love this strain, it literally has all the good effects you need in a cannabis strain. one day i was high as fuck walking through a park and as i was staring at this concrete path i kept seeing hallucinations of wierd zigzaggy lines n shit, it gives off a good conversation with alot of euphoria properties, also i didn&#39;t really get any negative effects apart from the obvious dry eyes and mouth, normally on other strains i get paranoid n shit, with this, i felt soooo chilled n happy. gotta be one of the best strain out there...

VI bought an 1/8th of Skunk #1 the other day and it was like going back in time. I started smoking with skunk, and really liked the stoney effect. I still worked and got things done, so it doesn&#39;t necessarily make you want to stay on the couch. It seems like if you smoke, and get into doing something within 10 minutes, you will not get couch locked.

VA great recreational sativa dominant strain that I find gives me the giggles every time.  Medium green chicken tender nugs with a sweet smell and sweeter taste. Not necessarily top shelf by todays standards but skunk 1 will always have a time and place.  Its price makes it even more worth it.

VOne of the best! My personal favorite. The first time I tried this may have been Barneys or some local Amsterdam shop. I loved the high while I was traveling. Now that this is available very easily at rec shops, I&#39;ve been able to get the Skunk No. 1 on the cheap. Great heady buzz, creates a very deep appetite or hunger right away. Never have had cerebral or psychedelic highs but you can sometime feel the out of body uplift. Great for first time users, but will bring on a strong cough if they are not ready for the pungent/skunk aroma. This strain is one of the best. No quick heart pace or anxiety. Always great for social sharing. Great overall experience every time. Picked up this batch of Skunk from the Sante center in Durango.

VSkunk always has been and always will be a great strain. Its super sticky and smelly and has that old school creeper high. And remember just cause some joe hands u a bag and says its skunk, doesnt mean it was grown, dried, or cured properly.  Or with the corret  lights, soil, nutes, temps, ect. Doesnt even mean its really skunk. This stain was the reason the term sticky icky was created.

VHey Greenone I was wondering which bank has the original or the closest one to the original out there. I had stock of it Northern lights, Big Bud, Hash plant, early girl, early pearl, afghani, and numerous old strains from the early to late 80&#39;s by my uncle ordering them before the internet was really around. He passed away and left all his crosses to me and a close family member when he passed away in 06. unfortunately in this country the laws are coming around one state at a time but upon me transporting them the police pulled me over and seized every single seed which included 37 sandwich bags full of the strains he crossed or stabilized and 13,800$ in cash, my car, my Grandmas jewelery which one ring appraised for 9300$ and the other for 6700$ plus all her gold necklaces, bracelets, and five other rings. oh yeah and seven pill bottles full of seeds. I popped some in 99 and the strain was so awesome I have never smelled another that could be in our basement while outside but this one I could smell three streets away. It tasted so sweet and I couldn&#39;t even begin to describe the flavor as it tasted better than anything I ever encountered to this day 16 years later! my brother&#39;s wife got mad and destroyed everything mother and clones. I doubt ill encounter anything remotely as good as her! sweet taste even dried in the microwave which was stupid it had its flavor in 5 weeks and between five of us that smoke had us all ripped almost in a hallucinogenic state. lol. I wish I could find the old strains we had and try to get that one sweet and earthy almost tasting smoke we had but living in the supposed land of the free gives no freedom of the least harmful plant and feed lies as they have done for years. Even upon legalization of the cannabis plant Here in the USA I will never let them collect tax revenue off my strains I purchase or receive since our country is legalizing it one state after the other to tax it as they see dollar signs! I just want to purchase or receive what the state of Missouri stole from us and now will be legalizing it in a year or so. It makes me very upset I lost all of that and 7 months of my life over seeds that were harmless to all that have them. I would have shared the strain with the world for free just so all individuals like cannabis could taste and feel the effects of that one strain that came from seed created over almost two decades as I am a giver that wants everyone to have the best strains and preserve the old strains that started the white widow, Jack Herrer, and many more bionic breeds! point me in the right direction as I am going to try till I die to figure out what crosses were used in creation of it to have it back and pray I can get it to a place that keep old strains and never do away with them because a new one is better. what if ruderalis and hermies become the only thing left by feminized seed being prone to become hermies under less stress, autos cannot be cloned or mothered out. what happens when true males do not exist to get pollen and autos bred in lose the gentic property to be cloned and feminization turns seeds to strains that ultimately produce a majority of hermies? then all will wish the true old school strains had been preserved to fix the problem! I wish I could find old school originals but greed and ripoffs/knock offs are being sold by a lot of banks and I want to know which banks will send them here and I get what I pay for!

VThere was an anonymous that posted on this strain two years ago...and I completely agree with him...skunk #1 as it existed fifteen twenty years ago is no longer here, sadly. People posting may be getting the hybrid variety but all these parent seeds are gone by the wayside like white widow and early pearl...it&#39;s sad.  I had a personal friend grow this back in the mid 90&#39;s (back when kineseeds.com was all the rage.  This is some of the best bud I&#39;ve ever had (and I&#39;ve had plenty).  This ranks up there with any sativa I&#39;ve ever smoked. Period. I&#39;d love to get my hands on some lol.  But unfortunately in a hybrid dominated world, this won&#39;t be realized

VThis was the first cannabis plants I smoked that was given a name and we were guaranteed it was what it was called, Skunk deserves it&#39;s name and you could never get away with pretending you did not have a bag of it on you. Sweet taste with an all round buzz nicely balanced between cerebrally active and body stone couch lock, great for promoting appetite and sleep, not one i would recommend for daylight or any time you want to be at a higher function or get creative, sure you will have the creative thoughts but they will be in one of those special plans we make for tomorrow, possibly after a good feed and a good sleep.

VI like Skunk#1. Makes me more focused and creative, I could catch some details (mistakes in dialogues) in TV show, which I did not recognize before. (I watched that show 2 years ago).  \u000aAlso while watching it, creative side of mind started to boost, and I had some creative ideas. So, in conclusion :) great for boosting  creativeness, and focusing on details. \u000a\u000aP.S The strains usually have qualities, which you might not experience at the same time. I mean the Effect, it all depends on person, also mood, whether, body chemistry.

VI would have given skunk number one a rating of five out of five if the flavor and sent wasn&#39;t too strong. The musky overtones really helps with the depression the energetic levels of stress and your mood if you want to get out in the day nows the time to do it. It&#39;s a very dry mouth it helps a lot with how you feel mood disorders.I sense that this is a creeper for sure if you get higher sticky but the more of a creeper it&#39;s going to be but it&#39;s a very relaxing creeper kind of like Alcopoco Gold.

If u tell me this actually exists, as a legal AZ cardholder\u2026 come on--WHERE is it? it doesn&#39;t exist as the strain it used to be, genetics gone forever...!

VThis high will make you break into a sweat with intense sativa like energy. It&#39;s skunky flavor is not a plus to it&#39;s lacking potency. I still give it a 3.5/5 because many amazing strains have came from this skunky little strain.

VMigraine pain 5; nausea 4 when I medicated round 1600 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. Head high very energetic/creative; been cleanin house since medicating. Body high exactly what I needed; still no pain/nausea 3 hours later (which is usually 2-2.5 hours for a Sativa dominant). Wouldn&#39;t use this strain too close to bedtime. No anxiety/paranoia (a must for me). Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea! :-)

The great thing about this strain is that it didn&#39;t make me sleepy and tired like other strains did. Overall an 8.5/10 because while it&#39;s a great high, it&#39;s hard to come across Skunk in my area.

VI was slightly disappointed in the Columbian Gold sample I received. The taste was not at all what I remembered from back in the day- the stone however was just like the good old stuff. This strain hit me in the happy department, and then rolled over very quickly into a psychedelic holiday on top of that. An excellent strain for wake and bake, it really starts your day off happily. I will try this strain again, and hope for that specific taste I remember if I can get my hands on some!\u000a\u000aAlso the CBD content is higher than normal in this landrace type I encountered

VThis is a very good strain for concentration and drive. Although it&#39;s a hybrid, the high achieved feels more sativa dominant. The high starts in the back of your head and kind of creeps up and engulfs you. This is a very potent smelling strain. Opening up a jar of this you will be hit with a very earthy/sweet/clean smell. The taste is average. Although it is a very heady high, it has the potential to leave you a little sleepy. But if you pair your smoking with a cup of coffee this sleepy feeling will be diminished. Overall a good strain for getting shit done.

VClassic smell and taste, really delicious and stinky bud. Buzz is very enjoyable, instantly improved mood with no jitters or paranoia. Mostly clear high, a little fuzzy if overdone but manageable even then. It&#39;s easy to see why this has been used in so many hybrids because it&#39;s a really solid strain. I would put it in the can&#39;t go wrong with this section because it has so many nice subtle effects.

VMigraine pain 6; nausea 3-4 when I medicated round 1300 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. Head high energetic; very nice Sativa dominant. Body high exactly what I needed. Last longer (3-4 hours) than a typical Sativa; very pleased bout that. Got my tired, fat @$$ up &amp; movin for the day! Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea. :-)

VI like this strain, not one of my favorites, but in a medium dosage its a pretty mellow buzz, never tried to get super high off it. I remember I felt pretty relaxed and well aware of my enviornment, I was slightly up on my feet, jut not physically.  \u000aEvery now and then I had the giggles, but not uncontrollably.\u000aI think this one is a pretty classic sativa.\u000aBut most of all, I think my favorite aspect of this strain is the smell.\u000aIts not called skunk for nothing!\u000aIf you&#39;re feelin&#39; stressed, skunk is definately the way to go!

VThe Skunk I smoked in the late 80&#39;s would be five stars.  One of the two I smoked is not skunk.  I think it&#39;s this one.  It was grown by Green &amp; Gold.  Still ok, just disappointed not what I waited 30 years for.  Skunk was named skunk for a reason and this smells nothing like skunk.

VSkunk is only great if its a high quality held. The aroma you get from smoking skunk can sometime be overpowering, thus making it not a recommended choice. South Africans know skunk too well...its quality is usually low (Skunk smuggeld accross Swazi Land&#39;s border into South Africa is of low grade) Imported Skunk or green house indor skunk holds more trichomes but is harder on the lungs again.

VThe Skunk I smoked in the late 80&#39;s would be five stars.  One of the two I smoked is not skunk.  I think it&#39;s this one.  It was grown by Green &amp; Gold.  Still ok, just disappointed not what I waited 30 years for.  Skunk was named skunk for a reason and this smells nothing like skunk.

The very pungent taste gives you a very exciting feeling during two hours, when you are completely out of the world by the speaking the sight and the behaviour. Then you are totally smashed up and you can do nothing for three hours after. Very good for intense sexual activity too. It washes yourself at all as much as a MaryJane strain can. Boom in your face.

I took two hits on my vaporizer of Skunk#1 and within a couple of minutes, the pain suddenly became very tolerable. This is the first time I am certain that marijuana helped in a purely medical way.

VSkunk is only great if its a high quality held. The aroma you get from smoking skunk can sometime be overpowering, thus making it not a recommended choice. South Africans know skunk too well...its quality is usually low (Skunk smuggeld accross Swazi Land&#39;s border into South Africa is of low grade) Imported Skunk or green house indor skunk holds more trichomes but is harder on the lungs again.

VWell, what can i say about this classic that isnt a common place. One of my favourites, sensi seeds keeps doing a great job preserving this gem. Full citric flavor and smell, the super soft smoke (doesnt make cof at all) takes about 4-5 minutes to kick in. Then you feel increasingly relaxed and sometimes even motivated for an DIY or maybe a walk. Good for smoking in company, makes social ice melt rapidly. It has very very clear high. Everithing in this strain is in place.

VHad good quality Skunk #1 recently and now I have a better idea about Skunks tastes and buzz in general. The skunk and sweet taste were dominant with slight earthy notes in the end. Well cured this plant can taste awesome in the mouth. I just can&#39;t get over the racing mind head buzz. If I want to stimulate or push my mind somewhere else rather than reality, I prefer a Jack Herer (that contain this strain in it&#39;s gene by the way) or a White Widow that would add some funk into the mix. Although I might try some more of these strains group in the future (particularly the more Indica type) I can now definitely say that I&#39;m not a Skunk guy at all. Dry red eyes with this one is really a turn off for discretion.

VThe real genetics still exists. I have had a mother plant growing for the past 30 years. Cloning it and inbreededing it it is the best smoke around and stable as hell. the skunk #1 of today is almost the same but I prefer the sticky icky my dad has held onto the past 27 years. plus he still has about 200 beans of the original first plants he grew back in the day the beans are insurance in case of deasease or potency loss fron cloning etc.about 2 times a year I will pop a couple beans grow out new mother and people fight over the clones. and even a couple of phenos over the years have had the real cheesy smell aka uk cheese was produced from original. It is a dank flower and is great in breeding projects. would b willing to trade to reputal breeder for the real chem dog or a clone of original Trainwreck since the original is cloning only unless story&#39;s true about Trainwreck from seedbanks in Holland and humbolt. I begrown both from humbolt and green house and crossed them both and it made it even better but I still wonder if it&#39;s the original from the past.

VMine is rated at 19% THC. I had one of the worst panic attacks ive ever had in my life from this strain. I felt high for a full day and a half after doing this, and I was peaked for a full 4 hours after smoking. I was anxious for 2-3 days after smoking this. Thanks to this strain I&#39;m now anxious about smoking strong strains. Guess I gotta go back to nothing above 10% THC. Before I freaked out, it made me happy, and very giggly. Wish it didnt screw me over.

Vi bought this strain expecting a strong &quot;weedy&quot; tasting, uplifting high to wake up to in the morning but was a little disappointed. the effects are very focusing and mellowing without a real body high. \u000a\u000ai did find it helped me study and kept me from getting distracted by TV or cellphones, but I don&#39;t have any need for this strain. If I had ADD/ADHD I&#39;d imagine this would help, but I like uplifting and euphoric Sativa&#39;s and this was grounding and focusing.

VAfter smoking nothing but Indicas for the past couple of years, it was a pleasure to rediscover this classic strain which I remember well from the 90s. It truly is a pretty balanced combination of the &quot;up&quot; Sativa head-high and the narcotic Indica body stone. It&#39;s a good choice for anyone who wants to get good &#39;n fried for a couple of hours of TV before the narcotic effect takes over and gets you ready for bed. I found myself laughing my ass off watching Trailer Park Boys last night, even though I&#39;d seen the episode a dozen times. Then I sat absolutely enthralled for close to an hour watching a documentary on Central American undersea life, something I&#39;ve never done before. I do find myself a wee bit groggy the next morning if I overdo it with this strain, so you might want to try a smaller dose until you know how you&#39;ll be affected. But I suppose that&#39;s typical of any of the more potent strains. One thing I&#39;ve noticed is this strain typically gives me delayed-action munchies. I wake up in the middle of the night with an urgent and insuppressible need for chocolate chip cookies and milk. And oh yeah, the strong odor of this strain should definitely be kept in mind. Skunk is called Skunk for a reason, and it&#39;s not compatible with stealth smoking. Bottom line, this is a quality strain that will get you good and high, which is precisely what you want your weed to do, right?

VMy iPad wouldn&#39;t let me do the rating parts sorry.. But I like the strain, it lifts me up gives me plenty of energy! This was my first mmj purchase from CG3. They had a cool little set up, limited inventory as of flowers and extracts but were getting more in. I am going to try green 2 go next. My back pain is much much less with this strain I can still feel tightness in my back muscles. It is a very aware kind of high. Although I did smoke some blue berry along with this but mostly this strain.

VGotta Love this classic strain! The skunky,piney and candy aroma and flavor is heavenly! Who would think a skunk could smell this good? Mellow Hybrid that gets the job done. Great head and body effects! Kind of a spacey high with body relaxing qualities. Really Nice Strain! Must try if you haven&#39;t already!

And No BS these nugs reeked so bad of a skunk, it didnt matter how big or little the bag u had on you or witch way the wind was blowing, you could smell it 20 feet from any direction. Tru expando smoke, and as soon as u were done coughing you were super high . my friends to this day still tell me that skunk you had when we were kids was the best weed i&#39;de ever smoked, gone but not forgotten never will we forget skunk # 1

VThe best looking plant in the garden...These ladies look like 4 foot high model rockets about to blast off...The buds are long and make nice 1.5-2&quot; t hick spears around 5-10&quot;long...The leaves are a definite hybrid with a very small size even for the big ladies. \u000a\u000aYeilds were never that impressive; however, the buds are SO tasty. Smell was incredibly DANK smelling and stinky, yet, juicy. I grew all live organic fox farm style, so these ones seemed to benefit the most. They really showed their full charecteristics through flowering and dried product... Love it...Sticky Earthy Dank Nugz Of Spicy Juiciness.

VI just had the craziest trip on this strain. I took about 4 fat bong rips and the effects hit within minutes. All I know is I was reading NFL news online. Next thing I know, I&#39;m tripping BALLS. I believe I was having a panic attack (as i suffer from them) but I was able to keep somewhat calm and just vibe to some hip-hop beats I made. My heart beat became very intense like it was going to jump out of my chest. I had to get up and groove. I could feel brain my waves and stuff man.. This is not a beginner strain by any means. I&#39;m able to write this review now that I&#39;m coming back to earth lol.

Head high very nice but a lil heavy; slowed down which is really weird for a Sativa. Still quite nice &amp; no anxiety/paranoia which is a must for me. Body high lasting longer than a typical Sativa too; still no pain/nausea after over 3 hours! I guess every strain is a hybrid on some level. Tastes spicy which I don&#39;t see very often; nice change of pace. Highly recommend for after work/evening/weekend use! :-)
