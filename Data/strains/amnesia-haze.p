VI had this strain as an edible once, let me tell you, if you have never had this as an edible, get ready to enter literal paradise on earth.\u000a\u000aIt feels like you are riding a high that transitions through all of the various parents that came to create this strain.\u000a\u000aI remember staring at the computer screen and there was this afterglow and I was at complete peace with the world and everyone/thing in it.\u000a\u000athe munchies, food will taste incredible like you never though food could taste, insatiable hunger.\u000a\u000aand the orgasms. well. you will have to try it yourself and find out.

VThis strain is a genetic wonder in every respect.  It is a gorgeous plant to grow with tight bugs, amazing smell, good yield and easy to manicure-just perfect really.  Grinding it up is a sensual experience and savored by us hardcore citrus lovers.  It is pretty much what everyone has described but don&#39;t discount its Indica side, which can be as equally potent, resulting in a noticeable and immediately relaxing body high.  This strain, as myself and friends call it a &quot;terminal strain&quot;, meaning you can END your search for &quot;the-great-strain&quot; when you find this one.  No kidding.

VAmnesia Haze is a quality strain with a lot going for it. When smoked it has a nice bright aroma. The come up takes some time to set in (Amnesia Haze is what I like to call a &#39;creeper&#39;) but when you feel it, it&#39;s a nice energising high. Whenever I tried to mong out after smoking some, I found myself wanting to get up and go do something: a motivational strain. I definitely found myself eating lots of good food, and all these effects contribute towards a great sense of happiness. When the buzz finally came off, I was tired enough to sleep deeply and refreshingly.\u000a\u000aAmnesia Haze is a great strain for bringing good times. Definitely a strain to enjoy with a group of patients.

VThe one time I ever tried Amnesia (while knowing its name) was at the Lotus in Amsterdam.

You could order coffee, tea, cake and you wanted everything went space.\u000aThe tender was a rastaman himself and saw in our eyes we were new to buying our own stash: &quot;yo man, if you wanna get real up in space you buy Amnesia! Special price for you new astronauts!&quot;, so we got 2grams for a bargain.\u000a\u000aThe smoke was delightful, sometimes a bit burning my throat (prob because I wasn&#39;t that used to smoking then). My friend talked about seeing ripples in the light and spirals, a beginner&#39;s fantasy. \u000aI first experienced the spells of mary-jay casted over my mind: music growing stronger, bass lines pounding like elephants, street noise becoming mosquitoes squished between the wiper blades.

Really nice Compact, Dense Budz. Upon smoking...unbelievable, very easy and light to smoke can take big pulls &amp; no coughing gives you a great boost of energy and alertness with a nice relaxing body feeling. Gives me the energy to start my day and during work and it just melts the stress &amp; anxiety away. Always puts a smile on my face. &#128077;

VNever was a fan of sativa stains UNTIL THIS\u000aIt was much more of a cerebral high and I felt as if I had figured everything out and could work through my depression because of what I saw. I felt like I was inside my own mind, but the earth was my mind? We were just walking parts of Earth. It was like my pain and misery was taken by the sky and literally lifted off me. It was almost sunset so the moon was really bright and so was the sky, and it was a crescent moon. As I looked at it, it was like the moon is actually a hole of my mind and there is light from the outside world shining through this hole. It has taught me a lot about overcoming my mental health and how mental health is just a perception of the world and yourself. And now I understand why people can be genuinely happy in the world because that&#39;s all they&#39;ve seen and are used to...

Glad I gave this strain a try   Crazy busy even though lumbar/sacral is totally trashed so need a clear head when babysiting a 3 year old and working with tools. It took L/S pain from 6 to a 4 on pain scale(2 bowls ~ 3 hours apart). Oh even though clear headed I still got that &quot;finding things funny&quot; feeling, lol.

VSmell! This stuff almost makes my eyes water when I take a sniff. Incredibly pungent, intense hazey smell; tangy and sharp with zesty/chemicalish(in a good way) undertones. The taste is similar, sour at first but with a sweet, full bodied after taste  The high is fast acting and intense, incredible sativa style uplifting effect but you can soon find yourself locked into the nearest couch due to the indica content. Great for getting some friends over and having a smoke, keeps you buzzing but allows for time to pass slowly and keeps you concentrating on what your doing.\u000aGreat hybrid, great taste, great high.

VFirstly, The name of this strain is perfect due to its time passing effects and loss of very short term memory. Amnesia Haze is a rather potent Sative strain with THC percentages ranging from 17% up to 25% on the highest grade of yield. With a low CBD content of 11% on average. This high is very cerebral but then again this strain also reminds users of Gorilla Glue#4 for its relaxing and potent high. This strain is more for evening use due to its effects of relaxation and tiredness which the strain inherits from its parentage specifically Jamaican and Afghani which are powerful Indica strains. This strain is an impressive smoke which would take connoisseurs back and come for more. \u000a\u000aAmnesia haze has a wonderful variety of flavors and notes for the user to enjoy. To sum up it is enchanting. When the Joint first hits your lungs you taste the freshness of the citrus notes followed by a creamy hazelnut and earthy exhale. The earthy note is severely under toned by the citrus which makes the strain stand out predominately from its cousin strain Lemon Haze. The smoothness of the smoke will make your mouth water, this is a strain which has qualities which are far and few between in that it makes your mouth water rather than giving the user dry mouth. Perfect for the stoner whos broke as a drink isnt required. It doesn&#39;t necessarily make the user Munchy but it does increase appetite to a healthy level for those who need that extra push. Its a very good strain for suppressing nausea.\u000a\u000aFrom personal experience and other people i have questioned about the strain It seems a rather good pain suppressant for those suffering with muscle spasms and long term mental conditions such as Anxiety, Clinical Depression and Gender Dysphoria to name a few. On the flip side negatives are scarce it pulls you out from the abyss and gets you jolly to sing about drug dealing and murder whilst driving to your 9-5 job. \u000a\u000aOverall a fantastic strain with some great properties and one of the most potent sativa strains that ive ever tried. I would definitely recommend to anyone to go out of your way to smoke this beautiful strain. Its fantastic for those who are inexperienced due to its smoothness and instant effects. On an average sesh High lasts around 2-3 hours(8th) dependant on amount. So next time you&#39;re at your local dispensary pick up some Amnesia and let your worries and stress leave your mind as if you&#39;ve forgotten.

Easy to overdo it and get uncomfortably high, this strain in particular tends to induce a mild panic attack (I do not suffer from panic attacks so I assume this would be the case for everyone) in which everything looks 2D and extreme paranoia and dysphoria sets in. Overall this strain offers an amazing experience and sense of inner peace, highly recommended to all potheads out there looking for something to make that special occasion all the more special ;)

VMy friend and I both bought a bag of this on Thursday.\u000aOn Thursday, he rolled a spliff of the strain, and I had 1 drag of it. It hit me instantly as soon as I exhaled - not a creeper from that experience.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn Friday, I brought 2 friends round and we decided to bong it in my house. All I can say is WOW - what a high! \u000a\u000aThe feeling was very warm; I definitely got an instant sativa high from it at first - so did my friends from what I could tell - our conversation became a hilarious one. I also got the guitar out and started to write a riff and vocal line.\u000a\u000aEventually, the indica high creeped along, and I felt like I was floating when I was sat on my sofa - it was amazing, my whole body was in a numb state of awe. Then the munchies... WARNING: DO NOT SMOKE THIS WEED IF YOU&#39;RE TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT. After trying to resist the munchies, my friends left and I ate:\u000a- Chicken Tikka Masala Curry\u000a- 5 Packets Of Mini Cheddars\u000a- Big bag of Maltesers\u000a- 3 Kit Kat Chunkies...\u000aI also fell asleep at 21:30, which is very early considering recently I&#39;ve been falling asleep at 02:00-03:00am. Great dope for insomnia by my experience.\u000a\u000aTLDR: instant sativa hit, indica traits creep later on, no negatives, great high - 4/5.

VThis stuff does burn heavily, and it seems to hit me like a train instead of being a gradual high. I also get terrible &quot;weed chills,&quot; but that&#39;s something I seem to experience regardless of strain.\u000a\u000aAfter a week of smoking this near-exclusively, it&#39;s probably not for me. Maybe what I have is weak, but I feel as though I need to smoke an absurd amount to get the high I want. I simply think that Sativas are too psychoactive for me. I feel really overstimulated and exhausted after smoking this for any length of time. Also, I&#39;ve noticed that I become extremely depressed when the high wears off, which does nothing for me as someone with mental illnesses (including anxiety and depression)

VGrabbed some of this from a local dispensery @ 30.2% THC. 2 Nice big buds made up the 1/8th I had and they were more than attractive. Classic big bud haze look with a citrusy smell to it..also had slight notes of pine...real refreshing taste and smell. The best part about this weed was how smooth it was. I could rip the biggest bong rips ever of this stuff without coughing..really smoky bud. Only downside was that despite it being a 30%er, it really didn&#39;t feel that way..it was a good heady high and yes..the stuff makes you forget your keys wallet your weed...it does really screw with your memory..but I was looking for a really blasting sativa...this didn&#39;t give me what I wanted but it was still a very fine smoke.

It sure puts me on a good mood and works great for depression. \u000aI can still focus on my daily tasks with the usage of this. \u000aThis works good for both day and night time, since it has a indica effect later during the high. \u000aI would recommend it if you could get your hands on it. \u000aGreat strain, even though I&#39;m not a huge fan of sativas!

He&#39;s a prick and that&#39;s all that needs to be said about him. But a great strain, it gives you an amazing buzz, but it did make me really paranoid after a while, allot more than other strains I have tried. But it just mainly made me feel like I was In a dream, I had a few mild hallucinations, I was really giggly and it&#39;s an overall great strain.

VAmnesia Haze brings both sativa and indica effects. You can feel it both in your head and body. One or two hit is enough to feel its vibration. Very happy, clear head and smooth relax. \u000aHowever if you hit mote than 5 and 6, then you can collapse. It presents a relax sleep. \u000aMentally Amnesia haze helps for having Joy and it gives peace in mind.

VA popular and very accessible strain in Amsterdam. Great to just grab and go if you just want a good nights sleep or a night in front of the television. Three grams lasted me a long time (smoke once a week). I didn\u2019t get much taste or added extras worth mentioning but I would certainly try again.

VPicked up an 1/8 from Rip City Remedies but used to love getting it from Amnesia Coffeeshop during my Amsterdam days. Smells  much better than it tastes. Smokes like an old school haze, works better when ground up. High is a bit of a creeper but extremely long lasting (3+ hours). Great stress reliever. Even though it helped me relax I still felt a bit anxious and jittery the first hour after smoking. Despite being an uplifting sativa dominant hybrid I slept better than I had in days with more indica strains; it didn&#39;t make me feel sleepy, I just slept more soundly after medicating. Overall: 8/10

You can definitely feel the Sativa effect in this one. It had me laugh for hours and made me really relaxed at the same time, not to mention the munchies i had on it. If you&#39;re looking for a great Sativa then there is no Strain i&#39;d rather recommend than Amensia. Simply the best 5/5

Upon opening the dab I could smell it as soon as it was taken out of the packaging, after one dab I was great instant euphoria kicked in along with a very nice sativa rush that tends to accompany the strain. Very good for people needing an uplifting boost throughout the day like myself, seems to help a lot with my depression and anxiety, overall this is a must try Sativa strain, try not to pass it up in any form if your able too.

Vgenerally a really nice strain, great for positive vibes in the morning great energetic buzz, this is a sativa dominant strain, so beware of amnesia in the UK that looks the part and smells the part, but then tastes like paint and gets you super sedated, it will be most likely SPRAYED with CHEMICALS for PROFIT, for me the most obvious part of this spraying is the buzz you get, it puts you to sleep rather than REAL amnesia haze is a real morning energetic buzz thats great for during the day... with the low cbd and high thc content of this strain i find its not very good for anxiety, but counteract that anxiety with pharmys and you&#39;re good to go! and by doing this, this strain is one of my favourite strains to start the day with ! :)

VThis reminds me of one of my favorite sativas: White Buffalo. They&#39;re both perfect morning strains. I&#39;m not normally one for sativas because they tend to make me too up and anxious but I like Amnesia Haze a lot. I get the right amount of energy. One bowl (about 20 hits) makes me feel clear headed, energetic, motivated, and happy but I&#39;m still relaxed. Another bowl of the same size makes my head feel light headed but not dizzy and increases the effects I already felt. I&#39;m a full time student and this strain helps me do my homework, which is often daunting. \u000a\u000aThis is a creeper so be careful when you first smoke it. It took about ten to 15 minutes to feel the full effects. I would easily buy this again.

VThis reminds me of one of my favorite sativas: White Buffalo. They&#39;re both perfect morning strains. I&#39;m not normally one for sativas because they tend to make me too up and anxious but I like Amnesia Haze a lot. I get the right amount of energy. One bowl (about 20 hits) makes me feel clear headed, energetic, motivated, and happy but I&#39;m still relaxed. Another bowl of the same size makes my head feel light headed but not dizzy and increases the effects I already felt. I&#39;m a full time student and this strain helps me do my homework, which is often daunting. \u000a\u000aThis is a creeper so be careful when you first smoke it. It took about ten to 15 minutes to feel the full effects. I would easily buy this again.

VIm in love with this strain! I smoke weed for many years now, but none is as good as Amnesia Haze. Even for heavy smokers it has quiet a strong high and combines the perfect Balance of happy-making, uplifting and relaxing effects. The smell and taste is great, so you should only smoke it pure and not mess it up with tobacco. There are many strains with different effects or a more powerful high but Amnesia Haze is the Queen of them, which takes you into her arms and makes you forget all your problems.

VCreeping high, gives areas of your body concentrated relaxation - tingles/numbness. Induces munchies after around 20 minutes of smoking, the comedown is gentle - leaves you feeling sleepy and well rested afterwards.

Crazy strong, long lasting, heady high, like the name suggests you do lose track of your conversations very very quickly, but this isn&#39;t always a bad thing. Just go with it. Highly recommended..

VA classic strain, with plenty of energy but still relaxes you. The pungent amnesia smell is very strong, smells almost dieselly/sour. The smoke is relativly smooth with the same flavours. The buds are cover with crystals and lots of dark orange trics. Like the strain suggest your memory goes and the next day you feel groggy is you smoke too much.

VStill love this strain. Great sativa, excellent for lifting and going out. Easy to function on, despite the name. The name is really descriptive. You&#39;ll love this and be very alert for all of it. \u000aFlavor: very earthy, piney, woody, tobacco on this. At least for me a very potent and forward sativa. \u000aEffects: amped and excited.

VThis reminds me of one of my favorite sativas: White Buffalo. They&#39;re both perfect morning strains. I&#39;m not normally one for sativas because they tend to make me too up and anxious but I like Amnesia Haze a lot. I get the right amount of energy. One bowl (about 20 hits) makes me feel clear headed, energetic, motivated, and happy but I&#39;m still relaxed. Another bowl of the same size makes my head feel light headed but not dizzy and increases the effects I already felt. I&#39;m a full time student and this strain helps me do my homework, which is often daunting. \u000a\u000aThis is a creeper so be careful when you first smoke it. It took about ten to 15 minutes to feel the full effects. I would easily buy this again.

I was really nervous that it would make my anxiety worse but it didn&#39;t at all. Would get it again if they had any in my area right now, guess I&#39;ll have to wait until it comes back around.

VI got this strain from Sweet Relief in Astoria. The first thing I noticed about this strain was its sweet lemony smell. The flower itself is coated in crystals and dark orange almost brown hairs. \u000aWhen smoked, sweet and lemon notes can be tasted. The high rolls over you slowly, but it leaves one feeling energetic and wanting to take on projects.

VAn amazing Sativa through and through. A pleasure to smoke. The smell was fuely with hints of grapefruit. The buds were fluffy, bright green, with long fiery calyxes (hairs). The buds in this batch were pretty large. The taste was smooth, citrusy, with a definite piney undertone that was very pleasant. Love rolling this stuff up. The high came on immediately and was racy as hell. Very energetic and strong. The high lasted for quite a while, almost 4 hours. Pick some up if you can find it. Seems to be a bit harder to come by.

VI&#39;m baked off a joint and a bowl. The nicest smoke I&#39;ve ever had, Me and my brothers had to get through 5 bags of Rhino to get us buzzin&#39; the same as one bag of Amnesia Haze. Crazy strong, long lasting, heady high, like the name suggests you do lose track of your conversations very very quickly, but this isn&#39;t always a bad thing. Just go with it. Highly recommended..

I use it to treat my chronic anxiety when I run out of meds, and it&#39;s way more effective.\u000aThe high after a few hits is just a little bit dizzy, very happy, relaxed, talkative, somewhat hungry, somewhat euphoric and really, really HORNY.\u000aThe reviews say it makes you energetic, not my case.

VVery nice strain. I use it to treat my chronic anxiety when I run out of meds, and it&#39;s way more effective.\u000aThe high after a few hits is just a little bit dizzy, very happy, relaxed, talkative, somewhat hungry, somewhat euphoric and really, really HORNY.\u000aThe reviews say it makes you energetic, not my case. It always makes me and my boyfriend very sleepy.\u000aIt has an extremely nice earthy and citrus taste. \u000aThe downside is that the high lasts only for about 1 hour. Medical benefits seems to reside after about 5 hours.

VA classic strain, with plenty of energy but still relaxes you. The pungent amnesia smell is very strong, smells almost dieselly/sour. The smoke is relativly smooth with the same flavours. The buds are cover with crystals and lots of dark orange trics. Like the strain suggest your memory goes and the next day you feel groggy is you smoke too much.

The flower itself is coated in crystals and dark orange almost brown hairs. \u000aWhen smoked, sweet and lemon notes can be tasted. The high rolls over you slowly, but it leaves one feeling energetic and wanting to take on projects.

VI bought 2 strains yesterday. One consisting of Afghan haze, and the other, amnesia haze. I smoked it with my 2 best mates, and we discovered a new kind of highness. This was not your average type of high, this was highness in another dimension. Highness that makes you have a good time and highness that makes you foresee your future and goals. It inspires you even much more to do what you love. The body feels really relaxed yet energetical. As said, it\u2019s not a sensation that can be explained. It\u2019s an emotion that has to be felt. Thanks to the weed Gods. This shit was superficial as fuck.

VA wondrous Sativa dominant strain from a Patient friends garden delivered to me freshly sorted from the hospital.  I am really relishing this formidable Sativa which has the out of bag limonene terpenes that I really love above all for first medications and subsequent use in the mornings.  These truly appealing lemon peal citrus crisp odours  and wonderfully earthy taste are such a strong contender for the Sativa Strain of the Spring of 2018 hands down winner in my books.  She is a confidant blend of three distinctive genetics a Jamaican Sativa a Laotian Sativa and Indica dominant Afghani-Hawaiian how is that for stretching the Cannabis Globe for basis of this truly helpful strain.

VI just started smoking and this strain is great! I barely need to smoke anything to get me very high and laugh like an idiot in my bed. It makes me exremely hungry and everything tastes amazing! My eyes get very dry though. I am not sure who thinks that it tastes sweet and like citrus, to me it tasted pretty bad I can&#39;t quite put my finger on what it tastes like.

VI would give it a 7,5 if I could.\u000aIt has great taste, great potency, great smell but there is something about it that puts me off after I smoked it for a while. It&#39;s like it makes you feel like you don&#39;t wanna do anything, you get completly unmotivated... So overall it is great strain to feel really spaced out and happy, but don&#39;t smoke it for a long time...

VPicked this up on the suggestion of my budtender, and I must say, I am BLOWN AWAY at the quality of this strain. I am a big Green Crack fan, but this little gem may edge it&#39;s way into my #1 slot. Very nice buzzy energetic high. I will probably get a lot accomplished tonight.

This strain is extremely potent, you don&#39;t really get a buzz from it, it just sort of makes you into a mindless zombie.

VKnown here in the Netherlands for being able to completely fuck you up with the right amount/quality. Tried some with my friends on a school trip. We had some free time and went to a park. After finding a nice spot where we wouldn&#39;t be a problem, we smoked some up. It took a couple of minutes but then hit me like a brick. The wind just felt amazing and felt like it was blowing through my clothes. The world felt and looked like we were in an earthquake and walking was a hard task. Walking to the kfc felt like it took 2 minutes but we actually walked for 20 minutes. Ordering something was scary and hilarious at the same time. Then the effect faded away with a very dislocated feel.

VGreat strain, my favorite so far. Made my back feel warm, the room feels smaller and more comfortable. I felt happy, interested, talkative, confident and creative. It didn&#39;t hit my body at all, I felt very in control and energetic. Yet I did feel a strong and clear buzz. It smells and tastes great, smooth and rich, but it tickles the throat a bit. And a full on cotton-mouth. But the high makes it pretty bearable... Definitely a great strain.

VI bought this in Holland  (the Netherlands). kinda pricey at 13\u20ac per gram. I bought it expecting energy because it&#39;s a sativa. I got lazy and dreamy instead. I didn&#39;t remember my back pain though!\u000a\u000aI&#39;m a medical user suffering from PTSD and chronic pain in my back. I&#39;d say it helped with both. I just didn&#39;t get the energy and focus I hoped for. Best fr meditation in my opinion.

VI had this mixed with the Bubba Kush joint and it prolonged the effects of deep thoughts while staring off into space. when you mix a strong Sativa like this with Kush, it is like a rollercoaster of up and down. You want to do something, but then you forget and then wander right back to that thing you were supposed to do earlier. (took me 20-25 mins to get washer started for laundry). Not good when you have a list of things you need to do. But if you wanna walk around high and dreamy, this is the strain for you.

VVery awesome strain. First of all the buds I got were super rock hard and dense to the point where they took strength to break. I threw a nug that looked like less than half a gram on the scale and it weighed out to 1.07 g.  Upon cracking the nugs the delightful lemonny citrus smell of the bud whacked me in the face immediately. I rolled up a joint and couldn&#39;t finish half of it I was so damn high. I was very surprised to find out that this bud didn&#39;t give me that long drowsy comedown which makes it very good for daytime medicating. 10/10 would buy this cut of amnesia haze again and again.

VI&#39;m a big fan of Amnesia Haze. It&#39;s a strong sativa with a euphoric mood boosting quality - perfect for day time blazing! Contrary to its name, I actually find it a really sharp, creative mental high. It also smells and tastes like a delicious field of flowers.

VGood high, clear headed but miles above the clouds. Zero anxiety or paranoia like a Sour Diesel. Vaped with a Pax 2, exhale has a woody, musky taste. Almost like a pine tree after walking into an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. I actually walked the dog after a half session with the Pax! Upbeat, mood booster, high energy jolt.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m searching for the perfect strains to battle endless/constant depression, alcoholism, boredom, social anxiety. Haze seems to be the genetic family for me. Anything Chemdawg is a HUGE no-go for me.

This strain is extremely potent, you don&#39;t really get a buzz from it, it just sort of makes you into a mindless zombie. Monging out is a big part of this and if you plan to do anything for the rest of your day i suggest you go for a different grade.

Not the strongest weed I\u2019ve had;nowhere near.

V2 1/2 stars for this one \u000a\u000aReal nice yield and aromas are sweet &amp; citrusy with slight tang of a sweet when medicating taste similar to strawberry cough?. \u000a\u000aI had a big Buddha cheese plant as well and there was a clear difference in height and yield and smell from probably after the second definitely by the third week of 12/12 nice aromas &amp; yields, but am haze can be  prone to many deficiencies,nitrogen, cal mag, more commonly \u000a\u000aPests. I have gnats one of the easier ones to get rid of but who wants anything living/flying around my soil in the garden. amnesia haze is also prone to pests \u000a\u000aDoesn\u2019t take long to produce many bigger than average colas, if done properly. Assuming that\u2019s why it takes ridiculous long to flower! Definitely bare that in mind [&#163;\u20ac$&#165;] as this plant matures probably In the last week or over. If you look at trichomes for maturity then it can be over the recommended date by a few days to a week, dependant on the climate of your garden \u000a\u000aIf it wasn\u2019t for the taste and highs I would definitely not choose this for first time marijuana medical growers

VI bought 2 strains yesterday. One consisting of Afghan haze, and the other, amnesia haze. I smoked it with my 2 best mates, and we discovered a new kind of highness. This was not your average type of high, this was highness in another dimension. Highness that makes you have a good time and highness that makes you foresee your future and goals. It inspires you even much more to do what you love. The body feels really relaxed yet energetical. As said, it\u2019s not a sensation that can be explained. It\u2019s an emotion that has to be felt. Thanks to the weed Gods. This shit was superficial as fuck.

VA wondrous Sativa dominant strain from a Patient friends garden delivered to me freshly sorted from the hospital.  I am really relishing this formidable Sativa which has the out of bag limonene terpenes that I really love above all for first medications and subsequent use in the mornings.  These truly appealing lemon peal citrus crisp odours  and wonderfully earthy taste are such a strong contender for the Sativa Strain of the Spring of 2018 hands down winner in my books.  She is a confidant blend of three distinctive genetics a Jamaican Sativa a Laotian Sativa and Indica dominant Afghani-Hawaiian how is that for stretching the Cannabis Globe for basis of this truly helpful strain.

VThis is a decently strong head high for me, but not so much that I\u2019m getting a headache or anything. When it first hit, things moved a bit slower...but once the effects started to kick in I was focused, extreMELY goal-oriented, determined, energized in a good way, and pretty giggly! This would be a great strain to get work done to, or any sort of creative project. It wasn\u2019t so strong that it kept me up (I smoked later at night), but it definitely didn\u2019t make me sleepy. It helped with body pain slightly but not as much as others with a higher CBD content for sure. This kind of strain would probably make you motivated but still able to just chill, it just depends on what your goal is. It gave me very slight munchies, nothing too strong and no sort of couch lock whatsoever. I feel like this could be a very fun strain to do with lots of people just having fun or by yourself on a day of running errands or cleaning your house. I also noticed it made me overshare a little bit lol and be very bluntly honest, more so than just an average high for me...but that could definitely just be me! Overall, I really enjoyed this strain. Definitely am gonna try in the future for getting work done.

I smoked a joint then i don&#39;t know what the actual hell  happend... It gave me everything! My first fase was a chilly, relaxy vibe. I was totally in myself and my thoughts just flew me tot Amnesia planet. And let me tell you, that&#39;s a beautyfull planet. My second fase, the creative social fase. I told my friend all about that planet, how it smelled, how it looked everything. But in my own words ofcourse and we had some funny talks and do&#39;s. Then wauw, i was just happy and we made some music with extra friends who  came. Real nice, man, yesterday was really one of the best chilly music meet. Just ideal to start of easy and go super cookie dough damn with friends while making music. Praise the lord.

A sweet biscuit but sometimes mouth watering fruity taste, heavy on the chest and forgiving with the high!

VI smoked some quality Amnesia Haze last night for the first time. It was so great I decided I was going to get high before work today (working high at this job for the first time!!) \u000a\u000aAs I walked into work (a restaurant) everything looked so complicated and I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to handle it .. but once I touched the first piece of worklike material I realized I too was a machine and I worked my ass off but time flew by. \u000a\u000aAnyway the high lasted about two hours.. and I just smoked some more about 20 minutes ago\u000a\u000a-My mind is at peace\u000a\u000a-My pain is reduced by 80% (broken back/ discs etc)\u000a\u000a-The head high is intense and enlightening. \u000a\u000a-I&#39;m on a cloud. I can feel colorful waves (of an unknown medium similar to light) loosening my neck muscles.\u000a\u000a-Anything that would make me stressed, angry, or frustrated is now quite humorous and thus simple to take care of.\u000a\u000aP.S. Smoke this outdoors.. it&#39;s really strong and the smell will linger in a room for hours .. even just from grinding it \u000a\u000a

VI saw Prometheus at a huge theatre on Amsterdam after smoking a huge joint of Amnesia Haze. Consequently, I thought the movie was pretty good, which meant that the drug had worked its eponymously-inferred magic. Not an &quot;every day&quot; smoke, as the afternoon proved to be blurry in not a good way, and I involuntarily ate three Febo cheeseburgers. But a good gentle ass kicking weed.

No perceived burn out or couch-lock.  The nausea was diminished to the point of I was hungry, and kept the food down. Has a slightly sweet flavor and is easy on the lungs and throat....as long as you don&#39;t try to take too much at once.\u000a

VGrew an auto-fem dwarf (from Queen Seeds) in the greenhouse this summer. Has only had a week of curing, so I&#39;m expecting it to improve in strength a little. Smoked in a one-hit pipe, 0.05g \u000aA long-lasting, focussed high.\u000aInteresting visual effect: a lowered depth of field perception with increased colour and detail perception: straight lines seem strangely fascinating.\u000aDry mouth is significant, and it&#39;s not really a &#39;fun&#39; smoke: don&#39;t look forward to it, so maybe a good one for cutting down as the hit lasts, too.

I remember i was with my friends, i was the only one who smoked it and for the first 30 minutes i was happy, i was laughing and all that, then from good went BAD! i kept forgetting what i was doing there, what happened earlier that day i was like what are these people doing here? and if i would&#39;ve looked forward everything was moving up and down and i was blinking very fast and i was getting paranoid and i cant actually remember very well what happened and as i was walking down to McDonlads to get an iced drink i couldnt feel my body. i could only feel a kind of vibration in my hips and i could her myself and i sometimes i couldnt even speak and i felt like i was in a dream and i was soooo relaxed but it got me very very very very very paranoid. that was the worst trip of my life. my advice, smoke it if u are in a safe place and with people that know how to treat or talk to a high person

VI&#39;m a big fan of Amnesia Haze. It&#39;s a strong sativa with a euphoric mood boosting quality - perfect for day time blazing! Contrary to its name, I actually find it a really sharp, creative mental high. It also smells and tastes like a delicious field of flowers.

VVery awesome strain. First of all the buds I got were super rock hard and dense to the point where they took strength to break. I threw a nug that looked like less than half a gram on the scale and it weighed out to 1.07 g.  Upon cracking the nugs the delightful lemonny citrus smell of the bud whacked me in the face immediately. I rolled up a joint and couldn&#39;t finish half of it I was so damn high. I was very surprised to find out that this bud didn&#39;t give me that long drowsy comedown which makes it very good for daytime medicating. 10/10 would buy this cut of amnesia haze again and again.

VIt has too much indica in it, at least for me, to be considered a sativa. I was let down. Maybe what I tried was poorly grown by someone; I don&#39;t know. Anyway I refuse to buy it again from other growers to certify my claim. Compared to truer sativas, the one I tried is 2 *s  for hardly any mental inspiration. However, as a hybrid, I would give it one extra star for a mediocre hybrid. Forget it, I&#39;m not buying this one again. A Malawi or Chocolate Thai is way more superior than this washed out strain of all it&#39;s original purity.

He&#39;s a carpenter so it&#39;s an awesome wake&#39;n&#39;bake before work as he can easily stay focused on numbers, measurements, math, etc. He compares it to that energetic, motivated feeling you get after your first cup of coffee.

We smoked a good amount of hash during the day and in the morning to set us stoned for the day. Put when we went out at night found the party and started 2 toke. that Haze really boosted us up. From super coutchlocked to dancing to all kinds of music. Got me talking to everyone and smoking with everyone. Would recomend to everyone on the look out for a amazing night out&#180;but would even be nice before bed or as you wake up. Nice looking buds too. tighty grown.

Creeps up on you a bit and give a total cerebral head high that lets you off easy.  It does not last more than about 2 hours or so.  A perfect daytime product.  I HIGHLY recommend.

Hairs are a deep reddish brown you can get lost in.\u000aSmell: Smells like a honeyed, tannin rich, black oolong tea; can almost taste it on the sides of my tongue just by taking a breath.  \u000aTaste/Smoke: Mild earthy taste, smooth &amp; creamy on exhale.

Having said that, don&#39;t go too heavy, quite a high THC level so can leave you lazy physically if not mentally. Flavour is similar to a good lemon haze with more earthy overtones.

The only reason I do not rate this 5 star is because I crashed out on my bean bag about 2 hours after smoking the original joint. For the first 2 hours I was having a bloody great time but after a while I did definitely become very sleepy. To be fair it was about 12:30 but personally I do not feel that sleepy at 12:30.

VGreat strain, my favorite so far. Made my back feel warm, the room feels smaller and more comfortable. I felt happy, interested, talkative, confident and creative. It didn&#39;t hit my body at all, I felt very in control and energetic. Yet I did feel a strong and clear buzz. It smells and tastes great, smooth and rich, but it tickles the throat a bit. And a full on cotton-mouth. But the high makes it pretty bearable... Definitely a great strain.

VKnown here in the Netherlands for being able to completely fuck you up with the right amount/quality. Tried some with my friends on a school trip. We had some free time and went to a park. After finding a nice spot where we wouldn&#39;t be a problem, we smoked some up. It took a couple of minutes but then hit me like a brick. The wind just felt amazing and felt like it was blowing through my clothes. The world felt and looked like we were in an earthquake and walking was a hard task. Walking to the kfc felt like it took 2 minutes but we actually walked for 20 minutes. Ordering something was scary and hilarious at the same time. Then the effect faded away with a very dislocated feel.

VI had this mixed with the Bubba Kush joint and it prolonged the effects of deep thoughts while staring off into space. when you mix a strong Sativa like this with Kush, it is like a rollercoaster of up and down. You want to do something, but then you forget and then wander right back to that thing you were supposed to do earlier. (took me 20-25 mins to get washer started for laundry). Not good when you have a list of things you need to do. But if you wanna walk around high and dreamy, this is the strain for you.

VTo be honest, this is a review of a disposable pen loaded with Amnesia Haze.  It supposedly is loaded with 1 gram of oil. Once it&#39;s used up  you simple toss it.\u000aMy problem is that the 1 gram claim is fraudulent. It lasted less than a week. Usually a gram lasts me over a month. I returned it to the dispensary and they politely gave me a new one. IT lasted a week. The pen cannot be opened. I seriously doubt it was loaded with a gram. I wrote to the company and got zero response. I will never use a WHO product again.

VCreeps up on you in a very interesting way, quite enjoyable and relaxing high, maybe would&#39;ve been better if it were a bit stronger. Seems better when mixed with SSH or something like White Rhino or White Widow.\u000aOverall, wouldn&#39;t go for it alone for daily use, nice to try once in a while though.\u000aCertainly helps with lack of appetite.

I even tidied my room at 11.30 pm which hadn&#39;t been cleaned to that level for about 5 months! However it also at the end of my night, completely knocked me out to sleep, but not too early like a heavy indica would. It&#39;s safe to say I awoke this mourning feeling on cloud 9 and I couldn&#39;t say no to vaping some more as we speak :)

Since I smoke with tobbaco it&#39;s hard to describe the taste but it has a sweet/sour taste I guess, The smoke is easy on the lungs and throat.\u000a\u000aThe high hits like a train and is chill and couch&#39;locking (have that with all sativas) There is euphoria, alertness and focus. Overall the high is awesome for watching tv or gaming. It may be too much for starters, but it&#39;s definitely worth trying !

But a good balance - being able to get the benefits without being completely dizzy and foggy for hours upon hours - is somewhat impossible for me with this strain. I connot recommend using this as a medical cannabis, although it did help me relax more and (most of the time) helped me sleep a little better. Note: I used this strain as a canna-oil.

VOf all the strains I&#39;ve tried in my life this is probably my favorite, and go-to, weed to smoke in the morning/daytime. If you&#39;re looking to relax and sleep, this is probably not it. Very euphoric, energetic, uplifting high that allows you to get work, or other stuff, done efficiently. Becareful tho, smoke too much and you&#39;ll be retarded haha. Love love Amnesia.

VI got an eighth of this lovely flower and it is definitely a great strain. \u000aVery smooth bud, not harsh at all and a somewhat instant high. The high is very relaxing and Euphoric, but doesn&#39;t spike my productivity as much as sativas usually do. However, the creativity this strain produces is wonderful. \u000a

VAmnesia haze has to be one of the best strains hands down its so crystaly with a nice amount of pale orange hairs. The smell is hard to pin it has a stinging Diesel scent with hints of a cappuccino which surprisingly mixes well. Amnesia is smooth with a good strong taste it breaks up almost into a crystal dust overall it&#39;s great

VAmazing strain, and one of the best sellers in Amsterdam.\u000aHad my hands on 46 grams which only took me 3 weeks to finish up. Very strong strain, even for my high tolerance level, it can still knock me out if just a little tired. Strong uplifting high, followed by a deep couch-locked stoned. Not to be taken lightly.  Could also use a little more taste on the exhale.. I prefer the AmnesiahazexCheese hybrid.

VSuper great strain. It has a great mix of sativa and indica. It feels like 75% head and 25% body high. It really mellows you out and makes you feel great. I have problems dealing with stress and Amnesia Haze makes me forget all my worries (pun not intended). Over all great weed, it hits you on the first hit.
