VWas really looking forward to this strain, as I&#39;m a fan of it&#39;s parent strains (Blue Dream, Grapefruit, Blueberry, White Widow).  My batch was a little harsh, but sweet on the exhale.  I was, however, a little let down by this strain.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it provides a cerebral buzz with a mellow body high, but for me, it was just &#39;meh&#39;.

VDecent strain that offers a strong but manageable buzz. I did experience stoner eyes admittedly, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;d be going out in public in the early stages of a fresh high...\u000a\u000aThe buds were visually stunning. Paler green with lots of white frosting and a semi-sweet fragrance that is released as you bust some open. The batch I acquired didn&#39;t really taste like fruit loops (or even Blueberry or Grapefruit). The 3 strains that make Fruit Loops resulted in what I describe as a soapy taste - especially on the first toke. This did diminish, and wasn&#39;t a dominant flavour or feature as the doobie burned but I just found it odd...\u000a\u000aStill, I have to give it 4 stars for the enjoyable buzz. On taste alone? 2 stars.

VTonite I&#39;m smoking on Fruit Loops, and indica dominant hybrid, that true to its name tastes like Froot Loops cereal - a sort of dull yet tasty fruit taste but that&#39;s what happens when they get dunked in milk, right?\u000a\u000aMine tested at 19.30% THC and .02 % CBD. I&#39;m definitely feeling  heaviness in my head and  a nice couch lock coming on, making this a very nice bedtime strain.  There&#39;s a cerebral quality to this one too, and I&#39;m enjoying vegging out watching the X-Files on Netflix with Fruit Loops loaded in my pipe.\u000a\u000aI am going to thoroughly enjoy these 2 grams of Fruit Loops but probably won&#39;t seek it out again only because taste wise I wish this had been fruitier.  Like I said, this is more of a dull fruit taste, not an explosive fruit taste like Tangie or Cherry Pie has, for example.

Vi give this strain 5 stars mainly because of its aroma of actual fruits ans berries permiates throughout. However the smoke was a bit harsh and they indica effects were a 5 outta 10 for my personal taste. Huge dense nugs of bright green with amber hairs slight hints of Purple. Def an itch that has now been scratched, another one checked off the to-do list &#128521;

V Picked up a 1/2 gram Snap and Pull of Fruit Loops by Fraction Extraction, Nug Run + Dewaxed. OMG! So flavorful! I got more of a grapefruit / sour diesel taste than anything white widow, blueberry or blue dream. Honestly some of best tasting concentrate I&#39;ve ever had. I had a tummy ache and it knocked that right out. Good indica hybrid. Not overly tired just relax, very very relaxed. I went to buy more but my ship sold out quick. If you get a chance to get some Fruit Loops definitely give it a try, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed.
