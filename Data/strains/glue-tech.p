VSmoked an eighth of this Glue Tech purchased in newly-minted MA! The high begins in the head but never really steps on the gas. As soon as I&#39;ve brought out the art supplies and set up my tunes I find the creativity subsiding and the indica taking over. It&#39;s a hybrid, but much more in the variety of evening smokes in my opinion.  Will it get you high? Yes. Is it something to write home about? Not really.

VBligaow!!! Honestly this strain is awesome and I will be going for more tomorrow I wish and hope I come across a seed in the bag. I work construction and have arthritis and multiple back injuries within minutes I got a warm relaxing feeling in my hands much like from a topical cream and can feel my back loosening up. \u000a\u000aHeh the screen started twisting a bit very heavy high couch lock for sure and i haven&#39;t even cleared the bowl yet.

VVery potent strain. I was ecstatic to get this from my dispensary and I must say, I was not let down. The high comes on strong and quickly. I noticed a euphoric and heavy feeling behind my eyes that gradually spread throughout my entire body. The body high was so strong, and overwhelming blissful that it was almost psychedelic like. Hopefully, you haven&#39;t planned on doing anything on this strain other than melting in a couch and watching a movie or playing video games, because you&#39;ll be melting in your couch within a half hour. Trust me when I say you&#39;ll not be getting up for at least a few hours. This is definently a strain to keep in your rotation for those days that you feel like getting lazy lol.
