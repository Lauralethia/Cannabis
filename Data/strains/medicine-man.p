V2nite was going to be a bad nite in pain or not I think. Specially strong in the PM (6). Nausea 4-5. Dint get a chance to medicate till 2030. Started workin in bout 5-10 minutes. Nausea gone. Pain lvl 3-4 @ worst. A lil dizzy; not too ditzy. Or maybe I&#39;m gettin used to it; either the weed or the effects of chronic pain. Some anxiety/paranoia (4-5) but manageable. Think 2nite was going 2 be bad for anxiety regardless. Oops. Guess that&#39;s a sign I need to take better care of myself. Wearing off BIG time 2 hours later. Perhaps I am building up a tolerance.

VLooking at other reviews, I know that this strain probably deserves better than three stars, but the product I got under the medicine man name was a disappointment to say the least. I can only assume this is because of the way it was produced. It smelled and tasted like sweaty feet. The high I got was ok, but left something to be desired. I hope this strain makes a comeback in my area, because other people make it sound so promising.

It has a subtle cerebral high and a light body interaction but this is outstanding for pain. I just smoked a little and it took care of a screaming shoulder.

Migraine/tension headache 5 all day when I got home &amp; medicated. Nausea 4-5 when I got home. Dizzy (4) &amp; disorientated (3-4). Medicated bout 7 pm. Doesn&#39;t take long @ all to work. Used much less. 1 1/2 hits as compared to 4 hits two days ago. High much enjoyable/less anxiety. Effect lasted bout 2 1/2 hours. Still too heady to be a favorite. Can&#39;t use too much of Medicine Man before my anxiety kicks in. But so wonderful for the nausea. Helpful for migraine pain tho doesn&#39;t get rid of it. I don&#39;t expect to be pain free anymore.

VThis strain didn&#39;t really match with my needs and psyche. It actually triggered really intense shaking in my hands, probably due to the high THC levels. Although I must say, I&#39;ve never experienced that with ANY other strain of flower: some with much higher THC. Would not recommend for anyone with anxiety. I slept ok after it if that matters. There are better strains out there. Don&#39;t waste your money.

VThis strain is probably the best I have had in a while. Definitely helps aches and pains, helps you stay focused and is relaxing. I give it a four only because of the dry mouth and the feeling paranoid every so often lol.

VLooking at other reviews, I know that this strain probably deserves better than three stars, but the product I got under the medicine man name was a disappointment to say the least. I can only assume this is because of the way it was produced. It smelled and tasted like sweaty feet. The high I got was ok, but left something to be desired. I hope this strain makes a comeback in my area, because other people make it sound so promising.

VMy lady and I have lived in Colorado for 4 months now and have only been to 2 dispensaries thus far. The staff at Medicine Man really took the time to answer my confusing questions, help me with a Westword Newspaper discount when I was limited on funds, and pointed me in the right direction when it came to growing plants and where to obtain genuine seeds. The only two things Medicine Man can approve on is better prices and discounts as well as benefits for veterans. BTW, I am a 25 year old physically and psychologicly chalenged veteran with daily and nightly agonizing pain.
