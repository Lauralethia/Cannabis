VVortex is an award winning strain that is mainly sativa dominant S/I: 80/20. The bud used in this review was purchased at HPRC. A local dispensary serving local humboldt residents with an indoor all-organic alternative medicine. \u000a\u000aThis bud stanks!!! The smell is a huge highlight for this bud. The very dense aroma of a mango/lime/lemonade blend meets you as you prepare to first smell it. The buds are beautifully sprinkled with a generous distribution of orange hairs and snow white tricomes. People have reported that this is their favourite tasting medicine out there, and I agree that it is top notch. The smell translates to the taste of herbs/mango/lemonade. The intake is smooth, but does have a bit of push-back, assumedly, as a result of the very pungent smells. One of the best and, i suppose, rarest buds I have come across.

VWalked into my first ever dispensary the other day and said &quot;I need something that will wake me up.&quot; the cashier recommend Vortex to me, and she couldn&#39;t have been more right. Very uplifting and energetic high, that makes you feel happy and ready to take on your day. Vortex quickly has become one of my favorite strains

VOne of my favorite strains of all time. Once the words baby poo are mentioned, the smell can&#39;t be described as anything else lol. No ceiling, great taste. As with every strain the quality can very from grower to grower. If you see vortex covered in crystals and it smells a lil funky, grab an eighth at least.

VGreat strain!!! Though not my favorite but when you drive a rolls royce you certainly recognize it!!! I did buy the plant, but wasn&#39;t my favorite strain. I&#39;ve read it is one of the best medicinal strains so I had to get her. It has a strong buzz and feel though total control and enjoy the ride.  I felt uplifted energetic focused and everything else you&#39;d enjoy in angreat strain BUT it barely touched my pain (fibro) which is why I probably won&#39;t smoke much. The oth thing for me is the smell taste and ride weren&#39;t my favorite. However, I have to acknowledge a great strain smoke and high quality. \u000a\u000aI shared it with fellow MMJ patients and they loved it!\u000aTry it out See if it helps you out.

VA very good easy to grow sativa dominant hybrid that&#39;s very very stable. I germinated 5 seeds and got 5 females all exactly the same in appearance and not much difference in high, taste , smell etc.. Looked like clones they were so uniform and all ripened at the same time except 1 she took another 2 days. Super thick trichomes helps drying slow in warm dry areas where you need a method to such as cardboard boxes with holes etc.. Is needed. Didn&#39;t have to do anything and took 15 days to dry. Perfect IMO. Taste bad during the first week of cure with low lemon smell. This all goes away after week 3 of cure and the lemon mango candy flavored come out.(I used hydro systems with organic nutrients but think in organic soil the flavors and tastes would have been almost instant and better. Under my bed now and been cured a month and it&#39;s a super great high with mild pain relief and great for my anxiety. Very talkative but still will make u walk into a room and forget why lol. 4.5 stars I give it only because the yields are average and it could have been more colorful IMO. Can&#39;t taste the Romulan in it at all something I like but also have Rombery under the bed cured so I have my heavy fruity spivey Indica and my all day citrus smoke with the vortex. It&#39;s a creeper so don&#39;t over indulge wait 15 minutes b4 dosing again. Easiest plant I&#39;ve ever grown looks so beautiful thru the whole grow.. Loved growing it. Also if u ever have the pleasure of growing this I suggest a scrog set up or lots of bamboo stakes to support the buds that are too much for the skinny branches to hold up. Strong for a sativa dominant helps me sleep or socialize with no ceiling or come down &amp; 0 hangover. This is quality smoke from a quality breeder. Any bad reviews are on the despensory&#39;s for using a cheap grower or just plain low standards with making money more important than helping patients.

VBeen smoking daily for about ten years... I strongly favour indicas, however vortex is one of my favourite strains of all time. It&#39;s my go to sativa. Some people don&#39;t like how it looks, but I think the large buds look nice. Real dark green  with yellowish hairs. Definitely unique. Smells earthy and minty to me. Sort of a mild smell. Effects wise, very powerful all around. Very prominent head high... With my high tolerance, differences in strains are very subtle, but vortex really stands out as a sativa. Picked it up a few times now from a Vancouver BC dispensery, and I love it. Out of 100 I&#39;d give it a  93. Wait.... No... 93.4

It made me forget everything I had done. I drank an entire soda w/out remembering even taking a sip. Same with a bag of chips. Kept forgetting why my mouth was on fire. \u000aGood stuff. I&#39;ll have to have it again before I can say much more about it though. But! It has a good taste! Very strong and weedy. \u000aApparently it mixes well with GDP, but bad call.

VVortex is definitely an apt namesake for the sativa strain, as it&#39;s high can send you, and your little dog, far out of Kansas if you are not careful. Happy, heady, creative, spacey, and potent are how I would describe this strain for me. The flowers look very skunk-like, in that they are airy or lose forming, but the skunk scent, that I&#39;d been expecting from the looks, is tamed very successfully with notes of what tastes of lemon and mint. These three seem to form a unique trinity that just works for my palette. Which is good thing as the I found the expansion in the lungs to be very quick, which usually makes for a harsher hit and/or a cough maker, but that lemony mint twist kept it at bay for me, like a cough drop. The high is very heady but from there... Well, it&#39;s taken me on an uplifted, whirlwind of energy high that keeps you zoned out when you are doing mindless repetitive tasks or in the zone when needing to focus on a serious serious problem with dogged determination and creative approaches. But like a tornado&#39;s path of destruction that hits &amp; destroys one house and misses the neighbor&#39;s house. Vortex can follow an energetic high with a heady mindcation to unimaginable depths of pontification on whatever flight of fancy you wish to go on or demand to be taken. It&#39;s sporadic in it&#39;s effects, but always delivers a great time.

VVortex is definitely an apt namesake for the sativa strain, as it&#39;s high can send you, and your little dog, far out of Kansas if you are not careful. Happy, heady, creative, spacey, and potent are how I would describe this strain for me. The flowers look very skunk-like, in that they are airy or lose forming, but the skunk scent, that I&#39;d been expecting from the looks, is tamed very successfully with notes of what tastes of lemon and mint. These three seem to form a unique trinity that just works for my palette. Which is good thing as the I found the expansion in the lungs to be very quick, which usually makes for a harsher hit and/or a cough maker, but that lemony mint twist kept it at bay for me, like a cough drop. The high is very heady but from there... Well, it&#39;s taken me on an uplifted, whirlwind of energy high that keeps you zoned out when you are doing mindless repetitive tasks or in the zone when needing to focus on a serious serious problem with dogged determination and creative approaches. But like a tornado&#39;s path of destruction that hits &amp; destroys one house and misses the neighbor&#39;s house. Vortex can follow an energetic high with a heady mindcation to unimaginable depths of pontification on whatever flight of fancy you wish to go on or demand to be taken. It&#39;s sporadic in it&#39;s effects, but always delivers a great time.

VThe smell is definitely the first thing I noticed about this strain. I would describe it as some kind of lemon candy. There&#39;s a slightly more complicated level of sweet to it than that, but that is the initial impression I got from this strain. Potency is quite good. Additionally, after smoking I could taste lemon in my mouth for nearly an hour.

VHeavy hitter with a body high. It reminds me of an Indica hybrid or a 50/50 because of the body high, it&#39;s not quite as heavy as an actual indica, but it&#39;s heavy enough to se before bed and you get that indica body relaxation. But when I bought this I was looking for an energetic sativa. It&#39;s fairly versatile, except that it does tend to make when somewhat drowsy, so it&#39;s not that good for a daytime med. It&#39;s alright for night time but I&#39;d rather get blackberry kush or an indica for that purpose. This does live up to it&#39;s name because it does kind of make your head a little bit like a spinning dizzy feeling almost. The taste is kind of fruity which is nice. It was kind of harsh though makes me cough a fair bit but. Nice and compact buds, got it for like $90 an ounce or $100 something like that. Problem is it&#39;s not energetic enough to overcome the heaviness of it; there is some energy there but it&#39;s dampened by the inertia of the vortex that makes you want to sit down for the most part.

VVortex is one of the best bang for my buck strains. It&#39;s a very euphoria-inducing strain, and it&#39;s generally a reasonably priced mid in most dispensaries. You could spend ~$5 a gram more on other strains and still not rival the quality of vortex&#39;s high. Vortex kief and shake is also amongst my favorites.

VThis strain has a nice smell and taste. It gives you an upp-y high, and the come down resulted in the consumption of a little bit of food (not too much) and I had a decent night&#39;s sleep. It is good for stress, anxiety, I feel like it helps my back pain a bit too, and I feel like it keeps me on track with getting stuff done. The high is not too intense. I would say it could last a bit longer, but it does the trick without having to smoke too much at once.

VVery powerful, really defines what a sativa is. It smelled and tasted a lot like Pineapple Express. Only 4 stars because the headache was definitely noticeable\u000a

Vthis is the first strain I&#39;ve found that is perfect as is. this had easily over taken sleestack as my all time favorite sativa. beautiful buds but the buzz is the deal. this is a perfect strain for wake and bake, I have never felt more motivated, upbeat, and productive in my live (at work and in general). vortex makes me grateful for smoke.

Vthis is pretty strong. I&#39;m only writing reviews on strong stuff now. I have been dabbing for too often so i tried to smoke some flowers. even for a daily dabber this is pretty strong. \u000agot this at safe capitol in sacramento. recommend.

VIt was sprayed with chemicals and pesticides and the dispensary would not refund my money. It made me and several people in the dispensary vomit. This is a horrible strain but most likely my horrible experience is completely influencing this review.
