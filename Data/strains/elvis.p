VI&#39;ve been loving this as a concentrate! It&#39;s flavor is uniquely spicy and sweet with a hint of jalape&#241;os. It doesn&#39;t seem to take much to get you an intense high, and the high itself is quite the euphoric rush. I&#39;m even getting these peripheral hallucinations as well as flash backs. This works wonders for pain and gives you a creative spark. Finally, my head is buzzing and my body is relaxed while I&#39;m hit with hunger. This is a new favorite strain for me ^^

VArrowhead shaped buds.  First vape had a bit of green bell pepper flavor, kind of like a Sauvignon Blanc.  Otherwise piney and menthol.   Head high came on quickly with peppiness and alertness.  Body felt pretty normal and relaxed. Had small amount of anxiety from this strain when out in public when my short term memory got scattered.

VThis is one of my favorite hybrid.  Elvis wins your nose and mouth. The smell is refreshing and the smoke is smooth.  The high is cerebral, energetic and refreshing. It is easy to build up tolerance with Elvis because it smells and tastes so good. It&#39;s a good strain to get out of the funk or get funk. I recommend switching buds to keep Elvis exciting.
