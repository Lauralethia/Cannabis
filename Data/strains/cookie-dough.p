VThe force is strong in this one. It hits hard, it hits fast and it hits you everywhere. Even for a veteran like me this strain is overwhelming. Great for getting away from it, but forget any and all notions of productivity.

VBeautiful blissful high. Sweet sort of skunk flavour. Tingly sensation throughout, helping melt chronic pain and headache away. Appetite for the first time in months. The mind effect&#39;s aren&#39;t overwhelming, just right to relax. If I had more I&#39;d be passed out in bed right now, but for now I&#39;m chillen. 1/2 a dab in. My husband loves it too, killed all of his pain instantly. This is a true hybrid with the mind/body effects in our opinion, and we both love it. Cookie dough for all!

VSo far my favorite of the Cookies ranking equal to the Blueberry Cookies mainly for their taste.  The latter was just super sweet with an edge of skunk, but this Cookie Dough was not so.  Rather bland with a little bite on the tail end which is immediately felt.  With each hit the sensation becomes stronger seeming endless.  Meaning the sky is the limit so if you want to get ripped keep going.\u000a\u000aReally keep puffing away because the high is sativa chatter mouth for 5-10 minutes at most before an intense sudden plummet into stoned.  As in lazy couch lock turned into gridlock soon thereafter so even with the best intentions nothing will get done.  The trick for me with any of the cookie strains is to just keep partaking for an active buzz..  \u000a\u000aAnimal Cookies was the most upbeat, GSC is boring even at astronomical %&#39;s, and I am looking forward to Thin Mints.  None of them have passed 3 stars.  \u000a\u000a***Check out next review for Cookie Dough on my page for a quick summary of a few fruity strains/CD salads.  Game Changer for sure***

Vas i sit here breathing after smoking, i taste the raw cookie dough. i had read the info and reviews before i bought it. i decided one hit at a time, which quickly became two. i have been repeating the cycle for hours. i feel the sedating effect whilst completely lucid and down for anything. i appreciate the high THC level so as i&#39;m not smoking so much as to cough. this is fire for those familiar with flower. i bought as much as possible and ran. this will last three times or more longer than the last dank hybrid and deep red-purple indica i just had.

VOne for the connoisseurs!  This dank, sweet and dry, baked beauty will give the newcomer trouble! A friendly, true to name kick comes with a tickley, moreish inhale and overall  10/10 all round high,  making this strain a great choice to many people  for many reasons.
