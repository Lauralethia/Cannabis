VFirst off, this stuff is STAAAAANKY! A beautiful deep and bold earthy/skunky aroma with hints of what I can only describe as &quot;beef Raman&quot;. A wonderful smoke, does wonderers for relaxation. Although it is a indica, I found it very very functional. 8.8/10 would smoke again

VAmazing indica. These aren&#39;t your daddy&#39;s nugs, these are proper medical/weapons grade. Very intense high with a calming finish, perfect to succumb to the sandman. Also good for deep pain!

VWhen I first saw how small the buds were on Tuna Kush I thought I got ripped off, but at second gance they are loaded with trichomes and dark orange hairs, looks almost frosty. The smell was skunky/hashy - heavy smoke, reminded me of pink kush on the exhale. Beautiful relaxing effects, but it&#39;ll knock you right out if you smoke too much of it.

VTuna Kush was nearly identical to Rockstar Kush, however, the issue was that the day after it leaves you feeling groggy, this is common with a lot of indicas however it&#39;s been very noticeable with Tuna Kush and to a lesser extent Rockstar Kush. It provides calmness and mental clarity, as well as a great deal of fatigue causing you to sleep and its overall impact on calmness, persists for 6-8 hours.\u000a\u000aI would recommend it after Rockstar Kush.

VI bought an oil cart with Tuna, but also had grape flavouring.\u000a\u000aWhile I can&#39;t accurately comment about the true flavour of this strain, the effect is pretty relaxing. It&#39;s very relaxing and laid back, but sometimes a little head spinning.\u000a\u000aNot really my favourite, but I&#39;m more of a sativa person anyways.

VA New Mythical Strain from BC from the land time forgot that I grew up during my formative years Cannabis wise before life wise.  I grew in and around Vancouver for near on 16 years with more stories of Cannabis exploits.   \u000a\u000aTuna Kush another British Columbian expat will soon growing in my Legal Medical Garden I welcome any genetic that incorporates Skunk F1 and Hindu Kush Land Race Indica.   This strain is about 70% Indica and 30% Sativa.  I have a Patient friend who is sending me clones of three Bc Strain that to my knowledge no one in Quebec is going at this moment.\u000a\u000aThis is one strain that wreaks to high sky just like the BC Skunk of my days !!!!

VDoesn&#39;t have a lot of bag appeal upon first glance... but it is POTENT and delicious. Smells amazing if you like that gassy smell.  Dark green, dense nugs containing a lot of crystal and clusters of red hairs. \u000a\u000aEffects are heavy in the head and eyes, it cleared up an oncoming migraine for me. Makes you want to be cozy and watch tv. Brings on the munchies... feelings of happiness. Excellent smoke for when you are feeling stressed out. \u000a\u000aI can also experience anxiety/paranoia with some strains and this one gives me NONE (like most kush strains). In fact I was feeling anxious about something prior to smoking and the tuna made all that anxiety simmer down.\u000a\u000aNot the best kush I have ever tried as I was hoping for even more body/muscle relaxing effects, but still a solid buy for kush lovers.
