VA new favorite of mine. The buds are covered in crystal and are almost so beautiful you hesitate breaking apart the bud. The high is super heady. I find that I cannot stop talking and moving to the point of dehydration (dramatized). The taste is sweet and fruity.   \u000a-great social strain\u000a-motivating and energizing\u000a-cerebral to the point of spiritual. I don&#39;t know exactly what that means but it makes sense to me. Anyway, if you have the opportunity to get your hand on some JD, give it a shot. I&#39;m glad I did.

VJamaican Dream is probably the very best wake and bake strain i have ever tried. The taste is earthy pine, and the buzz is 100% sativa. Not the strongest meds in the world, but it suits me fine for mornings especially. This bud makes me get up and go, and is very social while providing stress relief. You may get the giggles with this strain. very easy on your lungs if combusted. I like the taste also.

Started doing jobs I had been putting off for awhile and felt good while doing them. The buds I got from the dispensary were fresh top quality so I am sure that helped to give this one its full potential. Recommend this one when the crap of everyday life puts you in a deep hole.
