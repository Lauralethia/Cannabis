VCan I give it 6 stars??? Relaxing body high, lowers anxiety &amp; improves mood a lot in my case. Very good for pain. excellent for projects, snuggling, rainy day, frazzled nerves, etc. Remarkably smooth to smoke, not harsh at all. Mind goes off on pleasant &amp; productive creative tangents and you can still focus. It&#39;s powerful and comes on slowly at first. First time users of Gelato, try one or max two hits at first and wait about 20 minutes before you decide if you&#39;ll do any more. It sneaks up on you! perhaps because it&#39;s so smooth to smoke that you may not realize how much you&#39;ve inhaled. They should have named it Smiling Velvet Ninja....

VAbsolutely fantastic high. No foggy headed feeling and you actually feel like doing chores. mood improves 100% with no anxiety. This strain really helps me with my anxiety and depression. I&#39;m not so angry all of the time and I tend to be nicer to the people I love. Bottom line, if you have depression, anxiety and/or quick to anger, I HIGHLY recommend this strain, it has made my life so much easier which makes my family happy. Gelato has a head high but it also has supreme mood improvement attributes that are still there after the high has worn off.

VStopped by Ultra in SD yesterday cuz I was getting low.. scoped the menu... saw they had Bacio Gelato, I just couldn&#39;t pass it up. Currently the newest of the Gelato line from Official Cookie Fam Genetics. This sweet and tantalizing hybrid was bred and cultivated by Cookie Fam member Mr. Sherbinski!! Special care and grow techniques makes this gelato the most flavorful phenotype yet!! The taste is phenomenal, Girl Scout Cookies with a Thin Mint undertone, it&#39;s very difficult to describe the high (a close 50/50 to 60/40 blend) blessings from Ultra and Sherbinski, this is the real deal Offical Cookie Fam Genetics from SF. The only places in the state that I know have it available is Cookies SF, Dr. Greenthumb delivery and Ultra in SD. \u000a\u000a~ Stay Lifted my friends

VThis strain made my boyfriend and I have the most amazing connected, sensual dry mouth sex. Watch out for cotton mouth. Put on a movie afterwards but you may end up not watching it because you&#39;ll end up feeling your man again. Most sexual strain of them all. We had the most beautiful philosophical conversations this is a definite must try. Keep soft objects nearby you will want to touch things.

VIf I had this 20 years ago, I probably would have LOST MY MIND. Now as an MS patient, I can really appreciate this proverbial godsend strain.  \u000a\u000aOutstanding for anxiety halting mind-racing.  Zero paranoia. Pure Focus.  Should be called NZT-48, but the aroma/taste may not appeal to you; 9/10 would bang again.  I would call it Sour Gelato.  I&#39;d like to see a GelatoXGumbo indica monster.  Somebody make this.

VThis strain is a beast! \u000aI&#39;m and everyday, multiple times a day, smoker. But this one, put me on my ass in a hurry! Too much will make you become one with your bed, and blankets. Just enough, and you&#39;ll have zipped up energy for hours! The way down is nice and easy, not abrupt, or uncomfortable. This one can sneak up on you, and take you down. Being a daily smoker, I didn&#39;t anticipate it to come on like it did. For some, (myself included) it can come on very strong. It can cause a bit of an unsettling feeling when it first comes on, due to the fast acting strength of this strain. I believe newcomers should approach this strain with respect, and just a liiiiitle bit of caution. And as for the vets out there, it will be a welcomed strength. Especially with all the shwag going around now days. Overall, this is a great strain to enjoy alone, or with a group of friends. And it will be a great high for all, or you know, just you! Enjoy, and happy smokins!

VThis is what some would call a heavy hybrid. It does not send waves of relaxation pulsating through your body like an indica, but it comes close. It does not send you into mental hyper productivity like a sativa, but it comes close. It is 75% of each full experience, but beware: this means you are getting 150% of a high. It is great stuff, and quite trippy. I do not recommend taking this if you are socially anxious and are going to be in a new situation. Take this when you feel 100% comfortable with your surroundings.

VThat Ellzey person got it right. Can&#39;t have said it better myself. I mean literally because I feel friggen great about myself on this strain. Just some amazing feel good cannabis. Have mine in terp sugar form from dankman in the North Bay. Great in a concentrate. A little on the Indica side as several others have noted before me. I personally like to mix in a bit of a Sativa just to give the high a little more kick as this strain can get sort of lazy and have you meander if you were planning on doing something afterwards.

Vone of the most interesting smelling and tasting strains I&#39;ve ever had. I believe I had a thin mint dominant phenotype because there was a strong presence of mint terpines. when vaporized every hit cleared my sinuses followed by a sweet lavender vanilla aftertaste.

VWOW!!!! This is an absolutely amazing strain. Picked up half an oz of Gelato #45 for $200 from the Cookies SF. Although I can&#39;t say much for the dispensary itself, this top shelf flower is absolutely amazing! Beautiful purple buds glistening with trichomes and orange hairs. The smell is fruity and pungent, and I&#39;m definitely keeping some of this around just so I can smell it again. The trim on these nugs is impeccable, very few stems and no leaves, just beautiful purple buds.  The taste of fruity, creamy gelato bursts into your mouth with each hit you take. I have tried this with both a vaporiser (Volcano) and a bong, and each toke always leaves me yearning for more.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the high is slightly indica-dominant, but not couch locking. Gelato relaxes the body and the mind, while also lifting mood. Pain melts away as does stress.\u000a\u000aEven though this is a rather pricey strain at $20 a gram or $55 an eighth, it is a completely unique strain which every true cannasseur should try at least once. Goes well with it&#39;s parent, Sunset Sherbet!

VMethod: Wolf-LX Vap.\u000aFull Pack\u000a5-8 pulls.\u000a\u000aIve a nice delivery system in NYC. Going on 10 years plus. Always carry variety, and all top notch kind. \u000a\u000aOver the years I&#39;ve my go-to&#39;s like Sour Diesel. Hard hitters like Gorilla Glue. Super Stickies such as White Widow. All superb bud. All unique. And... This Gelato is super nice. Better in superlatives. Lips tingle and crackle. Like pine scented crystal fairies ice skating on quicksilver. \u000a\u000aDuh, fancy bud. Makes me wanna go freestyle creative, without remorse. Liberating. Creeper Alert. Is that how you spell alert, yes... Were still good. But wow... very nicely slipped on stoned pavement, ya dig. Nice. \u000a\u000aProbably too intense for novice smokers. It&#39;s a complex high. Strong. Frontal Lobe dominate. If no sun it brings the sun to you. Gotta photon head going.. warm and buzzy. Cheeks and temporal region buzzing like a &#39;you guessed it&#39;... not saying it.\u000aSeriously, not for emotionally insecure types. The high is pretty intense, and could dominate a depressed person into existential crisis... So, go for it!! \u000a\u000aThis Gelato has great staying power. Even 30 plus in, no decrease... only escalation. Like Dark Energy. And it smells so good!! Imagine a million O&#39;s in so, as in so....ooooo good! It smells that good. Pine fuel waxy fruity diesel vapor. Heavy. Its slicky too. Faught going down my vap chamber, clinging like a chameleon.\u000a\u000aTastes beautiful in a vap. Its sophistication really shines. Smooth. It&#39;s Sour Diesel killer. And I like Sour D. But, not even close. Makes Pineapple Express seem like Purina Dog Food. The aftertaste is a mellow jet fuel icy resin tiptoe. I&#39;m not sure if relaxing is the word to describe this beautiful bud. Happy and Euphoric for sure. Beware Couch Lock! All Hail Couch Lock! \u000aBook, TV, Sex, Sun, House Cleaning, Procrastination and Avoidance... works great! No seriously.. Really stoned. Really loving it. \u000a\u000aGreat Strain. \u000aHa.

V&quot;I&#39;ve got Gelato in the air, I&#39;ve got money everywhere, this bitch blowin up my cell, broke her heart and I don&#39;t care&quot; -Young Dolph\u000a\u000aGelato. While some strains have a song or two named off of them, few have a full-length album named in its glory. But enough about Young Dolph and his love for Gelato. Lets dive into the strain \u000a\u000aFirst impressions: Shit smells delicious. Earthy, but sweet. Like a weed flavored ice cream. Incredible. \u000a\u000aThe toke: Hot damn. I&#39;ve only smoked gelato out of a small but beautifully efficient bubbler, but the toke was so, so smooth. Similar to its scent, the sweet earthy taste holds for a truly magnificent toke. \u000a\u000aThe high: There is two sides to the gelato high. Firstly, the high is rather lax, but not overpowering. It calms your nerves, gives you peace of mind, and makes you want to bump some slow, driving trap music or let your mind drift away to the complex riffs of some math rock tunes. Gelato also has a dash of euphoria, but rather than overwhelming you with a feel-good euphoric trip, it gives you a confident edge. The result is feeling like your best self, like a real G. \u000a\u000aConclusion: This strain makes you feel like Young Dolph. 5/5.

VI got some from Releaf Delivery in San Diego -- I rolled a small joint, which I smoked with myself, and within three minutes I realized it was 45 minutes later. When I got up to pee, I realized it felt better to just stay naked, so I continued to undress myself in front of the convex shower mirror and I began to dance. Not just wiggle, but really dance. From my soul. When I realized I was scaring the cat, I tried to tell him I was sorry with my mind, but I think I might have been doing it wrong because he turned and left and hasn&#39;t been back since. I honestly miss him. I went to look for him and was stopped by my neighbor&#39;s caretaker for being naked in the street. A brief chase ensued, but I lost him in a taqueria. It was the single best smelling taqueria I have ever been in, and I found myself trying to convince the man behind the counter that I would bring him money after I went home and put on pants, if he would let me take home Carne Asada. We both parted ways disappointed I think. I made it home in time for Murder She Wrote, so I ate a jar of Skippy and fell asleep on the pad. That was about 7 hours ago and I am still high as fuck.

VIllinois THC 27%. I think this is my favorite of all time. It&#39;s so pretty to look at and the effects are just outta this world. Taste great , not super harsh on the lungs. The buds are fluffy ( not at all dry) and break up with ease. It mellows you out slowly and allows you to fall asleep peacefully. I feel like this strain was customized for me. And so does the dispensary  because it&#39;s the most expensive flower they sell =( \u000aAs a side note if you are just starting out with medical cannabis. You may want to hold off on this one for a while. Because it&#39;s super strong and potent , it may be overwhelming for a newbie. But for us &quot; heavy hitters&quot; I recommend you get your hands on it as soon as you are able to.

VI\u2019ve smoked a lot of weed and this is by far the best i have ever seen/smoked. The smell is sweet and pungent with some pine and quickly takes over the room. The appearance goes from dark green to purple. The bright orange hairs stand out on the purple buds. Very potent so people will high tolerances like myself will be pleased. The taste is like a hazelnut with pine. This strain is something all potheads/stoners/Cannabis consumers need to try. 10/10 best smoke ever.

I&#39;ve never had a better tasting strain. the high is clean and clear headed and very uplifting. I have ptsd and anxiety and this is one of the few strong strains that don&#39;t trigger that. my #1 strain and I have tried many. also my favorite cookie fam strain next to it&#39;s parent sunset sherbet. perfect 50/50 strain for daytime. 10/10

VGreat strain. I don&#39;t think I would ever get tired of smoking the flower. The buds are beautiful. Dense green with deep purple and orange coloring just exploding with tricombs. Super loud smell, pungent yet fruity. This strain is perfect for both daytime and nighttime use. Depending on the amount smoked however novices be warned this is a very potent flower.

VGreat flavor on this one, starts right on the top of the tongue with a distinct flowery taste and smooths out during the exhale to give a nice pungent tone. The high gave me the well daughter after squinting effect and moved up to a dizziness for a few moments after setting back into a couch potato feeling that lasted for a good while.

VWellllll, this strain has started popping up EVERYWHERE. When I initially heard about it I was pretty excited (how could you go wrong with those genetics?).\u000a\u000aSo I bought some sap, and the stuff didn&#39;t look all that great, but it smelled nice and terpy, so I figured what the hell right? So my first experience with Gelato kind of ruined this strain for me honestly (for the time being anyway). Basically when this guy was pushing the wax, he #1: Didn&#39;t bother to dry or cure first, and #2 is that he used the wet, chlorophyll saturated FAN LEAVES to make this. \u000a\u000aNow I was having a particularly intense episode of either Gastritis or Cyclic Vomiting, and NEEDED my THC or I was a miserable, nauseated, weak, sweaty, bile-heaving wreck. This stuff.. legitimately tasted so foul and powerfully of chlorophyll, that rather than helping my nausea and vomiting, the taste of a SMALL dab would immediately trigger the vomiting it was supposed to stop.\u000a\u000aNow I have tried it multiple time since then, however, I unfortunately seem to associate the unique taste of this strain now with the taste of OVERWHELMING chlorophyll, and overall... I dunno man this particular strain just doesn&#39;t jive too well with me. However, I can for SURE see why some people absolutely love it. \u000a\u000aI personally however, find it to be somewhat of an underwhelming strain, despite the heavyweight parents. I dunno. I just can&#39;t quite dig it man.\u000a\u000aAlthough I have ONLY received this strain in dab form so far. It&#39;s VERY possible that a good flower specimen of this strain could very well change my mind. If it does, I&#39;ll leave an updated review.\u000a\u000a\u005cm/

Worked out for the first time in along time so tried it out for the lessening of the pain to follow and surprisingly had very little, so hopefully it helped.

VPicked up Gelato #45 from Herbal Relief Collective in Pacifica, CA (Nice place, by the way). Nice specimen, exactly as superior product should be described. Herb was ground and smoked from a bubbler using hemp wick. Very good Kush feeling but with less introspection; my mind feels like I&#39;m talking slow, like I&#39;m in a state of meditation. Thoughts drift in and out, I reexamine my sentence and double check the spelling of &quot;reexamine&quot;. My body feels as if there&#39;s slightly less gravity, but not any feelings of flying or in the air, like you&#39;re in a bouncy castle and no one is in there but you. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;d feel different if you were in a crowd of friends all smoking this, maybe you&#39;d all be in the bouncy castle together. Surprisingly no munchies, paranoia, or dry mouth or eyes for me. This might be an average feeling from this, or I found a very compatible strain.

VAs an everyday smoker, this strain is AMAZING.  Smells and tastes great, and it is sooo potent.  I was good after 1 bowl. It was a little too much for my hubby who doesn\u2019t smoke as much as me, so I\u2019d advise against this strain for rookies.  And i gotta say, best sex of my LIFE on this strain.

VGold Leaf reserve cartridge in IL is a premium cannabis CO2 extraction cartridge. This is a slightly more expensive oil that runs $77 for a 500ml oil tank. I think that the $12 price hike [compared to most IL oil tanks at $65] is justified because the oil is very potent. Gelato oil is a hybrid strain that feel more like an indica. There is an immediate head buzz followed by uplifting relaxation of the body and relief from invasive or persistent thoughts. The flavor is very strong mandarin orange that reminds me of canned fruit with syrup.

Vi got a oz of gelato yesterday, shipped from bay area. philly has a bunch of fake gelato goin around right now. so when i smelled it i was happy it matched everything i had been hearing about. really reminded me of orange sherbet on the smell/aroma, super pungent and deserty. The taste was slightly differnt, still had the overall &quot;sherbet&quot; flav to it but with alot more skunky/kushy/cookie funk and sharp pungent acrid lemon, one of those u wanna keep smoking just for the taste. then lump on the best high ive ever experienced.. literally. heavy powerful high that doesnt induce couchlock or sleep until you decide to lay down. if your active it will work with you, if your chilling it will chill with you lol. i am disappointed by popular strains ALOT, but this ish deserves the hype, buds are beautiful,even though my batch almost no purple in it(fine by me,purple is so 2005). berner andbthe cookie fam crew bred an all time classic, this is the next big strain joining OG Kush, Chemdawg,Sour Diesel, GSC as names everyone knows

Here goes nothing:\u000a\u000aFirst off, I love the taste. It&#39;s sweet, but not overwhlemingly so. I&#39;ve had strains like Wedding Cake and Blue Dream, and they&#39;re a bit sweeter than Gelato. But it tastes great nonetheless.\u000a\u000aThe high is sooooo relaxing. It feels similar to a dream-like state. I&#39;m super giggly and a bit too hungry for 1 AM.

VIn terms of smell it wasn&#39;t something that would ingulf your house the minute you opened the jar. It smelled almost like a sour IPA; floral but, sour/sweet. The look was pretty impressive. Light green with some dark red hairs but the best part of the appearance was; it glistens especially, when you shine a light on it. The best part of this strain was it made you feel so good! No negative thoughts or over thinking shit just, good positive thoughts and feelings. It&#39;s one of those Strains that will make you feel good about doing nothing except, watching home alone 2

VI\u2019ve had several different gelato strains over time. Currently I have banana gelato (mixed with banana kush) and mint gelato. The mint is definitely better flavor and a more cerebral high for me. I like the steady buzz and light body affects. Good for an after work pick me up. The banana is sweeter and has more indica dominant affects in my opinion.

VGelato (also referred to as &quot;Larry Bird&quot;) is a high octane sativa dominant strain. The flower is a purple tint and is covered in white trichomes. Pain releief and mood stimulation are the main effects. Although the flower is quite potent, there was no loss in mental clarity. I would recommend this strain to an individual who is looking for strong daytime pain relief.

VTrying to review every strain that I give a try. This one has me all messed up. Took two hits off a bong recently and that hit quick and quietly. All of a sudden I was inside my head just enough to know I was high. Floating around. I see why they call it Larry Bird. I do love that it&#39;s one of the most affordable strains and regardless of THC content....It gets you going. Mixing it with blackberry or blueberry strain is one of the most incredible feelings (Currently running off that for the moment) that I have gotten from smoking. It&#39;s getting me more body high and energetic, feels good as my post workout.

VI want to give this strain 6 stars...\u000aI\u2019ve enjoyed this strain through a handful of different growers and I can say without a doubt, it\u2019s one of my top 3 favorite strains of all time.\u000a\u000aBeautiful frosty dark green foliage with red hairs paired with a smell that is hard to pinpoint.  A mixture of gas, spicy sandalwood, and biscoff cookies.  Really tasty.  Sweet spicy but earthy.  Fucking addicting.  Sneezing after the nasal exhale every time. \u000a\u000aSolid indica effects.  Deep relaxation, paralyzing sleep.\u000a\u000aWhenever I see this strain I usually buy.  I\u2019ve never been disappointed

VThis is straight up fire. My favorite strain of all time. The nugs are rock dense and range in color from pink, to green, to purple, with fire orange hairs. These hard nugs give off the beautiful scent of lavender and when smoked they taste like a dessert. The thc percentage at my dispensary is 29% for this strain and it is some strong, euphoric, sedating stuff.

VI\u2019ve had several different gelato strains over time. Currently I have banana gelato (mixed with banana kush) and mint gelato. The mint is definitely better flavor and a more cerebral high for me. I like the steady buzz and light body affects. Good for an after work pick me up. The banana is sweeter and has more indica dominant affects in my opinion.

VI started my morning off terrible. Dog pissed I&#39;m the house. Everybody loud. I just woke up pissed off.......and then I smoked a blunt of some Gelato. My anxiety, attitude, and frustratation instantly gone, and I was officially on cloud 9.  This is definitely a hard hitting strain, meaning you definitely feel both sativa and indica effects.  The high isn&#39;t hard enough to lay down and be a couch potato, but the sativa effects isn&#39;t going to have you energetic. It&#39;s more of a calm relaxing high that makes you wanna just go with the flow. This is PERFECT for anxiety and I&#39;d like to say he cautious with this strain because rookie smokers can&#39;t handle this.

Vonce again this strain delivers the potent sudden hit of a great high. super uplifting, makes me feel hella positive about what I have planned today. which isn&#39;t anything much. it hits really quick, for a avid smoker I still have difficulty finishing a single bowl, and cough hard each hit. be careful with this one, can get u too buzzed and have u locked on ur butt.

VI was in market for a sativa, one that I was after was not available and I chose Gelato after hearing it rapped about by Supreme Patty.  \u000a\u000aBag appeal is nice, bids are great consistency and have a good fruity scent to it, reminds me of walking around outside a dispensary in LBC.  \u000a\u000aSmoke and taste were very nice, not an overpowering flavor out of water pipe, but subtle and nice taste with a smooth smoke.  This was grown very nicely.  \u000a\u000aThe effects were interesting.  Was my second strain of the day when I first sampled, kept me up until four am laughing, typing, listening to music.  Typical sativa response I was hoping for.  Plan on using this as a day time/early evening puff, but would be intense for a concert experience.

Vi got a oz of gelato yesterday, shipped from bay area. philly has a bunch of fake gelato goin around right now. so when i smelled it i was happy it matched everything i had been hearing about. really reminded me of orange sherbet on the smell/aroma, super pungent and deserty. The taste was slightly differnt, still had the overall &quot;sherbet&quot; flav to it but with alot more skunky/kushy/cookie funk and sharp pungent acrid lemon, one of those u wanna keep smoking just for the taste. then lump on the best high ive ever experienced.. literally. heavy powerful high that doesnt induce couchlock or sleep until you decide to lay down. if your active it will work with you, if your chilling it will chill with you lol. i am disappointed by popular strains ALOT, but this ish deserves the hype, buds are beautiful,even though my batch almost no purple in it(fine by me,purple is so 2005). berner andbthe cookie fam crew bred an all time classic, this is the next big strain joining OG Kush, Chemdawg,Sour Diesel, GSC as names everyone knows

VWow. Just...wow! \u000aMy favorite strain right now, especially when I mix it with ACDC - though it&#39;s still fantastic used alone. Combining the two creates the ultimate cerebral and body combo without any paranoia or overall &#39;oddness&#39; and I function normally with almost all of my physical pain and anxiety gone. I really hope my dispensary keeps this around for a long time, because this has been a huge, huge help and welcome addition to my regimen.

VThis definitely increases libido-almost insanely but I\u2019ve noticed that usually comes way later in the high. It really helps with my irritability. My spouse said it made me less argumentative. You just want the whole world to be happy and no negativity. The munchies were real. Definitely a keeper so I actually do best on half as much as I\u2019ve taken on other strains. Helps my fibromyalgia incredibly. Blocks depression but the deep thinking it gives you can be distracting and eventually you pass out. Definitely a winding down strain, or let\u2019s play cards against humanity game!

VI bought an 8th of this and hot damn did it leave an impression. I&#39;m writing this some six or so months later but still remember REALLY enjoying the looks, taste, smell and of course the high. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m pretty picky with strains as far as the time of day I chose to smoke them. I can&#39;t say this about a lot of strains but I loved the Larry Bird w/ my morning coffee. It was uplifting and helped me feel creative while smoking it at night, I relaxed and really enjoyed that episode of the wire. An all around perfect high

The taste was slightly differnt, still had the overall &quot;sherbet&quot; flav to it but with alot more skunky/kushy/cookie funk and sharp pungent acrid lemon, one of those u wanna keep smoking just for the taste. then lump on the best high ive ever experienced.. literally. heavy powerful high that doesnt induce couchlock or sleep until you decide to lay down. if your active it will work with you, if your chilling it will chill with you lol. i am disappointed by popular strains ALOT, but this ish deserves the hype, buds are beautiful,even though my batch almost no purple in it(fine by me,purple is so 2005). berner andbthe cookie fam crew bred an all time classic, this is the next big strain joining OG Kush, Chemdawg,Sour Diesel, GSC as names everyone knows

VWhat a wonderful strain. Smells fruity, sweet, and a bit floral. Taste is sweet, fresh, candy-like. \u000a\u000aLet&#39;s be real folks, post-industrial capitalism is a drag for many of us. In addition to any hereditary issues myself and others may have, the culture we live in seeks to destroy you if you aren&#39;t a rich fellow. It can bring you down, it can cause you to not want to move, and to enjoy life a bit less.  \u000a\u000aI have a super-academic job, so I cannot medicate at work, but for a day off work, Gelato is my go to sitting at home strain. If I have to get up and go to lunch? I can accomplish that just fine, but for the most part, I can sit at home, veg out on some Labor History movies and calm the heck down. It is a great unplug and feel good about yourself again strain. Do it to relax, or reward yourself after a little housework - I tell you that feeling adds to a high like nothing else. Gelato makes it easy to let anxiety go, it might creep up and make you stress for a second, but letting that go is easier with Gelato than with many other strains. \u000a\u000aHighly suggested.

VTo begin with, the taste of this strain is incredible. It tastes like sweet floral candy with hints of fruit at the  end of the exhale. If you&#39;re a cookies fan you&#39;ll definitely enjoy this one The buzz starts with a quick head change. It obliterates anxiousness and stress without causing any physical mind raciness. It follows with a soothing indica melt throughout the body. What I liked most about this strain is that it allowed me to feel really damn good without any overly happiness (goofiness). The taste is unique and its effects are very pleasant. If you see this strain don&#39;t hesitate to have a scoop or two of Gelato.

VVery nice terp profile, not comparable to any other cookies strain by the Cookie&#39;s fam. Thc content could be higher but I have a very high tolerance, nugs are extremely dense and packed with crystals. Would definitely buy again. High is euphoric at first but mellows out reasonably to a nice clearheaded body high, great all day smoker. Definitely worth a try if considering

VJust had the pleasure of smoking a refine distillate \u201cGelato\u201d. After 3 nice clouds my eyelids immediately felt like bricks. Today is my birthday and I have been smoking most of the day (as every other day) That being said Gelato is a treat. 75.3% THC. I am relaxed yet focused. Finnishing up last work emails and prepping for tommorow morning. (Currently 11pm). My fianc&#233; who smokes a few times a week. Took two small tokes and is sleeping like a baby.

This medical grade bud presented a stong, fruity citrus aroma, with forest green nugs sprouting orange patches covered in frost.\u000a\u000aA really heavy, but mentally focused buzz develops very quickly.

VThis is a potent strain.  I would give it 70% indica and 30% sativa.  It is the perfect after work/stress.  I have yet to try the flower, but I am using the 710 Kingpen cartridge (Winner of Best Cartridge of the SoCal Cannabis Cup 2017).  It feels like I&#39;m breathing a grape jolly rancher with a lingering citrus aftertaste.  Absolutely delicious.  You get hit by the euphoria first, then start giggling afterwards till you drift on a cloud of grape smoke.  I use it mainly for insomnia, but I also noticed it helps with muscle cramps.

VPotent hybrid strain which carries multi-flavors of aroma and is quite heavy you&#39;ll notice immediate euphoric elevation along with Indica dankness.  Quite lucky timing-wise to pick-up half zip of this dank strain prior to 4th of July Eve.   Fabulous strain to fall asleep with but mostly the flavor is outstanding!   Should you have a good taste for Girl Scout Cookie&#39;s with a hint of fruitful flavor well this is your strain.   Seldom do I rate a Top Shelf in the high 9&#39;s out of 10 however I&#39;m giving this strain a strong 9.7 out of 10. A strain you&#39;ll appreciate and never forget it&#39;s strain name.  Perfect for the 4th of July Fireworks!   Last three Top Shelf strains:  Quantum Kush, Yeigar (Purple Kush) , and Gelato.

Absolutely recommend, though may be intense for someone new.\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: My review may be irreproducible because my second Gel concentrate was taken while intoxicated by alcohol as well.

Kind of has a sweet slightly funky taste, smooth and lung filling with a pleasant exhale. The stone comes in slow but solid.

VOf all the strains I&#39;ve enjoyed, this one has the lightest, and most refreshing smoke ever. I rolled J with the Raw Black papers and expected it to get to the bitter/harsh earthy taste towards the end but to my surprise...\u000a\u000a5/5 Strain with great applications for social uses, it can make you a bit sleepy but not anymore than your usual hybrids. Good appetite booster (almost ate all my snacks), and great mood elevator.

VAmazing strain. It destroys anxiety. I had taken a tolerance break until christmas day and on christmas morning before anyone in my house woke up i went into my back yard and took a few quick snaps out of my pipe. Thinking i wasnt that high i stood up to go get some water only to find myself strolling through a winter wonderland om the way to the kitchen. By far one of my favorite christmases due to this strain. It gave a amazing clear headed high with i nice body pain relaxation while still being able to be productive.

VThe smell and look of this strain are hands down the greatest, no hyperbole. Has that rich sweet and pungent GSC scent with an undertone of skunky flowery grape and citrus. Perfect, tight nugs frosty white, purple, greens, and twisty orange hairs...even pictures don&#39;t do full justice. Effects are very similar to some balanced GSC, heavy euphoria and relaxation, no drowsiness. Smoke is very smooth as well and effects last for hours. Might be my new favorite, going back to get more.

Vdefinitely wont let you down, something you can smoke on for months and will still give you that high you want, its not really a punch like og, more like some really good grapes but stronger, ive notice, the more i smoke the higher i get, most strains i smoke dont really get me higher even though i keep on smoking. to me this strain is very easy to control on how high u want to get. if u wanna be up and going, work, or social just take a puff. the growers i get it from is from berner in sf and sac. they flushed it extremely well on this recent batch so it was very smooth. so far ive tried 41 and 45. 45 had a sweeter taste and smoother, 41 had the exotic funk taste, and packs more of a punch than 45. they both smell very creamy and skunky cheesy like. very unique smell and taste to it. if you had gelato before u will know its gelato by the smell. the high is leaning to the indica, very strong on the body with a cloudy mind. only thing i dont like is the munchies is crazzzzyyy... this stuff gets me hungry and my body is so numb so i cant even feel fullness of all the food i eat

If I were a doctor I&#39;d prescribe it for generalized anxiety, social anxieties,  stress, pain, and depression. This strain seems like a very medical plant.

A little goes a long way, and it&#39;s obviously a creeper. I recommend pairing it with a nice cup of coffee, and maybe a nice sativa (but not too strong!) to go with it.

VI took about 4 hits from a vape last night and it took me straight to heavens doors. The smell of this was unlike any weed ive had, with a mix of strong mint and fruity goodness. The high? The first 45 minutes was pretty much euphoria and smiling with my headphones on, then it left me chilling in the couch in an almost meditative and beautiful state until I went to bed

VThis is my first review, so, take it for what it\u2019s worth. I love Gelato. It\u2019s sweet, like you just walked into Wonka\u2019s Candyland. It made me very chatty and introspective about weird shit. I found myself discussing the interactive ness of chips and salsa and where it fits in the echelon of snacks for stoner munchies. Answer: Higher than cookies or chips, but nowhere near a Chinese buffet. This strain DEFINITELY brings on the munchies and it\u2019s great for pain relief as well. I have a bad shoulder that\u2019s most likely a torn rotator cuff (I just went through it with the other shoulder, that\u2019s how I know) and a couple hits off a bowl takes the pain away. So, if you need pain relief or help with a poor appetite, you may as well take this and have a super fun time getting your needs met.

VStarted hitting it for the first time ever about 45 minutes ago. Smoked about half a joint by myself. Probably 6 easy good hits. Has a bit of an earthy coffee smell and taste, balanced with sweet herbiness. Packed, dry, yet sticky green nugs with very dark red hairs throughout and plenty of tricomes. Smoked real easy from a .75g joint, finger-rolled, with one ZigZag 1.25 orange pack paper.\u000a\u000aPerfect for pain. Opens my mind and let&#39;s it RELAX  in a very mellow way. Helps me focus and create (if I want to) but doesn&#39;t make me feel like I have to and get anxious. Let&#39;s me breathe easy and laugh. Melts the stress right away. I am a big fan of indicas generally, but this really is an exceptional hybrid!

Quite lucky timing-wise to pick-up half zip of this dank strain prior to 4th of July Eve.   Fabulous strain to fall asleep with but mostly the flavor is outstanding!   Should you have a good taste for Girl Scout Cookie&#39;s with a hint of fruitful flavor well this is your strain.   Seldom do I rate a Top Shelf in the high 9&#39;s out of 10 however I&#39;m giving this strain a strong 9.7 out of 10. A strain you&#39;ll appreciate and never forget it&#39;s strain name.  Perfect for the 4th of July Fireworks!   Last three Top Shelf strains:  Quantum Kush, Yeigar (Purple Kush) , and Gelato.

VThis is a potent strain.  I would give it 70% indica and 30% sativa.  It is the perfect after work/stress.  I have yet to try the flower, but I am using the 710 Kingpen cartridge (Winner of Best Cartridge of the SoCal Cannabis Cup 2017).  It feels like I&#39;m breathing a grape jolly rancher with a lingering citrus aftertaste.  Absolutely delicious.  You get hit by the euphoria first, then start giggling afterwards till you drift on a cloud of grape smoke.  I use it mainly for insomnia, but I also noticed it helps with muscle cramps.

VGreat strain. Nice smooth flavor. If you suffer from Fibromyalgia or Chronic pain use small doses well spaced. Otherwise when the high kicks in and collides with your pain it will topple you. If you are one who can taste EVERYTHING I don&#39;t suggest any wrap that has an alcohol taste as that will linger well beyond acceptable after taste. I feel like my vision is being squeezed into a vintage filter.

VJust had the pleasure of smoking a refine distillate \u201cGelato\u201d. After 3 nice clouds my eyelids immediately felt like bricks. Today is my birthday and I have been smoking most of the day (as every other day) That being said Gelato is a treat. 75.3% THC. I am relaxed yet focused. Finnishing up last work emails and prepping for tommorow morning. (Currently 11pm). My fianc&#233; who smokes a few times a week. Took two small tokes and is sleeping like a baby.

VVery nice terp profile, not comparable to any other cookies strain by the Cookie&#39;s fam. Thc content could be higher but I have a very high tolerance, nugs are extremely dense and packed with crystals. Would definitely buy again. High is euphoric at first but mellows out reasonably to a nice clearheaded body high, great all day smoker. Definitely worth a try if considering

VMy first experience smoking in probably 12 years. Went to the Dispensary here in San Diego and bought 1 g of Sativa, one of Indica and one hybrid. Decided to start with the Gelato. \u000a\u000aHaving to little or no Comprehension of the potency of modern marijuana, I smoked a whole bowl to myself. Good Lord. I could have taken one hit and been fine. The resulting experience wasn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d just incredibly intense. Brought up super intense emotional baggage, fears, doubts, which I could look at and process and let go. Very stoned, I texted myself, \u201c there is so much bullshit I carry around in my head that I can pack up like boxes and move out.\u201d \u000a\u000aI was waaay too stoned to be around other people and was totally overwhelmed for the first hour or so. Then I realize that I could just as easily shift my thoughts into beautiful affirmations and change my mood entirely. Which I did. Then I started listening to Led Zeppelin, which brought me to tears as I marveled at the beauty of human beings creating music to communicate with one another. I could see not only the actual music appearing as color and emotion, But also I was aware of the lives of the human beings who made the music and all of their experience that was bringing us together. \u000a\u000aLater i started to journal and had some amazing insights into relationships in my life. I also texted myself, \u201c interactions with things illuminates me\u201d which I found beautiful. \u000a\u000aOverall my body felt very relaxed, heavy, soft, strange and foreign. For a long time I hardly moved. \u000a\u000aIncredibly potent. But, of course, I am brand new to the effects of THC. Next time I will def start with a lower dose but this was an incredible, moving experience.

This medical grade bud presented a stong, fruity citrus aroma, with forest green nugs sprouting orange patches covered in frost.\u000a\u000aA really heavy, but mentally focused buzz develops very quickly.

This immediately made me excited to try it.\u000a\u000aAfter my 1st joint, I felt very uplifted and creative for about 30 minutes. After doing some writing, I started to feel heavy and very relaxed to the point I wanted to grab some food and put on a good movie. I have a very high tolerance but I really did appreciate this strain. The effects listed on Leafly were quite accurate to the effects I felt. \u000a\u000aI look forward to getting more Gelato when I want to hike, do some fishing, or get into a good book. I&#39;d recommend this strain to anyone that had a long day at work or wants a very euphoric smoke break.

VI got the kingpin cartridge. It\u2019s light and tasty. It is very mellow, and allows you to function in public. I was at a family event and would take a hit every time I went to the bathroom. I don\u2019t think anyone could tell I was high. The kingpin cartridge isn\u2019t very strong as far as the high goes, but the smoking experience was pleasant.

Let&#39;s start and say it is a very earthy taste,  and when they say it hits, campare ut ti Mike Tyson hitting you. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I wouldn&#39;t recommend smoking this and going anywhere. To me it was very strong. I might say a bit too strong for my taste.

VShut up. Just stop looking. This is THE strain for me. The miracle and frustration of the science of this plant is that it treats everyone differently. \u000aThat said, if you are a professional smoker. This will treat you right. For me, it\u2019s best for indoor use only. I\u2019m not doing anything but being with me. Excellent for depression, anxiety and sore muscles (back pain).

VAwesome strain. Vaped. Immediately can feel that this is a heavy leaning Indica Hybrid. Taste sweet but not overpowering and with a slight banana taste. Definitely will have you super relaxed but also able to carry a conversation. I vaped this a lot while watching Game of Thrones and I caught myself not being able to focus at times. Could have been that I was sleepy along with the high though. Overall a 5 Star Strain and will put this in my top 5 right now.

VBeing a fan of either really pungent or really tasty cannabis, Gelato is my favorite in a vape for an Indica. The smell from the flower isn&#39;t as pungent as the taste, but that taste is delicious. In a vape, most cannabis flower tends to get the obvious &quot;roasted&quot; flavor towards the end of the vaping session. Gelato on the other hand seems to retain the flavor longer compared to anything else I&#39;ve tried and doesn&#39;t quite taste &quot;roasted&quot;. I&#39;m convinced this is due to the genetics as I keep my flowers secured in a humidor.\u000a\u000aThe flowers were seeming fluffy, but dense, covered in a thick sheet of trichomes, sticky, and mostly large size buds. The flowers were lightly colored for the most part, and some hairs, but colors are not always consistent for me on repeat strains.\u000a\u000aMy final comments are that it&#39;s a great sleep aid and tastes wonderful. The taste alone will leave you feeling uplifted.

VI\u2019ve tried Gelato exactly one time, but it would be a sad day if I couldn\u2019t find this strain again.  This is by far the best hybrid I\u2019ve ever had.  I don\u2019t know if this is a trait of high quality weed, but the Gelato I smoked burned slow and it was so smooth that it really didn\u2019t feel like I was smoking at all.  Right out of the bag, this smells like pineapple with a side of Boston cr&#232;me donuts.  It tastes like carmel or fresh baked cookies.  One constant was that the smoke was so smooth that it felt like I was actually exhaling gelato. I was relaxed and it really cleared my head.  Noticeable cotton-mouth.  Laughed my ass off especially reading other reviews thinking \u201cyeah\u2026that happens to me too\u201d.  \u000aI\u2019d recommend this to everyone this Thanksgiving to melt away family stress.

VPreviously reviewed with the concentrate vaporized in a Plume cartridge,now reviewing under the flower form: This strain is great,powerful smell and flavor.The appearance is a little funky,but not too funky.Don&#39;t let the appearance fool you though,this strain will put you out.On the nose I get gasoline,black licorice,and berries.On the palate I get earthy herbs,berries,and desert cakes.The taste and smell of Gelato is pretty complex,which makes it one of my top 10 favorite strains.I like it because it is different than your typical sativas,indicas,and even hybrids.It has it&#39;s own look,smell,and taste,which is why I love Gelato

VAmazing strain!!!! I&#39;m a huge fan of the Cookie family and i finally got a hold of Gelato and let me start by saying this bud smells just as it&#39;s described. In terms of effects it comes on real relaxing and then it hits you the euphoria! Great for day and night in my opinion

VA lovely strain! It&#39;s a real crowd-pleaser and gives a very social high. I like it for when I&#39;m hanging out and casually smoking with friends who don&#39;t smoke much. I wouldn&#39;t call it a connoisseur&#39;s high and if I want to have a solo sesh where I just really focus on the experience, this isn&#39;t the one I reach for, but it&#39;s definitely a very nice strain and one of my friends who doesn&#39;t smoke much asked me for the name of the strain so she could write it down because she liked it so much!

My cocker spaniel and Pekingese are there snuggled next to me as we head towards the Caribbean island where I reside.\u000a\u000aI was able to converse and Netflix and chill. No depression, no pain nothing but happiness.  The vapor was so fresh, and flavorful. From the pipe even better.

VThis just might be the perfect strain, I kid you not. The nugs are fairly dense and full of red pistils. The Thc content was a whopping 25%, but the high was mellow af. It makes you giggly, amorous, and all around happy. It&#39;s a strain that makes you feel good about yourself and the world. Can&#39;t recommend highly enough

VGelato is an exceptional strain, it totally mellows you out and just makes you feel great while still a heavy hitter. I\u2019m finally toking on the 710 Kingpen of Gelato and I\u2019m just amazed. Totally happy and euphoric in a way yet a very very smooth high that literally tastes like skittles in a way and makes you feel very good lol. I took two puffs off that tank and am feeling extremely great! I\u2019d totally have to say this is best for Anxiety, Depression, Paranoia, Bi-Polar (as it helps mine). It just totally mellows you out.....9/10 easily for me if not 10/10 these Kingpens rock! Enjoy my friends you won\u2019t be displeased.
