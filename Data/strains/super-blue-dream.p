VThis is my &quot;Get SH*T done!&quot; weed. The first couple times I smoked it, I didn&#39;t think I was high. But then I realized it was very Sativa dominant and I was more focused and energized rather then &quot;Stuck&quot; like I get when I stick with my Indica varieties. If I&#39;m looking to relax and feel euphoric, this wouldn&#39;t be my go to. But man when I&#39;ve got some work to do, this is my go to.

VThis is a heavy Indica hybrid giving you the affects of an Indica when the mind clarity of a sativa. It is light and fluffy with a relatively smooth grape/berry flavor and smell. The high is long lasting with heavy heady and bod affects. testing at 27% THC, overall a pretty good higher shelf strain.

VI&#39;m pretty blown away by this strain, which I wasn&#39;t expecting since I picked up as a $35 eighth. \u000a\u000aThough my medical use isn&#39;t as serious as someone dealing with severe pain or seizures, I do suffer from acute anxiety companied by depression. Through therapy and meditation, I&#39;ve been able to make it through the day while at work or school with minimal problems, but when I&#39;m idle or at home, my anxiety ratchets up pretty quickly. For me, this strain is incredible at dealing with this at idle anxiety. \u000a\u000aAs far as consumption goes, I&#39;m typically either using a Dynavap or a Boundless CFC vaporizer using .05 to .1 grams in a typical session. Immediately effects are present with a slight behind the eyes push, within in minutes after inhaling the lightly-sweet and earl-grey tasting vapors a calm and mellow sense of relief runs through my body quelling my nervous ticks and easing my anxious mind into the present.\u000a\u000aThe only real con that comes to mind is slight dry mouth, but that&#39;s easily fixed by having grapes in one hand and a bottle of water in the other.

VPicked up 14 grams for $55 at a local dispensary. Expected it to be just another mid-shelf strain. After about a bowl and a half I was extremely head high accompanied by a slight body high. Ended up smoking the whole quarter in about 5 days. Went back the day I ran out to buy an OZ. Ran me $100. DANK BUD! Thats all I can say. I spend $12-15 a gram and don&#39;t even find bud like this. So if you ever find a well grown batch pick it up. Toke it up. Enjoy! :)

VBeautiful budd. I smoked a bowl of this before working out &amp; I felt amazing during &amp; after my session. I intended to work out only an hour &amp; wound up pushing a lil over 2 hours. This budd relaxed my body enough to allow me to push myself, while also giving me energy, and get my creativity flowing as I improvised my workout. It&#39;s lovely to smoke in the daytime &amp; be outside. Definitely felt giddy ~30 min into my high &amp; whenever I was talking to people, I couldn&#39;t stop smiling. However, smoking in the nite, the munchies hit like a bitch, so be prepared. Overall.. Splendid budd &amp; even better&#39;n Blue Dream imo.

VI&#39;m not digging this one.  Took a rip, waited a bit, felt kinda heady with just a little but of anxiety.  About 1/2 later feeling good so I had two more little hits from the pipe and got a bit more lifted.  Got tired and decided to crash, but as soon as I lay down, I had racing thoughts, images coming at 100mph, every muscle in my body was throbbing and electric and I had trouble piecing my thoughts together.  I medicate for anxiety, by I heard this was gentle for an sativa-dominant strain... well, apparently I just need to avoid sativa altogether because this strain had me pacing around at 2am unable to sleep at all.  Eventually I toked some ACDC and calmed down and was able to sleep.  Altogether, great for a really active high, not so great for anxiety.

It&#39;ll give you couch lock if you smoke more then the typical &quot;gotta go do stuff so a couple hits only&quot;. If you Vape, you&#39;ll love it. Awesome flavor and strong high. Critical couch lock. I found it last week at the green element in Carson, Ca. Went back this week for more but they were sold out. If you run across it, try it out.

VPerhaps the particular batch I tried (Alhambra, CA) was more Super Silver Haze than Blue Dream.\u000a\u000aAlthough it was a great daytime, stimulating yet relaxing Sativa (which is what I always need personally), the taste/smell was not the sweet blueberry of blue dream others experienced. \u000a\u000aIt was more like the damp prairie grass smell of super silver haze. \u000a\u000aCall me a girly girl, but I want my pot to taste and smell like tangerines, or pineapple, or a jade citrus forest. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the skunk mixing with the sweetness that makes it taste like the shwag I smoked back in high school. \u000a\u000aMental/physical/emotional effects- 5 stars\u000a\u000aTaste/smell- 1 star.\u000a\u000aOverall- 3 stars(:\u000a

VA.K.A Beyond Blue Dream. This strain tastes a little similar to its parent strain. The high is intense. Happy, energetic, euphoric. For me, regular blue dream will do just fine. At times the come down from this left me sleepy, yawning and all. Over smoke and you will not be able to function and or speak properly. Overall, recommended for experienced smokers. Great for daytime activities.

The best thing about this strain is that all you need is a small amount now and then to get a really good high. Smoke it, and it will take control of your entire body.

VAll time favorite strain. Absolutely delicious citrus and blueberry flavor; very clean, non-earthy. An amazing cerebral high with a low body high that is a powerful painkiller. Always has me grinning and giggling like a fool! Works verry well for boting boosting creativity!

VI&#39;m reviewing a Cartridge made by : Bhang  the testing info is ; CBD - 0.22%  THC - 81.2 %  \u000aMyrcene 1.209 mg/g \u000aCaryophylene 1.067 mg/g\u000aLinalool 0.996 mg/g\u000a\u000aIt has a decent taste , but the effects are pretty darn good for a vape pen oil ! &#128526;&#128076;&#127996; I use it in the daytime , when I&#39;m out and about !  It seriously did the job yesterday - I was feeling fine ! \u000a\u000aWill definitely try out more Bhang cartridges in the Future &#128077;&#127996;&#128077;&#127996;

VI am not an experienced user by any means, but this strain makes me feel really positive and relaxed, like all of life&#39;s concerns instantly melt away, without feeling out of control. If you just have a little bit, you feel motivated and energized to do chores lol. Have more and it will put you to sleep. So be careful with the dosage!

VI picked this up last and was very pleased with the high. The buds had a great aroma and flavor. The high was mellow yet energetic. It&#39;ll give you couch lock if you smoke more then the typical &quot;gotta go do stuff so a couple hits only&quot;. If you Vape, you&#39;ll love it. Awesome flavor and strong high. Critical couch lock. I found it last week at the green element in Carson, Ca. Went back this week for more but they were sold out. If you run across it, try it out.

VSuper Silver Haze was crossed with Blueberry to create this fun and potent hybrid. Super Blue Dream is fast-acting and known for creating head-heavy effects. Taking after its sativa heritage, this strain is energizing and great for daytime use. While Super Blue Dream is powerful, it still allows you to focus and get things done. Similar to its relative, Blue Dream, Super Blue Dream features a sour blueberry aroma.
