VI have tried this variety and so far enjoyed it.  The flowers are dense, dark with orange hairs and very sticky. It has a sharp scent that to me is of citrus with a hint of skunk.  Smoking it was pleasant and I found it gentle on my lungs.  It does produce very milky smoke and it kept a fruity taste finishing with a hint of pepper.  \u000a\u000aEffects took a few moments to become therapeutic.   It resulted in relaxation and moderate pain relief.  More effective than narcotics for my medical condition (RSD). In small doses sedation wasn&#39;t too heavy for me. By adding just a bit more and it does help my insomnia significantly. \u000a\u000a\u000aMy portion was very dense almost like sponge. I had to clean it out my grinder with a toothpick.\u000a\u000aOverall solid flower.

V\u2022 there aren&#39;t many pure indicas that I will smoke or vape all day... except for (Advanced Grow Labs&#39;) *Afghooey* \u2014 a pure cannibis vaping oil that clocks-in at a whopping 81% thc, while I&#39;ve never seen such an impressively complex terpenes-profile (w/such high levels OF said-terps!) \u2022 &#128076;&#127995; \u000a\u2022 Sweet, delicious, intense flavor &amp; 007-smooth, welcome + delightful inhalation of blessed-euphoria immediately blankets my body, brightens my outlook &amp; lifts my spirit. (If I&#39;ve got a project or deadline requiring immediacy, I&#39;ll often pair with (sativa) Sour Tangie for amazing &#128293; taste/senses-overload! ;) \u2022  This is a TRUE &amp; deserved 5 \u2b50\ufe0f-strain, which I HIGHLY recommend for any &amp; all medicinal tokers-alike, but obv newbies should start slow, or if able, try a lower thc-content&#39;d oil|bud, so as not to miss out! \u2022  Better-still is if Afghooey was Required-Smoking for each &amp; every human on the &#127758; \u2014 the world would be a MUCH kinder, gentler place! Love \u2764\ufe0f yourself some Afghooey &amp; do YOUR part for peace \u270c&#127997; \u2022

VI found this strain to be a nice surprise for my evening after a long days work.  Sitting back, relaxing and able to function and was in a creative state to where I began to write a couple of poems for my journal.  Highly recommend.  Also was able to function during the day, when I reduced my dosage to be able to function at work.  Pick up at Yavapai Herbal in Cottonwood, My favorite place.

VPicked up an 1/8 of Afgooey from Foothill Wellness Center. Great, super friendly staff. Good buds. Nice flowery smell on  inhale, piney lemony on exhale. Not really great tasting smoke. Great high for me though. Relaxing,little face melting,but definitely feel the Sativa in it. Giggly,talkative, (i can be painfully shy...and I have been using MMJ for a little over a year.This is my first review...so yeah really helps with social anxiety,lol) Can still &quot;get stuff done&quot; but easy to lose focus and some mental jamming.

They just intensify over time.\u000a\u000aEffects last 2-3 hours depending on dosage.

VThis strain has a very odd texture, it&#39;s sticky but very loose and plyable at the same time. It gives off a very fruity almost spicy flavor, and the aroma is pretty unique. The bud itself was very light and fluffy, with plenty of orange hairs. The high really went to town on me. I had literal couch lock for a good 3 hours. The whole time I had very very trippy visions, and my vision was very distorted. I personally wouldn&#39;t want to try and hit the city messed up on this. It&#39;s definatly a hard hitting strain (at least through my bong). If you&#39;re looking for a good old knock-out strain, this is the one for you. Overall, I give it a 9.

VI knew a guy who lived in So. Cal. 3 months out of the year just for Prop 215 and this strain, Afghooey, Afgoo whatever you wanna call it. It is sticky as fuck, can stick it to a pane of glass. It has really tight buds, the first time I got it there were some colas but this time it was mostly the bottom-of-the-pound shake. This strain has so much THC it just falls off, I use a razor blade to cut up my bowls so I don&#39;t lose too many trichromes. Afgoo makes you twisted, not as noticeable as trainwreck but that can be a good thing.

VI came across a strain simply &quot;AF-crack&quot; , obviously is afgoo x green crack. This one really surprised me, I was given a nice amount and at first was gonna say thank you then when my buddy left toss it. Well I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t! The person i got this from id view as &quot;master grower&quot;(25 years of grows and I don&#39;t consider myself a master) so I took another look. The buds were super super dense and frosted almost like a platinum cookies or the white. I personally hate gc by itself but crossed with afgoo it&#39;s a damn fine cut. For sure felt waaaay more indica then sativa but felt both. The smell , taste and the super smooth smoke makes this one of my new favs. Like I always say , my review is based on flowers that I know have been grown Rht (clean green , etc) and from someone I trust. At the dispensaries you have no clue who or how the bud was grown. Anyways it&#39;s a solid a 8.5 , I&#39;d love to hear from anyone else who has tried this

VThe strain of Afghooey I have is extremely potent. A small bowl smoked out of a glass spoon it gives me a nice slightly upbeat high but with defined body effects, but a small bowl out of a a double perc bong was way too intense for me. It gave me a good amount of paranoia and my anxiety levels were through the roof for a good 2 hours. Be careful with this if you have anxiety issues.

VAfgooey delivers deep, muscle-melting relaxation, together with a giddy, giggly, low-stress euphoric high. A wonderful mixture of uplifting (but not energetic) and mellow (but not couch-locked) properties. This one is probably my #1 personal favorite.

VThe strain of Afghooey I have is extremely potent. A small bowl smoked out of a glass spoon it gives me a nice slightly upbeat high but with defined body effects, but a small bowl out of a a double perc bong was way too intense for me. It gave me a good amount of paranoia and my anxiety levels were through the roof for a good 2 hours. Be careful with this if you have anxiety issues.

VVery good yield in scrog. It is growing fat, rock-hard buds covered in resin.  When smoked , it made me talkative, hungry and very relaxed. Be warned....it&#39;s not recomanded as a daytime smoke for it will leave you couchlocked and sleepy . It also can make dizzy and confused if you smoke too much.

VA bit too overwhelming for me. I picked up an 8th of this from a dispensary in Humboldt and it was seriously some of the strongest Indica based Cannabis I&#39;ve ever had. It put me out like a light. Even if I had a small bowl I would be very tired... I appreciate this effect as I do have trouble sleeping at night, but I only had this strain at the time and it made smoking and enjoying the day time almost impossible.

VI came across a strain simply &quot;AF-crack&quot; , obviously is afgoo x green crack. This one really surprised me, I was given a nice amount and at first was gonna say thank you then when my buddy left toss it. Well I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t! The person i got this from id view as &quot;master grower&quot;(25 years of grows and I don&#39;t consider myself a master) so I took another look. The buds were super super dense and frosted almost like a platinum cookies or the white. I personally hate gc by itself but crossed with afgoo it&#39;s a damn fine cut. For sure felt waaaay more indica then sativa but felt both. The smell , taste and the super smooth smoke makes this one of my new favs. Like I always say , my review is based on flowers that I know have been grown Rht (clean green , etc) and from someone I trust. At the dispensaries you have no clue who or how the bud was grown. Anyways it&#39;s a solid a 8.5 , I&#39;d love to hear from anyone else who has tried this

VI really like Afgooey.  My caregiver knows that I&#39;m big on taste, if I can&#39;t tolerate it, I won&#39;t medicate with it.  For me there&#39;s nothing worse than a harsh hitting med when I&#39;m already in pain.  I would recommend this to people like me who prefer smooth hitting meds that do the job right!  The overall smell, taste and effect is well worth trying if you haven&#39;t already.

VThe piney, vegetal fragrance is excellent and tastes the same; very pleasant. I don&#39;t find this to have the sedative effect others have described. In fact, this is my preferred daytime strain - I make my tincture from it. I have fibro and this produces a really strong body high that relieves pain but doesn&#39;t leave me feeling &#39;stoned&#39; at all. As a mom who has to function through myriad everyday activities, this is precisely what I want.

Vmy fellow service/retail employees; meet the answer to your end-of-day aches! At the time of writing this review, it is mere days to Xmas and my feet are two lumps of pain from working extra-long shifts. \u000a\u000atoday has been the best day off in ages; feet are completely pain-free.\u000ain small amounts you&#39;re just relaxed and all pains are dulled, but it didn&#39;t make me inarticulate or too sleepy.\u000a\u000alarger amounts, (a whole joint to yourself, in one go) will give you a nice, floaty body high, like you&#39;re floating on happy little clouds, and any aches or pains are a distant memory.\u000a\u000adry mouth and eyes are pretty noticeable, pretty quickly.

Best for evenings when relaxing but not intending to sleep.\u000a\u000aAlso, it really is gooey. Whenever I smoke this strain, I have to clean the Pax immediately afterwards.

Vthis strain was an absolute lifesaver a few months ago! got a pretty serious injury (bruised tailbone, 15 stitches in hand and arm) that kept me out of work for about three weeks, and the painkillers they gave me left me still debilitated at half dose and puking at full. i&#39;d never tried to use weed medicinally before. it chilled me out a bunch, which was helpful given how miserable the shock and subsequent stircrazies were making me, and gave me this really pleasant, really heavy feeling body high that helped me take some of the choicest naps i think anyone ever has\u000a\u000ai still wound up having to use half-doses now and then of my Big Pharma Junk to do certain tasks. the head high with this is pretty intense, making you a little zombied out, and i would find myself having some trouble balancing not hurting and not zonking out and not moving for hours and hours. but! it should be noted that im not a regular smoker, and my injury was incredibly painful, so im sure ppl more used to being human while high and those with smaller aches would be just fine! additionally, being a little buzzed while medicating with pills helped with the bad symptoms (nausea, depression) they were giving me.

VGlorious strain. Picked up a 1/4 today based off what leafly has said about the effects from weeds in Victoria, BC. After a bong hit a wave of euphoria hits you in the head and goes throughout your entire body, followed by intense feelings of relaxations. This weed works as a good nighttime strain, I&#39;m about to go to sleep after another bowl and am good and ready, even with bad insomnia generally. Playing videogames with some friends I was giggling like an idiot, Afgooey definitely will make you look stoned and giggle like a stoner when messing around with friends. Buds smell predominantly of tea with hints of pine, when busted up it smells extremely sweet. Flavors reflect scent. Amazing, heavy indica that I highly recommend and will make me an excellent staple strain in the future.

VLove what is strain can do to calm the nerves, relax the body, mind and SLEEP!  It doesn&#39;t put my head into a tail spin like stronger Indicas.  For me it&#39;s just right.  Vaping gives off hints of pine and wood.  And at times it can get a bit harsh.  All good in my book.  Highly recommend.

For me there&#39;s nothing worse than a harsh hitting med when I&#39;m already in pain.  I would recommend this to people like me who prefer smooth hitting meds that do the job right!

VI have to review this strain because it&#39;s the closest thing to Bart Simpson OG - which is what I&#39;m smoking now but Leafly doesn&#39;t have BSO listed.  \u000a\u000aAnyway, holy fuck this is a heavy hitter!  It&#39;s 23.8% THC and the sugar is thick.  This gets me mentally pumped like a fire Sativa but glues me down like a heavy Indica.  I&#39;m watching The Fog and its been a badass Halloween.  Just give this strain a try: either Afgooey or Bart Simpson OG or both.  You&#39;ll fucking experience truly powerful medicine.  There&#39;s some bad to it because it fires up my Pure-O but it doesn&#39;t fan the flames too badly.  I&#39;ve giggled and spaced out for the last 20 minutes.  I&#39;ll finish the movie and the leftover candy and be in dreamland eventually.  Peace hoes.

Left me hallucinating and seeing stars with slight panic for a minute, but nothing major. Caused me to space out more than once and sometimes couldn&#39;t keep myself from laughing. Ensures for a good night&#39;s sleep, though not a go-to for insomnia for me, which would be blue dream or gumbo. So happy to have plenty of big frosty nugs left of this!! A recommended strain for moderate patients who want a thrill, or a great choice for an every-day person. Might make lightweights trip and panic tho lol

VI\u2019m not a fan of Woody scents and flavors, but the quality of the high this strain gives doesn\u2019t disappoint. Although the smell and taste are mild and woody, Afgooey gave me a slow climbing heavy high in both mind and body but mainly body. Great bedtime bud. Very sticky buds similar to gorilla glue, hence its nick name \u201cSticky OG\u201d\u000a\u000aFor smokers who like a mild yet satisfying high to cap the night off and provide a good nights rest: AFGOOEY

VAfgooey has been around for sometime now and I have enjoyed this time throughly. A very strong smoke that can easily take your breath away when smoked through a bong in flower form. Much like that of dabbing oils. Not recommended for newbie smokers. A very strong hybrid that has a sour hashy flavor with hints of menthol and grape. One of the few strains that is both sticky and oily. Day or night, enjoy this strain wisely. Makes very resinous flowers when grown outdoors. One of the best in history in my opinion.

VThis medication tends to be more of a relaxing high for me. When I open my jar, I am met with a pungent aroma. The first pull from the unlit joint provides sweet berry like flavors. After a slow smooth inhale you are once again presented with the berry flavor on the exhale.  The medication comes on gently allowing you to enjoy the onset of relief.  Once everything is in full effect just kick back and soak up the moment, or get busy with a complex project.

VI\u2019m a new marijuana user and while I\u2019d recommend this strain for a seasoned expert, I would advise noobs to stay away for awhile! After 3 hits from my pipe I was nauseated and my chest tightened painfully. At first, I thought my body was rejecting it and just as I said \u201cThis was a bad idea,\u201d the fun part kicked in. Jello Legs, slackjaw, heavy eyelids, and lots of laughs. Followed by a bizarre paranoia and memory lapse spiral that lasted about 40 minutes, though it felt like no time had gone by. My previous smoke experience was with year-plus old weed from an iffy source, and this AF Gooey was fresh and way stronger than I expected. VERY powerful stuff \u2014 and by the way, I\u2019ve enjoyed it quite a few times since then with similar effects. It\u2019s amazing for pain of all types, and highly recommended if you have a patient friend or SO to help keep you from being too paranoid. Try it, but tread lightly!

VI&#39;d give it 4.25 stars. It&#39;s nice and potent, with a slight grape-y taste. It seems to work pretty well for stomach cramps and anxiety, with a slight lingering euphoric haze and giggly state.

VThis was my first time smoking weed.  This was a great strain to start with.  Very smooth, tasty and a really enjoyable high.  Only draw back was I was paranoid as hell (probably because it was my first time).  My gf was super relaxed more than I was.  Again great strain and would differently try it again.

Vsmoked a j of it when I first got it from my delivery service.  That was a big mistake, it made me paranoid.  Barely could feel my body which makes me more paranoid, all I could feel was my heart racing.  This paranoid sensation lasted for over an hour despite trying to walk it out in my house and backyard and trying to focus on long easy breaths.  If it wasn&#39;t for the paranoia I would love it the body high.  Also had bad dry mouth.

Vi  acquired this strain  from a grower we will call proffesor afghani . the bag it came in had a tie which said organically grown  and i was very impressed out of the ten plus pounds i got of this stuff all the buds were some of the most beautiful i have ever seen  purples blues and reds  covered the buds  some of the buds were even blueish purple and very  very light green  very nice smoke  smooth fruity  and sticky was hard to smoke a joint which is my preferred method  so i kinda passed this strain around and everyone loved it  including a family member who was battling cancer  at the time .  very nice organically grown stuff  clean smoke ..  great for pain and anxiety ..  sadly i only smoked this strain once  but i hope this helps someone somewhere  novice or veteran
