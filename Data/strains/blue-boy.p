VI&#39;m trying some outdoor grown in BC Canada. nice buds, brownish colour. smells earthy with hints of berry and mint.\u000anorthern lights is a personal favorite of mine, this definitely takes after its parent with a fruitier, mintier flavour. \u000aI&#39;d grab again! indoor or outdoor

VI&#39;m very relaxed, nice mellow body high.  I especially appreciate how I feel my muscles just sort of melting into relaxation.  This helps a lot with my back pain in that sense (because it&#39;s musco-skeletal tension).  \u000a\u000aThe first time I smoked it and I got a bit anxious.  Just a couple solid puffs.  I generally vaporize my herb.  Vaping it, I don&#39;t feel anxious.\u000a\u000aI have brutal cotton mouth.

VMy favorite strain is Blue Dream so I was excited when I got the chance to smoke this! Northern Lights is a good strain too.. I just feel a little anxious when the high started but I was already high on a top indica strain for a sleep aid so that could&#39;ve been the reason but by far I say the cross breed names should rate itself&#128168;

VWhat a unique and special strain! In some ways, this strain is more Sativa-like than many pure Sativa&#39;s because the high is so cerebral, creative, happy, sociable, talkative; and, because the corresponding body high is so minimal: No discernable sleepiness, heaviness, or inertia. I can be productive and focused if I need to be, or playful and creative (which is what I generally roll with).   This magical herb I smoked -- from RedwoodRoots Family -- provided a high with a relatively short life compared to most strains, and gradual, lovely come-down. Perfect for a social occasions and creative activities. 22.38% THC.

VGreat strain. Has a relaxed, laid back feel with subtle hints of creative, cerebral sensations. Makes you happy. The high isn&#39;t very strong when it hits you. You sort of glide into it without really noticing at first. I think this is an okay strain to use before bed. Very relaxing.

Vgood hybrid, but maybe not as classic as Snoops dream? Definitely got a few chuckles this time, and some energy. However, didn&#39;t get as much pain relief as last time. solid 4.5 strain. Not sure I&#39;d be looking to pay a premium price for it. unless somehow I&#39;m saving sea creatures by smoking it.

Vi purchased this looking for an easy-smoking sleep aid/pain relief. it provided both of these things without an overly intense body high, which i also appreciated. while i did wake the next morning with a headache, it is too early in my use of this strain to draw a definite link.

VNot a super big fan of this one. Like others said it gave me a killer headache and terrible red eyes. The initial 15-20 minutes gave me terrible anxiety to the point of having panic attacks. After trying it a couple more times they stopped but at first it was terrible. But I&#39;m more prone to anxiety with certain strands, so anyone else might love it, it just wasn&#39;t me favorite.

VWOW! What a most on usual and sensational strain, from the taste, to the next few hours.  Best Yet. \u000a\u000aNo matter what the strain I was always left ready to sack out at the end of the high, the strain gives me so much energy and doesn\u2019t leave me feeling tired at all. It seems like you can control your mind or let your imagination run away so we can be a wicked heavy high like a cerebral high or a highly functioning high like for work. Super creative!
