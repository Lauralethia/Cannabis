VOveral, extremely satisfied my senses.  A bountiful earthy aroma , followed by a Rose , pine intake and surprisingly gentle moist exhale.  \u000aA body high , that blanketed 97% of my surface.  The frontal lobe was left open, almost uninhabitable. Free to divulge in the herbs euphoric, stress free melodic vibe.  \u000aSubsequently , I was A pain free, horizontal, snack devouring  robot .  Able to mentally obtain  information. Then instantly dissect said information, in such a way that I only retained pertinent subject matter.  Uplifting , useful knowledge that was directly correspondent within the framework  of the makings of a great day.  \u000a\u000a*Then it wore off, leaving me a puddle of a human.   A step absolve useless.  SO I GOT MORE!\u000a&quot;The healing of a nation , through IRIE meditation &quot;.\u000a\u000aBless

V\u000a White OG - a true disconnector of reality...\u000a There&#39;s an unspoken sensation/topic of discussion of how you currently feel in the present now based on your environment... Well, that feeling comes and goes with this strain... You feel you&#39;re in your bubble and then bam, ur back to the feeling of your surroundings. \u000aIt&#39;s crazy good because this strain also has a happy inclination to it, making you disconnect from reality in such a pleasant-happy way. \u000aFew hits does the trick...

If you wanna go to sleep on it just smoke a little more.Otherwise this beautifully frosted bud will let you get anything done.Beginners take it easy with this one or you will be on the coach passed out.(I witnessed this happen to someone who said they could &quot;hang&quot;).I recomend you buy white og anytime you see it.You will not be disappointed!

VMy first shot at this strain was vaping (wax), and I was actually expecting a sativa... But my initial disappointment turned to a deep appreciation of this White OG.  \u000a\u000aIn short, this is what Indica should be.  You have control.  You can function if you want, or you can veg if you want, but if you cross the line and smoke too much, the indica will have its way with you, haha.  I would go so far as to say that if you want an indica that you can smoke here and there throughout the day, this is it. Just respect the limits of it, cause it\u2019s a cliff.

VVery nice, very dreamy and relaxed indica. Great appearance, with buds ranging from stubby tight nugs to looser, longer, &#39;fingers&#39;. Emerald green with a white patina. \u000a\u000aThe smell is very sour, citrusy and pervasive, though not as all-encompassing as other strains. The taste though is absolutely delicious - far from the earthy tones described here, I get a mild and creamy hit of candy, with a gentle sour finish. Rests beautifully on the tongue. The vapor through the Plenty vaorizer is smooth and thick, and lasts ages. Only complaint is that at higher temps the vapor tickled the throat, but a whip sorted that out. Great strain

Great Indica for insomnia, euphoria, pain, etc. Tastes earthy and pungent with a mild butane or fuel-like aroma. Mild munchies and couch lock ensued and body high peak made me feel like stretching all-over. All in all, with THC levels testing at thirty percent, this mammoth packs a punch. Will be buying again, 10/10, top shelf bud!

VThis is my first review on Leafly. I\u2019ve been using The Mighty vaporizer exclusively for a couple months now with different strains in the Vegas Valley. My strain comparisons and reviews are from using the exact same vaporizer that\u2019s well maintained and fully cleaned 1 or 2 times a week. This strain smells bad to me, but what is really off putting is the taste. I\u2019m certain that same nasty, ultra powerful mixed citrus, pine, and skunk disgusting  taste would come through using bongs, blunts, or papers. Using a high quality vaporizer really allows you to TASTE the flower for exactly the way the flower truly tastes. I also use the grinder that\u2019s means for vaporizers from S&amp;B, and I\u2019m telling you this is the WORST tasting strain I\u2019ve ever tasted. The effects of the strain are pretty much what is described on Leafly, but the taste is so bad it makes me not want to use it. Even the smell is not that good. Strains from the Vegas Valley I\u2019ve used that taste better (in order): Purple Kush (taste and smell 10), Blackberry Cream, Kosher Kush, OG Kush, Green Crack, XXX OG, White Tahoe Cookies, Grape Valley Kush. More reviews coming for other strains, including the ones just mentioned above and others to come. I realize it could have been the grower, but White OG has seriously been the worst tasting strain I\u2019ve bought in the Vegas Valley. Try it if you don\u2019t believe me. You\u2019ll regret buying it because of the obnoxious taste. Tastes like lawn clippings would taste if you grabbed a fresh pile and put it in your mouth to chew on, and the smell is pretty similar. The effects were pretty much exactly what Leafly has described in Effects, Medical, and Negatives. It did seriously give me a minor headache one time, probably because of the terrible taste. I\u2019m going to be a completely honest reviewer on here, by the way. I\u2019m so tired of seeing all of these 5 star reviews on way too many (vast majority of) strains just because the strain got the reviewer \u201cSOOO HIGH.\u201d

Vthe effects of the strain are rather nice. the issue here is the name.\u000aOG? There is no strain called White, nor OG, yet we have OG everything now.\u000aask 10 people what OG means and you&#39;ll get 10 different answers \u000aOG means absolutely nothing as it relates to cannabis strains, but the mental illness is spreading from strain to strain
