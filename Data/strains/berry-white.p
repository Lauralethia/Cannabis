VFinally got some, I&#39;ve been waiting to get my hands on this. The buds are nice looking nothing spectacular but nice, they&#39;re sprinkled on the outside clustered trichomes on the inside. The bag smelled like skunky berries but when I broke open the buds they had the aroma of blueberries and gasoline and quite pungent inviting ador. The high is awesome euphoric blast instantly great relaxing body and head buzz after a while kinda tingly too. The flavor is alright not what I expected but not bad, kinda flowery a little pungent not much berry but it&#39;s there. All in all great strain great indica I love it.

V&#127808;&#127826; Berry White is a unique and awesome hybrid. Very balanced and not too heavy, this strain provides a winning combination of effects. The flavor has a very earthy taste and subtle berry undertone to it. Fantastic smoke and even better high. Relaxing at first, then the mood lift sets in. Perfect in the evening or for any social situation. This strain has personally inspired a couple of creative works and deserves some recognition as a legend. If you generally don&#39;t like indicas, I want you to forget what you think you know and give Berry White a try. You&#39;re welcome.

VOne word, UNDERRATED! Anxiety free indica with not so heavy couch lock. You will be comfortable and chilling but surely not a falling asleep zombie. I suffer from anxiety and occasional insomnia so I lean toward indica. When I can find a strain that doesn&#39;t fully knock me out but relieve what I need everything feels right and that my friends is berry white. The effects or this strain far outshine it&#39;s decent smell and taste. I&#39;ve had two 8ths of &quot;middle shelf&quot; aka &quot;outdoor&quot; berry white flower. Both looked, smelled, tasted and felt the same. I&#39;d guess the same plant but who knows. Overall give it a try you won&#39;t be let down. &#128513;

VAlso called Whiteberry or White Berry. A cross between White Widow and Blueberry. This is one of my Top 10 strains. An even head/body high that gives focus and clarity to one&#39;s mind, yet it  also makes one feel relaxed, uplifted and somewhat euphoric. Good for depression and sparking creativity.

VOk let me start off by saying when I first heard the name of this strain I was a bit on ease. But then after A few puffs from the blunt around the camp fire with about 10 people, I WAS FU*CKED UP.This little girl sneaks up on you like a Lion hunting for food at night! Big big big head high then sneaks down to your body. Very light green with a couple purple spots on the nugs. This is a mixture of Blueberry and White Widow. Flavor is Wonderful. Not suggest you go out in public and do this. Overall awesome bud very good with people with Headaches leaves you social and you will find yourself staring into things for a long time. Morning affects suck, thats why its a 9 and not a 10 in my book. But this stuff will rock your world and last a good 3-4 hours. A+++ on this ^.^ P.S. Order pizzia before you spark up cause you will be munchies on max and to fucked up to order it :)

VPicked up from a local dispensary, was a little soft for my liking, so much so it was hard to grind. I&#39;ll leave it out for a little bit to dry it up. All in all smoked pretty good, real smooth, minor cough. I have a high tolerance but this one hit me on the 1st bowl within 7 minutes. Head high then body relaxation. It made me more creative and logical. Ex. I had an idea for an invention while toking back on God&#39;s Gift. After smoking Berry White, I realized it was a dumb idea after all.I&#39;m so so stupid. By the way, I&#39;m typing this while still on my high from Berry White, so I guess you could say it creates some energetic moods as well. I could prob BS a good research paper right now...yeah so this one is legit like Betty White, dang that&#39;s what they should call this strain Betty White, not Berry. Oh yeah very hint taste of berry on the exhale. Heard a car drive by. freaked out thought it was a cop, cops freak me out man

VWow. I pulled 3 times from the Volcano: Berry White has just assisted me in a major breakthrough at work (&#39;tho i am breaking to write my observations;-) My hearing is more detailed and i am noticing nuances in music that i haven&#39;t heard since i was a child.*I just made a series of &quot;errors&quot; in my work, realized i was thinking way faster than my mouse could keep up, and chuckled at myself! Nice to have fun at work. I&#39;m feeling so energetic and creative...and smiley.* I was meditating earlier today and this guided meditation has two sine wave/bell tones. I don&#39;t know what frequencies they are, but i can hear them now, at random, in a sound isolated room.* At the one-hour mark, i feel a little heaviness in the body, my focus is wavering slightly, and i&#39;m still feeling peaceful about everything. Including the work i have due in 5.5 hours \u000aand haven&#39;t started yet! I had some pain in my left hand&#39;s fingers that lessened significantly after i vaped. The sore muscles i earned while exercising feel relaxed and pain-free. *As i start to feel fatigue behind my eyes (not lidlock), i&#39;m vaping a bag of White Widow. Thanks, Berry, see ya soon!

VMethod of consumption - Flower; Smoking.\u000a----\u000a\u000aSmell - Definitely sweet. It reminds me of a blueberry sweet tart at first inhale (non-smoking). However, if you give it another sniff or two. You might be able to detect light earthy tones as if you were standing next to a berry bush.\u000a----\u000a\u000aTaste - Blueberry with a hint of vanilla. Not overly sweet; It ranges between semi-sweet to sweet. Smooth.\u000a----\u000a\u000aEffect -  I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;m type who gets the high delayed in other review. It&#39;s not the case with this strain. It calmly and slowly creeps up on you. Which is an amazing mellow type of high.\u000a\u000aMy stress levels were significantly dropping down after few puffs. Tensions in my body, mostly in my back where the pressure has been hitting on my herniated disc, was ironed out little by a little bit.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s uplifting as well for both body and cerebral parts. It gives you the floating tingly type of feeling if you become too aware of your body. It also would lift you away from your current worries as you sit back and enjoy small things. Which was great for my PTSD and anxiety.\u000a\u000aIt doesn&#39;t have the heavy couch-lock qualities but it might be enough to transit you to sleep. A gentle push for insomniacs, I&#39;d imagine so. (I was able to get a full eight hours of sleep once I decided to call it a night.)\u000a\u000aGiggle factor is there. I watched an episode of iZombie last night on HuluPlus and giggled at simple yet good-hearted remarks.\u000a---\u000a\u000aNegatives - Dry mouth. No doubt about it. However, it was easily solved by a pint of ice cream (half, actually).\u000a---\u000a\u000aMunchies - Low to medium. It depends, really. I didn&#39;t had a hungry attack because I was satisfied with ice cream.\u000a---\u000a\u000aExtra - I&#39;d recommend this strain to anybody who wants an easy-going high or doesn&#39;t want to be heavily medicated.

VBerry White was really good for my RLS.  It left me feeling relaxed and happy and drowsy, but not quite sleepy enough to really go to sleep.  Tasted pretty good with that sweet berry taste that I love.  All in all a good med for someone suffering from moderate pain, anxiety, or stress.  Made me feel good without an overwhelming head high.

VThe name is no lie... Berry White wears it proudly, sporting frosty white and sage green nugs. Break one in half to reveal leaves so juicy, no loupe tool is needed to see that THC! The smell will have you enveloped in sweet fruit and licorice... hypnotic, much like the man himself. Oh yeah!\u000a\u000aThe high is quick to achieve and mellow as a day in the sun. Think easy, not sleepy. I felt clear enough for the ideas to start flowing again, and that makes Berry White my first, my last, my everything. \u000a\u000aIf someone manages to harness the flavor in an extract or edible... my God!\u000a\u000a**Acquired at Crown Patient&#39;s Group :: San Diego, CA 92103 ::

VGot an 8th of this at Alternatives in Santa Rosa. Once home i loaded a bowl... smells like blueberry licorice candy as i shredded it up. Inhale was super smooth with a skunky sweet berry taste.  At first i thought there wasnt much of an affect, but as soon as i stood up...  Wow what a head change.  I had planed on smoking and relaxing when i got home.  Instead i found myself taking the dogs out for a long walk and catching up on much needed yard work.\u000aYesterday I finished that 8th and bought an OZ.  The Berry White has it all.  Great look, Great smell and tast and best of all it gets the job done.

VActually, from what I&#39;ve heard and read, Berry White is actually Blue Widow. (blueBERRY x WHITE widow versus BLUEberry x white WIDOW). White Berry is a totally different strain. Maybe merge this with the Blue Widow page and have it redirect? After checking to be sure my genetics information is correct.

I don&#39;t mind piney tasting bud, and this is subtle and not too over-bearing. It look blue-ish but has a frosty look to it that makes it dank. The high was fantastic, I was very comfortable and conversational, as well as creative. I bought a dub of it, and had to go back and get more. \u000a

VFirst time trying this indica from White Widow &amp; Blueberry. It&#39;s got a great smell right off, kinda sour berry smell. Smokes great, very sticky small round nuggets. I love this strain as a nightcap when I&#39;m having trouble sleeping...one, two hits and I&#39;m relaxed enough to get into dream land. Great sour berry, blueberry taste. A small amount goes a long way.

VVery nice, it doesn&#39;t taste good at all (very harsh flavor in fact) and it is pretty stinky, but this offers a nice euphoric high that does not drain your energy. \u000a\u000aCan make you a little dizzy if you huff too much too fast and it is prone to a little Dry Mouth. Avoid smoking even just a small amount of the stems as they WILL give you a headache.

VMy wife and I have enjoyed the sexy, silky, smooth, panty dropping effects of Berry White more than once and have never been let down. Its smoke was smooth and very pleasant with slight fruit notes. The high was just like Barry White&#39;s voice, it comes on slow and gentle then booming and deep. Berry White seductively invites you to take your clothes off and climb into bed, you comply and whisper &quot;please be kind it&#39;s my first time.&quot; We quickly went through our supply of Berry White, ever since then we are constantly on the look out for more.  All I want is that Berry White back in my mouth.

VBerry White has become one of my favorites. The flowers have a sugary cookie and berry scent. Very rosey, earthy and rich. The taste is very fresh however it can be a bit nauseatingly sweet with heavy pills. The Blueberry and White Widow genetics make this a very  STRONG strain. It has an almost immediate effect with intense muscle relaxation and a very pleasant heaviness. This medicine is deeply mellowing and relaxing. Artwork comes alive and you&#39;ll find yourself swept away into deeply sedating peace and happiness.

VThis strain is good.i like it just fine, but in very small amounts. It&#39;s a little heavy on the indica for my brain. I smoke maybe 2-3 times a week, but when I do smoke, one of its parent plants, white widow is my go-to. It only takes one hit and I&#39;m good for 4-5 hours. Generally I game after I smoke, but berry white makes it damn near impossible. This will be my bed time strain for sure.  This stuff is a lot more dense than widow and I ended up smoking &quot;too much&quot; on the first try. I&#39;m a super lightweight and get really paranoid with higher levels of thc, but that wasn&#39;t the case with Berry. On the bag of berry white it says only 7.6% thc but it feels a LOT higher like 16+. I get super stony, spacey &quot;forgot what I was gonna do&quot; and my filter goes completely haywire and I go straight to savage honesty. I&#39;m very relaxed though and my back and joint pain is nonexistent. 10/10 would smoke again.

VThis stuff is awesome. It looks beautiful and is covered in Orange hairs with somewhat of a white haze covering the rest of the bud. Smells sweet and pungent like any good weed does. When you smoke it it has fine sweet taste that is enjoyable. Smoked it out of a bong and took about 4 big hits. Found myself coughing for a good 5 minutes on the last hit that&#39;s when I knew I was good. Started off with a hyper induced happiness. A true feeling of enjoyment where everything is just awesome. The great thing was the other 6 people around me were feeling the same exact thing. about an hour and a half later this then turned into an extremely relaxing high that put everyone to sleep. All my friends were passed out around me so I just put some music in and went straight into another time zone. Then all of a sudden I felt a resurgence and I got up and just felt like moving to the music. I ended up dancing for the next 20 minutes. I have to admit this is the best stuff I have ever smoked and everyone else has been raving about it too. You have to try this stuff you won&#39;t regret it.

VThe wife and I absolutely loved this strain.  I traded a buddy of mine traded some Strawberry Cough and Sour Alien for some Berry White and Jillybean.  I&#39;ll review the Jillybean once we try it but since the wife and I tried this first...\u000aI do know where this strain gets its name, but it definitely has all the soulful Barry undertones.  Smooth, relaxing and just like a Barry White playlist, it had both the wife and I in an amorous state of mind.\u000aWe didn&#39;t think the bud was all that special to look at and the smell was about a 7 of the sniff-o-meter.  But after a thorough grind and a nice rolling effort we found the taste and effects were top-notch.  We were absolutely floating after just a couple rips and spent the next two hours truly enjoying that high.\u000aDo believe I&#39;ll be seeing if my buddy would like to make another swap.  Maybe some Casey Jones and Permafrost for another of Barry&#39;s greatest hits.

There is a secret to Berry White that I must share. \u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, use a grinder with Berry White. The reason is because there are so many THC crystals on this strain that it will create a residue of pure THC crystals after grinding a few batches. Second, collect this from the walls of your grinder and pour it on top of a small bowl. Even for people like me who &quot;can&#39;t get high anymore,&quot; oh, how mistaken you are.

VBarry White has a sweet scent that reminds me of a berry.  It tastes just as sweet as it smells.  I smoked this strain in a joint and it got me higher than I&#39;ve ever been.  I was really horny.  I had songs playing in my head.  I couldn&#39;t stop moving.  Everything around me was really pretty.  I also had the ability to give my full attention to something if I wanted to.  I&#39;m usually depressed, but did not feel the slightest bit of sadness after smoking this strain.  I think it has the potential to supress ADD/ADHD because of the &quot;full attention&quot; ability.

VThis is a new strain for me. I decided to try out a new dispensary also, Desert Rose, in North Phoenix because of the wonderful specials they were offering that day. Ended up  getting a quarter for 40.00. The buds are are a beautiful green with hints purple. They also have a very nice dusting of tricombs. The buds were very fresh and dense. This strain also smells very dank with hints of pine and a slight hint of berry. The high is very nice. Very nice to relax to. It offers great pain relief and muscle relaxation. You also get a head stone that is perfect for anxiety relief and offers some euphoria. Would definitely pick this strain up again.

VTLDR; sweet strain. Unique fragrance. Not very berrylike though.\u000aJust got this from NorCal medicine man in Oroville, ca. It is a sweet smelling strain, but not resembling blueberry or berry in any way. Shishkaberry is a sweeter more berry, floral like strain. Berry white is just sweet, although it does have a unique pop to it. It&#39;s not a run of the mill lemony or orangy sweet aroma, that you can get with a high percentage of the meta weed selection, which I&#39;m not a fan of. I like this strain, I would rate it higher than strains like green crack, og, gsc, blue dream, etc. but I would place this strain behind others like, sunset sherbert and shishkaberry

VThis is a new strain for me. I decided to try out a new dispensary also, Desert Rose, in North Phoenix because of the wonderful specials they were offering that day. Ended up  getting a quarter for 40.00. The buds are are a beautiful green with hints purple. They also have a very nice dusting of tricombs. The buds were very fresh and dense. This strain also smells very dank with hints of pine and a slight hint of berry. The high is very nice. Very nice to relax to. It offers great pain relief and muscle relaxation. You also get a head stone that is perfect for anxiety relief and offers some euphoria. Would definitely pick this strain up again.

VAs a person who is usually a sativa lover, I have been acquiring a liking for indicas and indica dominant hybrids. This strain has to go up next to my favorites like green crack and skywalker. It just simply is a euphoric and slightly giggly indica where thought is free flowing and easy, you definitely get your taste of sativa, sit on a good couch though and you seriously don\u2019t get up.

VThis strain is awesome. Normally an indica chick, I love the way this helps with my shitty appetite and pain, yet it doesn&#39;t knock me out right away, letting me enjoy the uplifting effects of antidepression and creative energy.  But it will creep up on me and before I know it, I&#39;m waking up from a weed nap, hungry for a snack. Recommend any indica lover who wants a bit of uplifting before the boom drops go ahead and get it on with Berry White.

VA smooth creeper of a strain. This will certainly set a mood of relaxation when consumed in a reasonable dose. It takes on the characteristics of most indica strains what you would expect but it&#39;s power won&#39;t totally zoom you out again used in low dose. Pain relief is a plus with this strain I would say it&#39;s a great strain to combat PTSD episodes.  a nice draw from a bong or two draws from a joint would do you good. I would recommend this strain to those suffering from PTSD.

Not many cerebral sativa-dominant hybrids can make SUCH a smooth tran-sition from day to night &amp; deep-in its&#39; indicol roots, but this 5-\u2b50\ufe0f&#128163;does the trick quite nicely! &#128076;&#127995; Medical cabinet-mainstay \u2014&gt; enjoy as wake &#39;n&#39; bake to start day off right AND/OR lick your day&#39;s wounds-well!

I was honestly surprised the first time, I don&#39;t taste much flavor when smoking. What follows is an immediate head rush, euphoric but not overwhelming (Chernobyl, I&#39;m looking at you!) which is accompanied by a deep sense of well-being, relaxation. So far, it hasn&#39;t locked me into the couch or paralyzed me. I can still GTD. Very Nice Work from Phat Panda.

VI bought an eighth of this and rolled 3 king sized joints.  I smoked all of them to the face and was high as a kite.  Once the high reached its peak, I had the desire to create something, so I started making a sandwich.  I put butter, egg, and bacon on it.  I also added to salt and pepper to the butter.  I could taste each and every flavor.  I also couldn&#39;t help but rub my leg because of how intense each flavor was.

VIf you want to chill and get some sleep; this strain is for you. Expect hunger and sleepiness. \u000a\u000aIt offers a sharp smell and a strong taste. My nugs were damp and had some trouble in the grinder but in the pax 3 vape it was great and lasted longer than most I think due to dampness

VAmazing terpene profile, with a pleasant fruity/musky berry like taste. Very strong head effects right off the bat which made it hard to concentrate for the first 45 min. Munchies soon kicked in with a full body buzz. My mind seemed to soar with this one, bringing on creative thoughts. Upbeat, a little &quot;giddy&quot; feeling in the body leading to pleasant euphoria. Great for stress and depression, stomach issues, nausea, appetite

VAt first I was skeptical about the indica dominant strain as I like attending my daily night activities. I immediately felt pain relief after the first two hits. The smell is so sweet and very earthy with a sprinkle of berry. Within minutes the euphoria sweeps in slowly leaving you at ease with stress relief. As the effects kick in. I feel eye pressure and a sense of new perspective. Can definitely picture the creativity this would bring as the world feels drawn toward me in a sense of clarity. The beautiful night time effects heal the pain and make you relaxed yet slowly easing into a deep sleep. Very good strain and great for night time ~ \u2601\ufe0f

VA great strain for relaxing and socializing berry white takes the best parts of white widow and gives them a sweet berry and indica flair. The sweet flavor precedes a wave of euphoria and relaxation  I find myself talkative and very hungry after smoking too much, but enjoy it in moderation after work when listening to music especially.

VLeafly family,  Berry white taste is cool like eating a mint, not nearly as strong , but a slight hint, very smooth on the throat, white smoke on exhale, first hit out of bowl felt ease of mind instantly, stoney type feeling, body felt relaxed. couch like effects, made me hungry but not uncontrollably, you can stay awake wont make you pass out but can sleep is you wish. i watched a movie and i really got into it, felt happy, chill.  To be honest i wish this strain was stronger, being a daily smoker.  but try it grab a gram or two.  its still unique just low in potency lacks the knockout punch.  Thank you for reading.

VOK.. First off, I get why they named this Berry White. A mix between Blue  Berry and White widow, but when I think of Berry White, I think of a low lit room with a glow coming from a well lit fireplace and slow music is playing on the stereo. While you pull your partner in close to give them a kiss and you wind up in the bedroom. This is not the case with this strain! Within 2 minutes you start to feel the Blue Berry effect, body starts to go limp (not good if your expecting what I said before...lol) and all you want to do is smile and lay there. After about an hour in, you want to sleep! game over! Good for pain and sleeping!

Voh boy! Allow me to give my 2 cents on this strain. for starters, it has the blueberry family lineage so expect it to taste nice. the flavor i get is a sweet berry with a small soapy taste. after a while it just smells tastes like a berry. the residual smell is pleasant with no complaints from Neighbors. Not to mention the nice cerebral high it gives you. This hybrid leaves you with a calm body as well as making you feel like going for a walk to your local munchie spot. you feel actively mellow to simply put it.

VI&#39;ve smoked this strain multiple of times. I am an indica lover. It relaxes you with a couple hits from a bowl. No couch lock feeling but makes you want to smoke and watch some Netflix .

That Berry Aroma Is So enticing! \u000a\u000aVery mellow high not too focused where you feel like your eyes are going to pop out lol. But that creative peak is just awesome. I did sprang my wrist from work the other day and I felt It feel a little tight. After smoking Berry White! Boy Oh Boy I feel Like I Can Do A Full Set Of Push Ups And Pull Ups without feeling Pain or tightness!  Most Definitely 5 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2019s ! \u000a\u000aJust One Blunt and You\u2019ll Be Perfectly Fine.

It also worked wonderfully well on my anxiety and replaced it with a sense of well being. The only downside I can think of is, that many of the berry strains it can make you cough quite a bit. I hope you enjoy it like I did, take and enjoy the relaxing. Love, Hayley

See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings -- Brand: PhatPanda\u000aStrain: Berry White\u000aTrue Hybrid -- Potency Analysis: TTL 26.5% THC 0.7% CBD 0.2% THCA 29.4% -- Cost: $15/1 gram conical joint -- The smell of this pre-roll is sweet and pungent.  It&#39;s really deep, with layers of bright scents - even in a pre-roll. --  The flavor was fantastic, Berry-licious like some of the dankest Blueberry you ever had - lots of pop and fresh blue flavor - with a back-end like luscious sweet dank.  This was amazing and the flavor lasted on my lips for an hour or more. -- Party! This pot makes me want to dance and have fun and laugh and socialize!   This upbeat and uplifting head high is accompanied with some great body feels like waves of fantastic running through you. -- \u000a\u000aThis joint was smoked in three different sessions, and four different people got high from it.  You can&#39;t argue with that.

But I got this Berry White tonight...and I was little disinterested in Sativa, but my guy wanted something that wouldn&#39;t put him to sleep.  So I got the Berry White, and smoked.  It&#39;s a great weed.  I can smoke and get higher.  That&#39;s what I like.  Consistency.  It started with this happy feeling and excitement, and then it really mellowed.  I still love the Bubba Kush better.

VI had a peach lemonade right before this so it tasted crazy bitter and unfortunately I&#39;m not sure what the real flavor of this flower is. I gotta say that the Lowell indicas are so freakin much better than their sativas or hybrids. They&#39;re perfect. This is the second indica pre-roll I&#39;ve tried by them besides the Blue Zkittles which was also great. It balanced out the sativa tincture I had earlier. It&#39;s just the ideal after work treat. Paranoia level: 0/10.

VTo me this strain, although incredibly fragrant, did not quite live up to its&#39; incredible lineage. The positives are in the jar the smell of mixed berries is quite pleasing; also the taste of the bud is top notch.  The widow side comes through on the exhale more prominently than the berry side witch is present in the inhale. The downside was the just kind of plain jane high. I smoked in a bubbler and a bong, but it just was an average high. It is useful anytime of day and the taste is refreshing.  There are just a lot more potent hybrids of widow and blueberry.

VBought this from a friend in an illegal state so there\u2019s no guarantee this is what I got but I\u2019m inclined to believe so due to its mild fruity scent and sweet taste. The hits are smooth and tastey and despite my low tolerance I did not find myself plastered after smoking a good amount (mid quality). Still beware, a constant craving for good food will overtake you for the span of at least three hours. In complete honesty this has not guven my most euphoric and intense highs yet the impact it\u2019s had on me is unmatched. If you struggle with anxiety while high, this strain will prevent your thoughts from racing excessively but still give you a boost of creativity. Despite not smoking this strain every day, I feel more uplifted overall after having felt some mild depression and anxiety at times throughout this past year. Overall If you are looking for a strain that will give a mild, relaxing and euphoric high, this strain will do the trick. But I cannot stress how powerful the munchies are from just a couple tokes.

VFavorite strain for day-time appetite stimulant. It allows me to munch like there&#39;s no tomorrow (which is why I have a medical card) but doesn&#39;t couch lock me nor fuck my mind up too much. Tastes and smells amazing. I&#39;ve let some sit in a jar (letting out the stale air daily) and it has just gotten more delicious and now has so many beautiful Amber crystals. Thank you blueberry X white widow (many different names for this combination of strains)

VI tried this a long time ago and i remember it being very uplifting and painless. Yea, it was kinda weird how it numbed your whole body out, but it was good i give it a 10 for quality but it doesn&#39;t get you very high, as i recall it was kinda mild. I believe its an indica dominate hybrid, probably 3 parts CBD and 1 part THC. It doesn&#39;t make you sleepy though, but if you lay down on your own, forget it, your gone.

VI expected more from this strain, so I&#39;m a bit disappointed. The high only lasted about 15 or 20 minutes for me, and I also had a strong hangover sensation the next morning. I smoked this about 3-4 times a day for about a week, and it also seemed to steer my mind in the direction of very morbid and disturbing thoughts.. .I also wasn&#39;t impressed at all by the taste and smell. It did however make me very hungry, so keep snacks on hand.

VI wanted to like this strain, I really did. I&#39;m not a fan of White Widow so perhaps I&#39;m being a little unfair, but here goes. The taste is kinda weird, a mix of blueberry and really strong earth, which almost overpowers the berry. The smell was pure earthy to me, but maybe that was just this particular batch. Effect wise, after one or two bowls you get a nice uplifted sativa high with a heavy indica body high, but anymore bowls and it just makes you want to lay down and sleep, at least for me personally, which is great for insomnia but not if you want to enjoy the weed.

VVery (Berry) balanced!   The most balanced weed I&#39;ve smoked (vaped through ABX Cartridge).\u000a\u000aThe very even head and body high that could exists.  In addition, I smoked it three times over the day and I never yawned or got tired.   But, when it was time for bed, I just went to sleep.  But, I did not fall asleep early like I usually do with any hybrid or Indica (and even a sativa or two!)\u000a\u000aI didn&#39;t have a eurphoic or happy feeling.  I didn&#39;t want to bounce off the walls, go play darts or go do a lot of cleaning.  I didn&#39;t want to jump for joy or sing ... I just felt calm - but NOT couch lock.  It was like a very calm feeling but at the same time, good to continue in the day.\u000a\u000aMeaning - I only had TWO feelings from Berry White ABX Cartridge.  (Hungry and Relaxed) --- that&#39;s it.\u000a\u000aIf I have a day of stress or someone upsetting me and I just want to chill and continue my day, I will reach for Berry White.

I would love pulled pork on a bun and I want to be on a space shuttle to watch the works above me. I love some toasted english muffins and some real muffins on my wild mustang farm. I would have a corn silo. This is some dizzy shit. I am chill as fuck. I am so dizzy. and relaxed this is heavy. I could be numb or sleepy.

There&#39;s that familiar sensation of constant elevation that most Indicas make me feel but it&#39;s twice as sickening with this strain.  I usually find myself sweating hard as I resist the urge to vomit. When the nausea subsides, a debilitating migraine usually sets into my brain.

VI had a peach lemonade right before this so it tasted crazy bitter and unfortunately I&#39;m not sure what the real flavor of this flower is. I gotta say that the Lowell indicas are so freakin much better than their sativas or hybrids. They&#39;re perfect. This is the second indica pre-roll I&#39;ve tried by them besides the Blue Zkittles which was also great. It balanced out the sativa tincture I had earlier. It&#39;s just the ideal after work treat. Paranoia level: 0/10.

VI stumbled upon this great indica, by accident. I was going to get Granddaddy Purple, but at the last minute I decided to try something new. I asked my budtender what indicas he recommended, and he suggested Berry White. It has a really nice smell to it, I pick up primarily pine. It makes me feel relaxed, and feeling positive. I&#39;d definitely recommend it!

Vberry white is true to its namesake with the sweet, pungent berry aroma of the buds, leaving one with a mental image of fresh, juicy berries in the market. relaxation induces once inhaled, and the medicine works it&#39;s way into every atom, lifting you up gently only to lower you back down to rest in peace

VAt about half way on the first blunt you should start feeling it crawl from your neck to your shoulder and then your spin. By then end of it your body should feel pretty much numb head -toe. Euphoria sets in pretty good as well. Now I smoke a lot so may be my tolerance but I say if you have it roll that second blunt listen to the music play in the background and by halfway you\u2019ll be coughing and feelings like you\u2019re on the most comfy rocket ship launch ever. Pretty good but needs to be stronger. \u000a\u000aP.S it may just be the bag I have isn\u2019t as good as yours so effects may accrue a lot faster&#129335;&#127998;\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u000a

VBought this from a friend in an illegal state so there\u2019s no guarantee this is what I got but I\u2019m inclined to believe so due to its mild fruity scent and sweet taste. The hits are smooth and tastey and despite my low tolerance I did not find myself plastered after smoking a good amount (mid quality). Still beware, a constant craving for good food will overtake you for the span of at least three hours. In complete honesty this has not guven my most euphoric and intense highs yet the impact it\u2019s had on me is unmatched. If you struggle with anxiety while high, this strain will prevent your thoughts from racing excessively but still give you a boost of creativity. Despite not smoking this strain every day, I feel more uplifted overall after having felt some mild depression and anxiety at times throughout this past year. Overall If you are looking for a strain that will give a mild, relaxing and euphoric high, this strain will do the trick. But I cannot stress how powerful the munchies are from just a couple tokes.

But I got this Berry White tonight...and I was little disinterested in Sativa, but my guy wanted something that wouldn&#39;t put him to sleep.  So I got the Berry White, and smoked.  It&#39;s a great weed.  I can smoke and get higher.  That&#39;s what I like.  Consistency.  It started with this happy feeling and excitement, and then it really mellowed.  I still love the Bubba Kush better.

Voh boy! Allow me to give my 2 cents on this strain. for starters, it has the blueberry family lineage so expect it to taste nice. the flavor i get is a sweet berry with a small soapy taste. after a while it just smells tastes like a berry. the residual smell is pleasant with no complaints from Neighbors. Not to mention the nice cerebral high it gives you. This hybrid leaves you with a calm body as well as making you feel like going for a walk to your local munchie spot. you feel actively mellow to simply put it.

VTo me this strain, although incredibly fragrant, did not quite live up to its&#39; incredible lineage. The positives are in the jar the smell of mixed berries is quite pleasing; also the taste of the bud is top notch.  The widow side comes through on the exhale more prominently than the berry side witch is present in the inhale. The downside was the just kind of plain jane high. I smoked in a bubbler and a bong, but it just was an average high. It is useful anytime of day and the taste is refreshing.  There are just a lot more potent hybrids of widow and blueberry.

VGot this at Freedom Market in Kelso, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings -- Brand: PhatPanda\u000aStrain: Berry White\u000aTrue Hybrid -- Potency Analysis: TTL 26.5% THC 0.7% CBD 0.2% THCA 29.4% -- Cost: $15/1 gram conical joint -- The smell of this pre-roll is sweet and pungent.  It&#39;s really deep, with layers of bright scents - even in a pre-roll. --  The flavor was fantastic, Berry-licious like some of the dankest Blueberry you ever had - lots of pop and fresh blue flavor - with a back-end like luscious sweet dank.  This was amazing and the flavor lasted on my lips for an hour or more. -- Party! This pot makes me want to dance and have fun and laugh and socialize!   This upbeat and uplifting head high is accompanied with some great body feels like waves of fantastic running through you. -- \u000a\u000aThis joint was smoked in three different sessions, and four different people got high from it.  You can&#39;t argue with that.

VI&#39;ve had really nice experiences with this strain. It led to a very pleasant full body relaxation with out feeling out right sleepy. It also worked wonderfully well on my anxiety and replaced it with a sense of well being. The only downside I can think of is, that many of the berry strains it can make you cough quite a bit. I hope you enjoy it like I did, take and enjoy the relaxing. Love, Hayley

VSmoked.Berry White for the first time tonight. I smoked it while very tired so that effected the high I think. I&#39;m giving it 3 stars. It&#39;s pretty good but I wasn&#39;t blown away by it. Definitely a sativa dominant strain. Barely any body high, cerebral.h head high. you can do shit on it, run errands,.drive etc it.wasn&#39;t that happy type bud but that could have been because I am super tired. I don&#39;t feel like it was properly named..When I think about Barry White the singer, he&#39;s deep,.slow,.intense, qualities I attribute to indica strains with intense body highs. This strain is.bright, cerebral, light. Opposite to the singer&#39;s music. It.should have.been named Green Day or.something lighter.

VGrower: Slab Mechanics THC: 66.3% CBD: 1.26% Method: Butane/Propane Man is this stuff tasty for a $13 1/2G Slab Mechanics deserves a shoutout for quality oil at a great price.  Anyways Berry White is a really nice cross of two classic strains that makes a great indica dominant strain. Its a very uplifting strain that sets in a good calm happy state, but you can still function properly with little couchlock and sleepiness which makes it great for going to the movies. It doesnt stir up much appetite but still does to an extent which is great for the movies as it makes for good snacking and not a full on meal. Scent wise there is little from it being oil but it has a subtle scent of earthy berry but thats it. As for taste though its excellent with a strong note of blueberry/strawberry that lingers for quite awhile and is not earthy at all and almost tastes like a strawberry starburst and not like cannabis. It was a very smooth smoke and light on the lungs where strawberry was a bit heavier of a smoke when it comes to oil. Overall its a great indica dom that I would reccomend for someone newer to cannabis or indicas or someone who just doesnt want a couchlockey indica. 8/10

V\u201cYou&#39;re the First, the Last, My Everything\u201d (1974) the other Barry White\u000a\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s taken me several years since going medical to fully evaluate the log jam of strains available today.  I tried this Berry White from Amazon Organics three weeks ago,  it&#39;s really unbelievable in its versatility.  My Berry White song lyrics would say something like the first hit is Wonder- great for focused dailly use.\u000aThe second  is Thunder-time to relax!   \u000aAnd the third  is Under, sleepy time time!\u000a\u000aThe taste is sweet berry on the exhale,  the Bw smells like the best weed ever.  The scent is promising , I anticipated what&#39;s coming then BW delivered up some of the most delicious effects for what ails me. \u000a\u000aWith chronic pain and being a constant Mr. Forgetful, Berry White does a grand job for helping me focus out on a daily basis.  At least it would if there were any clones or seeds available.   It&#39;s similar to Blueberry Headband, Blue Dream, Blueberry,  with a heavy Indica appearance after several vapes.  I tracked down the grower and he said there was a possibility of a cutting in the near future.  I hope so!

VI really really like this strain! Berry white is a great strain that I&#39;m glad I tried. The effects of the Indica and Sativa happen pretty much at the same time. A nice mood uplifter but with great body relaxation. I definitely feel that the Indica is stronger/ more predominant than the Sativa, so I wouldn&#39;t use it before something important. A nice strain if you want body relaxation but not to the point of couch lock

VThis is some great bud, although labeled as an Indica, I get more sativa effects (must be the White Widow). I can use this day or night, great medicine for depression...this one pulled me through a dark time in my life! If u get the chance give her a shot, you&#39;ll be glad u did!

VI just started using the Randy&#39;s wired papers and they are dank.  I can finally smoke my joints down to the roach and boy does it make a difference :) I smoked 7 joints of this strain in my backyard.  After smoking that much, I wasn&#39;t able to smell anything.  I was still sweaty, aroused, and creative.  Another weird effect of the quarter was my eyes feeling like they were popping out of my head.  I also had cotton mouth from smoking so much, so being high, I easily drank like 8 glasses of water that day.  It was cool though because the water made me feel like I was swimming.

VGrower / brand: Master Grown in Seattle,WA 09/10/2015.  Very potent (22%), very stony w/ some focus but can still forget things easily.  Also, makes the eyes droopy and red, but the scent and taste is mild and not very noticeable.  Middle of the road effects that leaned sativa: cerebral creativity but can still sit and relax.

VThis strain disappointed me. I smoked 5 joints before and during a Logic concert and all I got was a sligh head and body buzz. Music sounded good but not extraordinarily amazing. One good thing about this strain is that it made me feel more confident and open. The batch I got also didn&#39;t look cured properly. It had too much moisture and the trichomes didn&#39;t stand out as much as some of the other strains I&#39;ve tried. I really hope I get to try this bud again but with a better curing job.

VLiterally the worst weed I have had in a very long time. It tasted soooo disgusting and it didn&#39;t have a smell. The guy that delivers it is super cool but come on man did you try this weed? Its pretty gross.

VIt\u2019s relaxing with a great smell! I loved the aroma. It doesn\u2019t make me feel high. Slightly relaxed. Pain levels have decreased. For the price I paid, I would have loved to have a better experience. This is weak

VI decided I wouldn&#39;t get this if I had the opportunity to get og kush or this. og being kind of standard, and better than, imo. I&#39;m over it but it does the trick. I am officially retard, but I just got off of purple cheese so maybe that&#39;s why this is a lil bit of a disappointment. I am retard tho in a blueberry manner, pero no me gusta. es retardo hahaha
