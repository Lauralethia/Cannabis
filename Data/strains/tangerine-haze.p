VGot some of this yesterday. I love Haze, but am skeptical of crosses. They rarley remind me of the Haze i know(or atleast the pheno we had). As soon as i opended the bag i caught the distinct tangerine stentch. It also had a pungent hazy undertone which transfered perfectly to taste when smoked. It may actually taste better than it smelled, felt like a cat pissed on a tangerine and then  shoved it up my nostrils. The buds were a amazing blue green with furry white trichs all over and a few orange hairs here and there.The effects are very hybridy. It feels very haze like in the onset but then it also produces a mellow calming body high. It doesnt have the energy of haze, but doesnt have the lag of alot of strains that get you this ripped.

VThis is the best sativa I have ever smoked. I plan to find a vape cartridge of this to see if it holds up to flower. I recommend this to anyone who uses mj to inspire creativity. I&#39;m a writer, and Tangerine Haze took me to a place that can only be described as transcendental. It&#39;s the kind of high you want to talk about intricate ideas, philosophical ideas, with friends. Have a white board or something to write with as your group will undoubtedly come up with some mind-blowing ideas. Slight dry mouth and great sleep on the come down. Top 5 flower of all time. And last week, found the best indica of all time ... Ghost. What a week for weed!

VAs a Sativa fan and dedicated AM smoker, I am blown away by this energizing hybrid.  It really smacks you with it&#39;s citrusy aroma and it has a nice and clean taste.  I find the high to be one that is clean and clear headed and lends nicely for socializing when you&#39;re out and about or have to act &quot;normal&quot; around people. One bonus also is that the blend lacks the paranoid qualities some don&#39;t like about Sativas while yet having that great Sativa buzz.

VThis is definitely one of my favourite strains - it has a really subtle, but not overpowering taste and a great smell of orange. You can taste it within every draw/toke (whatever you call it where you&#39;re from) \u000a\u000aThe high? It makes you extremely creative. I just wanted to draw, paint or do anything &quot;artsy&quot;. The only thing I ended up doing, was going home, playing minecraft, a creating a huge bong with all my buddies that I&#39;d just smoked with... (That is of course after satisfying the munchies) \u000a\u000a\u000aAll in all, would deffo recommend it - one of the best highs I&#39;ve ever had!

VThe smell is like candy!  Taste is close to the same as well.  This strain grabs you by the hand and just starts dancing.  Definitely uplifting, but not so speedy as to cause any anxiety.  I rarely enjoy sativas, as they sometimes make my anxiety worse and make me more aware of muscle spasticity, however this was a perfect balance between uplifted, clear and one pointed.  By this I simply meant there wasn&#39;t the usual highway of thoughts buzzing around, I felt very &quot;in the room&quot;.

Firstly you will notice the powerful aroma,- tangy sweet orange that forces a second smell. The taste is very pleasant and smooth throughout (even 15 minutes after the dab). Euphoric high starting in your chest, I would recommend putting a good record and just really feel the music. Overall excellence, I am nothing but impressed! &#128077;

VHey y&#39;all, just got my card last week. Moved here from Texas for school 2 weeks ago and this was one of the first strains I bought legally!\u000a        \u000a                     Cost: $5/gram, $15/(1/8th)\u000a                  Local Dispensary: JP Wellness\u000a\u000a 4344 Montebello Drive, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80918\u000a-Ask for Kim if she&#39;s there. She&#39;s well-educated, very helpful and friendly, and will make a first-time weed buyer feel at home and less like a criminal, haha.\u000a\u000aPROS\u000aGreat smell, flavor is out of this world, beautiful buds, etc. The high of this strain consists of phenomenal Sativa effects. Takes about 2-3 minutes to enter MY system, and lasts approx. 30-45 minutes consuming 1/20th of a gram. Produces a variety of changes in my mental processes including; Increased productivity and time management skills, euphoric feelings, regulated/slowed heart rate +increased blood  stabilized moods, ability/desire to accomplish daily tasks with minimal thought effort, actually sat down to write this review haha.\u000a\u000aCons:\u000aDry mouth, dry eyes, I assume those are traits of an Indica. That&#39;s about all the negatives from my experiences, and I am critical about my strain selection. A few other strains I&#39;ve tried resulted in paranoia, this one didn&#39;t create any sense of that or anxiety.\u000a\u000aOverall, I would recommend this strain to try for any Colorado newcomer, or even for the weekend to conquer social anxiety! In my opinion I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to individuals with low blood pressure, as I assume problems could arise if your body reacts like mine and your heart rate slows down, \u000a increased blood flow/oxygen intake=lower blood pressure. I may be wrong, just something to research into if you have a problem as such.

VTastes great, not all that interesting otherwise. Bright tangerine citrus is pronounced in both the aroma and flavor. The taste is a bit sweet, almost candied. The high is disappointing, subtle, a bit of a tease other than some minor trailers at higher doses. This feels more like a Sativa high than a hybrid and even then lacks any real euphoria. Recommended as a tasty option for beginner consumers hoping to start slow, but even then I think you&#39;ll grow out of it quickly.

VI had this over a year ago and haven&#39;t been able to get my hands on it since, but highly recommended. It really does smell citrus-y, super pleasant. I smoked some with my bf in his dorm and we walked down to the track together to see the stars. The stars were amazing but unfortunately tonight was some sort of weird women&#39;s soccer team ritual so they all stormed the field insanely drunk and started stripping and we had to run away. First they thought we were the cops, though. That was weird because I thought maybe they saw cops, and you know how that is. So my boyfriend and I started walking back and I make him stop on the sidewalk to kiss me, but I can&#39;t decide how I want to kiss, so I keep stopping him when we&#39;re getting into kissing position and I&#39;m like, &quot;alright, real slow&quot; which he still makes fun of me for TO THIS DAY. I just couldn&#39;t get the kissing position right and I kept making myself laugh and I couldn&#39;t take it seriously but I really wanted to kiss, so it was just a lot of things going on. Then we went back to his room and watched Rick &amp; Morty, and did other things I assume.

VA great smoke that leaves a nice citrus flavor on the palate after smoking.  The high from the Tang Haze has always been consistent and is a great smoke for a social occasion.  Slightly harsh in all honesty, but still the high and the effects from the smoke is most definitely worth it.  I would suggest this smoke for beginning individuals who aren&#39;t used to smoking regularly.  This sativa is must try!!  A good bud will have a healthy green color with brown whiskers and an undeniable tangerine aroma to it.

VThis wax tastes amid smells just like tangerines. I want to clean many house with it. I want to drill a tiny hole in the jar and wear it on a necklace. YUMMMM! \u000aI have never liked Hazes very much but this one is more than tolerable. Crisp, vibrant high with no paranoia or sleeplessness. \u000aI am sampling some live resin from an Illinois dispensary and it is phenomenal! Best tasting errl ever!

VHey y&#39;all, just got my card last week. Moved here from Texas for school 2 weeks ago and this was one of the first strains I bought legally!\u000a        \u000a                     Cost: $5/gram, $15/(1/8th)\u000a                  Local Dispensary: JP Wellness\u000a\u000a 4344 Montebello Drive, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80918\u000a-Ask for Kim if she&#39;s there. She&#39;s well-educated, very helpful and friendly, and will make a first-time weed buyer feel at home and less like a criminal, haha.\u000a\u000aPROS\u000aGreat smell, flavor is out of this world, beautiful buds, etc. The high of this strain consists of phenomenal Sativa effects. Takes about 2-3 minutes to enter MY system, and lasts approx. 30-45 minutes consuming 1/20th of a gram. Produces a variety of changes in my mental processes including; Increased productivity and time management skills, euphoric feelings, regulated/slowed heart rate +increased blood  stabilized moods, ability/desire to accomplish daily tasks with minimal thought effort, actually sat down to write this review haha.\u000a\u000aCons:\u000aDry mouth, dry eyes, I assume those are traits of an Indica. That&#39;s about all the negatives from my experiences, and I am critical about my strain selection. A few other strains I&#39;ve tried resulted in paranoia, this one didn&#39;t create any sense of that or anxiety.\u000a\u000aOverall, I would recommend this strain to try for any Colorado newcomer, or even for the weekend to conquer social anxiety! In my opinion I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to individuals with low blood pressure, as I assume problems could arise if your body reacts like mine and your heart rate slows down, \u000a increased blood flow/oxygen intake=lower blood pressure. I may be wrong, just something to research into if you have a problem as such.

VTastes great, not all that interesting otherwise. Bright tangerine citrus is pronounced in both the aroma and flavor. The taste is a bit sweet, almost candied. The high is disappointing, subtle, a bit of a tease other than some minor trailers at higher doses. This feels more like a Sativa high than a hybrid and even then lacks any real euphoria. Recommended as a tasty option for beginner consumers hoping to start slow, but even then I think you&#39;ll grow out of it quickly.

Vtang haze is a top notch hybrid it is a very light green fluffyish bud with very distinct orange hairs the smell and taste is just like tangerine and very unique the high is great for pain and helps with stress as it helps free your mind it is a great early morning uplifting strain with some indica pain killing qualities but heavy on the sativa

VI don&#39;t like writing bad reviews but... I bought Tangerine Haze from Starbuds in Louisville CO and it&#39;s not for me :(  You can smell the citrus on the flower but it doesn&#39;t transfer into the taste very much.  I would say it is middle of the road, like what used to pass when we had to buy whatever was for sale.  The smoke is harsh and the buzz is lacking.  I don&#39;t know if this is a bad grow or what but be weary! #SWAG

VFirst thought: tastes like hash oil. Yet it&#39;s so smooth, I didn&#39;t cough at all when smoking this.  It mellows you and releases any tension you feel in your body. It&#39;s very emotive, but in a cleansing way. My friend cried when relating a memory of a happy time. It is also good for a few giggles. Although expensive,  I will definitely look for this strain in future. I&#39;d HIGHLY recommend it!

VThe Tangerine Haze was more relaxing than I expected. Probably the G-13 genetics. This is good stuff though, not quite as energizing as some of the other strains I&#39;ve tried for the day, but enough to roll with if you are already feeling alright. It also got rid of a major headache I had, though it didn&#39;t get rid of the pain in my legs from an accident that well. \u000a\u000aWhile I felt totally chill on this strain, according to my wife I looked like I was in pain. I wasn&#39;t though. Then again the time she said that I had had quite a lot... I did feel that a moderate dose was much better for functionality and feeling comfortable around others. In fact it really made me feel calm and collected around people. On this, I was able to remember stuff from a long time ago that I usually am unconscious of. \u000a\u000aI definitely recommend trying this strain!

VTook one two second long hit from a small bong  4:50 pm til 29 hrs later it lasted. This is for me to treat my ptsd but it was overpowering. First, head rush, then woozy like I drank a few shots. Not new to cannabis. It made me less aware of the space around me and put me inward, where I didn\u2019t wanna be. It did silence the background thoughts and literally felt like I had a grey haze around my head the whole time. It couch locked me and I grew frustrated and pent up cause I couldn\u2019t do anything around the house the whole time. I found that it slowed my thoughts down to the point I struggled to speak simple sentences and it also limited my ability to emote to convey to my SO how I was feeling. For me that\u2019s a huge no in my book, being unable to speak properly for myself. When it finally lifted I began to feel better. It solidly pushed me down and was firmly oppressive in nature. This is better for someone in a hospital bed or who wants to be mentally absent. It also dropped my heart rate and blood pressure significantly; 130 became 100; 80 became 70. I am usually 120/80 stable.\u000a\u000aI have CYP450 2c9 DNA deficiency so THC lasts 3 times longer or more in my liver. This strain sapped emotion from me- even positive ones- and felt much like Celexa and Gabapentin (which I took years ago for depression and muscle issues independently)- and seriously scares me how strong it is in my system. I effectively had no beneficial side effects from this. I had no quality of life or functionality on this.
