VThis is possibly the greatest strain I have ever tried. When I get high I want all of me to feel high.  Whole body experience.  Right now I feel completely high. I smoke heavily and have for a very long time.  After packing and clearing a bong 4 times I am laying on my bed feeling so fucking great I had to write a review.  Muscles I can&#39;t name feel high. I think the description here on Leafly is completely accurate &quot;a very intense high that starts in the head and quickly spreads through the body and limbs, and can be beneficial in treating pain, anxiety, depression, and loss of appetite.&quot;

Vthis and Harlequin are my favorite sativas currently. moose and lobsta at lower doses leaves you with energy just a little head spacy and float, feelin&#39; groovy and fluid but smoke a fat bowl or a few to yourself and if you don&#39;t zonk out in to peaceful nap-ta-tude you&#39;ll be having a blast! good strain for watching a comedy and not really having to follow directions or do too much cause I caught myself forgetting I had abowl still goin&#39; starting on missions (to the kitchen, store, outaide, whatev) and I&#39;d just space it 100% but I love this odd ball strain. the cerebral high is really fun

VThis strain is exceptional! As a indica man, let me tell you that this sativa is no joke. Perfect Thanksgiving strain. Very heavy head high yet still leaves you capable of having a full conversation without missing a beat. Nicely euphoric and awesome &quot;Headband-like&quot; haziness over your eyes. Taste is a solid 9-10, tasty hash like fruitiness with a note of diesel. Emerald Dispensary Phoenix location had this wonder, bravo!

VI enjoyed this. I am a weekend smoker and still pretty new trying to figure out what works for me. I am sure I took &quot;small&quot; hits over the course of the night...but others were drinking except me and it allowed me to be very comfortable and chit chat and lots of giggling. I was hoping to feel some of that libido effects and may have in a different setting. Made me overall happy. I am camping so the fire was nice to watch.

VI&#39;ve just enjoyed both the flower and the rosin from this amazing flower.\u000a.\u000aThe smoke is very clean.  Flushed very well.  The buds are the perfect match between dense and spongy.  When ground, the smell is of fresh Concord grapes. But when put in the rosin press this little lady comes to life.\u000a.\u000aThe rosin is light, sticky, and heavenly.\u000aThis variety just went into my &quot;Hell, Yeah&quot; column.  With the nice psychedelic high it is easy to simply drift.\u000aI did have a bit of shakiness with my hands, but not bad.\u000aThis should be a nice ride.

VThis strain feels euphoric in a way other strains just don\u2019t. Every time I see this strain in a dispensary, I buy it regardless. It is absolutely excellent. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a high THC-v content, but this strain feels \u201cfast\u201d in a way other strains do not. After quitting cigarettes, this strain was a godsend for me. The first time I smoked it in a hemp wrap, I thought i had  messed up and purchased nicotine on accident because of the amount of cerebral energy. I think to grow Moose and Lobsta there has to be adderall in the soil or something. Truly a must try strain. Such a unique feel that I haven\u2019t observed in other strains.

VThis strain is very, very coated with white trichomes. It will gum up your buster within a day easily! It smells... interesting... out of the bag. It\u2019s a mix of skunk, fresh grass, and a pungent smell I can\u2019t put my nose on. But it\u2019s definitely weird. Don\u2019t worry! That\u2019s the \u201cworst\u201d thing about this strain. As you smoke it the fruitier flavors and sweetness come out. The high is mostly concentrated in the mind, but like all weed it does eventually settle in the body. It\u2019s high THC content does make you feel like your brain was T-boned by a semi truck, haha! I would call it uplifting, energetic, psychedelic (a little bit). You can for sure get work done, play games, or live up the social scene with this one. Enjoy!
