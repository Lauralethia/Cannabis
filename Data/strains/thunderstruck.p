VI would have liked a stronger buzz.  The pain relief, however, is phenomenal.  Multiple old injuries are far less noticeable.  The description is spot on.

VThis is the perfect strain for Anxiety, you feel really calm and relaxed with slight euphoria, in higher doses definitely felt the Sativa effects and more of the THC side of this strain. Didn\u2019t have much cotton mouth if any. Love the sweet earthy taste it had.The cut that I had tested at 11% CBD and 6.6% THC just to show as a reference.

VI have a bulging disc and this relieves the pain a bit.  Thunderstruck makes me feel relaxed and leaves me with a clear mind.
