VAmazing indica and deserves all of its praise. I already loved ghost Og so when I felt this strain felt like a super enhanced version I was happy. Made me feel extremely happy and was a euphoric high. Was a blast for me when I was just chilling out listening to music. Super fun to do, 4/5

VOne of my top 3 faves from Compassionate Sciences ATC in NJ--they have a very hard time keeping this little known secret in stock! All around strong and effective for pain, muscle spasms, GI issues, depression/anxiety, and appetite. Even as an Indica I am able to vape this during the day and still function around the house but found it could also help me sleep/make me sleepy, especially when smoked.

VI also picked up the Sativa dominant hybrid strain from my ATC in NJ. Wonderful cerebral high, murdering depression. Good appetite stimulation, bye nasuea. Smoking/Vaping all night revealed more of its indica side. Feeling my arms a little a\u005cmore and allowing me a great nights sleep, destroying insomnia. This strain 100% recommend to other medical patients going through chemo and radiation.
