VFluffy nugs with light, sweet aroma and flavor. Mellowing hybrid high that affords for an altogether relaxing experience. More on the side of indica than sativa in terms of the potentially sleepy latent effects, yet somewhat uplifting at the onset.

VThis was a really rough strain to vape and while it did have me buzzing, the euphoric feeling left pretty quickly. \u000aI picked this strain up when it was $25 an eighth and accidentally bought two of them on back to back visits to the dispensary and so it was a long time to finish it all as I didn&#39;t look forward to vaping the flower when it was in my rotation. \u000aCherries Jubilee isn&#39;t a very strong strain and what little high I did get off of it didn&#39;t last long maybe 90 minutes at best. It does do a decent job of putting you in the mood to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t want to smoke this and then go out and party but if you are looking for a mellow high, this might hit the spot.

VThis is absolutely delicious! I actually taste cherries on the exhale. For me, the effects come on nice and smooth. Waves of happy, worry-free bliss followed by a body high to match. Mentally functional until the end when sleep finally takes me.

VDefinitely one of my top 5 favorite strains. It&#39;s an indica, but doesn&#39;t make you feel bogged down or glued to the couch. The flavor is nice, but what I like most about Cherries Jubilee is the feeling of euphoria and happiness it gives me. It also doesn&#39;t hurt that it never causes me paranoia or anxiety. Amazing.#420sweepstakes
