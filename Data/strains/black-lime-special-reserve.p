VBlack lime reserve is more like a cherry spicy lime aide.Flavor burst of this flower just lingers on your tongue.My new go to strain being a huge fan of NL and Chem.It was a no brainer! Smell of the flower was spicy, chem, lemon, cherry cough drop smell.Budz glittered tight compact budz. Taste spicy cherry lime aide lime aide. Effect 50/50 w/ Kannabrix Cbd syrup 5mg on 2% thc 52% cbd on deck.Morning or night strain. Great for watching squirrels or cleaning house.Concetrate got to be amazing

VThis is a smooth smoke. The citrus lemon taste is strong, and there&#39;s a hint of tar or pine tar underneath. Black Lime is relaxing and headier than most indicas. Unlike a lot of other reviewers, my particular pheno was definitely indica leaning. The strain is of medium potency. I seemed to be especially sensitive to vibrations (neighbors walking in their apartment) and noises outside. I went to sleep about an hour after smoking this and while it helped, it doesn&#39;t stand out in that respect. This is a good smoke if you want to chill out, that&#39;s about it. After this I realized I much prefer sativas, generally speaking.

VI love this stuff. I bought it because my favorite dispensary was out of everything I wanted and the reviews on this looked good. It ended up being a wonderful choice; I bought an 8th the moment I ran out of my original gram. It&#39;s a very chill high, the kind of weed that&#39;s good to smoke an hour before bed, to ease you into sleep. It makes me feel so good and relaxed. I&#39;m contemplative, but my thoughts flow loose and free instead of racing. Very mild body high. Such a pleasant strain, the best stuff if you want to get high and cuddle with your girlfriend, and talk about deep shit before going to sleep. I mix in some Lavender if I want to conk out faster and have a stronger body high, or, conversely, add a bit of this to Lavender if I want a gentle cerebral buzz. BLSR is mellow. understated, and altogether amazing.

VThe strain comes in nice semi small to medium to big plump nuggets. The color had Orange hairs or freckles, a nice dark lime color. The smell is sweet, floral and enticing. The feel of the smoke against my throat isn&#39;t harsh and is quite light, smoke tastes like delicious fried fish that&#39;s well seasoned with just the right amount pepper and seasoning salt. The physical effects are relaxing, strong pain relief yet light on the body without feeling heavy, semi tingling throughout certain extremities. The mental effects are very therapeutic also with relaxation, happiness, a unique calmness, social and awareness, in the beginning and semi-middle energy then from the end of semi-middle to the end meaning later after usage the effects of an effortless feeling of sleepiness that&#39;s welcoming.

VMild come-on that\u2019s starts a little in the head and slowly grows until your mind feels blank. Still able to think and form thoughts in a way like surfing - it\u2019s fun and feels good, but short and easy to lose focus. Head isn\u2019t so much cloudy as wrapped more tightly, like headband. Tingly streaks and currents of pleasurable relaxation cascade through the body. Music has a strong, rich presence that\u2019s easy to fully take in. Surprisingly clear mental space prevents getting really lost in it, though it\u2019s still very entertaining. Watching stuff is similarly engaging, just not best in class. Overall, it\u2019s a pleasant, relaxing haze that\u2019s too clear-minded. Really fighting my eyes from drooping and nothing sounds better than a nap even though I just woke up and was wide-awake prior to smoking. Overall, good for medicating physical symptoms...otherwise fine, if unremarkable. 6/10 p.s. Just saw it has Purple Kush in it, which would explain the premature crash. Always seems to happen with purples.

VThis, to me, if a hybrid...in my own experience seemed to really lean towards the indica. If it leaned more to the sativa side, I surely didn&#39;t feel that. Sativa&#39;s make me hear voices &amp; get paranoid lol. It smells nicely of citrus and a tiny bit of earth. Flowers are not dry and not too soft but is dense. Smokes nicely. The &quot;smoking pot&quot; smell goes away quickly unlike some of the diesels.\u000aIt didn&#39;t take much to get me euphoric and very relaxed. If trying this one and only toke occasionally, I&#39;d start out with just a little and then you can always go for more. You start feeling the effects about 2-5 minutes in. This one is going to go on my list. It&#39;s going to be a favorite.

VI recently picked up an 1/8th of this from Trumed in AZ and I am so stoked on it. The second they opened the jar, I was hit with overwhelming scents of peppercorn, pine and lime zest. I had no knowledge of the strain and just came across it. I immediately bought an 8th and burned through it. I see a lot of mixed feedback about what it is, as it&#39;s being advertised as an Indica and people say it&#39;s a Sativa dominant hybrid, but regardless of what it is, the important part is that it&#39;s amazing. It tastes just like it smells, and the high is slightly cerebral and very uplifting. It immediately relieved the tension in my chest and shoulders. The high comes on quick and just chills you out. \u000a\u000a Very good for anxiety and depression as well as pain. I&#39;ve been pairing it with a pure CBD vape and it&#39;s been helping me like you wouldn&#39;t believe. To make matters better, it tastes like citrus candy, it&#39;s sticky as can be and if you see it... grab some!

And not too harsh even though a peppery taste. Was planning on writing more but I want to get back to the Black Lime.. Nice times ahead tonite. &#128512;

VI was drawn to this strain because I&#39;m a fan of one of its parents, northern lights. \u000aMuch like its parent strain, BLSR helps to ease the anxiety and depression that I have due to PTSD. It relaxes my body but doesn&#39;t couch lock me, and I find myself thinking and speaking more creatively after smoking it.\u000aThe buds were very frosty with trichomes and it was the strongest smelling weed I&#39;ve purchased in awhile. It definitely didn&#39;t disappoint, especially for only $23 an 1/8th.

VI was not a fan of this strain at all. This cos have been a bad or old batch but I  found my buds to be very dry, frail and crumbly; so much that a grinder was completely unnecessary. The aroma was very earthy and a hint ground black pepper but not very pungent. The smoke was a bit harsher than usual and the effects were very short lived. The dispensary sold this strain as a premium shelf strain as well. Side effects include:  finding new strains on leafly to try next time

VI really enjoy this peppery scented bud and the slight lime flavor that accompanies it. It has never failed to put me into a relaxed, yet uplifted state. This is the first strain I have encountered that had the occasional &quot;tingling&quot; sensation. It&#39;s a nice bonus. The buds are dense and bushy, colored a mid-green with deep orange hairs creeping all throughout.
