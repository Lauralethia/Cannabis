VThis wax will give you the leg up you need.\u000aRight off the bat you&#39;ll notice the moist texture of the crumble, this is a good sign.  The high is energetic but also relaxing, your standard hybrid affair.  Taste is that of a subtly cooked pound cake mixed with essence of weed.

VThe scent is mellow and somewhat similar to OG Kush, not citrus-sour nor skunky.  There&#39;s a bit of fruitiness to it.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s one of the best smelling strains I&#39;ve had.  The buds themselves are light green from heavy trichrome dusting.   They are tight, dense buds and are marbled with light orange hairs which are similarly trichrome covered.  Under a magnifying glass, the buds just look beautiful.  The smoke tastes great filtered through my 2-ft 5150 Glass single perc.  There are definite lemon notes on the exhale.  The smoke is smooth and I didn&#39;t cough at all.  After two bong rips, the high came on quickly and just keeps going up.  My body is relaxed and comfortable, but my head has been affected the most.  The head high is calm but alert.  Although I &quot;feel&quot; high, I am able to focus on tasks without attention span problems.

VThis is another review of a sample I&#39;ve tried and was frankly VERY unimpressed! Once again I obtained this from an Ann Arbor delivery service that isn&#39;t on Leafly. The sample came from seeds obtained from DNA Genetics and the delivery service claimed they had it tested at 31.6% THC and just this figure alone should tell you how &quot;factual&quot; it is. If this stuff is one of the highest THC strains around than high THC strains SUCK!!! LOL I also sampled 3 other strains from this service, Lemon Skunk and Doc&#39;s OG, both also from DNA, and although they say the THC% is less, I find them significantly better and not only that they are half the price of the Lemon OG. I&#39;m not sure on the authenticity of the actual strain I got, but if it is what they claim it to be, than it isn&#39;t very good and definitely way overpriced. I assume the latter because there are other dispensary&#39;s in the are that sell the same strain for half the price so this leads me to believe it isn&#39;t a great strain overall, when they are charging more for other strains that are rated much higher by many more people.

VGrew two clones from 6 inches easily, they practically grow themselves.  Did one inside with lights, and another in the veg. garden with equally impressive results, for me anyway, none before grew like this in N. CA.  Bud rot appeared after first rain, so beware, but those precious, juicy buds were worth the minimal efforts and energy, just fish emulsion and peat moss for nutrients, with neem oil for a safe pesticide.  Cheap, but could not get any clones of it to survive.\u000a\u000aFor just me and my medical problems, is th bomb.\u000a(;-) =

VSmoking this as I write...Got from Bud Hut in Everett, WA; grower was Top Shelf growers...22%. Smells like straight up Minute Maid lemonade, so sticky I could turn my bowl upside down DQ Blizzard-style and have not a crumble fall out! Tasted like a non-sour lemonhead with a hint of ginger. Only took me three hits to get where I wanted to be! Absolute best strain I&#39;ve ever smoked.

VThis strain isn&#39;t bad, but isn&#39;t my favorite either.\u000a\u000aIt hits you pretty quick, and the head high is definitely a sativa thing, it still carries over too much indica. It makes you feel floaty and dizzy but not really euphoric and happy like a sativa would. \u000a\u000aThe body high is also there, but it is too subtle. It is cozy but not couch locking. \u000a\u000aOverall, this strain has a balance of both types of weed, but sadly it only offers an introductory experience of both indica and sativa. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe one thing that stands out is this weed is the only kush that doesn&#39;t give me a headache! Also this strain gives VERY powerful munchies, not as bad as my experience with some hash plant x g18.\u000a\u000aVery citrus-like smell, though I wouldn&#39;t really call it lemony. You can just barely smell the skunk in the flowers themselves, but once you take your hit, you are given a very sweet, skunky flavor. The weed doesn&#39;t smell NEARLY as strong as other kush&#39;s, after 45 minutes in my closed room, the smell was gone. For comparison, my last kush I tried (Jedi Kush) had an EXTREMELY pungent smell, and it lingered for a day or so. \u000a\u000aThis is a pretty good strain for sleeping, but only when you need to. I am able to fall asleep the same time every night (11:30pm-12am) because of the weed. When bed time rolls around, this stuff knocks me out HARD. One minute I may be pigging out watching netflix and the next I may be totally asleep. It seems quite uplifting during the day though.\u000a\u000aWhenever I smoke this stuff, I get very dizzy. It is sort of like a euphoric drunkenness. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOverall, I feel like this strain would be best mixed with a pure sativa or indica, just because it only offers a tease of both.

VHeavy heavy heady Indica. Great for when it&#39;s time to shut off any and all mind noise. I can be smoking another Indica all day and then sit on the couch and take a few hits of the CT medical program liquid cart and BOOM ..... Nothing. Brain done.\u000a\u000aVery effective for quick onset panic, anxiety etc. clears the mind quickly. Heady high but you don&#39;t need to or want to think too much, a gentle haze \u000a\u000aLike tonight I was out and all I had on me was some white bastard. I had a panic/ neurotic freak out mixed with pain and the white bastard only helped so much . That is sedating but nothing like this Lemon OG kush. This strain helps more with that and very quickly. A few hits and it&#39;s hits hard \u000a\u000aCan&#39;t say much for the taste other than an undertone of citrus. I&#39;m using vape oil. And I&#39;m on the couch and thoroughly relaxed and calm and my mind is quite. Not euphoric, not quite foggy but kinda just being. Very much like meditating. Smoke and clear the mind... \u000a\u000aBut all I can really say is tune in turn on and drop out with this one

VLemon OG should be renamed &quot;something that&#39;s good&quot;. So when anyone asks for something that&#39;s good, lemon og is what they get.\u000aOne of my favorite strains. Numerous red hairs network through semi dense green and beige sticky wet looking nugs. I&#39;ve seen shades of purple and blue in some nugs. Smell is like pine sol. Lemon, chemical, eucalyptus, with under tones of fresh cut wood, skunk, and hash. Taste is sweet and pungent like the aroma. Heavy on inhale the eucalyptus taste is more like a feel that drops into my lungs expanding immediately. Exhaling the expansion gives goosebumps with low tolerance. Cough is immediately, severe, and long. Happiness is immediate and doesn&#39;t fade out through the entire high. Relaxed in mind. Couch lock is questionable, it&#39;s nice. Body high is all over and strong in face. My eyes feel it the most. Nerves nice and relaxed. Over doing it easily can cause me to get drowsy. Dry mouth is barely noticeable, because I&#39;m so high and stoned. Over all, a really great strain.\u000a\u000aRecommend for anything and anyone.

VFirst of all let me set the background. It was a warm humid day on April 19th I texted a friend asking if he knew anyone who could get me a LOT of that green flower we all enjoy. The next day I went and picked up about an ounce of this lovely bud.\u000a\u000a- review -\u000aI\u2019ve now consumed all of what I purchased and and I can tell you one thing for certain, you can\u2019t go wrong with this strain. The onset was indeed very quick. The first thing I recognized was a cerebral high followed by the body shortly after. You all probably know what I mean when I say my head entered a *whomp whomp* state for the next hour or so without being distracting mind you. My body became heavy without making me sit Idle for the duration of the high. It was really enjoyable when I smoked a bowl and then sat down and played a good story based game on my Xbox. I\u2019m not sure what it was about it that allowed me to really focus on the narrative but it was amazing. I\u2019m not sure i would\u2019ve been able to finish far cry 5 as quickly as I did without smoking this lovely bud. It\u2019s 100% in my top 5 favorite strains. As far as aroma I was hit with a nose full of earthy/citrus accents. The taste was also great it wasn\u2019t harsh and when I smoked it through my nicely chilled bubbler it was super flavorful while still not being too hot (remember the smaller the opening you inhale through the richer the flavor) as far as munchies go I wouldn\u2019t say I had the need to eat most likely due to me being on a rather high dose of vyvanse. Now I will say whenever food was placed in front of me and I would start to eat, there was no stopping me. \u000a\u000a- Rating -\u000aI\u2019ll be basing it off of 4 key elements; smell, flavor, high and the length of the high. I\u2019ll rate each element out of 5 for a total of 20 points (this is the opinion of one stoner so take it all with a grain of salt) \u000a\u000aSmell - 4.5\u000aFlavor - 3.5\u000aHigh - 4.5\u000aLength of high - 2 (it was a decent length but I bet it would\u2019ve been longer if my tolerance was lower lol)\u000aTotal- 14.5\u000a\u000aOverall it\u2019s an excellent strain for all stoners but I would recommend it for the day time stoner who wants to enjoy life and enjoy a strong high without being unable to function! \u000a\u000a

VFor the sensory effect alone, Lemon OG Kush is the gold standard of the medical strains I&#39;ve had the pleasure to try insofar. The lemony fragrance from the bud is pleasant for a guy like me with a bit of a sweet/sour tooth. This strain left a sweet aftertaste that lingered as the head high kicked in, though of course a bit of dry mouth to go along with it. The smoke itself gives away the skunky undertones, but its the citrusy flavors that once you&#39;ve exhaled. As far smoking a bud goes, I would liken this experience to eating a sour gummi- my favorite!

Mine is an indica-dominant strain, yet hits more like a hybrid, which I prefer, in that it is not sleepy, but cerebral, and not couch-locking, but quite mellowing.. a new fave added to my medical (treasure-)chest!  Would give 4.5\u2728, if possible.. if only for lack of intense, euphoric-punch (but some days, that&#39;s exactly what i need!) \u262e

VLemon OG Kush is in a category of it&#39;s own. If you have a dispensary that delivers good medicine like Hardcore Harvest in Montrose Michigan, and you happen to come across this strain, don&#39;t pass it up. There is no wait, no creep here. You&#39;ll start to feel the very unique cerebral effects almost instantly. The sativa side comes on fast and strong, but like Leafly&#39;s description, it quickly mellows into a full body relaxation. A little goes a long way with this wild bastard! Excellent for stress, anxiety! Good for pain, but there is better.

The first 10-15 mins I really felt it\u2019s sativa qualities, but after that I got really couch locked. Munchies are a thing, so make sure to have some snacks around. I recommend this as a late afternoon to evening bud, because you will have some great sleep.

VLemon Og has a nice mild brain buzz and a relaxing body high that gives off the best of both worlds. Pungent lemony smell and frosted buds are the best example I have seen of Lemon OG. Buzz lasts anywhere from 45-1.5 hours and has a slow decline so you&#39;re not left hanging and anxiety ridden.  I can medicate with Lemon OG to find some rest or take a hike. Lemon OG is a definite favorite of the Hybrids.

VOH My CannaGods this is a strain I have wanted so much to try for at least two years. From those guys at DNA Genetics. And a Skunk based genetic at that and NO wonders why I love it so.  She is a 50/50 perfect blend of Las Vegas Lemon Skunk x OG#18.  She has a bag nose of the richest Meyer Lemon Zest Limonene terpenes that I have ever had my nose in.  And that after my 48th year of Cannabis use.  She has some intriguing Berry overtones as well.  This is one strain that I will request beans of and it will remain one of my go to morning strains !!!

VThis is an everyday strain. I hadn&#39;t had much experience with it until today, and with only three hits, I was transported to Utopia. It&#39;s made me feel euphoric, calm, in the moment, and just generally feeling really good. The psychoactive effects don&#39;t hit hard, and last for quite awhile; and when you come down, you don&#39;t come down like a piano on a cartoon cat, with a lot of sads....you come down pleasantly, like a puppy on a cloud.

Smells very lemony which is no surprise and gave me an amazing relaxing high. Munchies as usually and got a great sleep with it.

VDense, and extremely aromatic, mainly due to its OG parentage, Lemon OG provides a pleasant, citrus-ridden smoke that both uplifts cerebral spirits, and  dulls physical discomfort. Prepare beforehand for a heavy dose of the munchies. Not a wake and bake strain, but definitely a heavy candidate for mid-day, and evening use. Under the tree this Christmas &#127876;

VI love Lemon OG. It was a strain that grew on me, kind of like an acquired taste. Its a 60/40, and anything beyond a 50/50 will set off my anxiety, so this is a perfect fruity exotic strain. Very unique smell(lemon) and taste(floral lemon) come along with this strain, and quite a bit of heady potency. A good daytime strain, does not make me fall asleep which is great for use during physical activities as it alleviates my pain while not making me groggy. It is a cross between Las Vegas Lemon Skunk and OG #18, and oh what a pairing. The finest of the fine. Even the popcorn nugs are desirable. Love this strain when it has been grown right.

VThis strain is one that i would recommend to someone to use during the day. Although it is an indica and should put you to sleep i found that it did quite the opposite. The effects don&#39;t last as long as i would expect and it kept me awake rather than putting me to sleep. I also had some paranoia and a headache after smoking. The smell is extremely strong and the taste is a citrusy kush taste. Very strong but not recommended for night time use for insomnia.

Vseven only on price.. this lemon strain.. LEMON KUSH was pretty on point.. it was a believe a 60/40% indica strain, and you could feel the indica (in the couch) effect right away which was nice.  Definately not a creeper.. it was a air bud structure but produced fine red hairs and full tricomes.. Id pick up an ounce if I had the dough.. 60 for 5 grams aint bad though.. thanks green light delivery!

THE JOINTS I PICKED UP WERE SO PACKED AND TIGHTLY ROLLED  THAT I COULDN&#39;T GET A FULL PUFF AT IT, UNTIL I TORE APART THE JOINT.

I told him too late, he said just make sure your pallet is clear this will blow your mind.  he got to the house, we packed my dirty pipe and I was a little confused.  I got a light lemon taste but nothing earth shattering.  knowing how excited he was I said dude we should have rolled a j with a wick.  then I understood. it was like I was smokin lemonade.  by the time the joint was gone I was off in lala land. I felt fantastic. body heavy, mind fully at ease.  can&#39;t wait till it&#39;s fully cured and ready for sale.

VOh man, this stuff is definitely potent.  I am not a huge fan of the lemon taste... a little too skunky for me, but it certainly does the job.  It has a very citrus-y, woody spice to it.  It does give you a KILLER case of the munchies, and I need to try to lay off of that.  ha! \u000a\u000aAlmost immediately, it gives you this heavy head high, but you can definitely feel an all-over body effect within about 10 minutes.

VI got this from a local dispensary in southern oregon, it quickly rose to my top 5 favorite as I went back for more 2 days later. A very piney pungent og blends perfectly with the lemon flavor that is so strong it&#39;s almost sour. If you enjoy citrus in your smoke while being laid out this is definitely a strain you will love! Great for night time or a heavy daytime anxiety relief.

Vok so, I&#39;m usually an indica only person. I don&#39;t usually ever even smoke a hybrid. but, after a few bowls of some mendu kush, I took a fat rip of some lemon OG kush. \u000athis stuff is fire. what a fantastic journey this takes you on. really has become a favorite pretty damn quick. what everyone says is true. you do get a little head fuzz, but it&#39;s awsome and the body buzz is seriously relaxing. Lemon OG Kush is a great smoke. A must have smoke.

VA fantastic Kush strain! This stuff, when grown properly, is one of the more perfect strains in exsistance. The structure of the buds are like hard, tight , medium size buds covered with crystals and smelling a little bit like a skunky rose. I liken the effects to that of OG Kush, although the sativa properties lend an uplifting feeling initially. Lemon smells way better than the OG as well. This is one you can smoke with the ladies. I give it a 4.6/5\u000a

VThe batch that I received of Lemon OG from Washington was phenomenal.  After two treatments courtesy of my vaporizer, I was in a mental stupor - zoning in and out.  If you have lofty goals and a lot to get done, this is definitely NOT what I would be medicating with!  I&#39;ll stick to my Jack for that.  I actually started to trip after a solid two trenches on my magic-flight.  By far the most potent indica I&#39;ve ever had.  Oh -from my experience, you WILL pass out after 3 hours or so. No matter how hard you fight it or try to caffeinate it, it&#39;ll happen.. After you empty the fridge!

Gives a positive feeling, a state of mind where it&#39;s easy to let go of things and see them from a broader perspective. \u000a\u000aI find it easy to focus very intense on thoughts, they really expand, which I find perfect for visualization. \u000a\u000aMakes me relaxed but actually more productive and creative. \u000a\u000aI had it in a vaporizer from Crater, it works wonderfully with weed.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend.

VThis is an everyday strain. I hadn&#39;t had much experience with it until today, and with only three hits, I was transported to Utopia. It&#39;s made me feel euphoric, calm, in the moment, and just generally feeling really good. The psychoactive effects don&#39;t hit hard, and last for quite awhile; and when you come down, you don&#39;t come down like a piano on a cartoon cat, with a lot of sads....you come down pleasantly, like a puppy on a cloud.

VLemon Og has a nice mild brain buzz and a relaxing body high that gives off the best of both worlds. Pungent lemony smell and frosted buds are the best example I have seen of Lemon OG. Buzz lasts anywhere from 45-1.5 hours and has a slow decline so you&#39;re not left hanging and anxiety ridden.  I can medicate with Lemon OG to find some rest or take a hike. Lemon OG is a definite favorite of the Hybrids.

Yep, I coughed for straight 30 seconds. The high was more uplifting at first. I felt light as a feather. Also with a feeling of face tingles, it was pretty ticklish. Then that face feel goes to your whole body but more intense. I\u2019m just smiling, looking over at my friend. Just realizing he was talking to me the whole time, but I was just enjoying this high.

VDecent geometry with trapezoidal clusters of yellow-green nuggets &amp; foliage, generally coated with a pale orange/yellow dust. The occasional tricomb like a missed hair while shaving reminds me of my puberty. Noice.\u000a\u000aA cow-shit kind of smell. Lightly sweet on top, musty undertones. Not exactly my favorite, but more intriguing because of its uniqueness. I keep sniffing it and pushing the bag away again. \u000a\u000aGrinds easily. Not very sticky, but not dry and crumbly either. Soft to the touch. Feathery, even. \u000a\u000aSmells better upon packing the bowl. The lemon scent has started to come up and the cow-shit has disappeared. Really a kind of lemon-medicine (vs., say, lemon-fruit) smell instead of the traditional skunky smell. \u000a\u000aMakes for a beautiful bowl when packed. The range of greens and approximate uniform size/shape gives it fish-scales appearance. You can sort of see the rate and locations at which this will burn.\u000a\u000aA very floral taste, she says. Not much of a strong sense of taste buds on me, admittedly, but I can detect a long-lingering aftertaste (whatever it is). Burns slowly looks meh (no eye-catching cherries), leaves the mouth a little hot. The smoke is a wide, thin, horizontal layer of wispy light grey fog, not bold and thick and white. \u000a\u000aHigh in the front of my head. Eyes focus pretty intensely as I type. Hot smoke now. Totally fun and unassuming, though it gets your attention (very different from the Qwerkle high preceding it) pretty quickly. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VI love Lemon OG. It was a strain that grew on me, kind of like an acquired taste. Its a 60/40, and anything beyond a 50/50 will set off my anxiety, so this is a perfect fruity exotic strain. Very unique smell(lemon) and taste(floral lemon) come along with this strain, and quite a bit of heady potency. A good daytime strain, does not make me fall asleep which is great for use during physical activities as it alleviates my pain while not making me groggy. It is a cross between Las Vegas Lemon Skunk and OG #18, and oh what a pairing. The finest of the fine. Even the popcorn nugs are desirable. Love this strain when it has been grown right.

VOH My CannaGods this is a strain I have wanted so much to try for at least two years. From those guys at DNA Genetics. And a Skunk based genetic at that and NO wonders why I love it so.  She is a 50/50 perfect blend of Las Vegas Lemon Skunk x OG#18.  She has a bag nose of the richest Meyer Lemon Zest Limonene terpenes that I have ever had my nose in.  And that after my 48th year of Cannabis use.  She has some intriguing Berry overtones as well.  This is one strain that I will request beans of and it will remain one of my go to morning strains !!!

VAwesome, went into a tourist hang in my city.. payed like double the price, but well worth it. This strain has an interesting taste taken from both Kush and Haze. Smell of wet grass and a little lemon juice. Had a happy day, though it started raining... \u000a\u000aNot to sure about the munchies from this one, bad timing or just not the best to boost your appetite

VThis strain is in my top 10. Upon looking at it, it looks great! It has a lemony citrus taste, and a great body buzz. The first 10-15 mins I really felt it\u2019s sativa qualities, but after that I got really couch locked. Munchies are a thing, so make sure to have some snacks around. I recommend this as a late afternoon to evening bud, because you will have some great sleep.

VLemon OG Kush is in a category of it&#39;s own. If you have a dispensary that delivers good medicine like Hardcore Harvest in Montrose Michigan, and you happen to come across this strain, don&#39;t pass it up. There is no wait, no creep here. You&#39;ll start to feel the very unique cerebral effects almost instantly. The sativa side comes on fast and strong, but like Leafly&#39;s description, it quickly mellows into a full body relaxation. A little goes a long way with this wild bastard! Excellent for stress, anxiety! Good for pain, but there is better.

It&#39;s definitely a different lemon flavour than your usual lemon hazes, but I do prefer a more pungent flavour myself. People saying it gives them munchies, but for me it was an appetite suppressor. Otherwise, happy and relaxed effects, and a cerebral relaxant for sure. Highly recommended!\u000a

Vseven only on price.. this lemon strain.. LEMON KUSH was pretty on point.. it was a believe a 60/40% indica strain, and you could feel the indica (in the couch) effect right away which was nice.  Definately not a creeper.. it was a air bud structure but produced fine red hairs and full tricomes.. Id pick up an ounce if I had the dough.. 60 for 5 grams aint bad though.. thanks green light delivery!

VThis strain is one that i would recommend to someone to use during the day. Although it is an indica and should put you to sleep i found that it did quite the opposite. The effects don&#39;t last as long as i would expect and it kept me awake rather than putting me to sleep. I also had some paranoia and a headache after smoking. The smell is extremely strong and the taste is a citrusy kush taste. Very strong but not recommended for night time use for insomnia.

VMy favorite Craft Cannabis strain and one of my All Time favorite along with some Grand Daddy Purp I got here in Las Vegas! The taste is amazing! You can literally taste every aspect of the plant in one hit, but makes you want that taste from ever strain you get! With Lemon Og you are never dissatisfied! Then you calculate the price, 160/oz big phat nugs, if I ha the money I&#39;d stock up for 60 years so I can enjoy it for the rest of my life.

VI was given a few flowers to try from a friend, he admitted they were whispy, but that doesn&#39;t always translate to bad bud. The structure looked pretty good, but they definitely weren&#39;t dense. The smell was a faint lemony aroma, pleasant, but not strong. Unfortunately it seems the grower harvested a little early, trichomes are almost all clear. The smoke was okay. Light and heady, I didn&#39;t get the medicinal benefits I was expecting and the duration of what effects were present subsided rather quickly. I\u000aThis is just one of those unfortunate reviews where the grower just wasn&#39;t able to show off what I believe this strain fully has to offer. I look forward to trying a 4 star (or better) sample of this someday, until then.

VLemon OG was very kind to me. It made me feel very relaxed but it didn&#39;t force me into sleep it gently slid me into it.  Depending on your tolerance of course. Also I had very peaceful and happy dreams. I woke up refreshed and recharged. Mellow.
