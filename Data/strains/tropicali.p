VI&#39;m typically a sativa smoker so this strain gave me the giggles and was just a chill brain high for a couple hours. It&#39;s great at parties and for daytime smoking, but would definitely have a bowl while cooking dinner or so.

VGreat smell very flowery type of smell. love the texture of the bud and the color very light green. \u000aThe smoke was smooth with a bit of dryness in the after taste. overall best!! I actually time my high with this strain and it was last 2:00 hours . just a cool fact

VI was too smacked to realize what I was doing half the time it was sick. If I had any pains I wouldn&#39;t know. I like it, but it&#39;s kinda makes you more quite than talkative.
