VInteresting Hybrid.  Very strong strain. Definitely feel that Stoney OG high, but there is an alert Sativa-ness to it as well, all adding up to a potent  mix of sensations.

VGot some beast mode og by red label. Doesn\u2019t look that great because it\u2019s outdoor and was on the low shelf. Effects are amazingly strong but not enjoying the speedy thoughts, some tense nerves, and talkativeness in the beginning. What was good was the strong relaxation in body and mind. Mind is calm and happy. Smoke had expanded decently strong during inhale and stayed consistent through exhale. Good long cough. Taste is woody, sweet like cream, and spicy like coriander. Moon cookies x with Tahoe og? I don\u2019t like the sativa genetics to much in this but maybe it\u2019s the low shelf talking. I\u2019m not going to get this again.

VI never needed very much of this strain to get me where I wanted. I get a very active mind but at the same time I zone out and relax. Perfect for a late night hangout or to help you catch some solid Zzz&#39;s.
