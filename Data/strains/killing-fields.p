VPerfect preparty rush charge. Awesome lemony sweet marked flavour and an awesome crescent active hit that makes you ready for the night. Good match, the presence of the &quot;Jack Herer&quot; is clear. Happy buzz. :) \u000a4.5

VI really enjoy the flavor of this strain. The high is very uplifting and did I mention the flavor?? OMG the lenomene is so strong and that is my favorite flavor profile (Could ya tell). The strain I recently reviewed was testing at 19.74% and it was that and some! Great for early mornings. Sharpens the mind and knocks out and bad mood you&#39;re in. Definitely a must try.

VI would have to say beside blue dream, berry o is my definite go to. Even though it is a sativa I always feel relaxed and comfortable, aka no couch lock. Berry O defined helps with pain and is a good strain for boosting a good mood and creativity.

VSuperb strain! This shit was incredible. I had got to try the purple pheno the solid one and it literally made all the colors around me form into one. Very intense and psychadelic and uplifting. Very strong sativa effects. Had a fuely berry smell with a tinge of musk and the smoke smelled like incense and haze. Totally recommend to anyone thay loves a good true sativa!

VI am giving this a nine because while the test I had of it was not grown to what I believe she has the potential to do. Also because whatever it may lack in thc cbd wise the aroma and the complex berry, grape, lemony, slight hint of diesel flavor makes up for and surpasses any short comings. Can&#39;t wait to run her in my medical garden. Hoping for a solid purple pheno. From what I have had the green pheno has more of the lemon tinged with diesel with grape overtones. Complex on the pallet to say the least. However the true purple pheno (this thing would make Prince say damn that is purple!) I am hoping to catch one, it was like inhaling grape / berry kool-aide. Freaking amazing! I would love to have the purple pheno for an everyday smoke just because of the taste!
