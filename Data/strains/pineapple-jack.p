VI have mixed feelings about this strain. For me, it was a major creeper, so the first time I tried it I had a little too much and had a minor freak out. Not a paranoia freak-out, more of an anti-social kinda thing. The next few times were a lot better. It makes everything pop a little louder. Colors are more vibrant, every thought is an epiphany, and everything has a lot more emotional intensity. Very float-y. I also got a lot of energy. But, it was a little dizzying, and took away too much thinking ability for my liking. I think I&#39;ll try this every once in a while to fly around a bit (maybe while jamming, or at a show, or the theatre) but it&#39;s a little too exciting for everyday. I also got pretty tired when it wore off.

Vthis is one of the best sativas I&#39;ve smoked. It&#39;s very relaxing hiwever I&#39;m still energetic enough to carry on throughout my day. I do find the crash is pretty strong and very similar to when I&#39;ve smoked an indica strain. but the effects of Pineapple Jack are well worth it!

VOne of the best sativas that I&#39;ve smoked. An all-around great daytime strain with an incredibly Unforgettable Aroma and taste like he&#39;s never had before.  I will never disappointed everytime I smoke this whether it was one to two hits or one to two bowls it has a very prominent uplifting effect on me.  Its effects are very noticeable but not overwhelming which makes it perfect for daytime smoke.

VWow, I got this strain as filler so I could meet Yerba\u2019s delivery minimum and I am so very glad. Indeed, I am most elated! Rain for days hurts with Arthritis and left me feeling tortured and mighty blue and now my mean ole neuropathic pain has a stupid grin on it\u2019s face. I was already a fan of it\u2019s parent, Jack Herer when it comes to reducing pain but combining it with Pineapple means what ouchies yet remain I no longer care about and can go about my day. Mind you not operating any machinery, like a blender for instance ;) Beautiful dark green tight bud with just enough brown orange in the pistols to provide skin pain relief. The flavor is excellent, slightly waxy earth, strong pine with a bit of diesel, not very coughy. Comes on strong and can be maintained. My new favorite hard day\u2019s cure for sure.

VI experienced Pineaple Jack with my new Da Vinci vaporizer. I will have to write a glowing review sometime about using it. So easy. I did several hits of Pineapple Jack and loved the taste...especially the aftertaste. The combination of earthy and citrus was sharp and memorable. This is a relaxing strain, with some prolonged head high.  It significantly relaxed me, with a small amount of euphoria. I imagine if I did a lot more at one sitting other elements would show up.

VWas super excited to try this strain and it didn&#39;t disappoint. Very uplifting and a great way to relax without getting stuck to the couch after a long day of work. I&#39;m such the couch would have been a great experience as well though.

VIt seemed pretty mild to me. Not much of an effect unless I committed to the whole bowl. LOVED the smell! Reminded me of a pineapple candy. Mmmm... munchies.  Not much of a help with the pain, though.

VThis one is decent. I agree with many of the other reviews I that this is a lighter feeling high. I wouldn\u2019t pay the top shelf price for this again personally. The taste is fresh and zesty, but I can never comment on the \u201ctrue\u201d taste (vaporized) because I\u2019m smoking joints and blunts only as I don\u2019t have a vape at the moment. &#129320;\u000aIf you like a light, fresh Sativa, or a Sativa for someone who wants to \u201cease in\u201d to it, you might try it IF you can find it for the right price. As far as top shelf flower? There are plenty of choices that blow this one away at this price point.  One thing of note...I\u2019ve smoked a whole eighth of this and there is no red eye effect, and no dry mouth at all. Amazing.  I am about to order pizza with dessert and shit though so....&#129335;&#127995;\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  This might be a good niche med for people wanting a Sativa that stimulates appetite.  It smells a lot like Jack Herer but with extra pine sol or astringent to it. In a good way. It\u2019s hard to describe but it\u2019s quite zesty and robust, it reminds me of a fresh cut lawn.  So again, I\u2019d smoke it, I\u2019d buy it for the right price, but it doesn\u2019t represent to pend Sativa.

VThe Pineapple Jack is my favorite strain so far. It gives me the pain relief of an Indica in a Sativa dominant. It&#39;s a great &quot;day strain&quot; that still keeps me functional and energizes me when I need to focus. \u000aAlso Greenleaf Farms is the best company around by far!! &#128077; I highly recommend them. They are always super fast and friendly, my favorite company as well! &#128515;

VAll around solid Sativa strain.  Nice body buzz to go along with the incredibly uplifting, clear headed sativa high.  One of the best things about this strain is the aroma which is very tropical, it has one of the most unique smells and tastes you will find.  The looks are great as well.  Never dissapointed when I smoked this whether it was 1-2 hits or 1-2 bowls, itll always add a nice prominant effect to your day.  Good for deppression, creativity, energy strain...etc.

Vthis stuff is gr8 damn this helps me go to class focused as all heck. love learning on this strain also makes interacting with people fun because it can be kind of an intense head high so when you gotta ask yr classmate afterwards for their email so you can compile a study guide with them for the exam you might stumble over your words a bit
