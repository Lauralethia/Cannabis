VGood for:  Beginner smokers &amp; the anxious\u000a\u000aPros:  Super mild, relaxing.  Starts off in the body, but does get a bit psycho-active after about half an hour...leaves you relaxed &amp; happy.  &quot;High&quot; lasts about 2 hours and then...\u000a\u000aCons: I get a headache 2 hours after smoking.   Taken at night I have weird, unpleasant dreams.

Vso far my favorite strain I&#39;ve smoked. This strain completely allows me to relax after a stressful day and takes away my anxiety. Top shelf medicine at its finest.

VVery fun strain to smoke. For me, it made me very productive, cleaned my room and went for a jog. But also very giggly, went to taco bell with my friend and we were laughing so hard in line that we couldn&#39;t order food. Very slow head high, takes about 20 mins to get built, at least for me.

VOne of the only strains that really helps me. I have severe anxiety, and suffer from depersonalization / derealization. Marijuana usually makes these issues worst, but this gives a nice relaxing feeling. As one user said, its like a antianxiety medication, without the script.

V-Almost entirely without any psychoactive elements, this strain is a top notch anti-inflammatory.\u000a-Very earthy and woody, these flowers taste of sweet grass when vaporized.\u000a-A very relaxed, positive, and mellow feeling.\u000a-One of the absolute best medicinal strains available!

VMy all-time favorite. Perfect for relaxing a bit between getting home from work and cooking dinner...where you can take the edge off completely but still be able to function clearly. It&#39;s the best of every world and all I&#39;d ever buy if given the choice.
