VA sweet tasty strain for those who don&#39;t like too sacrifice potency for flavour this is you all over. It&#39;s sweet but retains that Kush element which gives a strong taste with strong effects. A good evening smoke if suffering from insomnia etc.

VMethod: Barney&#39;s Flower in a Vaporizer\u000a\u000aAroma: It smells, sweet with a bit of spice and fruit. 1/1 Star.\u000aTaste: The sweet takes over at first with a marshmellow-y pastry taste before ending with some berry hints. I think this would be amazing as a vape cartridge to really pull out the right terpenes. 1.5/2 Stars.\u000aFeel: A strong and classic indica. Had to cancel a walking tour I had later that night and just sit on a pier watching Canal water before putting on a movie I never finished as I passed out at home. It wasn&#39;t the most practical choice for a tourist trying to milk their vacation but could be great for insomnia and counting sheep. 1.5/2 Stars.\u000aRanking: OG Kush and GSC are two of my favorite indicas and are parents of some of my favorite strains separately. Cookies Kush is a great way to try them together but sometimes you just want the originals. 1/1 Star.\u000a\u000aTotal: 4 Stars.

VNot what I expected from a cross between GSC and OGK. It is a very nice strain. But when I think GSC or OGK, I think happy, giggly, uplifting, etc. This is very heavy in the face. It certainly has the calming effects. \u000a\u000aMaybe since I experienced this in a dab it was a bit heavy.  It&#39;s worth a try. Plenty of worse strains out there.

VI haven&#39;t been on leafly in a while, but have grown a number of new to me strains over the winter. I&#39;ll start here. I really like this strain. For the personal stuff, I like that it is an evening relaxing strain, but without knocking me to the floor or couch. I did a few more things before calling it a night. I just felt cozy and relaxed, and slept very well the whole night. Properly cured, she smells and tastes great as others report. As for growing it up in the mountains (in the winter, in the greenhouse), it grows to be a tall, slim plant, in a 20 gallon pot. Yield did not match growth, at least inside during winter. I&#39;ve had Sour Diesel varieties share up to 8 ounces in the same space, in the same size pot, during the same time of year. She gave just under 3 ounces of solid buds, with a decent amount of popcorns and smaller for other tasks. Overall, because of the nice medical effect, I give her 5 stars. I&#39;ve got a few clones going for the spring outdoor crop. I hope she has higher yields outside, but I&#39;ll probably keep the strain anyway. Nice stuff. Oh yeah... at least for me, it didn&#39;t make me hungry, or give me the munchies like other people report. I considered snacking, but was aware of my actual hunger level (not hungry). I didn&#39;t simply crave. I liked that.

VMy guy and I have been trying different strains for the past few weeks and thus far this strain has been my least favorite. After smoking, we immediately felt super lethargic and getting regular tasks done became extremely inconvenient smh lol..While I&#39;m still an elementary smoker, my guy is very advanced and for this strain to put him on his a$$ it had to be very potent. However, if you&#39;re  wanting something that will increase your appetite and put you to sleep, this is the perfect strain for you!

Never was that high after just one spliff. Very psychedelic, funky and relaxing. Will definitely buy this again when I visit the Dam this year in order to find out if it&#39;s still that good haha

Smoked a joint of this stuff and I&#39;m experiencing a nice relaxed stone. Feeling a little spacey, kinda giggly, very hungry. If you want to just chill out for six hours and rediscover the wonders of tasty food, Cookies Kush is a real treat.

VDefinitely a strain that kicks insomnia and depression in the butt! Cookies Kush is a smoke that allows you to sink into deep relaxation and sleep. Smoke a little bit less and just lay on your couch and be ridiculously happy! While Cookies Kush is one of the weaker strains I tried, it is one that I loved so much I hope to grow one day. Cookies Kush has allowed me to stop taking my sleeping medicine, and has helped to stabilize my sleep schedule. This is a definite keeper!

VCookies Kush is a must try strain. The plant grows like a dream! Buds get fat and dense, with a thick coat of crystals. Trim is perfekt for hashmaking or edibles. Yielded over average for me.\u000aPuff a few hits of this beautiful dank flower and you are most certainly going for a spaceride. \u000aThe High is a top 5 for me. Stoned, but without getting couchlocked, just dont overmedicate ;)

And is a joy on the pallet ! Not to mention the body and mind! It&#39;s certainly one of the more flavoursome buds out there and I&#39;ve sampled a few in my 23 years of enjoying herb! This strain is up there with the tasty girls it&#39;s relatively easy to grow, I&#39;d say intermediate level ! And seems robust to mold and insects ! It&#39;s one worth trying and certainly for me in the uk it&#39;s almost impossible to get my mits on so growing seems the only way to sample these fruitful flavours from around the world ! 4stars !

VPleasantly surprised with this one! Was skeptical of it due to the fact i don&#39;t really trust the Rollex phenotype of OG crossed with a Girl Scout, coming from Amsterdam (I do trust DNA however). Especially considering the fact that Barneys Farm won an award for Sweet Tooth, but it isn&#39;t even the real one. Anyhow this is some very pungent, sweet and stanky herb. U can taste and feel the Girl Scout but it isn&#39;t dominant, the OG is and the buzz is very strong and sleep/ munchies inducing.

VPleasantly surprised with this one! Was skeptical of it due to the fact i don&#39;t really trust the Rollex phenotype of OG crossed with a Girl Scout, coming from Amsterdam (I do trust DNA however). Especially considering the fact that Barneys Farm won an award for Sweet Tooth, but it isn&#39;t even the real one. Anyhow this is some very pungent, sweet and stanky herb. U can taste and feel the Girl Scout but it isn&#39;t dominant, the OG is and the buzz is very strong and sleep/ munchies inducing.

It kinda made the headband effect a little tight around the forehead but as im writing this its moving to a body flop kinda high where my head is cloudy but focused and my body doesnt want to listen to commands from my brain. Overall great after work strain. After all it gave me the idea to sign up on here and tell you about it! High as fuck.

The stone is actually pretty legit. My tolerance is quite high from smoking every day all day so it can be challenge sometimes to really get ripped. Two good bowls of this stuff and I&#39;m pretty stoned, any more and I&#39;ll certainly be couchlocked. Overall really good flower!

VI&#39;ve never been a big fan of strait GSC but I&#39;ve also not yet really thoroughly given GSC exploration (only tried once or twice) but wow let me tell you Cookies Kush is pretty incredible!  Great effects, very strong potent yet very enjoyable high anytime smoke doesn&#39;t make you wanna go to sleep until you start coming down.  No strain before Cookies Kush ever really helped me with trying to get to bed earlier.  Cookies Kush makes you very happy and relaxed and is a great high, when you start coming down (and only when you start coming down) it really helps put you out like no other!  Amazing stuff.  Similar strain I once tried that was created by a local grower is also amazing, people should explore it more...GSC x OG 18 ...do it!!!

Vthis strain is a complete waste of time. me and a friend grew out 5 feminized seeds , all grew incredibly tall with thin wimpy stocks. as of 8 days the fifth plant just turned male, and 4 males in veg. I cant really give a review of the smoke itself, as 5 out of 5 seeds turned male. all grown under 18-12 dont ever take a chance on Barneys farm total shit strains like cookies kush and sweet tooth. the sweettooth made it to maturity but the flower sucked.   absolutely un reccomendable.

VFirst off I would like to say that I am writing this high and everything is extremely and agonizingly slow to me. Yet I still made myself create an account on here for the sole purpose of saying this messed me up big time. This being my first time using marijuana in any form, perhaps this was a dumb choice as my first weed type (?) but whatever. I was with a guy friend I\u2019d only hung out with once before. As soon as I was fully high I was 100% paranoid he was going to sexually assault me, and then I was anxious I was acting weird so I\u2019d try my hardest to act normal. It\u2019s hell. I haven\u2019t felt this anxious and self-concious in a long time.
