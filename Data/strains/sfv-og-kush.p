VThis is a creeper...takes about an hour to really kick in.\u000aAnd when it does get ready to EAT!! Total munchies. I was watching every food channel I could find.  \u000aGreat strain. Doesn&#39;t kick your ass , great if you are going out but want to be mellow.\u000aI use it right before dinner and after that I can just kick back on the couch and relax.  Easy to go right to sleep.\u000aI only smoke at night and this is a perfect fit for me.

VStrongest, couch-lockiest and sleepy indica strain I\u2019ve ever had, good lord!  This is the answer to my insomnia.  One bowl out of my vaporizer and I was GOOD.

VINDICA???? Made me SEVERELY anxious each time   I smoked SVG- even when I tried to mix it with another indica that is my go-to anti anxiety and heady higher than high High.....so I am certain it wasn\u2019t the blackberry kush in that mix that STILL made me extremely anxious and even edgy/annoyed for absolutely no reason. I am not saying it\u2019s a bad strain or that the good reviews aren\u2019t equally valid. I have never taken the time to write a review and chose to now not to criticize the strain or the dispensary I got it from, I noticed that the strain info on side effects on Leafly for this strain did not have \u201canxious\u201d listed at all (and neither were any \u201csemi synonymous\u201d words used here like \u201cparanoid\u201d or \u201ctalkative\u201d). It smells awesome and tastes good enough that I can\u2019t recall thinking it was nasty- which for me, if i can\u2019t remember the taste then it was either good or ok. If I can remember the name of a strain bc of its taste alone, it\u2019s bc it was awful to the point of storing info into my short term and long term memory (which is noteworthy bc I struggle with both regularly when I am not high.\u000aI am ending this review with: If you are prone to anxiety even with some indicas, this might be one of those but won\u2019t be listed bc it doesn\u2019t seem that there are enough people that sensitive that write or read reviews so not enough mentions of that side effect to include on the info page. Sorry this is long I smoked a hybrid.

VI had a very rough couple of days before picking up 3.5 grams of this SFV OG. While I was not anticipating much, since I had not known much about this strain, I was very surprised on how relaxed and happy it made me. It wasn&#39;t necessarily a super energetic happiness, but more of a &quot;life is okay. keep on keeping on&quot; kind of happy. \u000a\u000aAll in all, this strain kept me happy and well during one of the darkest (or dankest) times I&#39;ve had in the recent months.

VIt&#39;s a very strong cerebral and Body hit that you can easily over medicate on if you go back for 2nds. Classic OG smell and Flavor with hits of Coffee notes coming through.Beautiful large colas with a dense trichrome filled body. Awesome green and red and orange coming through.Perfect cure. After 1 small mini bubbler bowl, I was feeling a heavy and strong Sativa Cerebral feeling but could still focus, after the 2nd bowl, 1st rip, I feel like I have been put in a thai clinch by Anderson Silva and am being ragdolled, If I have any more I will be finished via a KO.

VLOVED the strain, had an insane head high and made me feel a lot less anxious and depressed. Only gripe i have about this strain is the paranoia (its pretty high on the paranpia stat). I was just vibing and watching tv until I heard a fire alarm and freaked for a good 30min fiddling with my fire arm, turns out my alarm was fine and it was just the show on tv lmao. The paranoia kinda looms over you a little bit, but overall the experience was very fun and definitely gave my anxiety a beat down. Id suggest just avoiding things that could potentially make you axnious such as work or other responsibilities. 4/5

Wasn&#39;t sure about the strain while I was waiting for the effects--very cerebral. In about 10 minutes I couldn&#39;t have felt better. My head was clear and I was just in an overall good mood. Relaxed w/o couch lock (might have been the diesel). Just an overall mellow good time. My buddy was nice enough to share so I&#39;m looking forward to giving this herb another go soon.

I coughed once just as I finished my joint. I&#39;m not disappointed. Guys, the high is so sweet and warm, It&#39;s raining outside and it&#39;s pretty cloudy but it feels like I&#39;m heaven.

VLOVED the strain, had an insane head high and made me feel a lot less anxious and depressed. Only gripe i have about this strain is the paranoia (its pretty high on the paranpia stat). I was just vibing and watching tv until I heard a fire alarm and freaked for a good 30min fiddling with my fire arm, turns out my alarm was fine and it was just the show on tv lmao. The paranoia kinda looms over you a little bit, but overall the experience was very fun and definitely gave my anxiety a beat down. Id suggest just avoiding things that could potentially make you axnious such as work or other responsibilities. 4/5

VDon&#39;t let the small nugs on this SFV OG Kush fool you. Breaking open the dense buds, your nostrils are met with the heavy scents of lemon, pine, and the classic Kush kick. Bred to favor the qualities more associated with an Indica, you will experience smooth cerebral effects and relaxed body sensations without the heaviness usually associated with Indicas.. A little harsh when smoked, this strain is better when vaporized, yet is still potent regardless of method.

VSuper relaxing strain. Real mellow and cool. Not too much thought going on either. Body pain is lessened and there is a definite couch lock. Lazy hooded eyes have I. Yet I can&#39;t deny that I am quite high. The being quite high part makes it hard to go to sleep despite the relaxing effects. This is great evening after work shyte. Smells dankly chemical but after associating the high with the smell you&#39;ll come to like it :-)

VFirst off, I&#39;m a lil pissed at the place that I got this from because they told me that this was sativa dominant..\u000aWith that being said &amp; now knowing the strain, it&#39;s not bad. \u000aEuphoric, heavy eyes, I could definitely drift off but probably not fully fall asleep. \u000aI&#39;m more of a sativa person,  but this indica is good for stress, if you just want to chill/drift off and in high doses, sleep for a couple of hours.

VVery good high but it tasted exactly like lemon Pledge. I even sprayed some in the air and they smell very similar. I love lemon haze so the clerk suggested this at almost 29% compared to LH&#39;s measly 17%\u2026\u2026 I still like lemon haze better. No ammonia taste or smell with that one.\u000aAll in all, I got very high and felt GREAT for about 4 1/2 hour&#39;s.

VNow I have had both SFV OG strains. The buds are quite similar have a different smell though. This SFV OG Kush has a good lemon aroma like lemon pledge. The high is great real relaxing buzz but does tend to make energetic at the same time. Good for pain and also great for night time. The flavor is also a little similar to SFV OG with slight differences lemon woody earthy taste good strain.

Nice sugary buds both over 20 % very tasty. ..and it will sit you back so buckle in. ...I am definitely interested in trading clones for clones on this one. ..that&#39;s why you need to find yours and enjoy

VFifty year old weed virgin here. For once I get to review something after a second smoke rather than first impression. After my adventures with J1 it was nice to land the next day on something that was going to be familiar. I knew what to expect and about how much to smoke to get there. First the slightly heady sensations, then a gentle wave down my body and an overall sensation of slight heaviness, and finally an overall sense of peacefulness, wellness, and overall reduction of anxiety. Later, when it peaked and seemed to be tapering off, maybe two or three hours, I hit a little C99 (Cindy, sold to me as Rip Cindy from my favorite local dispensary, Cannabliss in Springfield, OR) and that seemed to put a very nice bow on what was a good morning of smoke and shopping groceries for my family before coming home from a long, long night of work--usually about fourteen hours. I slept very well, and have no doubt it would have been just has good had I topped off with a little more OG rather than Cindy, but I really really like Cindy. Can&#39;t help it. Can&#39;t always be about Marsha, right? ;)
