VThis is my favorite strain of the year so far, besides my go-to, Blue Dream. I HIGHLY recommend trying this out in flower form. After smoking it, I was in a really good mood and wasn&#39;t too tired. I definitely felt mellowed out, but with the anxiety relief that this strain provided I had a burst of creative energy and enjoyed some music and even got some work done on my laptop. Blue Power relieved my underlying chronic migraine symptoms and rendered such a lovely, distracting high.

VCopped a half zip of indoor grown Blue Flower from a private grower in a trade for some clones. I was intrigued, as it is otherwise not available locally.  I&#39;m giving it five stars for the wonderful and complex burst of fruit and flower that strikes both the nose and the tastebuds. Very smooth smoking out of my modestly sized kettle bong. I want to throw this caveat out though - despite being an indica, this strain does not produce the indica effect of intense relaxation (couch-lock, drowsiness) often associated with and desired from indicas. It&#39;s 90 + degrees today, and I know if I smoked Blackberry Kush or some such, I would be down for a nap in short order in this heat. However, I feel relatively free of any energy drain associated with just having smoked. A bit of a creeper this one, but not terribly slow coming on. Different flavors, but the low key psychedelic effects remind me of an obscure strain called M and M. Somewhat similar to Obama too. I find myself pretty focused too, albeit a bit inwardly. But on productive matters and projects, no paranoia or self-dissection. Snag this one if you see it, it&#39;s a treat!

VInstant headache.\u000a\u000aI decided to try this to help with anxiety that&#39;s part of the panic disorder that I have. Other indica-dominant strains have been helpful but I was looking for something with less THC to take earlier in the day, so I picked this up at my local dispensary.  Their THC reading came in at about 12%.\u000a\u000aI guess I should have paid more attention to the Negative Effects listings for this strain, specifically that 50% reported &quot;headache.&quot; After vaping about 7 hits, an almost immediate headache came on in my temples.  I&#39;ve had the same issue with sativa-dominant strains, but not with indica-dominant ones.  I won&#39;t be using this again.

VI have grown this strain multiple time&#39;s and it is hands down one of my favorite strains. I&#39;ve found her terps to be very exotic and hard to come by so she is a treat for anyone looking to pick it up. I&#39;ve hade phenos the smelt like a lemon pinetree that changed to a blueberry with smooth moonshine (lysol) kush. I&#39;ve had pheno&#39;s that have had subtle sour nodes with earthy kush funk. Typically the more sour pheno&#39;s turn blueberry after they dry. A very potent strain that has anywhere from a euphoric hybrid like high or it could be a racy sativa. As far as growing her goes, it is a 7/10. A pain to maintain at times (pheno dependant) and it is a slower grower, with a low yield if not trained. But, worth anyones time potentcy and terp wise. She also DUMP&#39;s resin heads for all you extraction artist&#39;s. And they are FIRE!!!

VGot this for my first rec purchase today, and I must say I&#39;m very impressed. It has a great taste with a smooth smoke. It gives a very happy high but it&#39;s a bit heavy and can couch lock you. All in all it&#39;s a great tasting potent indica that immediately help with my lack of appetite and nausea.

Didnt smell great, a pungent chemical like smell, lacked the THC dusting of a punchy bud, and had no hints of purple or blue hue,  but all in all a solid value smoke for night vibes around $13 a gram.
