VTastes really good, the smoke isn&#39;t harsh at all. Trippy as fuck, has the focusing effects of a Sativa and the relaxing buzz of an Indica. I like to do smoke this when I&#39;ve had a stressful day and I still have to get some work done. Downside is it gives you dry mouth and slight paranoia.

My salads were  ounces of Reggz/Purple Haze/Chocolate Thai/Hydro Ponic/White Haze/Crippy/Jamaican Reggz, and if you want to add some more to make it more stronger you can go ahead and do so It&#39;ll still be a salad.
