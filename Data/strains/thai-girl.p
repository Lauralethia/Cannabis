VThis is a good strain to use if you want to think everything is beautiful and dig deep into all the ways life is a gift. Euphoria! Thoughts are going a mile a minute and digging deep into concepts. Hard to finish a task because I keep starting new ones. But starting a lot of &#39;em. Hard to focus because everything is fascinating... Good for the heart :)

VThai Girl personally doesn&#39;t get me as high as I would like before a work out. I can&#39;t quite concentrate through the pain as other strains. However, it does put me in a good mood for a long time and it tastes great. It has a fruity taste like mango. It&#39;s nice right before work, helps me interact better with customers.

VI have severe pelvic coagulation and usually go toward indicas for the full\u000abody relaxation and pain control. But when my budtender told me about this strain for her back pain and after getting some oil, this is my #1 sativa. It&#39;s not as cerebral or halo as others, but more full body with an energetic, bright feeling like I just took an amazing shot of espresso. Exercising and hiking with this in an oil vape is an absolute must; it helped that much with my pelvic pain. Plus it&#39;s got great flavor; lots of lemony love &lt;3

VI mostly enjoy this strain, it tends to be kinda racy and energetic, good for being social and getting things done. Over time, it&#39;s become less special to me, but still a good go-to for those qualities.
