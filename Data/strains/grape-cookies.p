VI had recently gone thru wisdom teeth surgery &amp; wasn&#39;t able to smoke for 2 weeks. As someone with insomnia and appetite loss , Codeine was not what i expected to be prescribed,(and only took them when i was really in pain) .\u000aAs soon as i was able to smoke ,I was able to get my paws on this Bad Boy. The aroma was rich coffee and grape infused with a mix of jet fuel. This rocked hit me by the 3rd toke, I was so relaxed, and had a full nights rest,that my body was in need of. A+++++\u000a

VPferfect indica. Not too strong but just right. This strain relaxes you , you get to enjoy all the sensations from your typical indica strain but don\u2019t have that couch lock or sleepy vibe.

VGrape Cookies: Good indica for getting a nice buzz in the evening. Good way to put you to sleep if you want to use it for that purpose. Don\u2019t use in the morning.\u000a\u000aThe high from this strain is consistently intense and focused laser beam. It will keep going into the day from the night before. While this strain does help with sleep, it is recommended to use a sativa in the morning, since this will burn off any residual after effects of the indica from the night before. Raising average because if you don\u2019t have a sativa in the morning, it will mess up your day.

VA strong Indica that packs both a body and head high without being too sleepy. Lots of bright grape, berry and hash in the flavor. I didn&#39;t quite get the giggly part many report, but i did have the grins...

VAnother amazing GSC cross, one of the best I&#39;ve tried. Right up there with Gelato and Sunset Sherbet for me, especially in the look and scent. Sweet grape and hints of a GSC/OG type dank scent underneath and the taste matches it spot on. Perfect frosty purple nugs you almost feel bad breaking apart. Super uplifting relaxing with a wide range of effects to match a numbing body buzz. Makes whatever you&#39;re doing better or at least more manageable.
