VHellfire OG is a bit of a misnomer, because I felt great after a few puffs. No fire or molten rock, just a pain free body and worry free mind. This strain makes me a little tipsey, so pass on the extra puffs if you&#39;re prone to cannibus-related vertigo or dizziness while getting your Cheech and Chong on. Great diesel scent and and nice green flower.

VYes - highly recommended. As others have noted a definite one two punch. First euphoric then it brings you down - in a very good way. It&#39;s a creeper at first you might think it isn&#39;t that strong a moment later you realize that you just lost track of the last half hour. I vaped it, very little taste which  leads to the gross misconception that it might not be very strong - then POW! A new favorite. This review is for weed purchased in Tacoma WA, Green Haven brand 30% THC.

VFive stars straight across.  Although how this strain works for me and what it affects is almost diametrically opposed to what its effects are for most people.  It doesn&#39;t make me euphoric or energetic at all, in fact it&#39;s completely the opposite.  For me this is the most powerful sedative I&#39;ve ever been on.  And I&#39;m talking even prescription drugs such as the benzo&#39;s that I&#39;ve been on at various times for my anxiety disorders - clonazepam and lorazepam included.  It&#39;s relaxing and sedating, it kind of leaves me with a mellow, sleepy kind of feeling.  It also doesn&#39;t affect my pain as much as say the dancehall that I use daily for just about everything, but hellfire&#39;s sedative qualities are without precedent, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Along with the dancehall and hurkle, this is now in my top three and what I use pretty much on a daily basis to deal with my conditions.  Marvelous strain!

V60/40 s/i\u000a\u000aYeah, this one is a heavy hitter.   Instant  deep body relaxation.  Not a heavy sedation per say but more of a tingly numb and relaxed state.   Can be a bit intense but this does not last long.  \u000a\u000aThis one is a bit heavier than my normal ratios which are usually weighted very heavily on CBD concentrations as I am coming off anxiety meds.  So this was an interesting experiment for me to have a very high THC strain with an ok amount of CBD.  \u000a\u000aI

VI have had some strong strains before but first fatty bowl of this and it flattened me. Instant rush to the head very cerebral high (can make you feel dizzy) and quite energetic actually but has an indica crash that can put you to sleep.
