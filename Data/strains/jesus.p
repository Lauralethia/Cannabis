VI really enjoyed this strain, enough to where I had to go right back out and buy more before I can&#39;t find it. mine is in concentrate form, wax / budder made by refine seattle. the taste is very floral with some lemon and citrus. I can tell the thc amount is high. nice head high, very euphoric that&#39;s probably what stands out the most along with the great taste. U can never go wrong with refine seattle.

VI first tried this strain about 1 month ago, didn&#39;t really hit me as was said so I laid off. I smoked a bowl of it tonight, WOW! I am feeling a good head buzz and tingling in my hands and the back of my neck, this is what Jesus wants me to feel which is awesome!  Good for anyone, anxiety gets better.

VI&#39;ve been dealing with a depressive episode for the last month. After smoking Jesus, I could not stop smiling. It&#39;s not super giggly or euphoric so I wouldn&#39;t call it upbeat. It just puts you in a good mood, anxieties lessen and you feel like being productive. Minimal munchies and a little bit chatty.\u000a\u000aThe strain i got is made by Kiana. The leaves were pretty loose but it was only $10 a gram. Great strain for what you pay.

VWonderful hybrid.  It works for pain and mood as effortlessly as black magic, and even more for insomnia.  Nice, lemony scent and mild smoke are definite perks, as well.  It also doesn&#39;t aggravate my anxiety disorder, simply relaxing me slowly but surely until I feel pleasantly calm and content.  Anyone that gets a chance to try this strain really should take it - I very much doubt there will be many people that will be disappointed.

VOne of my earliest smokes, super smooth inhale, thick and liquid smoke on the exhale. Nice smell, and a serious creeper. Took 10-15 minutes to take effect, starting with tingly skin and limbs. Then WHAM, hits you like a sledgehammer with trippy visuals, lots of big laughter, everything was hilarious. The indica side follows with waves of chill, and a nice calm. You\u2019re gonna want to have some nice music to listen to; close your eyes, watch the light show playing out behind your eyelids, and thank Jesus for the medicine. Definitely a favorite if you can find it.
