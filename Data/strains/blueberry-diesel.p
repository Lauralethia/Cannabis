VSmells very sweet especially when you crack a nugg get a nice whiff of blueberries. The taste and smell when smoked however isnt what you&#39;d expect. More of a strong earthy taste and skunky smell.

Vone of my new favorites. small amount gets you very giggly and euphoric with a burst of energy. the initial energy mellows down into a smooth relaxation that&#39;s not sedating. good for a social smoke or to wind down from anxiety/stress. watch out for munchies though.

VGreat berry flavor for sure. Fairly smooth smoke. High is heady and pleasant. Medicinally, it works great! Exactly what Leafly statistics state it does. I only didn&#39;t give this a 5 because, although the smoke was fairly smooth, it still had a sharpness to it. I&#39;ve only smoked this through a pipe as well. Overall great smoke and would definitely get it again.

VThis is becoming one of my favorite strains. Blueberry Diesel is a great hybrid for a day inside. Its&#39; sativa side is prevalent, but not overwhelming, it is a nice calm head high. The Indica side is also equally prevalent and not understated; it has a powerful body high that gives significant pain and anxiety relief.

VNv pure blueberry diesel. 21% thc \u000a\u000aAppearance: dense bud structure and light green and bright orange hairs. \u000a\u000aSmell: the scent is very fruity and pungent.  it smells like a blueberry strain with just a hint of that diesel scent to it \u000a\u000aTaste:The taste is very sweet and leaves a nice after taste on exhale and on  a dry pull from a clean pipe or joint it taste similar  to how it smells \u000a\u000aEffect : it comes on quickly in a subtle head high while being a bit relaxing the high seems to come on a bit heavy at first it mellows out after just a hour or so. maybe it&#39;s my tolerance but it smokes very smooth and burns\u000a to a clean white ash .great daytime smoke it&#39;s relaxing but not super heavy where you feel tired or lazy .

VA personal favorite -Blueberry Diesel is all about that sweet blueberry flavor, which comes through nicely whether in bud or concentrate form. One of the best pure flavor strains I&#39;ve tried.\u000aAs for effect, expect a high that comes on slow but sets in well, doesn&#39;t knock you down too hard, though it will set your sails for chill-world. \u000aIt seems to be an even mixture of sativa and indica-type qualities; nice, uplifting, relaxing yet fairly clear-headed. Your mind and body will both benefit with this one.\u000aUsers looking for a super heavy body experience may want to look at other strains, but look to BBD for a good, strong and mellow rip.

VThis is an amazing strain. I picked this up on 4/20/12 for my first ever time buying dispensary bud. The smell is intense, it can easily stink up a room. I struggle with appetite and nausea a lot due to liver set backs. I hadn&#39;t eaten for about 3 days and didn&#39;t really feel the need to want to. So I picked this up. Started with 2 puffs; I&#39;m a heavy smoker but I start with a couple to get a feel for the bud. It is possible to over smoke and get sick. Think of cannabis as a medication. The first two my face and head felt fuzzy. A couple more I felt a blanket of comfy and began eating chips and cereal. Few more hits and I was done. I ended up going back to the dispensary and getting Blue Widow because this was doing what it was supposed to. Put me to sleep.

VI\u2019ve been trying to find the right strain and dose for my chronic pain, celiac\u2019s disease, and anxiety. I noted on the breakdown on Leafly that it had a nice balance for a hybrid, maintaining a cognizant head high with the relaxing body wave. Picked some up from CCA on Sunset, and y\u2019all- this was a very good find. Happy, euphoric, calming, but never overwhelming. I had a decent bowl to myself and while I am for sure medicated, I am completely aware of surroundings, time, etc... no time jump, no couch lock, just amazingly focused relief.\u000aGreat for beginner patients as it is fairly mild on head change, but a nice change of pace from a buzzy sativa or heavy indica for veteran patients.

A cross between crows pleasers blueberry and NY Sour D, the buds are sticky, dense, coated in crystals, and highly potent smelling. The smoke is smooth, the high is energetic, but not paranoid, and will leave you wanting to go on a run, then eat a lot of food. Helps me with anxiety, PTSD, and pain.

VI\u2019ve been trying to find the right strain and dose for my chronic pain, celiac\u2019s disease, and anxiety. I noted on the breakdown on Leafly that it had a nice balance for a hybrid, maintaining a cognizant head high with the relaxing body wave. Picked some up from CCA on Sunset, and y\u2019all- this was a very good find. Happy, euphoric, calming, but never overwhelming. I had a decent bowl to myself and while I am for sure medicated, I am completely aware of surroundings, time, etc... no time jump, no couch lock, just amazingly focused relief.\u000aGreat for beginner patients as it is fairly mild on head change, but a nice change of pace from a buzzy sativa or heavy indica for veteran patients.

VI love this strain. \u000a\u000aThis came from an indoor grower.  The giveaway is the density of the flower.  CO2 is the only thing that will make a flower that dense.\u000a\u000aThis flower has a wonderful bouquet, has not been keefed, and is cured perfectly.\u000a\u000aThe trim was nice and tight the way I like it as well.

VBlueberry Diesel is an amazing strain. The smell and taste are more blueberryish than the actual blueberry strain, with just a hint of diesel. The nugs were long and conic, with green,red, and some blue/purp here and there. Lots of milky trichs. The high was  hard to pinpoint. Sometimes feeling balanced and some times leaning towards the body.

VGot blueberry diesel by lucky devil and was excited to try it because of the lineage. The look is good. Very frosty, dripping trich. Greenish beige nugs with minimal small orange hairs. Smells off from expectation. The aroma is like beef jerky. Very spicy and slightly sweet. Smoke is heavy and expands quick. Good long cough. Effect is good at first. Very happy, talkative, and slightly relaxed. Then it fades into a heavy sedation with a active mind unable to keep up. I dislike feeling like speed balling. Not cool.\u000a\u000aBlueberry diesel isn\u2019t for me. I don\u2019t recommend.\u000a

VThe smell of this strain is why I bought it. It&#39;s aroma is so yummy. However, I gave this strain a lower rating because it did not get me high. Disappointed, confused if my tolerance is just to high, or if I expected an influence other than just being clear heading and mildly relaxed. If you are sensitive to anxiety and have a lower tolerance and just want something to make you chill, then this could work for you.

VThe Sour Diesel Blueberry from Advanced Farm and Garden in Ypsilanti is 100% organic; as is all their strains. The diesel smell was not as strong, nor the blueberry, as its respective parents, respectively, but rather it had a happy marriage of the two. Sweet blueberry scent, with a touch of citrus, finishing with the signature Sour D taste. Dense clouds via the vape 6 tokes deep; and the burn is sweet and smooth to the finish line. If you like Sour D and Blueberry, then I recommend this. Provided mild to moderate pain relief, as well as stress relief and a relaxed and happy effect.

VThis strain is AMAZING! it tastes just like Blueberry (I also wrapped it in Grape Swisher Sweets), but gives me the same mellow, relaxed feel of Sour Diesel. Sour D. usually makes me body feel limp, relaxed, and tingly. I also know it&#39;s loud because everything around me just seems louder (literally lol) and I had the giggles, but not too much. Overall I would give this a 10/10. One of my top 5 if not my favorite yet. I rack it up to the same level as Train Wreck.

VGot a free gram of this stuff the first time I visited RC. Very generous of them because this stuff is good. &quot;Blueberry&quot; because it smells and tastes fruity with a blue tint to the buds. Diesel because it&#39;s strong on the sativa end that lifts you up and gives you some energy. A good clean smoke that&#39;s good for pain and stress, too.

I do think it tastes a bit rough, and the high is delightful, yet takes a bit more to reach where I normally want to be creativity-wise. Over-all? Good strain, well worth the purchase if money is tight.

VGot blueberry diesel by lucky devil and was excited to try it because of the lineage. The look is good. Very frosty, dripping trich. Greenish beige nugs with minimal small orange hairs. Smells off from expectation. The aroma is like beef jerky. Very spicy and slightly sweet. Smoke is heavy and expands quick. Good long cough. Effect is good at first. Very happy, talkative, and slightly relaxed. Then it fades into a heavy sedation with a active mind unable to keep up. I dislike feeling like speed balling. Not cool.\u000a\u000aBlueberry diesel isn\u2019t for me. I don\u2019t recommend.\u000a

VThe smell of this strain is why I bought it. It&#39;s aroma is so yummy. However, I gave this strain a lower rating because it did not get me high. Disappointed, confused if my tolerance is just to high, or if I expected an influence other than just being clear heading and mildly relaxed. If you are sensitive to anxiety and have a lower tolerance and just want something to make you chill, then this could work for you.

VThe Sour Diesel Blueberry from Advanced Farm and Garden in Ypsilanti is 100% organic; as is all their strains. The diesel smell was not as strong, nor the blueberry, as its respective parents, respectively, but rather it had a happy marriage of the two. Sweet blueberry scent, with a touch of citrus, finishing with the signature Sour D taste. Dense clouds via the vape 6 tokes deep; and the burn is sweet and smooth to the finish line. If you like Sour D and Blueberry, then I recommend this. Provided mild to moderate pain relief, as well as stress relief and a relaxed and happy effect.

VThis strain is unbelievable. Bbd makes you feel like your dipping your body in a bath of honey.. A good strain to try when you want to play some video games, or chill with some friends. Using this with the Pax especially with the Flavor setting on makes the strain 10x better. You can definitely taste the diesel and that small bit of blueberry for more advanced palettes. Very smooth smoke. Def recommend

VThis is a lovely strain! There is a lovely fruity flavor and a pleasing, but pungent, aroma. I find that I feel pretty calm and relaxed mentally and physically. For me, it isn&#39;t as strong on the physical relaxation as I would like, but it does definitely take the edge off and a bit more.  : ) If you are about to have a bit of this lovely smoke, Enjoy!

VI love this strain, but who wouldn&#39;t. Combining Sour Diesel and Blueberry is a perfect combo of one of your best Sativas and Indicas into some sort of ganja dream child. Definitely more of an Indica stone for me with just enough head high to keep you off the couch and more likely on a lawn/beach chair Lol

Well it was really on the full body side just very mild, stimulating mildly, with a little uphoria. Relaxing we&#39;ll say. well balanced for an anxious person or walkin the dog.  The effects last 1-2 hours tops. Id buy it again.

VGreat strain that I picked up a Bloom in Phoenix AZ. I like the taste of the blueberry and the hint of diesel. The buzz was great for day time and playing battlefield 4 (PC). It gives that uplifting head high then the slight body relaxation will settle on you. I will def be getting this strain again. This buzz almost is like Agent orange another favorite of mine.

VHad no knowledge of this strain. Dense, tight buds loaded with trichromatic &amp; a light blueberry aroma. Loaded my vape with a moderately tight pack &amp; pulled 2 good rips at 410. Hopped in the shower &amp; on came a most comfortable &amp; stimulating cerebral head high. I&#39;m prone to anxiety &amp; a touch of paranoia from time to time but that&#39;s my shadow &amp; not from the bud. In any case, there was none of either. I settled in &amp; began re reading a book I started whilst heavy in a Chem 91 buzz, I hadn&#39;t understood a word! I re read the chapter as the indica effects began to settle in. Not very heavy at all &amp; felt very comfortable. Two more rips at 410 &amp; I noticed a became a bit unfocused but nothing unmanageable. I continued to read &amp; understand what the author had in mind. As I came down a bit, I turned my vape to 465 &amp; finished the chamber turning on an interview with Randall Carlson. The indica effects crept over me &amp; the next thing I remember is waking up from a satisfying, deep restful sleep. Highly recommend this strain!

VReviews can be relative because how the herb effects you depends on everything that&#39;s done to it from the time it&#39;s planted until the time we light it up or make oil from it.  That being said, and adding to it that everybody is different, this strain is very good but not one of my favorites.  In terms of the buzz, it&#39;s good and it&#39;s not overpowering which makes it a good daytime weed for heavy smokers.  If it were left to effects alone, I&#39;d probably just give what I had a 3.  Nice, relaxing, mellow, take the edge off with a very slight heaviness on the eyelids.  And, I was still very functional while smoking this strain.  HOWEVER, while I am one that finds the high just okay, the appearance, the smell and the taste of this stuff on the other hand, is WAY BEYOND 5 stars.  I want to smoke it just for the smell and flavor alone!  It&#39;s da kine that when you smell it, your body starts telling you that it really wants it.  Amazing and freakin&#39; yum-EEE !!!  Best tasting weed EVER!  So, I gave mine 4 stars.

Went to grass roots and they had flowers in stock, so i bought 2gs for $30. Smells EXACTLY the same as my plant. Looks just as good. Its a little mild for me, but makes a great indica dom hybrid for daytime use. Smells sweet and extremely strong, almost a little chemy. You know glow sticks? And how they smell wen you break em open.. yea thats how this smelled. Suuuper dank shit! like i said, good for daytime use, not too good if you want heavy indica. Great smoke for sativa fans, like me, lazy, but not sleepy. sticky as shit, and super dense. love it!\u000a

Why they crossed it with a good strain Afghani. I know this aint Sour Diesel because I love Sour Diesel. Way different high. The highs mild short and instant wierd bad trip weed. Too uppy not uplifting either!\u000aI know its NYC Diesel because I know the grower that got them from Vancouver Seeds. Love the Blue GOD he got with em! And I dont like GOD BUDS High!

I smoked out of my glass bowl noticing how smooth the hit was and upon exhale tasted just like it smells, very pungent. One hit and I could feel the high instantly which was very strong almost overwhelming at first. I highly recommend this strain to anyone and think a 9 is dead on this is some very good strain and would be great for stress relief due to the calm state of mind this will give you.\u000a\u000aTHC:  10.84%\u000aStrain(s):  Hybrid Indoor Blueberry X Sour Diesel

VAverage strain. Has its goods and it&#39;s not so goods. Made me feel great and active, but also made me feel anxious and rushed

VPurchased at Light Shade Havana. This strain is A1 for me! A potential all day&#39;er, no couch lock, alertness, smooth smoke, i.e. not harsh on the lungs, and good for circles ;-)

VHonestly I\u2019m not hating on any strain it\u2019s just not for me. I was very zoned out and I wasn\u2019t talking at all and just overall didn\u2019t even get me a good experience. The taist was fruity and taistfull and the smell was also terrific. I would defiantly recommend rolling a grape blunt with this strain it mixed amazingly. Overall I\u2019ll leave a 2 out of 10 for being a very taisty good smelling strain with minimal to no good effects. Thanks for the read
