VI shared a joint of this with my friend who is battling depression and dealing with a lot of grief due to the loss of her husband. We sat at a duck pond and laughed for about three hours, it felt so good to see her smiling again. It was really incredible to see the way this strain truly lived up to its standards.

VBarneys Farm Laughing Buddha were developed by the Barney&#39;s Farm&#39;s seed breeders by crossing Thai and Jamaican marijuana genotypes. This new strain is mostly sativa, with very fruity, exotic flavours and an intense sativa high. In 2003, she won the Cannabis High Cup and became an undoubed favourite in marijuana smoking society. Laughing Buddha are stable and show consistent results with at least 80% germination. They are suitable for indoor and outdoor cultivation, show typical sativa growing characteristics and develop tall straight plants with a rich branching system and plenty of bud sites. Plants of this cannabis variety grow fast and stretch during flowering and a bit of training might be required, some prefer pruning or bending over and tying down (very effective), some go for tipping the tops - anything will do. When growing outside, Laughing Buddha can become as tall as 2-2.5 m. high, indoor samples remain their decent size of about 130 cm. Those weed lovers who prefer to grow Laughing Buddha outside start harvesting in mid October (Northern Hamisphers) with a naturally high yield of app. 450 gr. per plant. Like any other sativa dominant marijuana strain, Laughing Buddha has a longer flowering period than her indica counterpartner, it takes 11 weeks for her to fully mature, some cannabis growers give her another week or two to get the best results. A very distinct, powerful sweet and spicy aroma appears at the beginning of flowering. Grown up plants display long fat colas, virtually dripping with resinous trichomes. Laughing Buddha marijuana is said to contain as much as 18% of THC and 0.4% of CBD what makes her high very energizing and happy giggling.

VI&#39;m typically an Indica user.  I have 2 diseases that I am combating at the present. Neither have a cure.  I usually shy away from Sativa&#39;s.  But this strain is phenomenal!!  It takes away all my stress and anxiety.  A fantastic strain to get your mind off depressing aspects of life and allows you to LAUGH at the ridiculous aspects of ALL human nature.  Takes away pain.  Relaxes your intestinal troubles (inflammation).  All this and NO paranoia.  This strain had me up and doing.  It had me very happy for at least 4 hours.  If you are EVER blessed to find this strain?  Stock up.  If you are blessed to find it in a vape cartridge?  Stock up.  Blessings to all.

(I suggest Allman Brothers Fillmore East album)  or maybe you feel like taking a nice walk in the park, or really getting into a video game or just hanging with friends.... this is the strain you want!  \u000aIt is uplifting, bubbly feeling, no matter what you decide to do I can almost promise that at some point you will have the marijuana grin, the one that originates in your belly button and moves up and makes you grin and giggle.  Oh yeah, Laughing Buddah all the way.  \u000aGood for anxiety and depression, good for muscular and joint aches and pains.\u000aLove this stuff!!!!!

VGrows easy with a lot of fox tails in the buds.

VThis was an alright smoke.  The label said it was a shade over 20% THC, but honestly, I&#39;ve had better buzzes off of lower % MJ.  It could also have been the fact that I bought pre-rolls instead of the flower.  \u000a\u000aDon&#39;t get me wrong....the initial buzz was fantastic, though the smoke was a little harsh.   The problem is that the great initial high subsided pretty quickly.  After about 3 hours or so, I felt the need to give the buzz a turbo boost with a couple more hits.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I didn&#39;t feel this lives up to it&#39;s hype.  But ,hey, any buzz is a good buzz, and the shortness of the high I got from this may be good for a day out on the golf course.

My body has a slight floating feeling (even a slight feeling of floating is really fucking amazing if you think about it... like a slight feeling that my entire body is levitating off of the ground. Yea, like that.) \u000aAs far as the feeling upstairs, picture someone opening a window on a cold ass morning in December when it&#39;s a seemingly prefect 72 degrees inside of your cozy cottage. That very first feeling of the crisp air awakening your senses... capture 5 seconds of that feeling. &#160;That&#39;s the vibe I get from it. \u000aBut hey, that&#39;s just me.

VThis strain is an amazing sativa. Picks you up from low mood in low doses (vaped), but in high doses it will change your reality, making sight and smell so enhanced that you will feel like you are a 5 year old child first experiencing the world again! Its perfect for visiting pretty places/lights/fireworks etc. only down side is that everyone else around you thats sober will seem like miserable negative zombies walking around, unaware of what they are missing. Its a shame 99% of the world still dont take cannabis!

VBefore I tried this strain, I had 5 week break of smoking. I smoked a joint. Right after smoking I went laydown and listen to music. I would get these warm waves of happiness thru my body and seeing psychedelic shit about 5-10min. After that the shit went real, put the volume up and listened this 80s motivational retro music. I   did put a watch and a cool diamond ring at my finger. Had a HUGE raciness and idea that i&#39;m a undownable. It was like pure addrenaline, very strong, euphoric and scary feeling. I could also process these big things that are happening in my life without any stress or nothing. Strong munchies. I do not recommend Laughing Buddha at a high doses for beginners. This is a very very strong strain. Crazy

VThis was an alright smoke.  The label said it was a shade over 20% THC, but honestly, I&#39;ve had better buzzes off of lower % MJ.  It could also have been the fact that I bought pre-rolls instead of the flower.  \u000a\u000aDon&#39;t get me wrong....the initial buzz was fantastic, though the smoke was a little harsh.   The problem is that the great initial high subsided pretty quickly.  After about 3 hours or so, I felt the need to give the buzz a turbo boost with a couple more hits.\u000a\u000aAll in all, I didn&#39;t feel this lives up to it&#39;s hype.  But ,hey, any buzz is a good buzz, and the shortness of the high I got from this may be good for a day out on the golf course.

Vnice strain. I doubt if I should give it 4 or 5, it&#39;s good but I will see if it&#39;s really outstanding after some cure.\u000a\u000aAroma is delightful, it&#39;s a mix of mango, tangerines and some flowers, and when you smoke it, it&#39;s spicy. it&#39;s a weed for hammock and cocktails for sure - relaxing with an interesting sense of humor to it, but not racy. i didn&#39;t want to talk much or do stuff, but all jokes seemed histerically funny and I wasn&#39;t couch locked. the potency is decent but not the strongest either. long lasting. smoking more doesn&#39;t knock one out, but adds new dimensions to high and makes it slightly psychodelic in larger doses.

VThis strain is a bit disappointing. In fact, every Barney&#39;s Farm strain I&#39;ve tried so far has been underwhelming. For a pure/almost pure Sativa, it just lacks that intense cerebral high that you&#39;d expect. It&#39;s merely ordinary. This is the first Sativa I&#39;ve ever encountered that I can use at bedtime and it won&#39;t keep me awake with a racing heart.

It felt like all I could concentrate on.\u000a\u000aI tried to smoke Laughing Buddha at least four times, all with the same result. So I avoid it now, because I&#39;m not keen on getting a headache that continues for hours until I sleep (no thanks to it!)\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve smoked it with friends in the past who love it, and I can see why, but I can&#39;t seem to tolerate this particular one.

VI&#39;d like to mention that I&#39;m new to this research, and this is only my third strain I&#39;ve had. Each month I try a new one, vaping only one sativa daily and the one indica nightly. Since my general disposition is somewhat irritable and lacks focus, I am looking for something that assists in relaxing me so I can be pleasant, and laugh instead of get angry, and something which can keep me focused. This Laughing Buddha was NOT for this girl... first of all, it does leave a bit of paranoia which once its understood that its the weed, I can relax about that... second, it leaves me almost couch-locked and stupified - i cannot have conversations cuz I can&#39;t remember what they asked or said... that&#39;s not helping focus.... lastly, it seems to magnify my sensitivities which is not a good thing when a five year old is tired and crying and whining and clingy and you&#39;re it. so, no relaxation or uplifting feeling with this. But to leave things on a nicer note: there was one nice thing about this strain -- it made me randy and I rather liked that. :)

VI hadn&#39;t heard about this strain before, but after reading the happy and energetic description and the positive reviews on Leafly, I was amped to give it a go for my morning workout.  At $21 a gram, it was very spendy, but I knew it wasn&#39;t a strain that came around very often, so I took the plunge. \u000aI smoked Laughing Buddha in a bong on 2 different days, and felt very little effect.  It did pick me up enough to get my workout clothes on, but there wasn&#39;t too much motivation after that.  Where were the happy, energetic, uplifted, euphoric, giggly effects?   I sure didn&#39;t feel them.  Sometimes when I get a lame strain like this, I am hesitant to blame the grower or seller, because I may just need a tolerance break, and that may be the case here.  I have a bit of the flower left, so I&#39;ll give it another go, but so far, I&#39;m underwhelmed and disappointed with Laughing Buddha. I wish I&#39;d spent my $21 on something else.

An uplifting, balanced sensation settles as you are granted a breif respite from the worries of the world.

VMy review is based on Organically grown, smoked with a vape. (Flowermate PureHit )\u000aThe strain is true to its name. Zen is the word best to describe the high. Taste fresh and with a hint of citrus. Smooth, creeps up fast and lasts for about 3+ hours. \u000a\u000aI felt calm, like water that is completely still. Lost in thought but aware of surroundings. When my thoughts were interrupted, felt happy and peaceful. I would recommend this one for daytime use or when you know you can dedicate the time to let this high take you where it wants. Not for sleeping. \u000a\u000aGrowing: \u000aVery temperamental plant! Requires a strict schedule or it will get stressed out and let you know it. Long flowering period and if stressed will punish you with even longer. Wouldnt recommend for growing in the summer. Big beautiful buds with seemed to get frostier looking after dried. Smells like lemons and I got almost 6 ounces out of one plant. Grows tall and fast. Experienced growers only.

VIt was initially supposed to be indica, and i smoked it at 01:00 of the night, as last j of the day with my friends. After the first happy rush, we started to laugh really really a lot, and noisy, saying bullshits and then... BOOM. A second powerful rush turned us in werewolves and we started fighting in the middle of the night on the floor of our corridor. Great time, i had a lot of fun! Flavour and smell: citrus, sweet and earthy. Energizing stuff, powerful. Strong but BOOM.\u000a\u000aP.s: after 1/1.30 hours you can sleep. Really well ;)

VThis one wasn&#39;t exactly cheap at the coffeeshop, so I only tried about two grams. Its taste can be best summed up as a pungent earthern smoke with a light aftertaste of citrus fruit.\u000a\u000aIt may be a strong sativa, but I think the &#39;laughing&#39; part should be taken with caution. Laughing Buddha really seems to signify the vital rule of sativas and drugs in general: Be in a calm, enjoyable surrounding. Relax, and do things you like. You need something to distract your mind, otherwise it&#39;ll most likely try to entertain itself by annoying you.\u000a\u000aExcellent strain for the creative bursts, but purely for recreational use.
