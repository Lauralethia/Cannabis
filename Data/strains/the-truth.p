VThis strain is a perfect roller coaster of a ride. I decide to try this for back pain and I&#39;m glad I did! First you get a burst of uplifting energy, and it follows up with a very uplifting and happy feeling! After about an hour it starts to mellow and the body starts to go numb and heavy and the pain melts away. I found myself sitting in the recliner watching TV and not even focusing on the pain! I could see where you could lay down and sleep, but to me it&#39;s for during the mid day/mid evening. Another must try if you can get it! No anxiety or Paranoia!

Compared to the HH cold-filtered indicas, this one doesn&#39;t immediately Nyquil your ass to sleep. The taste is hard to pinpoint and honestly I forgot. It was fruity but not like... sweet? Kind of like lemon and cucumber spa water. This strain should be great for anxiety. It makes your brain shut up right away. Paranoia level: 1/10.

VI think this strain very quickly became one of my top tens.  It has an incredible grape and berry flavor followed by a very stringent chemical diesel flavor and some woody notes follow. The high is great, it sets about your head and shoulders with that wonderful Buzzy tingly sativa high and qickly followed down the rest of your body relaxing all the tension and stress. Great as a joint or blunt, as well as through big bongs.

VWell the truth of the matter is that this strain kicked my arse right to bed! Very nice experience after a gruelling couple of days. :) \u000aGot a cortisone and freezing shot in my knee two days before I smoked this bad boy. I felt so good I did a ton of stuff and overworked some of my other arthritic joints. Woke up stiff and in pain, stumbled through my day, and decided to try The Truth before bed. This hot babe cherishes her beauty sleep!\u000aSmoke was nice, did not cause an asthma attack or coughing fit. First impression was tension release, then a sense of overall relaxation. Definately dulled the pain and eased my muscles. I was so mellow and cozy after about 20 mins that I watched some tv &amp; cuddled the dogs. In about an hour or so I was ready for lights out- faster than this 25+ year user was expecting- and I had no problemo nodding off ... slept long &amp; hard too. Insomniacs should give this bad boy a try, same with nausea sufferers cause I found it settled my tummy too. Veteran approved strain for sure.
