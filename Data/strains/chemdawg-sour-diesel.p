VThis blew my high tolerance for THC right out the window with two bong hits. My anxiety is gone and there isn&#39;t a care in the world. Body feels comfortable and fuzzy, my head is flying and my chores are doing themselves. Couldn&#39;t be a more perfect strain for getting it done. Pungent Pinesol and Diesel aroma yet a very smooth, milky smoke. Glad I went for a 1/4oz of this before it sold out.

VThe Look: Heavy black and very juniper colored leafs in a very big pine tree that bushes out like if a pine tree had gained some middleweight it&#39;s a husky nug. \u000aThe Smell: Very dank diesel, very fresh grass cuttings smell like, it smells likes actual rain very impressive.\u000aThe Taste: Pungent, Musky, Harsh, Tea like and lots of herbal, pepper. \u000aThe Effect: Hits my third eye and I feel my lower back loosen up from being tense. \u000aHere&#39;s a little back story about this bud and why it&#39;s a fave. \u000aWe call it here Sour Chem. It&#39;s hard to find because it&#39;s a combination of Sour Diesel &amp; Chemical X aka Chemdawg D the 1997-2001 south calli strain. This was the third strain I tried, the first was Clockwork Orange, and I have yet to see it here., the second was Blue Dream. Sour Chem as I like to call it and it&#39;s what it&#39;s called here in NM. It&#39;s highly recommended for those who suffer from asthma like me. It also helps with tinnitus.

VMy experience with this strain is from vaping the shatter concentrate form. I find the initial effects subtle in onset but recognizable after several minutes. Creativity and invention drive increased, wanting to complete side projects/hobbies, ideas for new things, improvements. Though if you stop being productive you may tend towards couch-lock or chill mode. You can return to productivity with some effort, and completing tasks is more gratifying. This strain is not recommended for bedtime use, but can be a prep-for after dinner strain.

I think this strain is great for working out and doing things, but it still gives you a &#39;stoned&#39; feeling if you smoke a lot of it. Definitely an &#39;out of this world&#39; feeling! It also tastes a lot like dutchberry with diesel flavors.

VI just harvested my first Chem Sour plant of 2.  The buds growing in the pictures section is from my Csd&#39;s.    I trimmed off a few low, popcorn buds along the way.  I tried these buds from a month early, 3 weeks early, 2 weeks early and haven&#39;t tried a full ripe one yet as I just cut it down today and a bigger one tomorrow.      The 2 week early buds are AWESOME even without curing!   I chanced it and clipped about 20 grams when it dried of the 2 week early bud which is now curing for my daytime smoke and I wish I harvested at least 1/2 the plant or more at that time.   I love the exact high it gives me so much and lasts way longer than I expected too.   It has such a good uplifting, energized, happy feeling I was blown away.  My daughter burned out some friends tonight and they loved it too.     I&#39;m so happy I clipped some early and hanging now is about 40 grams when it dries of  full ripe fat nugs.   Stoked I grew this strain!   Tomorrow harvesting the other one at full ripe.

Valso known as East Coast Sour D..... imo this is the primordial of all the sour diesels.  Rez has been back crossing this inbred line for years, and the labors of toil are all in the smoke.

VI never had the chance to try sour diesel before, especially with chemdawg! This hybrid is awesome for pain relief &#129299; plus it helped me focus, but at the same time super baked. I don&#39;t know if that makes sense. Hmmmmm&#129300; I probably shouldn&#39;t write the review while I&#39;m medicated haha

VThis was the first strain I picked up the day I got my card in. I wanted to get some tangie but they only sold it in grams. This Sour Chem was nice absolutely beautiful coloring  and trichimes on the buds. It does were off quickly so that&#39;s why I only gave 3 stars. Love the caramels eating is such a better feeling and believe I will be doing more eating than smoking. I ate caramels and it felt like I was on a benzo of some kind mellow and total body high love it.

VThe taste is pretty good, like it\u2019s name says. There\u2019s a nice musky smell too.\u000aGood strain, the Sativa makes you happy pretty fast and stimulate you (^_^\u2019) while the Indica can lock you up to the couch. Depending if you are already sleepy or tired, it also helps a lot to fall asleep too. It has also a good chronic pain control.

VI have been smoking heavy for a while now, but oh boy does this strain pack a punch! It&#39;s fuel and skunky smell just fill up any room you&#39;re in. A personal hit can last quite a bit with sativa like effects, however a blunt or big joint can cause some indica like effects and lead to sleep. Definitely a must have if you can get. Not recommended for beginners.

VThis rating is for the shatter/wax variety of this strain.\u000a\u000aIt was a GREAT value, low cost shatter from a dispensary with a pungent terpy taste and noticeable citrus aroma. Earthy undertones in the flavor, and predominantly sativa  effects - however I don&#39;t think this will keep you up. Manufacturer &quot;baby gerrl&quot; out of the house of dank dispensary in Detroit. Quality was higher than expected at a low price point and a nice cerebral high.
