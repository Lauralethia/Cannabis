VA Great Strain. It is actually a isolated cut of Cannatonic bred for a better ratio of CBD to THC. This strain often tests less than 1% thc, and was derived for the application for more specific conditions such as Epilepsy. This strain does not get the user very high, and instead sends a wave of well being over the patient. It is a great choice for people with anxiety, or people sensitive to high amounts of THC. The strain smells of a lemony musk. A strain called &quot;Oracle&quot; is genetically the same through analytical testing, and must have descended from the same parents.

VPerfect for daytime use, or for work.  It helps with symptoms but no high what-so-ever.  It tastes and smells just as good as the &#39;dank&#39; stuff.  I have read the term &#39;clear-headed&#39; in some of these reviews and that nails it.  Even though it doesnt get you high, you just feel good and alert.  I always have it now for times when I dont want the high.

VAs an anxiety patient hooked on prescription meds and with a very negative reaction to THC, I never thought that I would find a medicine like this strain. I bought a small amount to try it out. It tested at 0.7 % THC and 18.3 % CBD. I was nervous, since my experiences with (high THC) cannabis has been horrible in the past. I took a couple small hits, waited, then took a few more. The strain brings on a slight warmth and relaxation. I felt a tiny bit of the THC, but that is due to my extremely low tolerance. No anxiety, no paranoia, just relaxation and comfort. I was able to sleep like a rock later on, which other strains have stopped me from doing due to the &#39;jarring&#39; effects. I really recommend this to anyone seeking relief from anxiety and mild/moderate pain. It isn&#39;t to harsh of a smoke either. I will definitely buy this again. \u000a

VThis is exactly what I was looking for - a strain that helps my chronic pain but does not get me high.  I do feel a difference.  I am more relaxed and happier when using this medicine but I am not feeling the full psychoactive effects of other strains.  I need this since I medicate daily, all day, for pain and I don&#39;t really want to be high all day, every day.  for sleep I use another strain but this is perfect for day use.  It really helps my pain.  My use of Norco has dropped in half in only the two weeks I have been using this.

VACDC is the most magical strain-pain reliever.  This should be in medicine cabinets everywhere.  It relieves cramps, eases stress, pumps up the happiness level several notches, and gives you an overall sense of well-being without zonking you out.  There&#39;s no couchlock or deadhead spaciness.  You can focus and even work, if necessary.  It increases appetite without causing ravenous munchies.  \u000a\u000aACDC is amazeballs.  Pick it up.  Vape it.  Smoke it.  Fall in love with it.  Savor it to the last little nug.  (And then go find more).

VGreat pain reliever and great tasting bud. Helps me be pain-free for a good 4-5 hours which is the most relief I have ever had from any other medicine. Melts away my pain almost instantly. No psychoactive effects, so it is great for daytime use. I would definitely recommend for people with high pain levels that want to stay functional throughout the day.

VThis strain has been a life changer for me.  As a sufferer of severe anxiety and PTSD, I could never smoke cannabis without having horrible paranoia and a racy head. Mixing this strain with any strain completely eliminates those effects for me, and if smoked alone - the anxiety little melts out of my body.  AC/DC has allowed me to try strains like sativa dominant strains that I normally would never be able to function if smoked alone.  The distributor is Goldleaf/Ataraxia, and it has literally made me choose to start my xanax taper months before I thought I&#39;d be ready to.  I can also say it&#39;s reduced the severity of the withdrawals by a lot! Also the positive mood is no joke! I have been in a GREAT mood since I&#39;ve started using this strain daily.  It has completely curbed my depression.  This strain is one I will always have on hand. 10/10.

VI have been managing my pain from a spiral fracture of my right femur in 2006.  This is by far the BEST strain I have used in managing my lower back, hip, knee and leg pain that I have tried  since 2006.  I can not say enough about this strain!  It is amazing and works in about 10 mins my pain goes down to a level of 2 from a constant 7..... and it lasts for about 6 hours of pain relief!!      It is at Perennial Holistic Wellness Center in Studio City, Ca.   The ADCD - 2421 strain simply  RULES.  -  THANK  YOU TO WHO EVERMADE THIS STRAIN!!!!!   - Peace... Vincenzo Thomas Amato.

VThis is so far, by far, my absolute favorite high CBD strain. I&#39;ve been taking benzos for over twenty years, something I wish were not the case, but when I smoke ACDC, the effects are infinitely preferable. It treats my panic disorder with agoraphobia, OCD, and generalized social anxiety better than any benzo ever has, which is an amazing thing. \u000a\u000aWith just one to two nugs, I&#39;m rewarded with a beautiful sense of relaxation.  No noise in my head, no OCD thoughts. I feel happy. I can laugh and smile and my mind isn&#39;t in a constant loop of fear and anxiety.  It&#39;s sad to say this, because I&#39;ve only been living half a life *for* half my life, but ACDC allows me to feel good about myself and to feel unafraid.  This plant is a true gift.   \u000a\u000aAfter being on Valium for so many years, as some out there may know, the effects don&#39;t quite work any longer and what you&#39;re basically doing is taking the pill so you don&#39;t suffer from what are horrific withdrawals.  With the help of ACDC, I&#39;ve even been able to (slowly!) taper my dosage somewhat and those feelings of withdrawal--which from a benzo are extremely unpleasant and can be deadly--are not quieted completely but they are calmed considerably. \u000a\u000aACDC does, however give me a terrible headache, but it&#39;s something I&#39;m willing to overlook.  I may stop smoking and begin to vape it, but it just works so well that I&#39;m reluctant to switch things up.  Feeling baseline and normal, able to leave the house and enjoy a night out with friends is such an incredible, beautiful gift.  \u000a\u000aThe 20 to 1 ratio is what works best for me, I&#39;ve tried strains of ACDC that were kind of off, like 16 to 4 or 12 to 3, for me the magic number really does seem to be that 20 to 1.  \u000a\u000aA great plant and I like it even more than Cannatonic, which can make me a little bit paranoid; not something I need!  \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;ve struggled with anxiety, please, please give this plant a try?  It has honestly changed my life.

The body high I got from this was very relaxing and yes I did feel a very minimal head high with clarity.It was not overwhelming at all I could still do work or a task without a doubt.

VQuick back round check. I&#39;m not a recreational smoker and it&#39;s been about 13yrs since I&#39;ve smoked any marijuana. The last time I smoked it gave me a panic attack and was left feeling very paranoid. Recently, I have been looking into alternatives to pain pills because it&#39;s taking it&#39;s toll on my body. I&#39;m not an anxious person but never had a good experience with marijuana and was left put off. I recently did a lot research on CBD strains and read a lot of testimonials that left me feeling optimistic. I went ahead and got a recommendation for my medical condition and picked up some ACDC  from a local dispensary. I was very hesitant to smoke because of past experiences. Today, I finally built up enough courage and  took 2 small tokes, in about 5mins I felt some pain a relief (50%or so) and I also felt calm and relaxed so I took a 3rd toke. Fast forward 2hrs or so, I was getting a little stressed with kids so, I went out and took 2 big rips because I wanted to see if it would keep my from punching my kids (JK, and YES it did help me from getting further upset). I felt a little anxious at first because I might of over done it but, it was more a self induced feeling I put on myself. In about 5mins of coming back into the house I was more calm and chill with pain around 70% better. In my experience I would hiighly recommended strain to anyone with pain or anxiety. This strain will NOT give you a head buzz and good for putting you at ease. A big  plus, you can stay active and do your day to day activities because there is no stuck/couch lock or lazy feeling. It&#39;s a strain that I will definitely pick up again. Don\u2019t hesitate, try this strain you will not regret it.

VI needed a good daytime strain. Something that will ease my pain but keep my head clear. I run my own business so being high all day, as fun as it may be, is not what I want. When I first tried acdc I wasn&#39;t sure if it was working. I&#39;m used to THC dominant strains and the familiar sensations they bring. This CBD dominant strain gives you all the relief without the &quot;high&quot;. After about 20 minutes I realized my mood was great and my pain was eased. This is the exact result I was hoping for so I can use it and remain focused and productive at work.

VThis strain is purely medicinal. I originally started using cannabis to help my anxiety, but living in Nevada, there isn&#39;t many high CBD strains due to the high demand for recreational strains. After trying several different high THC strains, THC and CBD, and even regular CBD oil, I decided maybe cannabis wasn&#39;t the best option for my anxiety. Then I discovered ACDC. Tested at 0.06% THC and 10% CBD, I was excited to try this strain that wouldn&#39;t result in a psychoactive high. I felt a slight discomfort after my first few puffs, which was most likely just anticipation anxiety. When it finally kicked in, I realized that this strain is the one for me. I wouldn&#39;t say it has any &#39;&#39;in your face&#39;&#39; effects at all. However, there is an intense calm, and mild euphoria as all your pain, inflammation, and anxiety melts away. Great strain for daytime/nighttime, as it can ease you into a deep sleep and also provide the relief you need to get up and kickstart your day. Would reccomend to those who are fans of high THC strains, as it can be a great daytime alternative that provides nice, soothing effects, without the mind altering high. Would HIGHLY reccomend to any patients looking to treat pain and anxiety.

VSon has epilepsy and autism. Strain is very good when delivered as cannabis butter melted and delivered PO ( by mouth). NO adverse reactions. Great med for autistic people who are sensitive to drug interactions if they are currently taking conventional seizure meds. AC/DC strain is very LOW in THC and HIGH in CBDs which makes for a great PRN or daily med for autistic people who have seizure but also need this strain to calm down so they can void properly, reduce their self abuse and reduce seizures. It&#39;s a great med. Should be top shelve for anyone with seizures and autism.

Vearlier reviewers mentioned eased social awkwardness, energizing (&#39;pepped up&#39;), relaxation, well-being, tingling.  not much about its pain-relief properties though, even with this being a CBD-rich strain created for medicinal usage.  happily, my experience of the sample I vaped (0.7%THC, 13%CBD), confirmed the other reviewers&#39; observations - and added significant pain-relief.  I found that it made me less socially anxious, was energizing (sativa-dominant), and combines the analgesic effect THC has on my nerve pain (L4-L5 nerve compression) with the anti-inflammatory quality of CBD - it&#39;s working for my heel issue too (plantar fasciitis).  it&#39;s a kind of &#39;Goldilocks&#39; strain: energizing, anti-anxiety, analgesic.  full disclosure: I&#39;m a lightweight, so a bong hit&#39;s worth in my magic flight (about 10 vapes) gave me a light THC buzz, reminiscent of what I got after smoking a joint in the early 1970&#39;s.  if you&#39;re used to consuming 1/2 g. of flower at a session, you probably won&#39;t get a THC buzz.  I&#39;ll need to do further &#39;research&#39;, but, having tried other high CBD strains and not finding them very effective for my issues, as well as taking CBD and CBD/THC caps, which only worked sometimes - esp. the hybrid caps in tandem with Ibuprofen, I think this may be the best of all for someone who has &#39;hybrid&#39; (nerve + inflammation) pain.  I was tempted to say &#39;like a half valium and a pain pill&#39;, but there&#39;s that energizing effect too, to give you an idea of what this unique strain is like.

VI used to smoke pot a lot in my teens and it was great then, no paranoia, just the giggles and relaxing euphoric feeling but when you&#39;re a teen you don&#39;t really have as many worries as an adult! fast forward to adulthood and all of the sudden everytime i smoked with friends all that happened was extreme paranioa and total negative head trips!!  needless to say i quit smoking for a good 20 years.  now with the legalization here in California and all the different strains available i thought I&#39;d give it a try.  I&#39;m a mom with a stressfull job and kids to take care of so my job doesn&#39;t end when i get home but this is such a great strain! i feel totally clearhaeded and energetic and ready when i get home.  hey maybe there are some moms out there that can do it without but i needed help, even went to the doctor for antidepressants because i felt so shitty that my job was taking everything and i felt like i was drained at yhe end of the day and had nothing left for my family.  i got rid of the antidepressants and stopped drinking wine every night to cope.  now i just take a few hits and feel relaxed happy and energized but not amped up.  it&#39;s perfect for someone that wants to unwind but still be able to focus. Highly Recommend!!

Stressful-AF-days need THC... except that&#39;s not the case at all. \u000aIf you are anything like me - sensitive to everything - then you&#39;re going to love this gift from heaven that goes by the name of ACDC.\u000aBy my second hit I was already feeling a deep body relaxation only to be followed by a meditative state while still wide awake. I literally found myself grinding my bud (which is usually an ever-so-fast process) so but sooo slowly and in such peace as if I had all the time in the world and didn&#39;t want to lose the newfound feeling of my body&#39;s energy vibration.

VGood pain and anxiety relief. I wasn&#39;t high or stoned, but I can&#39;t say there was no psycho-activity. About 30 minutes after I smoked a half J I noticed that I felt different. I was calm, social, talkative, happy, but not euphoric. I had lost track of time hanging out, and once I was outside I thought yes, this is a high. It continued to build slowly over time until a soft landing later on. Later on, I had a regular dose of my usual weed, and had a much deeper experience than usual.\u000a\u000aIn summary, think chamomile tea on steroids, + pain relief and no sleepiness.

VBnzo may have been a more appropriate title for this strain. I struggle with anxiety/panic disorder accompanied by insomnia and this is the only strand that I will smoke when I&#39;m feeling panicky. Others, even low-thc/high-cbd, make my mind race. Though Acdc is sometimes sold as a sativa, it doesn&#39;t make me antsy or turn my stomach into a bottomless pit, as sativa&#39;s often do. Everyone is different, just had to share my experience in case anyone else can benefit from this as well.

VThis was my second cannabis smoke. I have severe panic attacks and general anxiety. I was looking for a high CBD to help me with this without the nasty side effects of benzos or antidepressants.\u000a\u000aI tried another strain before, as that one had lower THC content and I&#39;m really trying to avoid the head high, scared that it might trigger a panic attack.\u000a\u000aI have only smoked ACDC once, but I could feel a mild reduction of my anxiety in 2-3 minutes after I smoked (3 puffs).\u000a\u000aI went on with my regular evening, and later I decided to smoke a bit more. (4-5 puffs).\u000a\u000aAbout an hour after that I was in my bed, getting ready for sleep, and I noticed that my anxiety was gone! I felt normal again! I fell a sleep with such an ease that I haven&#39;t experienced in so many years. \u000a\u000aI had zero negative side effects, and I didn&#39;t get a head high at all. I&#39;m guessing this really neat relaxation of the body is what people call body high? If that&#39;s the case, then that&#39;s the only thing I got.\u000a\u000aThe one I got was tested at 1.31% THC, 19.42% CBD

VI hope that I can find this strain for the rest of my life. \u000aI have very bad social anxiety (diagnosed) and I am not a big fan of the traditional head/body highs you get from THC just because it makes me more self conscious about how stoned I look. \u000aThat being said, ACDC has allowed me to smoke and pep up, feel a lot less on edge and focus more on the things I need to get done.  I end up just getting really smiley and a lot more social (which I need). \u000a\u000aIf you are looking for that head or body high then I don&#39;t know how you found this page since its notorious for its high CBD content and very low THC content.  \u000a\u000aShout out to the guys at LAPCG as well, they are extremely friendly and nice and make it very comfortable to shop. I will definitely return.

I am a heavy smoker and like the &quot;high&quot; of high THC strains, but I got to say that this strain is truly a medical strain and it fucking kicks ass. A great strain for pain management and it is very relaxing. If they sell it at your rec shop or medical shop.......get some.

The smell is a piney lemon scent and the smoke is smOoOoth, no harshness whatsoever. I can FINALLY enjoy smoking again, thank GOD for high CBD strains and for ACDC!! Highly recommend!!

VI&#39;ve been searching for a balance with medical marijuana for 15 months. With issues like ADHD/ADD/Tourette&#39;s/Anxiety, most medications fix one issue and exacerbate another (adderral helps focus, makes tics worse etc..) I have tried several indica strains because of a bad experience with a sativa strain (made tics and anxiety much worse). What I found is that the THC was not the best compound for my specific condition(s). After reading more and more about the physiology behind CBD, I decided to give it a shot because I can&#39;t use the indica during the day anyway. Well this strain might be the game changer. I have noticed a reduction in anxiety, a reduction in tics and an overall sense of relaxation and wellbeing. I know that sounds cliche but it&#39;s the truth. I have been seeing specialists for years now, bouncing from one pharmaceutical to another, finally over to medical marijuana and 15 months later finally to CBD. This is truly a godsend for me and I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from a similar condition. I never thought I could find a daytime medication so effective with NO SIDE EFFECTS. I think my 6 year search is finally over. I can&#39;t describe how happy that makes me. I knew the answer was here somewhere, I just had to dig it out.

VI picked up this strain to mix with others, primarily because I&#39;ve read that CBDs can counteract some of the paranoia that some strains  can cause. I&#39;ve found that&#39;s true. But I&#39;ve also taken to smoking it it on its own, because the effects, though subtle, are so pleasant and relaxing.\u000a\u000aThere&#39;s no euphoria or heightened senses or weird, stoney thinking. But there is a psychoactive effect, at least for me: a gentle, calm feeling of well being and a bit more focus than I usually experience in my daily life.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s really wonderful.

VSevered nerve - extreme pain. THC-intolerant: causes extreme paranoia, anxiety, psychosis. Also need to function, work, think, read, speak. This ACDC is miraculous. Pain relief with no brain high, only a bit of welcome euphoria, relaxation. Perfect for daytime pain crises and sleeping at night. Though reading boring stuff for work requires a coffee to stay awake. Also requires additional doses as it wears off quickly and when it does the FULL extent of the pain is manifested. As a bedtime elixir: perfect, zero trouble reading and relaxing. Plus an excellent night&#39;s sleep! IF there is a tiny amount of anxiety it is manageable, certainly nothing one could call paranoia. As a bonus the minty citrus taste means I don&#39;t need to brush my teeth anymore. Leafly - thanks for this forum. The entire world will benefit not only from these blessed strains but also the combined real world analysis here. Now, if these critical medical strains were to be available everywhere as well. Written without slang for Google translatability. Recommend highly! Thank you to the developers.

VFirst time trying this one. Vaped a bit more of it than other strains in order to feel the effects more. Initially there is a headiness which may cause a TINY anxiety rush if you react to meds kicking in. However it&#39;s passed within 2-3 mins and moves down to the body. Thinking is clear, mind is calm, body is a bit numb but not in a disconnected sort of way. I suffer from anxiety and am pretty sensitive to meds. I can promise, you will not have a bad experience with this strain.

VAnyone who says that high CBD strains won&#39;t get you high, have obviously never tried AC/DC. This won&#39;t get you &quot;high&quot; the same way that THC dominant strains do, but you will feel a body high with slight psychological effects. \u000a\u000aAC/DC is very relaxing, but I don&#39;t feel relaxed to the point that I&#39;m tired. My mind is super calm and anxiety melts away. Even if I get a feeling that I COULD have anxiety, it goes away almost immediately. I&#39;ll then feel happy and more peaceful because I don&#39;t have anxiety (obviously lol). I get a slight head buzz with this strain, as well. It&#39;s kinda tingly feeling, with a slight alteration on my perception. It&#39;s very mild though, and I still feel very alert and focused. \u000a\u000aWhat&#39;s great about this strain, is that you can mix it with other strains to make your own little concoction. I have mixed this with Jack Herer and Lucid Dream, and I have had amazing results. THC and CBD absolutely work together, so I want to have a good amount of both to medicate with. If you get anxiety from high THC strains, try mixing this in. You will feel so much better. \u000a\u000aSadly, this strain can be somewhat difficult to find. I have one dispensary near me that actually always has it in stock, which I am very thankful for. I wish more dispensaries would carry high CBD flower, as there are patients who actually need it. \u000a\u000aThis strain is fantastic, and I recommend it to anyone. Give it a try; I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like it more than you think.

VI&#39;m giving this strain 5 stars because it&#39;s holds up to the &quot;smells like/smokes like&quot; real weed. I say &quot;real&quot; because with less than 1% THC and 20% CBD it&#39;s by no means traditional. Kind of like fat free mayonnaise. \u000a\u000a1.) My buddy who is quite the weed hound took one sniff and said &quot;Wow, this smells like actual weed unlike Cannatonic!&quot;\u000a\u000a2.) It will give you absolutely ZERO high. We&#39;re talking, none. For those of you that might be concerned about getting too high, or you&#39;re smoking for the first time - these are the training wheels you want to slap on the bike. \u000a\u000a3.) You just feel better after a few hits. I&#39;m a pretty high strung guy and can battle anxiety from time-to-time, and this is a really good strain to just hit the CBD, feel a little calmer and chill out. \u000a\u000aI smoke stuff that&#39;&#39;s quite a bit heavier than this, but I&#39;ll tell you what, AC/DC at a 1:20 ratio makes great cut. For instance. If you want to get a little bit of a buzz you can cut it in 1:3 or 1:2 with some higher THC and get more of a &quot;high&quot; without the...um, high. It&#39;s weird, but CBD does a fantastic job of blocking the psychoactive in THC yet allowing the mellow, chill feeling that THC can bring. It&#39;s amazing. \u000a\u000aSo, to TLDR; this: Buy a quarter of this. Smoke it anytime, for a no-high relaxed feeling. Best smelling high-CBD strain.

VACDC has changed my life. I smoked for many years in my 20&#39;s. I had a medical issue that put me close to death.  When i recovered, all of my old favorite strains cause severe debilitating anxiety. I went to the emergency room convinced that I was having a heart attack. This is coming from someone that rolled a one ounce jumbo joint for her 21st birthday and smoked a quarter of it by herself,lol. So I stopped smoking, and i cried about it a lot. Lady cannabis has always been my healer, if i couldn&#39;t sleep, was having anxiety, had nausea, pain etc, i always had my sweet lady cannabis. About 5 years later, I heard about ACDC and strains like Charlotte&#39;s web. I sought them out, but living in Ma, there is no CW. I did find ACDC after much searching. I was still scared, so I sent a sample to a local lab to have the THC/CBD etc examined. She came in at 19% CBD and .8 percent THC. I was excited but still nervous. I tried just a little puff, but didn&#39;t hold it in at first. Then I got up the courage to hold a puff in and, oh my goodness. Instant relief, giggles, relaxation, lessened back and bladder pain, and a hint of the munchies. I can&#39;t say enough about my sweet girl ACDC, bless the healing power of cannabis. ACDC has a piney scent with hints of earth and pungency, she has light red hairs and medium green leaves.

I read about this strain on a IBD forum for chrones and UC.  Decided to give it a shot.  Why the hell not? I haven\u2019t really been into weed for years i hate the paranoia and couch lock.  I hate feeling like I\u2019m an alien or being overly aware of my hands or pores.\u000a\u000aSmoked half a preroll of it in the am when my cramping and bm\u2019s make me bed ridden or bathroom floor ridden- and usually this means I\u2019m unable to start my day or even get into work. Legit 20 min in to what is usually 3 hours of hell my cramps and tenesmus it all started subsiding my body relaxed my head wasn\u2019t stressed out with the usual \u201cwtf I\u2019m dying.  I should really see a doctor and try their steroids they keep pushing on me\u201d thoughts. \u000a\u000aIBD people should be aware it\u2019s my choice to not try steroids due to mood swings mine are already bad enough. I have UC and use Lialda daily.\u000a\u000aAmazingly I was able to get up and get ready.  Mind you super damn slowly but i started my day. This def wasn\u2019t a hundred cure all I still felt bad, but not the norm bad where I\u2019m forced into the fetal position on the floor while tenesmus turns you into a marionette springing to life running to the loo every ten minutes.   Yet I had an appetite and my body was relaxed enough and my head was less stressed. All the bad thoughts that come with the pain came but quickly left, and the pain was pretty much gone within an hour too! \u000a\u000aThe real surprise is it\u2019s been 2 weeks of solid use and my bm\u2019s are not a walk in the park but def way more normal and improving each day.  I haven\u2019t been bed ridden in the morning more than 15-30 minutes.  \u000a\u000aMind you all of this is with a proper diet and lots of water and tons of supplements NAC, D3, zinc, turmeric, multi, probiotics etc. I haven\u2019t added in exercise due to joint inflammation this past year but I\u2019m starting to feel more normal.  Even stairs haven\u2019t been as painful.  This strain makes me feel hopeful that within the next month I\u2019ll be back at the gym. \u000a\u000a\u000aAll of this with no psychoactive affects and being able to have a clear head.

VI like to think of this as a medicinal tea. None of the paranoid effects associated with THC. Relaxing but doesn\u2019t feel chemical in the ways that certain pharmaceutical drugs can feel, and without the side effects of dependency and amnesia. \u000aAnother way of thinking about it is as a potent dose of chamomile tea. Calms the nerves, has a mild analgesic effect, leads to gentle relaxation. I am extremely sensitive to THC, and have intense anxiety issues, and this is a nice calm to the storm\u2014if yoga and meditation ain\u2019t cutting it anymore ;-)

VOK, I picked up the strain so I could enjoy smoke without the THC (kind of like drinking a nonalcoholic beer). With that said, there still feels like there are psycho active effects; including munchies! They say there&#39;s only 1% THC and 20% CBD in the strain. Well I can tell it&#39;s not nearly as potent as regular weed, I still feel quite satisfied. Placebo fact? Is there a more THC the strain then the lead on? I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to drive on it. Or maybe, the CBD and other compounds have a much greater impact in cannabis then I ever knew. Excited to try this more, especially on the weeks

VI was looking for a strain for Panic Disorder and Anxiety.  I found Charlotte&#39;s Web, however it seems next to impossible to find.  So, then I stumbled on ACDC and how perfect!    It has 0.42%-1.2% of THC and 16-24% CBD!   That&#39;s about as &quot;high&quot; a CBD strain you can ask for.  Well, I&#39;m not one to talk since this is the FIRST I&#39;ve ever smoked.  Anyways, ZERO negative effects, just a very mellow feel.  Very happy to have found it.  Looking forward to trying more!

VThis is a great strain for treating pain and inflammation at home. I had been using ACDC in vape form for a while before I found the flower. The flower isn&#39;t as strong as the vape, vape lite at most, so I had to smoke a little more than I usually do. However, it had very little head high for me so, that wasn&#39;t an issue. Bonus- because it&#39;s more body-high and mood lifting than &quot;stoned&quot;, it&#39;s a great option before work.

VJust grinded up about a 3/4grm. bud in my new Tsunami grinder. Rolled it all up (perfect fit) in a Strawberry White Owl, which smelled great but not much Strawberry flavor. The ACDC is soo smooth, no harshness whatsoever even in a blunt. Within minutes I felt a slight head high (nothing overwhelming) and thought I was gonna start feeling paranoid...but never did. It&#39;s like my mind was trying to trick me into paranoia but the ACDC stopped it and reverted my thought process is a better direction (kinda crazy actually lol) I can even tell by how much I&#39;m writing that it&#39;s given me more patience and making me WANT to write this review. Oh...lol....so I smoked about half the blunt, maybe 10 hits, then put it out. Once I felt sure that I wasn&#39;t gonna freak out I decided to smoke a little more, maybe 5 more hits. At about that time I noticed the body relaxation really kicked in and my thoughts slowed down even more (a good thing) then put it out and right away wanted to review it for you guys =) I&#39;ll leave it at this...if you were a heavy heavy smoker and had to quit due to crippling paranoia but always missed smoking and wanted to be able to smoke again REALLY bad but couldn&#39;t...get yourself some effin ACDC dude...like for real tho! haha...I&#39;m out!

VACDC has changed my life. I smoked for many years in my 20&#39;s. I had a medical issue that put me close to death.  When i recovered, all of my old favorite strains cause severe debilitating anxiety. I went to the emergency room convinced that I was having a heart attack. This is coming from someone that rolled a one ounce jumbo joint for her 21st birthday and smoked a quarter of it by herself,lol. So I stopped smoking, and i cried about it a lot. Lady cannabis has always been my healer, if i couldn&#39;t sleep, was having anxiety, had nausea, pain etc, i always had my sweet lady cannabis. About 5 years later, I heard about ACDC and strains like Charlotte&#39;s web. I sought them out, but living in Ma, there is no CW. I did find ACDC after much searching. I was still scared, so I sent a sample to a local lab to have the THC/CBD etc examined. She came in at 19% CBD and .8 percent THC. I was excited but still nervous. I tried just a little puff, but didn&#39;t hold it in at first. Then I got up the courage to hold a puff in and, oh my goodness. Instant relief, giggles, relaxation, lessened back and bladder pain, and a hint of the munchies. I can&#39;t say enough about my sweet girl ACDC, bless the healing power of cannabis. ACDC has a piney scent with hints of earth and pungency, she has light red hairs and medium green leaves.

VThis is hands down the best strain I have ever used for treating pain. I used the vape cartridge from Absolute Xtracts. I felt the effect of this after 2-3 hits, which is much faster than usual for me. It dulled the pain from a migraine almost immediately, and that&#39;s a tall order. With migraines you have to address the pain FAST or else it gets exponentially worse. This really did the trick.\u000a\u000aSide effects I experienced included feeling relaxed/peaceful, a little sleepy, and I think it also dulled my appetite for the rest of the day. \u000a\u000aHighly recommended for anyone struggling with pain. I think this could also be worth a try if you&#39;re struggling with insomnia due to how relaxing it is.

VEven though my AC/DC only has 5% CBD, it&#39;s still amazing.  I&#39;m extremely sensitive to THC so I was worried that even 1% would be too much, but it&#39;s perfect.  Just the &quot;kick&quot; that was lacking in the Cherry Wine hemp I&#39;ve been smoking (which incidentally has more CBD at 14% but undetectable levels of THC).\u000a\u000aACDC&#39;s smell is a light citrus (lemon-lime) scent with mild pine undertones.  Definitely some limonene &amp; pinene in there.  The effects are soaring &amp; calm at the same time.  Feels like it&#39;s clearing the cobwebs &amp; fog out of my brain.  It&#39;s a lot less &quot;heavy&quot; than the super-high CBD stuff I&#39;ve been using, which hits me in the back of the head &amp; often triggers mild migraine/head pain.  \u000a\u000aI&#39;d love to try ACDC from a dispensary to see if the effects are similar to the stuff I&#39;ve got.  I&#39;d rate this a solid 4 in terms of effects, though the looks are less than impressive lol.  It&#39;s bone dry &amp; the buds are teeny tiny.  You can still see the frosty stuff though if you look really close :)

VI was not a marijuana smoker in high school or even as a young adult because the paranoia &amp; loss of control I felt was way to much for me. I had the opportunity to become a pot head because I had so many friends who sold and smoked it. I\u2019m sure there were several different strains as well, but each time I\u2019d take a puff, within minutes I\u2019d be on a bad trip. In fact most of my life I didn\u2019t understand how my hubby and several friends could smoke and still function? Fast forward to today, I have chronic pain because of a car accident that left me with a neck injury and childhood trauma that left me with depression and anxiety. I\u2019ve been on many medications over the years, done chiropractic, acupuncture, yoga, and other stuff to alleviate the pain at the expense of my kidney &amp; liver. My husband suggested medical marijuana and I knew I had to give it a try. It has been so surprising how well my mind and body are relived using the AC/DC CBD Oil! It has been perfect for me. I never imagined I\u2019d be a proponent of medical marijuana but here I am writing a review on one of my favorite natural medicines! If your story is similar to mine you must try the AC/DC strain.

VAhh, yes AC/DC just an excellent strain for patients who respond to CBD therapy better than others. The 24% CBD most definitely makes my mind and body feel energized, creative, focused, and yet it will work on my headache or the anti-inflammatory properties for my back spasams. I most definitely get uplifted when I use AC/DC it&#39;s a powerful tool in my fight against pain and opiate addiction...a very thin line. I have slowly been tapering down on opiates with the help of cannabis and specifically AC/DC.

VThis strain is perfect for those who are sensitive to THC but need the help of a strong CBD for pain. I have chronic back pain issues, so this is a great fit. Mostly, it&#39;s helpful because I have a 10 month old girl, and being married, I don&#39;t particularly like being cerebral and overly medicated. This is exactly what people need to help cope if they don&#39;t want to feel high. Sure, after a big bowl you might get a little lifted feeling, but you&#39;re completely functional and a little more light-hearted. It&#39;s the perfect fit for someone like me.

VThis is the only strain that I can vape during the day that doesn&#39;t give me that &#39;burn out&#39; feeling that too much THC gives you when you start coming down. Especially if you need to stay productive, it can be annoying to fight the tiredness that some of us feel from THC from vaping/smoking in the morning/afternoon and this is the answer! It allows you to be relaxed and feel like you&#39;re floating but without the head high, which is great for needing to stay focused or social but also feeling medicated. And what&#39;s even better is it keeps your tolerance to THC down so when you do vape the weed with high THC at night, it helps with insomnia and you get blasted. I have chronic neck pain from college football and the CBD percentage in this strain is so high, it takes away my pain almost instantly! Truly a gift from above

VThis strain is perfect for those who are sensitive to THC but need the help of a strong CBD for pain. I have chronic back pain issues, so this is a great fit. Mostly, it&#39;s helpful because I have a 10 month old girl, and being married, I don&#39;t particularly like being cerebral and overly medicated. This is exactly what people need to help cope if they don&#39;t want to feel high. Sure, after a big bowl you might get a little lifted feeling, but you&#39;re completely functional and a little more light-hearted. It&#39;s the perfect fit for someone like me.

VACDC is quite  different  from  other hugh CBD strains incuding  Harlequin  which is amazing.  The ACDC I have from New Vansterdam in Portland  area is really wonderful  the only drawback  being  hard  to  stay  lit and  I had to relight  after  every  hit. The  flavor  is spicy, the smell  is  pleasant  but strong my wife  tells me. You do get a mild wide awake  talkative  high even though  mine was tested at 1.5%thc and 20.5% cbd. I only  use about  3 hits  at a time.  The high  cbd reduces  pain butcit takes an hour  or  so  and the inflammation  reduction  is pronounced nutvyou need  to  use it everyday at least once  for 3 or  more  days.  I have inflammation  related issues  for years and ACDC has helped  more  than anything including  steroids  which  I  used  for  years. Sleep  is good and energy  pretty  high as well.  You will  want  to  talk  a lot.\u000aGREAT STRAIN!!

VSo being a lightweight who has not smoked in almost 20 years I tried this due to its low THC rating. I have tried it three times and I would say the psychoactive effects are pretty much non existent. You get a mild head high for maybe 20-30 minutes (I take 2-3 hits) and all your muscles relax. It feels like a strong muscle relaxer and its quite nice. Very mellow pain killer, I felt a slight euphoria but again like I said very mild (like a glass of wine) I would be interested in trying a strain w a bit higher THC but the CBD seems perfect! :)

VIf you&#39;ve never tried a CBD-focused strain before, I highly recommend it. CBD has worked wonders for my trigeminal neuralgia, and it also helped with a short-term muscle tightness in my back. You don&#39;t get high from it like you do THC, but there is definitely an overall euphoria that kicks in as it loosens up your body.\u000a\u000aThe ACDC I got has 20% CBD and 1% THC. The interesting thing, for me, is that CBD takes a little while to kick in compared to THC. So there&#39;s a very mild THC &quot;lift&quot; that happens initially after inhaling, and then within about 15 minutes I feel every muscle in my body relax to what feels like its &quot;default state.&quot; I&#39;m not impaired by the relaxation, rather I&#39;m freed by it.\u000a\u000aACDC is good to have around both for when you just want CBD or you want to blend a little CBD with your THC strains. I am very sensitive to strains that induce paranoia, and you can very quickly and easily mitigate that with some CBD. ACDC provides that option, for sure.\u000a\u000aThere&#39;s a mild tingliness that sometimes happens for me with CBD, and ACDC can definitely kick that in. When it happens, it&#39;s blissful. I just wish it happened every time I used this strain!

VWow, just wow. I&#39;m not even sure where to begin. So, I picked up some ACDC from Desert Rose here in AZ. Normally, I am a fan of high THC indica strains; in fact, prior to ACDC, I had never had a high CBD strain. Here in Arizona, it&#39;s a beautiful day. It&#39;s about 60&#176; out, with a slight breeze, and scattered showers. As I am writing this, I have just finished a 1g joint of said ACDC. \u000a\u000aThe immediate effects that I noticed were as follows. Upon taking my first drag, I felt an immediate and engulfing sensation of calm. My entire mood shifted up, and I set down my phone to just take in the beauty of the world. \u000a\u000aAbout halfway through the joint, my body began to feel light and airy. At this point, there still was no sensation of being high; just a positive shift throughout my whole body.\u000a\u000aAs I finished the joint, I noticed that there still was no noticeable euphoria telling me that I am medicated. Instead, I feel rejuvenated; fresh as if after the best sleep of my life. I&#39;m uplifted, my body is not aching or throbbing, I feel calm and at peace. I HIGHLY recommend this strain. The calming effects are astounding.

VI\u2019m a 33 year old man who has a hard time admitting that I suffer from anxiety and depression. AC/DC is the best medication that I have ever taken. I can smoke a little and after about 15 mins have an overall sense of well being. It takes the edge off of the negativity that is a constant monkey on my back. If your suffer from anxiety  and also thc induced anxiety you should definitely give AC/DC a shot! Light a joint, pack a bowl, or take bong rip and let the true medicinal value of cbd ease your pain.

VSo being a lightweight who has not smoked in almost 20 years I tried this due to its low THC rating. I have tried it three times and I would say the psychoactive effects are pretty much non existent. You get a mild head high for maybe 20-30 minutes (I take 2-3 hits) and all your muscles relax. It feels like a strong muscle relaxer and its quite nice. Very mellow pain killer, I felt a slight euphoria but again like I said very mild (like a glass of wine) I would be interested in trying a strain w a bit higher THC but the CBD seems perfect! :)

Vamazing strain. if you get anxious or paranoid when you smoke, try this strain. you get a very unique high. you don&#39;t get a &quot;head high&quot; you just feel very relaxed. you get high but you don&#39;t feel euphoria, giggles, anxiety, or paranoid, you just feek very relaxed. definitely recommend this strain to anyone smoking for medical reasons, has a low tolerance, or someone who wants to smoke and be social.

VVery skeptical at first since I heard there is no head buzz, I felt like I was ripped off...but over the course of the day I noticed that my back pain was not even notable.  This was the first reaction I had to it.  Later I felt my body very light, more talkative and more euphoric. Still not completely sure about this strain, very strange, was the fact that it smelt earthy (just like Jack Herer) but the exhale was very clear and almost tasteless.  A very confusing experience but I know I did feel the effects just very subtle but great.

VSorry, I ran a little long on my review... \u000a\u000aI have MS. Over the 18+ years I&#39;ve been ill I have tried MJ several times. Back in my teens - early 20s I was a constant MJ smoker. Then I entered a career that was not conducive to drug use and stopped. \u000a\u000aHowever, My illness led to eventual disability. Eventually It was suggested that I try MJ and I thought &quot;heck yeah!&quot;  Unfortunately though, every time I tried it I wound up paranoid, anxious and my muscles twitched for hours. I&#39;m in Cali but all my experimenting was before we had legal medical MJ. \u000a\u000aSince then medical use of MJ has improved dramatically. With the ability to study the effects of each strain, cross breed and treat a wide variety of symptoms I decided to try again, this time using Leafly as a guide as well as friends recommendations I settled on ACDC. I was looking for something relaxing but not sedative, that would help with pain and stiffness but would not mess with my ability to think or induce paranoia or anxiety. \u000a\u000aBang! I hit gold. ACDC filled all my criteria. My first hit was long and deep, yet didn&#39;t set me coughing. I waited about 10 minutes and could feel my pain level drop a notch. I had a vague sense of being medicated in my head but only just a bit. I followed up with two more good deep hits.\u000a\u000aThat gave me what I was looking for. My pain dropped to  4, I could reach my socks which is typically impossible, plus I was in a good mood, awake, alert, but no jitters, no anxiety, no paranoia. I was able to talk to others who didn&#39;t know I had smoked and they didn&#39;t notice anything other than I was more cheerful and seemed to move with less jerking. \u000a\u000aI am still going to try other strains - I need something for midnight cramps and there are so many strains geared toward MS who knows what I&#39;ll find but for now I&#39;m pleased I found something that works for me... \u000a\u000aSo that&#39;s my opinion on ACDC. For me its good to ease pain, loosen up the muscles, and enjoy a gentle buzz that is there but leaves me able to function normally while nicely alert.

VStrain Data: THCa 0.65, total .57, THC 0.00, and CBD 13.11. (Full review down below.)\u000a\u000aTaste: I get an earthy and woody taste, as expected. It leaves something to be desired. 2/5\u000a\u000aSmell: Perhaps I am too harsh on earthy and woody attributes but this is not a strain you can enjoy the scent of. 2/5\u000a\u000aHigh: It &#39;kicked&#39; in relatively quickly but does pack a bang. It is a decent strain to attend lectures at but wears off quite quickly; relatively speaking. 3/5\u000a\u000aSide effects: I do not feel paranoid or anxious on this strain, nor do I feel like I get dry mouth too bad. I have noticed I am not as talkative after smoking this strain. 3/5\u000a\u000aFINAL: 2.5/5, but rounded to 3 for this system.

VI seen a video recently of someone&#39;s mother very advanced with Alzheimer&#39;s. Couldn&#39;t speak at all.\u000aSeemingly had no idea even what was happening she was that advanced. They show this lady after taking CBD for one week. There was a noticeable mobility increase and speaking a lot incoherently. \u000aThen they show her after 4 weeks of treatment and she&#39;s got full coherent speech in sentences. \u000aNo joke!! Thee most awesome advancement I&#39;ve seen in a dementia sufferer. My father passed on as a result of Alzheimer&#39;s at 57, first signs at 48. \u000aNeedless to say I&#39;m scared to death to contract that disease. Through my research, it looks like ACDC might just be one of the best medicinal CBD out there. I should mention that they did not disclose what CBD they were using on Mum, but I figure ACDC is the ticket. \u000aCan anyone please help me to find ACDC seeds. \u000aEven one or two females would be fine and more appreciated than you&#39;d ever realize. I have numerous family members who also need this ACDC CBD oil. Helpppp \u000aWhite light and blessings to you

VACDC has been a lifesaver. I have been suffering from severe anxiety, panic attacks and PTSD after a very traumatic life event about a year ago. I\u2019ve tried prescription medication and nothing helps as much as ACDC does. It\u2019s the only thing that helps me feel happy and normal. I know I can count on it if I feel a panic attack coming on. I am not the same person I used to be since the trauma, but ACDC really helps me move about my life with confidence that I have something that will actually help me cope. I appreciate this strain and it\u2019s medicinal properties.

So I&#39;ll repost and update after the results are in.\u000a\u000aI use a bit of a high THC strain with ACDC.

I wish I could have found her sooner! I didn&#39;t smoke for about a year and a half due to 50% of the time I would get pnoid! Heart would start racing, I could feel the fucker beating in my ear! Thump thump thump fucking thump! It was just crazy! But I wanted and needed to get smoking again. So once I was approved I went right for this strain! I got to tell you it&#39;s amazing! I didn&#39;t feel pnoid! I did feel the thc but it wasn&#39;t over overwhelming! And when I thought I was going to get pnoid it just went away! But the body feel was nice! I was alert, energetic and just over all happy! The high was definitely different but enjoyable! I love it I think I&#39;m gonna be ok in life! Lol!

VYou know I almost gave up on this strain until I changed things up decided to try it again and smoke this over vape. I usually roll joints with this and it does a decent job. I tried vaporizing it on 420 d took 3 nice big long draws and I didn\u2019t get high but I did feel medicated I could function things very very clear I could think freely I wasn\u2019t worried about what\u2019s going on around me I was very happy. I could feel the effects but it worked magic. My only negative about this strain well 2 is it\u2019s so expensive and I go through so much of it. Wish I could find it on the street I would go through 4 ounces easily in a month. I had no pain what so ever. I have learned that this and other cbd strains out there you just need a much higher dose. I\u2019ll smoke a nice king size joint and feel pretty good make it 2 and I\u2019m there where I need to be. Only get about an hour of relief before slowly wearing off but If you smoke enough of it you\u2019ll love it. The last biggest complaint I have is I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just the strain or the dispensary maybe not properly curing and drying it. They sell out so fast there\u2019s a list of 700 people waiting to get it so they never sell to public, and maybe they just rush it, but when I\u2019m grinding it destroys my grinder. I use it in my sharpstone maybe it\u2019s the grinder but the buds stick to everything and it has no crystals. Just feels very moist and squishy to the touch and doesn\u2019t want to grind nicely.

VHigh CBD, low THC does NOT mean you are not high. With AC/DC, I feel good, even keeled, and happy. I don&#39;t feel &quot;stoned,&quot; and I&#39;m perfectly capable of functioning (doing hair for work AND typing this review!). \u000a\u000aI picked this up for the pain relief qualities. My lower back was really hurting (sacroiliac joint, to be exact), so I took a couple hits before my morning shower. The pain has lessened significantly, though I am still aware of it. Probably a good strain for folks who need to function AND feel good.

VFlavor is earthy, pine, citrus. Very smooth on the throat. It&#39;s my first time using a high CBD strain,  for anxiety. I didn&#39;t feel any &#39;high&#39; at all,  but I do feel a mild body relaxation effect, and pain feels somewhat dulled. it&#39;s perfect if you want to focus on your work and still be 100% functional.  no red eyes,  no dry mouth.  At first you will find this strange,  but this has THC between 0 and 2-3%. Definitely not recommended for recreational users,  because you won&#39;t get &#39;high&#39;. This is for medication.

VI am really sensitive to THC and have been known to get panicky if I actually smoke normal recreational amounts. My use mostly takes the form of microdosing with a vape pen. A 2 second puff can get me high with some of the strains I have tried, so I take tiny puffs. However, vaping Truelieve&#39;s ACDC cartedge version of this is no problem. I tried two 2 second puff of it and it relaxed me. I got a bit of a headache (may have been due to my sinuses) and a little tired, but it wasn&#39;t terrible.  It seemed to help with my knee pain.

With a couple exceptions (that I later regretted), it has been the only strain I smoked during this time. With a very mild mental uplifting, deep relaxation of mind and body, and inducing no hunger, it has eased my detoxification to a mostly fruit diet with extensive Robert Morse N.D. herbals.

VThere is not a better strain that I have tried for relaxing or relieving stress than ACDC. If you want to have all of the medicinal effects of the medicine, and still have completely clear thoughts, ACDC will do exactly that. The only psychoactive effect that I have noticed is an elevated mood. This is also perfect after a long run or workout and want to give your muscles something to relax! If you also still love high THC strains like myself, mix ACDC with your favorite THC strain!

VFlavor is earthy, pine, citrus. Very smooth on the throat. It&#39;s my first time using a high CBD strain,  for anxiety. I didn&#39;t feel any &#39;high&#39; at all,  but I do feel a mild body relaxation effect, and pain feels somewhat dulled. it&#39;s perfect if you want to focus on your work and still be 100% functional.  no red eyes,  no dry mouth.

Bought this strain for its high CBD yet still have small amounts of THC (versus none).   60/40 SI \u000a\u000aVery sweet smelling and sweet taste with a slightly harsh pull (perhaps this is because I hit so hard being deceived by how sweet it is).\u000a\u000aNice mellow high...not as relaxed as I thought I would be (from the CBD not the THC) but will try in a few different applications.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still use it occasionally, and I find that if I smoke a small bowl of my AC/DC (my home grown has a thc/cbd ratio of 0.5/16) I get instant relief most of the time.

There\u2019s very little to non existent euphoric \u201chead high\u201d.

VI picked up an eighth from Curaleaf dispensary in NJ. This strain came in at 11.70% CBD.The flowers were light and fluffy. Had an earthy, grassy scent. I The flavor was a nice clean earthy woodsy taste.  I vaped in my Cloud Vape diamond herbal vaporizer at 365 F. The effects were felt immediately. My anxiety went from an 7-8 to a 1-2 almost instantly. This was also a good strain to use in the event you consume too much THC. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for anxiety relief or someone new to cannabis.

VHigh CBD, low THC - so not a typical high. A gentle come on of mostly cozy euphoria that feels like getting a hug from mom. Slowly works its way into your brain, making vision glowy and colorful. Head is more fuzzy than cold medicine and does, in fact, feel sufficiently stoned despite low THC. Euphoric physical relaxation is felt deep in the body. Wonderful mood elevation that\u2019s carefree, cheerful, and funny. No anxiety or instability. A perfect, safe learner strain for first-time smokers. Music sounds distinct and elevated. There\u2019s a small disconnect - like a numbness - that&#39;s soothing, but does not make it as easy to connect with music. Has a fun spaciness while still being well enough in control. Befuddles thought and makes concentrating more challenging, so not the best for work. Overall, it\u2019s so uplifting, it\u2019s impossible not to recommend.

VI tried this strain last night after work. I was hesitant to give it a go because I usually stick with what I&#39;m familiar with. It ground brilliantly and smelled amazing; rich and heady with that perfect bitter-sweet tang. I cut it 30/70 with tobacco/green and gave it a whirl. \u000a\u000aThe combined head/body high and the relaxation gave me the best sleep I&#39;ve had in weeks. I woke up feeling super refreshed and rested with very little pain in my back. For a bit of relaxation and a pain-free good nights sleep? ACDC tops it for me. \u000a\u000aThe only downside was the extreme dry mouth that I got after smoking it, but otherwise it&#39;s a solid strain that I&#39;ll be getting again.

VI have been experiencing severe depression and anxiety for months. We were going to go on a family vacation I needed something that would get rid of the anxiety, but not get me high. I&#39;m not ready to come out of the hot box to my mom yet &#128514; This strain is it. Pure medicine. Easy to relax. It&#39;s literally the reason this vacation hasn&#39;t beaten me yet, and the reason my husband is sleeping so soundly right next to me &#128525;&#128525;&#128525;\u000a\u000aYour body will get high from this, your mind will be really clear. My high lasts for a few hours. I vape this in a non-flavored oil, and the flavor of this strain is weed-y. like, you can absolutely tell it&#39;s weed, but it&#39;s not unpleasant, which is why I&#39;m only giving this strain 4/5.

VThis strain was amazing! I tend to have really bad back pain, and within five minutes after sharing a bowl with my boyfriend, it was gone; it also helped me anxiety a lot. I felt pretty energetic, but not too much so that I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. Smoking this didn&#39;t harsh out my throat, nor did it make me cough while smoking. It&#39;s also something I could definitely see being useful throughout the day, as it didn&#39;t leave my mind in the usual sativa fog.\u000aI recommend this strain for people who need help managing small amounts of anxiety (I don&#39;t believe it would work too well on anxiety/panic attacks) and body pain if you want to feel clear minded. If you are looking for the sativa body and mind high, however, I think you should look elsewhere.

VACDC is a good strain for people who don&#39;t like / can&#39;t tolerate the psychoactive effects of strains with higher THC ratios. I&#39;m vaping ACDC as i&#39;m typing this and my personal gram has a CBD to THC ratio of 25 to 1... I don&#39;t feel any high at all and it&#39;s definitely been helping my anxiety / panic disorder along with minor depression... to quantify the effects, two to three puffs cuts my anxiety in half... 5 to 6 puffs almost completely eliminates it and I definitely notice an uplift in mood. I also find myself laughing at things that I wouldn&#39;t normally find humor in. The only downside I can find is that the effects don&#39;t last all that long, for me they last anywhere from 1 to 3 hours depending on how many puffs I took. Oh and for whatever reason it also gives me a huge erection, lol so I guess that&#39;s another benefit or downside depending on how you look at it.

VI stick to my former rating of a solid 4 stars for AC/DC. Works super well for what it is for. Makes you calm and focused. But in my opinion, with AC/DC less is more. If I vape the equivalent of more than half a bowl I get kinda too relaxed and get a little tired. I notice if I smoke just a little at a time throughout the day that that works best. Oh and again, it gives a good amount of dry eyes. Give it a try though. It&#39;s great medicine.

VWorks great for alleviating muscle and nerve pain. I&#39;m using a vaporizer and each hit lasts a couple hours, tops, whereas with some higher THC strains I&#39;m feeling effects for hours on end. It made me feel a tad woozy, in a dizzy, almost-nauseated way... not my favorite way to feel, but it&#39;s more manageable than the intense pain I was experiencing before. Basically didn&#39;t make me feel high at all- just relaxed and calm. Was able to get chores done, make a few phone calls, etc. while on this.

VPersonal favorite. This stuff is super relaxing. It&#39;s almost pure CBD, so it won&#39;t make you high unless you smoke a fuckload of it, and even then, it&#39;s not the mind-altering high you&#39;d get from THC. You&#39;ll be a bit relaxed and unwilling to move too much, but you will be functional. It&#39;s very similar to a Vicodin high.\u000a\u000aThe smell and flavor are fantastic. Very herbal and woody. It&#39;s something I could fill my room with and not be ashamed of. I let it out my nose just to taste it.\u000a\u000aThe best way I can think to describe the feeling this gives you is &quot;my brain feels comfy.&quot; It feels like a huge weight is lifted off the top of your head and your brain feels cushioned. Like the feeling you get from taking your shoes off after a long day of work, except in your brain. Not much of a body relaxer, but it does help with pain and stress quite a bit.\u000a\u000aSome good stuff. Shame finding it in vape cartridges is surprisingly rare.

Zero anxiety. Zero paranoia. Nice wood-like smell, earthy taste.\u000a\u000aBecause of the lack of THC, there\u2019s very little euphoria or head high. A couple of vape sessions over an hour period was perfect. My body was numb, almost couch-locked. But I wasn\u2019t ripped like I would be from a Granddaddy Purple or Blue Dream.  \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a unique experience and one that I really enjoy. This is my nightly strain now after a stressful day at the office. Highly recommend. 5 Stars !

I was looking for a high CBD strain for pain management (I have several bulging discs in my back), but I also didn&#39;t want to be stoned while trying to get stuff done (like running errands). This flower delivered. I&#39;m nearly pain free, and I still have a clear head, so it&#39;s perfect. I feel a little bit of a body high, but that&#39;s to be expected.

So on the recommendation of the sales lady, I picked up a gram of this, and a gram of Bubblicious (reviewed later).\u000a\u000aI really want to love this...I lit up, and was welcomed by a decent little head buzz, and was really relaxed.  All was very pleasant...until it wasn&#39;t.   When the hammering headache hit, I first chalked it up to the travel.  But the second time, same thing.  It felt like someone stuck a hot poker in my head.\u000a\u000aI hate throwing good weed away, but I&#39;m not sure I want to chance the blinding headache again.

VGot this from Puffin Farm. It&#39;s about 8% CBD and 6-6.5% THC. I&#39;m very sensitive to THC and am trying it out for migraine and tension headaches. I tried Dancehall before (11% CBD and less than 1% THC) but it really didn&#39;t do much. This ACDC did make me high after vaping 3/4 of a bowl. I was sleepy and lethargic with slight confusion and memory loss before it leveled out after about an hour. Then I was still relaxed but had more energy. The comedown was the most pleasant part of it but it didn&#39;t really do much for my headache. I might have vaped more but didn&#39;t have time to lay around. Zero psychoactive effects. No paranoia - I am very prone to paranoia but this produced nothing close to it for me. Just wish it did more for pain, didn&#39;t really help my headache that is caused by pinched nerves and tight shoulders. Relaxing and spacey strain of you smoke enough of a certain phenotype I guess. Was made better with coffee.

VThis is the first time I&#39;ve tried ACDC and while it&#39;s an enjoyable strain, it falls below the mark. One of the big upsides of this strain is the smell and taste. You instantly get a blast of skunky citrus with an earthy undertone. The taste is similar, but I get sort of a spicy vibe on the exhale. \u000a\u000aOther than that, this strain is pretty average. The potency is average, and the high is not all that special. Medicinally this is a useful strain due to high CBD content, but the cerebral effects are essentially non existent. There aren&#39;t really any uplifting effects, so for depression or similar problems, look elsewhere. Recreational users? looks elsewhere.

It also left me feeling light and happy while remaining completely coherent and focused.  It\u2019s effects for me felt somewhere in between Cannatonic and Sour Tsunami , two other high CBD strains that have worked well for me as well.  I\u2019d recommend this as a good daytime pain relief option at times when staying focused and productive is a necessity.  A bonus of this strain is that it doesn\u2019t give me munchies :)

VAs a latecomer to cannabis(38), I decided ACDC should my very first strain which I chose for its low THC and high CBD content, hoping it would be beginner friendly.\u000a\u000aIt turns out, this was a great first strain for me.\u000a\u000aIt had a really clean, pine smell that somewhat reminded me of hops.\u000a\u000aThe taste was as earthy and piney as the nose indicated, and upon my first draw on my vaporizer I felt an immediate calm wash over me. I felt very relaxed and content. Other than some slight heart racing, The only noticeable effects were a sense of calm, and I began to enjoy an almost zen feeling where I wasn&#39;t hyper focused or obsessing over my problems. \u000a\u000aThe one thing that I wish I got a bit more from ACDC was more pain relief. I suffer from a lot of chronic back and joint problems, and I was really hoping this would have put more of a dent in that, but maybe if I got some that was a bit closer to a 1:1 THC/CBD ratio, it might help more in that department. \u000a\u000aRecommended as a good all rounder any time of day, but preferably before evening.

VJust tried AC/DC for the first time this morning. This one tested at .91% thc and 20.86% cbd. At first you feel nothing. But after about 20/30 min you start to realize how calm and relaxed you are. You feel calm and relaxed yet alert and slightly uplifted. I drove around today for a good hour running errands in bad weather and felt calm and comfortable. Most other times that would have given me anxiety. I also got a slight happy/euphoric feeling at times. This is going to be a very useful med for me. Especially before work when I don&#39;t want to be &quot;high. I can see this strain pairing well with a coffee in the morning. One negative thing I noticed is that it gave me really dry eyes which sucks for someone who wears contacts like I do. AC/DC is really good for what it was bred for. I give it a solid 4 stars. I will rate again in the future as I keep using AC/DC.

But the AC/DC gives you a great relaxing body high without the anxiety/rapid heart beat/shortness of breath portion of it. I could have normal conversations with people unlike the high THC weed.

VFantastic stuff. Very different. The flower I bought was not the normal super dominant CBD variety but nearly a 1:1 ratio just slightly favoring CBD (6.05%THC / 8.66%CBD), but it is the most even, and cruisy hybrid feeling ever. There is most certainly a high, but its a gentle head and body massaage combined with the relaxation of the CBD high. It&#39;s a light tickle all around - super balanced. Much more of a fan than I thought I&#39;d be. Not super long-lived... a couple hours or so. \u000aThis was bought from Herbal Nation in Bothell, WA .... and grown by Puffin Farms (a new fav grower). The terpenes are awesome and potent on these nugs. Berry, bubblegum, juicy, piney. Very pronounced and the taste is great. Great strain.

VA lot of the time common THC strains are too much for me so I decided to try CBD. First time was nice, I took 3 hits and felt a subtle uplifted / calm feeling. a little elevated but not high. Now I smoke an entire bowl of this stuff regularly (which is rare for me). One fully packed bowl of this puts me near the equivalent level of one puff of most THC-dominant strains, without the spacing out or anxious feels. I do need to mix this with an indica to fall asleep though.

Not only did it NOT easy my pain, but it gave me acute anxiety, and made me dizzy and tired which is not the effect I&#39;m looking for. This strain also made me mad hungry and I try to use strains that suppress appetite.

VLet me just begin by saying due to PTSD, I do not like being intoxicated. I have degenerative disc disease: 16 bulging discs, 11 dessicated discs, 5 torn discs leaking inflamatory protein throughout &amp; wake up with a fever daily. I am a mom of 4 and when it comes to pain limiting...&quot;if I feel like I can, I do&quot;. When I feel better I do more without thinking about it. After research I knew I needed high CBD, Maryland is limited in CBD strains available, but I hunted down prerolls &amp; vape cartridges in ACDC which helps me a good amount. I was doing a lot more...we are selling our house and a lot needs done before photographers come. I used a swiffer on my kitchen ceiling, washed the top half of a 18 foot chalkboard wall...couldn&#39;t do that before Acdc. I feelt motivated to get things done.  ACDC kills pain and gives you more range of motion. I am sad to say I did to much, I broke off a disc.  I will have to be really careful not to overdo it and injure myself.  I need to remind myself &quot;even though you are feeling less pain, you still need to take it easy because you can reinjure yourself by doing to much&quot;. \u000a\u000a\u000aSee my review on Harlequin for accute  severe nerve pain relief after I broke off the disc.  Hope this helps others.

Everything in my body relaxed; my mind was quiet but not tired or clumsy.\u000a\u000aTHC is wonderful, but don\u2019t hesitate to try out CBD. THC makes you high, CBD makes you high on life.

VIt\u2019s a miracle strain. I\u2019m not into pharmaceutical narcotics or even ibuprofen. It\u2019s not my scene. A little background information. I\u2019m an active dude. I work 45-55 hours in the kitchen, and then I\u2019m in the gym at least four days a week. This is after I blew out my left hip two years ago training for a marathon. So I give my body a pounding. I\u2019m also not one who enjoys the euphoric feeling of normal marijuana strains, so finding a non-physco active strain was important. I found AC/DC, and I\u2019m a regular user. I actually ingest through making teas, and butter. Your body fully absorbs the cbd\u2019s when your liver processes it through indigestion, and once it happens, man!!! My knees, hips, and lower back immediately improve. Like I said, it\u2019s a miracle strain!

VGives you a short head high that lasts for 2-3 minuets tops, then it&#39;s nothing but a nice body high that leaves you functional, but less stressed out. \u000aI&#39;d recommend this if you&#39;re going to school and have anxiety or have a test, it helps you relax and think. \u000aAs per usual, you can function a car while high on this, but you probably shouldn&#39;t drive while high, so don&#39;t think that just because you&#39;re functional, it&#39;s okay to drive. \u000a\u000aThis also helps with being active as well, especially if you 40/60 mix this with a high THC strain like sour diesel. It gives you this perfect medium of awake(due to the head high of SD) but calm, due to the heavy CBD. I found the mix perfect for going on a hike or being out in nature or doing sports. \u000a\u000aDoes nothing for headaches really, but does wonders for minor body aches. If you want something REALLY good for body pain, get sour tsunami. :)

VIt is interesting that you always hear that high CBD strains are not psychoactive. While they obviously dont have the same effects that a 25% thc 0%CBD strain will have there is still a very noticeable feeling. I have a vape cartridge of this at like 88% CBD and when I take a solid hit there is a very noticeable effect. It&#39;s an instant relief of anxiety and stress with a tingly warm sensation in the back and top of my head feeling. There is also a a light perceptual change in visual and audio. It&#39;s not like the full on Technicolor change from some high THC strain but it&#39;s there. This is one strain that I prefer a cartridge to flower because I use it as a way to supplement more CBD to the usual amount of CBD and THC

VI love this high CBD low THC strain!  Unlike my high THC vape cartridges which I can only take one draw or even a half draw of, I can actually vape and enjoy this strain all day long. It\u2019s potent pain-relieving and anxiolytics properties make this a true medicine for me, one without the high.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love the energy and focus and euphoric effects of Dogwalker and Pineapple Express. But for everyday medical relief that leaves me clear headed, ACDC is THE answer. \u000a\u000aMy primary reasons for getting my medical cannabis card are for anxiety and panic disorder from PTSD and for chronic pain and fatigue from fibromyalgia,\u000aosteoarthritis, and lumbar spondylosis. I was so glad to find this strain that melts away all of those symptoms without making me high. While the THC strains also treat my issues, I\u2019m not able to go around stoned all the time. CBD oils have been hit or miss for me. But vaping this CBD strain is an absolute miracle treatment for me.

VAC DC is my life saver! I mix it with other strains to temper the heavier THC in them. Sometimes I use it alone and that\u2019s great too. The pain relief of this strain is just outstanding! Plus no paranoia or anxiety which is a huge plus. I have used AC DC for migraine relief and also pain that I have in my upper body (jaw pain, neck, shoulder) and joint and muscle pains that are part of Post Lyme Syndrome. It helps so much.

However I&#39;ve seen reviews saying this strain can actually cause headaches?

VReally nice strain known for its CBD content. I vaped a lot of this and managed to also get high. Unlike getting a bucket dropped on your head (potent Thc strains), this crept up on me like a ninja. I was sitting,  relaxing,  then I started having thoughts about a sardine can shaped bed and other weird stuff like that.  Think about it,  you could put a pull tab on the duvet and everything. Super chill silly high and the CBD helped with aches and pains. Straight up tastes like weed,  nothing special,  good or bad, in that se sense.Try this out,  it&#39;s a fun one.

VThis strain has approximately a 1:20 THC:CBD ratio, meaning that it&#39;s psychoactive effects are essentially null. CBD works well as an anti-anxiety, anti-nausea remedy (There are other uses as well, I think for epilepsy).\u000a\u000aNevertheless, the fact that AC/DC was marked as a Sativa in the dispensary was a bit random, but I&#39;m sure that if the CBD were lower, there would be more heady effects.\u000a\u000aWith this strain, I was very clear headed, but do feel warm in my face and in general, a calmness comes over very gently. \u000a\u000aThe nugs themselves are like little popcorn kernels, they&#39;re very small and dense. The taste isn&#39;t necessarily the best, but I would recommend this one more for medicinal use than anything else.

VDon&#39;t pass up this awesome strain up because of the low THC level. The calming, relaxing effects of this strain are killer and if you want more THC effects, you can do what I do and mix this bud with a higher THC strain. I have had some amazing entourage effects from this high CBD strain combined with a high THC flower, or you can always just sprinkle a little kief on it and you are good to go. As a stand alone strain, AC/DC can hold it&#39;s own for a mellow and relaxing effect. I love to smoke this bud when I begin to feel anxiety. It is like a Xanax withour the emotional numbing effects of a benzo.

Again if you&#39;ve read any of my previous reviews you understand that I am a medical marijuana patient in the legal state of Oregon using medical marijuana to treat my PTSD. My reviews are a guild line for other PTSD patients enrolled in a legal medical marijuana program. \u000a\u000aSo, much like Charlotte&#39;s Web ACDC will smooth you out one or two sessions with this strain you will feel a since of ease with a mild jolt of energy. \u000a\u000aWhich is perfect if your PTSD symptoms are throwing you into a depression. This strain can be consumed as a stand alone strain in your medical marijuana rotation strains. I do recommend this highly for you ptsd patients.

VI took this in a topical form from cannasilk and helped kick some of my lower back pain (lower back surgery) right in the ass. I didn&#39;t feel sluggish or bogged down, really just didn&#39;t hurt nearly as much anymore. I plan on playing around with it more to see if it can hang with my day to day pain.

VI know alot of people knock the cbd strains because they are less psychoactive and they dont have the traditional high, that said i really enjoy the different though equally pleasant buzz and alleviation of symptoms.  High Thc highs are slopier to me.  High cbd gives a very clean content, ache alleviating focused effect i really like for doing research and work.

(Which I&#39;m constantly in) I was intrigued w the low thc content in the first place and the fact that I&#39;m not going to be looking at a bleeding ulcer from all the ibuprofen I&#39;ve been taking:(  I wouldn&#39;t say there isn&#39;t an actual high but a more mellowing contemplative state of mind... And you can focus... I&#39;m curious to try it out during day activities. \u000aHas that throat hit to it. All and all I&#39;d say  id smoke this regularly for my pain.

VI reviewed ACDC last year and at the time, I was brand new to cannabis after decades of not consuming it, so I gave it s high rating. I have to say, after trying some other bomb strains, ACDC is not for me. It gave me a headache, made my neck hurt (one of the reasons I use cannabis) and just makes me feel out of it. I know a lot of people swear by ACDC, however, try Harlequin and Harle Tsu. I love both these strains!

VThis strain is TRASH. I smoked a joint that had too much kief in it which gave me a headache so I smoked some of this &quot;medicine weed&quot; acdc and it made my headache even worse in fact I think it upgraded my normal headache into a severe migraine. I was really pissed, will never buy again. #TRASH\u000a
