VQuick hitting hybrid that provides nice all around relaxation.  The indica creeps up on you though too many hits will put you to sleep.  Knocking 1 star off the rating because the dry mouth from this flower was very intense.

VGrade- B+\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a nice effect, but after a brief period of energy and creativity, it quickly became a hazy couch lock. \u000a

VPungent, dense little popcorn nugs that&#39;ll kick your ass. Strong sativa hybrid, mine was 70/30 I think. Heavy head high, but you can feel a surprising amount of indica -- good for pain and relaxation while you work. I&#39;m impressed with this strain, you can really feel the Trainwreck in it.
