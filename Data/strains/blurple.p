VInitially it smells like a pack of little bites blueberry muffins. There a small specks of purple on this bud covered like a chocolate chip cookie. It has a flowery berry taste that is smooth with a slight sting, not a real heavy smoke. was rated at 12.6% thc 50/50 hybrid. Coming off of durban poison, a sativa with 25% thc I was having my doubts to whether or not Blurple would be a good smoke. Overall it is a nice looking bud , smells fresh and smokes fresh berries. While I was having my doubts , the blurple slowly took over and gave a relaxing body high and a mild cerebral high that was good enough to not be paranoid.\u000a

VI&#39;m not a super huge fan of this strain. My local dispensary was out of blue dream so they recommended this. It wasn&#39;t that far off but I probably won&#39;t smoke this on purpose again. The high made me feel not very great and I ended up wanting to go to sleep because of a headache.

VI think the strain overall is pretty good. The buds smelt like purple Kool-Aid or a grape flavored drink. The high was also pretty awesome. My body felt good and relaxed while my head was all tingly. &#128077;&#127996; However, not the best to smoke before bed.I felt wide awake.

VI love this stuff.  Looks, smells, tastes exactly as its name implies. Gorgeous colors in the flowers, grape underscore, best high. I recommend it.
