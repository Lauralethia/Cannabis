VBy far one of the best sativa dominant hybrids out there. Smokes sweet with hints of strawberry and gum on the front end and a almost sweet pine on the exhale. Effects are strong but can still focus and get some things done. Also great in vape cartridges and edibles. Highly recommended

VYou get that \u201chazy\u201d cerebral high but you also get a relaxed stoned body It&#39;s amazing tasting but that harsh cough lung expansion kind of sucks was unexpected. The coughing fit did make me feel like I was gonna cough up phlegm. Uncomfortable for a little bit. I wouldn&#39;t classify it as a Paranoia type high on the onset. But more of a slight \u201con edge\u201d. Not racy. The cerebral effects were awesome as the harshness escaped. You can tell it has a strong indica influence but without the \u201cKNOCK OUT punch\u201d. Meaning it&#39;s not gonna make you pass out to sleep. But I can see if you dose enough it might put you to sleep easily. So what I am saying is it&#39;s not an OG Kush. But it is some potent medicine. I can see this helping people with Depression, Anxiety (despite the feeling of being on edge for a tiny bit and no it&#39;s not racy or paranoia feeling). Cerebral effects feels like an Uplift but with a stoney/heavyweight to it think of it as being an Astronaut basically it feels like you got a helmet on you but you don&#39;t. However, wearing a knit cap on may feel good on this strain. The body effects are mainly in the upper to semi lower region of the back. Shoulders feel relaxed. Head feels somewhat heavy after peak over time.

VIf you like something that helps with your sleep or just soreness from a day at the gym, this is the one for you. However, this was not smoked as a bud, but purchased as an applicator for vaping. Much more potent in an extract form and no strong smell lingering around the house.....or job. I was not quite sure if I would like the vaping, but it&#39;s great for those moments you can&#39;t just break out the bong and go to town. The effects last a lot longer than just puffing on a j or bong and it will make you want to take a nap. I still enjoy the smell of a good bud and will never switch to just vaping, but this is one applicator I do carry for those unseen emergencies. This will definitely knock your dick in the dirt!!!!!

VFound an oz in Boulder grown by Locol Love. One of my top 5 all-time for the following reasons.\u000aAesthetics. Bud structure was insanely dense and trimmers removed 100% of the non-desirable leaves, with only potent StrawberryxDream to consume.\u000aSmell. The strawberry scent escapes the jar first, teasing you with a soft but present aroma. The dream packs a punch, right behind it and sticks around, lingering to remind you of its Blue Dream genetics.\u000aPotency. Tested at 25-31%, I found this to be a great value (albeit expensive) as a bowl was plenty good for me.\u000aTaste. Pleasant, certainly Dream-dominant from this grow.\u000a\u000aIn all, this high quality strain will go down in my book as a premo strain and one to look for. mad love to the growers.\u000a

VThis strain is so awesome it actually made me write a review on Leafly. I smoke mostly for a mood boost and motivation and this checks all my boxes . It&#39;s almost underwhelming in a sense... you think with all these reviews  you would be stoned but I feel wonderfully content right now. Absolutely no anxiety or paranoia. Super chill, happy, not couch locked. In fact it prompted a happy cleaning binge for me. Easily a favorite.

VStrawberry Dream is an excellent strain for depression. Buds are dense and frosty with trichomes. Smells sweet with hint of fruit and citrus. Smoke is smooth and slight sweet aftertaste. Clear headed stone, Very energetic. Great medicating strain for depression and daytime use.

VNice, mellow; my girlfriend said she felt \u201cGiggly\u201d, then she went into a forward fold as I sat beside her chilling for well over five minuets until she finally came up and said \u201cWow, I really like this Herb.\u201d Keep in mind, she normally smokes CBD, only took one hit (lil baby bong rip), and now she\u2019s completely passed out. Night Night :)\u000aMeanwhile, I\u2019m fond of indica, but, because I really enjoy the Smell, Taste, and mellow buzz that this Herb gives, (also, my girl is Super sensitive to thc, like Not in a good way, &amp; she loved it, although she is definitely still passed out at 10:20pm;) still, I\u2019d Highly recommend this as a Daytime strain for most anyone... \u000aStart Slow. Less is More. \u000aShe just woke up from her beauty nap. \u000a*Definitely one of my Favorite Sativa based Hybrids  ~ Time to load up some GDP &amp; Chill...\u000aOne Love. \u000a\u2764\ufe0f&#128155;&#128154;

VThis strain was good my only complaint was that it is kinda harsh especially if its on the dryer side.  Given the fact that it is not very pungent you would expect it to not taste that great but it is kinda earthy with a little citrus not much.  It does however knock u out if your already tired so its good for people taking it easy that need rest.
