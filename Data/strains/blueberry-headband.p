VA lot of really top notch genetics went into making this strain and you can definitely feel every one ! This weed is very loud when ground. It smells like blueberries and gasoline. The high is very immediate. I suffer from terrible allergies and this immediately dried up my nose and stopped my sneezing. It made my eyes and mouth a little too dry though. Make sure to stay hydrated with this strain. Blueberry Headband eases emotional distress with a calm but uplifted serenity. This is one of those buds that make you genuinely happy to be alive. Amazing for depression. Wonderful strain to practice yoga with (yin and yoga nidra especially); you can feel this flower open up your chest, throat and sacral areas. Great for cramps. Noticeable buzz in the middle of forehead, bridge of nose and temples. The indica effect from the &#39;76 Blueberry and Pre 98 Bubba Kush are definitely felt and inexperienced users might have a hard time staying awake.  I give this 4/5 stars only because the dry eyes and mouth can be intense and the high is relatively short.\u000aFollow me on insta @weedtalkmtl and @potprincess2000 for more cannabis content and reviews.

VFirst thing I noticed was the taste.  It was some of the best tasting pot I have had. Very sweet Berry. Seemed sweeter than the straight Blueberry I have. A hint of pepper. To be honest, its hard to judge the high when you smoke several strains all day. Which I do. It seems to be good and relaxing for my anxiety. Also nice body /muscle relaxation.  Some pain relief too. I must get this again on my next visit. Could be my new favorite strain. I don&#39;t say that lightly. I try new strains every couple days. This stands out.

VVery Dank, Sticky on my fingers and incredibly fluffy with white calyxes. Deep purple on the very inside of these wonderful buds. CBG is released when breaking apart these dense nuggets. This Blueberry 76 is deep with smell of eucalyptus. Bud Structure: Looks like a bunch of smaller grapes in the form of Apollo 11. Darker looking green leafs the kind of green you&#39;d see in the fall around redwood forests on moss. Absolutely stunning each part looks like its been lightly dusted with nice Orange Pistols. It&#39;s so fresh it&#39;s clogging up my American Grinder. Testing: The THC level for this guy tested at Steephilllabs at 19% and 0.50% of CBD which is killer for those looking to be evened out towards the end.\u000aThe Taste: Musky, Very Woody, and Pungent herbal taste, has that Chemical Taste mixed in still not skunky doesn&#39;t taste skunk like more diesel/petrol than skunk. \u000aThe Vape: Incredibly thick while keeping an array of swirling CO2 casper fog towards the top like a liquid breakdance move while exhaling. All I can see is blue through the bag as it blows up I can see the numbers on the screen of the LCD just blue lol.\u000aSmell:Eucalyptus, Fresh Rain/Cut grass, lemon and much of pine. It reminds me of visiting a very rainy open ended forest for just the hint of mint on the end. \u000aMedical Usages: I use this to calm down after a stressful day at work, helps out my feet from being not numb and not so light that I can still feel the pain. It allows to me to bring bliss into a situation that was causing more frustration. That I was having with my ADHD and Mood Swings; allowing me to stay attentive with focusing thats not in an alarming way. Let that vape in sit with it and meditate, like MGK said &quot;Think about better days no more late night belly ache&#39;s, let that smoke in and meditate and just chill&quot;. Allowing me to focus on what I need to get done next, in a stony way that doesn&#39;t detract or distract the focusing concepts. It&#39;s great for cutting back and not letting every little thing bug you even if it is hurtful, this will allow you to cope with how you feel rather than trying to fit your self into a mold that doesn&#39;t work for you today. That inner guru that true self that guides you. Blueberry Headband Allows me to get things done with a blissful naturalist holy type view that says. &quot;Yea bro you got this just keep grinding and in no time you&#39;ll have that motive to take on higher and harder challenges that once seemed impossible&quot;. Beams of light effect the lights I have around me, I can see a more richer deeper saturated color depth on the keyboard for each letter thats beveled in. Shiny objects and general objects reflect more. This a must if you are looking to totally reset and keep a good mood during a bad day.

VGot a quarter of some baby buds for an eight hour road trip andthe strain is great! When I first opened the bag, the sweet smell of blueberries wafted into my nostrils and my mouth watered in anticipation. When I broke apart the buds, sweetness overtook the room. It smelled as if I were standing in a blueberry field. The taste was sweet and lightly floral, with subtle berry notes in the aftertaste. The high took a bit to kick in, but once it started it went full force. It started behind the eyes, much like hash but much more energetic. It could be described as  buzzy and heady. I&#39;d recommend it to anyone with a tedious or boring task ahead, or if you just want a shot of energy with a great taste.

No  OG Kush, Cali Sour D, and Pre-98 Bubba Kush in the genetics.  \u000a\u000aShould of just said, It&#39;s okay if you like headband.  Not my cup of tea.

VWhen I pop the top off of this green lid I can smell eucalyptus and Sage. These buds are giant Boulders and when I say ginormous I mean bigger than a half dollar these things pack a punch in a compact very dank nuggets. It smells of Pine and the taste of skunk pungent and lemon wood.  The blueberry hits my body first and then comes on the headband with kind of a halo effect hovering above your head I don&#39;t know how else to describe it other than that.  This combination is very mellow and really treats stress and anxiety to the max. I would recommend this for those who have a hard time in social situations and for mood disorders if you&#39;re looking for something to chill you out blueberry headband is the strain for you.

VMy strain of choice. I will drive pretty far to get this. I have a lot of joint, back pain and as soon as I smoke this, it is gone and I like to stretch. It allows me to move through what would normally be tight or a little painful. This strain allows you to function well but really relaxes everything. Once I start smoking this though, I want to smoke more and will just smoke it all night. I&#39;m only sad this isn&#39;t in concentrate yet, as I would use it all the time for anxiety, and pain. Great when you&#39;re sad...I could go on and on. It makes me a little chatty, super analytical... but sometimes snarky.

VI don&#39;t know about talkative but I think this is more indica because when I smoked it with music playing it made me want to just sit down and listen to music. (Im when when these things happen so yeah) but it was a great head high and made time go by so slowly but you felt like it&#39;s been forever, in a good way!!!!! And the taste was just great lover it. But again most of my high with this was listening to music, but that&#39;s me.

Vvery stringy flowers, but the the effects are outstanding with blueberry headband. the blueberry smell and taste is beautiful, and the effects of the headband strain make the high wonderful.\u000ausing scissors would be the best for breking up these flowers, and this flower goes great in rolling papers.

This strain makes me bubbly and social that&#39;s why it&#39;s one of my favorites and I can choose to smoke a lot like I said to get hella lit or just a little to be uplifted and focused.

VAll time favorite strain. This is the only bud that gives me a really practical euphoria (read: not laughing out loud in public for no reason but giggling a healthy amount) I feel uplifted, inspired, and like I love everything around me. Body aches disappear, I am weightless, and ready for anything.\u000aI suffer from clinical depression - one way to fight it is with a couch lock indica that puts me to sleep right away. The better way is with Blueberry Headband - which removes the darkness in my head and replaces it with absolute dreamy wonderfulness. Forever my #1

VWhen I pop the top off of this green lid I can smell eucalyptus and Sage. These buds are giant Boulders and when I say ginormous I mean bigger than a half dollar these things pack a punch in a compact very dank nuggets. It smells of Pine and the taste of skunk pungent and lemon wood.  The blueberry hits my body first and then comes on the headband with kind of a halo effect hovering above your head I don&#39;t know how else to describe it other than that.  This combination is very mellow and really treats stress and anxiety to the max. I would recommend this for those who have a hard time in social situations and for mood disorders if you&#39;re looking for something to chill you out blueberry headband is the strain for you.

VMust admit going into the &quot;Blueberry Headband&quot; experience there was very high expectations just for the badass name alone.  Some strains come with a predetermined veneration due to the fame of pedigree.  Both Blueberry and Headband strains have made such big names for themselves that such reputation is carried onto their offspring. \u000a\u000aThis flower can relate to Paris Hilton in that regard, but unlike her does not depend on birthright alone.  A super tasty &amp; tranquil buzz that holds its own against its predecessors and contemporaries (Cheesy Headband &amp; Blue Wreck for example).  Did not see the actual buds before being broken up into a preroll so cannot note that.  The taste being sweet &amp; tranquil on inhale with the same notes on breathing out just with an added diesel punch.\u000a\u000aNot a high energy buzz yet did not shut me down at all considering the 2 mile hike up the side of a mountain that was enhanced.  The miraculous part was that the whole event was almost canceled due to a migraine forming behind my left eye.  The pressure was really bad &amp; nausea had set in with the sunlight causing a uncomfortable blood pounding feeling.  A little puff-puff of this medicine every few minutes took complete care of that all the way to the top of the Butte.  \u000a\u000aThe view was phenomenal with the cannabis giving me the ability to push through.  With focus on drinking water &amp; breathing in the fresh air the almost impossible feat of  avoiding a debilitating migraine was accomplished.  Honestly did not vote 5 stars because unlike other Headband strains I&#39;ve tried there was not that cool sensation around my head.  A classic nonetheless even without a catchphrase like &quot;That&#39;s hot&quot;, maybe instead &quot;BADASS POT!!&quot;\u000a\u000aAnd for the record I&#39;d totally party with Paris.  Get a hold of me girl, we can work on that legacy, and making some dank strains of our own =)  On that note this is some great lovemaking weed &amp; may it be suggested a panoramic view at high altitudes will enhance this effect.  And heal migraines.  But I&#39;m not doctor so just saying.

VVery sedating. Lots of dry mouth. Pretty minimal paranoia. Behaves much more like an indica than I would have expected so save this for night. Not too social of a strain but good for spasticity/pain.  Aroma is skunky with some pine, not as fruity as you would think. I am kind of reminded of the feel or Master Kush if not the look or smell.

This strain is felt in the front and back of the head very strongly (hints the name &quot;headband&quot;) and smells like a nice blueberry bush!!! Could be used for a night time medication also.

VI have been looking forward to trying this strain for a long time. It is very good and deserves a 5 Star rating. The smells of this strain have the sweetness of Blueberry with a flower aroma to accompany it. The taste of this strain is very pleasant sweet Blueberry taste with a slightly spicy/herbal after taste. \u000a      The feelings it gives you are a relaxed focus and a nice tingling body high. The Blueberry in this strain is prevalent and the body high shows this, because I feel like the Spy Who Came In From The Cold to stand next to a fire to warm up. It is like being bathed in firelight after a cold day outside. The head high is also great, and not to overwhelming perfect for getting rid of headaches and feels like a halo on your head.\u000a     This strain is a perfect all day strain, keeping you leveled headed all day. I would use this strain to prepare and wind down from hard work out or day. It is also amazing to vaporize on the golf course.

VI use cannabis to treat anxiety and for some odd reason this strain triggered all the symptoms I generally have. It actually causes me to feel nervous, Racy, and just mentally overwhelmed. I know there were a lot at the dispensary really enjoyed the strain so it\u2019s probably just personal preference however I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anybody with a high anxiety or panic disorder...Maybe the sour diesel just really shines through but it really was a racy feeling...How do use my 1: 1CBD to THC tincture to bring the panic down . I gave it to storage just because the flavor was good and it helped a lot of others at the dispensary. Otherwise I give it zero stars

VSmells of sweetness and skunk the blue berry is strong in this. Fat silverback gorilla finger nugs. Dank from head to toe and all covered in saturated red hairs all over. the vape is very thick with lush exhale very fluffy and light. I noticed I feel  little stoner head; spacey talkative and like it says euphoric head pressure a little but its great for a night time strain it&#39;s calming me down which is great for my depression and ADHD, My anorexia is being helped with this strain too beware lazy dry eyes and dry mouth you can get off track too, its a creeper I would suggest this for medium tokers.\u000aFloral tastes too, nugs as tall as 3&quot; and deep nug to stem ratio.

VThis strain has a lovely, fruity aroma, and a good high to an extent. It puts you in a dreamy mood, but has a very &quot;hard&quot; type of high for me. After a small amount, you feel good- a sativa head rush. and an indica melting type of feelings. I&#39;m a pretty big fan, but in my experience, it&#39;s easy to get to an uneasy level of high, where you have to put energy into keeping yourself calm, and telling yourself you&#39;re relaxed.IT&#39;s got an uplifting high for the most part, but can also make you feel a bit heavy and twitchy for those who may frequently experience anxiety with certain strains. Not the best hybrid for being productive or relaxing in my opinion, but definitely one of the best for that overall &quot;stoned&quot; feeling

It literally does make you feel like you have a band around your head, lived up to its name. Such a sweet aroma, smooth taste and milky pulls. Definitely one of the more deceptively stronger strains I&#39;ve tried. I wouldn&#39;t pass this up if I get the chance again. You won&#39;t regret it!

VI usually smoke FlavRX Vape Pens due to the odor, and my mom stays at the house. I had a night to blaze freely, so I had a Pre-rolled joint from Vendor &quot;Sierra Gold&quot;. Started off with big puff inhales, not holding but for a second or two before exhaling. Put the the joint out... Works quick, awake, not hungry, laughs are easy to come by, head feels floaty a good float, a bit thirsty but not cotton mouth. I always try to not smoke a bunch at once, but instead too buzz high it. I&#39;m easily paranoid, but not off of this at ALL. Didn&#39;t give it a 5 due too taste.

VThis strain packs a great punch!  The &quot;headband&quot; feeling is real, probably one of the better head highs I&#39;ve found so far.  The regular Headband gave me a bit of paranoia but BH did not.  The body high is just enough to place you in a couch-lock state, which is good or not good depending on what you have going on.  I used the Mighty to vape this but I&#39;m very curious to try out a gnarly bong hit, or two, or three....!

VThis has been my favorite strain to date. Starting from opening the container your nose gets smacked with an amazing blend of citrus, fruity, menthol smells. Pulling it out of the container you find what looks like a tiny snow covered Christmas tree with orange accents. Upon smoking it you taste all of the great scents you smelt while packing it. The high is extremely clear and euphoric. It really allowed me to put my worries aside and have a good time. This has been a stand out for me. I strongly recommend it.

V::Single Tear rolls down my cheek. Like Denzel in Glory::\u000a\u000aFirst time trying this strain......but it surely won&#39;t be my last. Easily in my Top 5 strains of all time now. Easssssily!!!!\u000aThe smell is just amazing. In all a actuality, amazing does it no justice. If you&#39;re a medicator who is big on smells. You have hit the jackpot with this one. It has a smell which I can only describe as. A batch of Blueberry pancakes topped with sweet lemon Diesel syrup. No exaggeration.\u000aThe look is beautiful. Nice medium to dark green leaves. With dark orange almost red pistils. And just covered in trichomes. Easily some of the stickiest bud I have ever come across.\u000aThe high I can only explain as a heady relaxed high. A sensation of have a pretty woman massaging your temples while you&#39;re in a warm robe and slippers. This could be a day or evening strain. Depending on your tolerance. You could definitely get stuff done while on this. But as well as just sit back and catch up on your favorite movies &amp; show.

VTo start with, this is one of the best tasting cannabis I\u2019ve every had. It\u2019s so sweet and berryie. This almost has two different highs. You smoke a big roll with a friend or sibling and shortly after you feel the indica in this come out very strong. Huge body stone and a amazing sense of hunger. Where as you smoke a hitter or two and you get crazy head high that almost makes it feel like you are using the zombies blood pick up in Black ops 3 zombies.  Great motivater, clean smoke, excellent for pain in high quantities, keeps you level headed and makes you giggle. Definitely will be getting this again!

VI use cannabis to treat anxiety and for some odd reason this strain triggered all the symptoms I generally have. It actually causes me to feel nervous, Racy, and just mentally overwhelmed. I know there were a lot at the dispensary really enjoyed the strain so it\u2019s probably just personal preference however I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anybody with a high anxiety or panic disorder...Maybe the sour diesel just really shines through but it really was a racy feeling...How do use my 1: 1CBD to THC tincture to bring the panic down . I gave it to storage just because the flavor was good and it helped a lot of others at the dispensary. Otherwise I give it zero stars

VI bought a preroll of this so cannot adequately comment on its appearance. The smell is light menthol and orange peel, very lovely smell. The taste is earthy and hashy with a sweet berry undertone.\u000aThe high is quick, within a minute and the first thing I notice is how calm I am. There is very litttle head-high, just the lightest possible buzz with giddy euphoria. The body starts calm and the relaxation builds as pain relief sets in. This is functional weed, your mind will stay clear and sharp so I can recommend it for anytime use. The light, euphoric and relaxing body high lends itself to nighttime use. This bud would also be great for getting \u201cin the mood.\u201d\u000aFinally, this is a perfect strain for beginners or those who don\u2019t want to get \u201ctoo high.\u201d

VThis strain has a lovely, fruity aroma, and a good high to an extent. It puts you in a dreamy mood, but has a very &quot;hard&quot; type of high for me. After a small amount, you feel good- a sativa head rush. and an indica melting type of feelings. I&#39;m a pretty big fan, but in my experience, it&#39;s easy to get to an uneasy level of high, where you have to put energy into keeping yourself calm, and telling yourself you&#39;re relaxed.IT&#39;s got an uplifting high for the most part, but can also make you feel a bit heavy and twitchy for those who may frequently experience anxiety with certain strains. Not the best hybrid for being productive or relaxing in my opinion, but definitely one of the best for that overall &quot;stoned&quot; feeling

VI have been looking forward to trying this strain for a long time. It is very good and deserves a 5 Star rating. The smells of this strain have the sweetness of Blueberry with a flower aroma to accompany it. The taste of this strain is very pleasant sweet Blueberry taste with a slightly spicy/herbal after taste. \u000a      The feelings it gives you are a relaxed focus and a nice tingling body high. The Blueberry in this strain is prevalent and the body high shows this, because I feel like the Spy Who Came In From The Cold to stand next to a fire to warm up. It is like being bathed in firelight after a cold day outside. The head high is also great, and not to overwhelming perfect for getting rid of headaches and feels like a halo on your head.\u000a     This strain is a perfect all day strain, keeping you leveled headed all day. I would use this strain to prepare and wind down from hard work out or day. It is also amazing to vaporize on the golf course.

VI baked some Blueberry Headband into some brownies and while I did get extremely high I had such a clear head, which at first tricked me into thinking I wasn&#39;t that high. So I ate some more and discovered that I WAS THAT high. Great strain if you want to be relaxed but also want a clear head.

VMust admit going into the &quot;Blueberry Headband&quot; experience there was very high expectations just for the badass name alone.  Some strains come with a predetermined veneration due to the fame of pedigree.  Both Blueberry and Headband strains have made such big names for themselves that such reputation is carried onto their offspring. \u000a\u000aThis flower can relate to Paris Hilton in that regard, but unlike her does not depend on birthright alone.  A super tasty &amp; tranquil buzz that holds its own against its predecessors and contemporaries (Cheesy Headband &amp; Blue Wreck for example).  Did not see the actual buds before being broken up into a preroll so cannot note that.  The taste being sweet &amp; tranquil on inhale with the same notes on breathing out just with an added diesel punch.\u000a\u000aNot a high energy buzz yet did not shut me down at all considering the 2 mile hike up the side of a mountain that was enhanced.  The miraculous part was that the whole event was almost canceled due to a migraine forming behind my left eye.  The pressure was really bad &amp; nausea had set in with the sunlight causing a uncomfortable blood pounding feeling.  A little puff-puff of this medicine every few minutes took complete care of that all the way to the top of the Butte.  \u000a\u000aThe view was phenomenal with the cannabis giving me the ability to push through.  With focus on drinking water &amp; breathing in the fresh air the almost impossible feat of  avoiding a debilitating migraine was accomplished.  Honestly did not vote 5 stars because unlike other Headband strains I&#39;ve tried there was not that cool sensation around my head.  A classic nonetheless even without a catchphrase like &quot;That&#39;s hot&quot;, maybe instead &quot;BADASS POT!!&quot;\u000a\u000aAnd for the record I&#39;d totally party with Paris.  Get a hold of me girl, we can work on that legacy, and making some dank strains of our own =)  On that note this is some great lovemaking weed &amp; may it be suggested a panoramic view at high altitudes will enhance this effect.  And heal migraines.  But I&#39;m not doctor so just saying.

VThis is what pops into my mind as the first strain I ever smoked. Within seconds after my first hit I can feel the effects coming in. A very nice head high and puts you to sleep very quickly. Not a distraction from real life as you get a nice head high while being able to fully function. I occasionally get sweet flavor while smoking but when I vape I don&#39;t taste any sweetness. My first few sessions with this bud had me spacing out as well as musical patterns and sounds looping through my head. Cheers

VIt&#39;s a nice relaxation sensation, without making me feel sleepy. Had to wrestle my mind to maintain focus, but I wouldn&#39;t classify the fluid thoughts as racing or paranoia-inducing at all. Grab a fan before you smoke - this stuff is going to stank! My biggest issues with this strain were the major red, squinty eyes and it brings on a slight headache the next day. I always have at least a mild (and sometimes pretty bad) cloudy, sluggish brain the next day.

Dank from head to toe and all covered in saturated red hairs all over. the vape is very thick with lush exhale very fluffy and light. I noticed I feel  little stoner head; spacey talkative and like it says euphoric head pressure a little but its great for a night time strain it&#39;s calming me down which is great for my depression and ADHD, My anorexia is being helped with this strain too beware lazy dry eyes and dry mouth you can get off track too, its a creeper I would suggest this for medium tokers.\u000aFloral tastes too, nugs as tall as 3&quot; and deep nug to stem ratio.

I asked budtender what they thought, and they gave me a similar answer minus the cross breed smoking. If I had one good thing to say, is it would be great for beginners. It would be the next step up from Ativan (I take a prescription).\u000a\u000aLike all strains people are different, but, I wouldn&#39;t put this as top priorities to try.

VTried Blueberry Headband after being told that it was an indica dominant strain. I soon after realized that I was misinformed and instead of the &quot;Couch&quot; high I was waiting for I felt something quite different. Along with the sweet taste this strain gave me an exceptional head high with much paranoia. My paranoia  most likely rose due to the amount I smoked. I rolled a 2 gram blunt and took that to the face. But, as I said I thought it was an indica strain to begin with so I believe I smoked way too much. Once my paranoia settled I felt euphoric and focus. A very active head high that had me energetic and hungry. A perfect strain for those looking to roll up and clean the house.

VScintillating, full-blown high with that fucking awesome Headband energy becoming a major fun component immediately. Feel like a teenage rebel who&#39;s invisible and will live forever! Lots of thrilling, youthful, wide-eyed enjoyment of life. Incredibly upbeat and genuinely happy and cheeery.\u000a\u000aAfter a bit, it transitions into a more stoney, sedated - but pleasant and smiley high. Entire body curiously feels like a stick figure; all tingly and tactile. There&#39;s a good amount of high in the face that feels thick and pillowy. Noticeably streak of empathy. Man, it feels good to feel things :)

VThe high came on almost instantaneously (within one minute of smoking) for me. Taste was good and fairly smooth. I was not expecting to get as high as I did from the two hits I took. I was hoping to get some homework and things done around the house, but quickly found myself glued to bed with my iPad to distract me from my overwhelming whirling thoughts because it was just all too much. I&#39;m not by any means saying I don&#39;t enjoy riding intense psychoactive effects sometimes (particularly in more party/play situations), but based on what I was told at the dispensary, I was hoping for something less pyschoactive just to chill out but focus on getting stuff done.\u000aSomething I especially didn&#39;t enjoy, though, was how I kept having weird gag reflex feelings, almost like contractions, sort of, but not. This happens to me with some strains sometimes. When it happens, it usually only lasts about 10-15 minutes right around when I first smoke, and then I&#39;m over it and all fine and dandy. With this strain, that feeling lasted all the way through (and then a little longer after the head high) and, despite having munchies, made it really hard to swallow without feeling nauseous..\u000aI think this is probably just exclusive to my physiology, though, because my boyfriend had no problems and actually liked it enough that he&#39;s smoked more of it since.

Vthis weed made me shit my pants literally, it had some good effects and relieved all of my pains and worries but the only downside was that it made my eyes like the fucking sahara desert and it also made me shit my pants and thats why i gave it an overall rating of a 2.
