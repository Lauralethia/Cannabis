VWorks very well for stress and anxiety. It has a relaxing/calming effect but doesn&#39;t make me too relaxed to not do anything.

VOkay yeah hit this too much in the beginning you will not get it again... but, let it mellow within you and all is ok. Use it sparingly unless you are hardcore cuz it&#39;s some good sh** but can&#39;t give it 5. Body high might mess with you combined with the mind high. If you&#39;re new to smoking, try starting with something else... Just sayin&#39;. But a good smoke and true to it&#39;s Leafly stasis... the leaf never lies.

Vbuds were small and very sticky. very pungent smell. broke up very well and &quot;fluffy&quot;. smooth to smoke and tasted quite sweet. Didn&#39;t take much for the buzz to kick in. was surprised how hard and fast the high hit. felt happy, energetic at first then felt relaxed. but not too relaxed. smoked just before a wedding where I didn&#39;t know anyone but my date, and felt super relaxed and easy going. where usually I&#39;d be nervous and uptight. definitely will use again.

VNice to see some out west weed made it to the Ann Arbor area. My delivery guy brought me a 1/8 and a few doors. Took me five days to smoke it all. Talk about bang for ya buck. First landrace strains I have smoked. I did have some Thai stick back in the day. Bad ass bud. Relaxed for sure.

VVery beautiful plant indeed, was a pleasure to grow. As well as somewhat of an honor.  Very resinous, straight fumes, pungent almost sulphuric odor with a good amount of sweetness in there. That&#39;s my take on taste. Grown in Hawaii.

VThis strain was amber and FROSTY. Had my sample in the morning and it quickly provided a euphoric head change that gradually settled into a calmer more relaxing energy with mild body relaxation. Great strain to start the day.
