VDouble Dream by Leaph, Washington State. - 28% THC\u000a\u000aI&#39;m really glad I ended up grabbing some of this.  The buds small in size are heavily trichomed and smell of a mixture of sweet citrus and blueberry.  The effects are very nicely balanced, but sativa dominant.  I blazed this after work late Sunday night and made it through West World and The Walking Dead, wide-awake enjoying every moment.  After, I was able to transition to an indica and fall asleep.  Definitely a strain you could use any time of day for a multitude of reasons.  A refreshing change from the typical Blue Dream experience.  9/10.

VA great strain if you&#39;re looking for creative and mental stimulation, the intensely sativa-based effects of Double Dream are quick to onset and provide an energizing and euphoric cerebral buzz at first, before eventually tapering off into the relaxing and soothing effects of its indica side. Great for relief from stress, anxiety, insomnia, and depression.

VDouble dream is a solid sativa hybrid strain. Smells pretty damn good. Smokes pretty good and guess what makes you feel pretty damn good! This was my third stain I&#39;ve reviewed. Very solid. I was a day dreaming fool on this double dream kush. I smoked alone and somehow I felt like I was at a party turned my music up started dancing like a fool. Got the cops called on me for noise complaint ended up in jail. Broke out tho.  Came back home and lit it up again!.... When I came down from the high, I found out I was only dreaming.....

VI&#39;m honestly not sure how I feel about this strain.  The effects were almost immediate, there was a light haze around my whole body but concentrated in the center of my head.  After about 10-15 minutes, a very clear-headed feeling hit.  I was doing computer work and this definitely helped me focus on my task. I didn&#39;t feel euphoric, happy, or even content.  I felt depressed more than anything, but I liked the focus aspect of the high so I decided to smoke another bowl.  \u000a\u000aThe second high hit a bit differently.  I felt more sedated, very heavy behind my eyes and in my head.  Then, the anxious feeling in my chest kicked in.  I was getting stuff done though, not necessarily in any organized manner, but doing it nevertheless.  I felt like a neurotic zombie, but gosh darn it, I got so much stuff done, I did not get the munchies at all, and I think it did pretty good at taking away my aches and pains.\u000a\u000aI just don&#39;t think I would do this again, the depressed feeling and anxiety just aren&#39;t worth the benefits.

VThis is my new favorite strain. I will say that if you have to much, the clear headed functionality kinda flies out the window. That being said when done to the point of buzzing, it is super relaxing yet there is no couch lock, amazing for creativity, and even made me feel a bit like working out. Funny enough, I can also have it before bed and I&#39;ll sleep very nicely and wake up refreshed! It&#39;s AWESOME. Enjoy! Just don&#39;t have too much or you could find yourself listening to trance and watching p*** for a few hours. Not a bad thing, but I needed to get some work done hahaha. Oops :-)

If I smoke this an hour or less before bedtime I have trouble falling asleep. If I have it an hour and a half or two before bedtime then I can usually get to sleep ok. My friend swears by it for his ADHD and I believe him, but since I don&#39;t have that problem it just feels more like unnecessary additional stimulation to me sometimes.\u000a\u000athis is a strain that feels different to me when I am in company (more chatty and focused) and when I am alone (more stony and cerebral).\u000a

V1. Nugs broke up well and were notably dense and sticky. 2. Smelled like classic CA high grade. &quot;Ah, I remember that smell&quot; was stuck on repeat everytime I opened this strain&#39;s jar. 3. Smoked smooth, but was a tad harsh on exhale. 4. Tasted almost like a dreamsicle.

VI&#39;m not a huge fan of sativa anything, not even hybrids... BUT, this sweet, amazing, dreamy strain is changing my mind. This was super high quality oil vaped in a wickless ceramic slim vape pen and it was absolutely amazing! It was 71%, 2 hits and I was toast for 4+ hours! It tastes sweet, and also kind of spicy, very floral, and super grape-ish as well! This would be my go to for cartridges but damn it&#39;s hard to find! Super amazing strain!

VLoved this strain. Way more Indica leaning than the Leafly description says, not daytime strain. High marks for stellar creativity and unconventional thinking. Had two pretty profound insights from this bud. I shared with others and they say, &quot;Holy shit, that&#39;s an amazing concept!&quot; If you&#39;re a creative person, this might be a good one to spark up at the end of the day and see what you discover.

VI really liked this.  Smoked some and it was very nice balance between head and body, finishing off with body and an easy come down.  and even a tad aphrod if ya catch ma drift.  Fell in love with it.  Tried vaping it, and it really lessened the effects.\u000a\u000aTried another vendor (Downtown Cannabis Company) sold in Bellevue at BelMar and it was completely different in that it was very psychedelic.  Brain candy.  Enjoyable but not sought after for me.  Left me with a slight haze hangover the next day but no crabbiness.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. DD is a sneaker, beware! I found myself back out in the garage fifteen minutes after my first smoke because not much was going on. It took a while to gain steam and momentum in my head first, and then body. The head high I think might be good for folks with PTSD who need that cloud going right behind their eyes. I felt just slightly unbalanced, but not at all head-heavy (which I usually detest). DD doesn&#39;t give you brain-scramble where the whole world is jump cutting like a bad edit of a crappy new action flick, ending with you standing in the kitchen trying to remember why you&#39;re there or why you&#39;re naked. Again. It&#39;s effect is more refined and gentle. I found myself very much present with my wife and child, not feeling self-conscious of lack of motor control or sporting a stoner perma-grin. The body high with DD is very nice, in fact if circumstances had been different Mrs. Mule and I might have chased one another around the couch a bit. And the sleep I got was top-notch, no problems getting to sleep or staying down. In fact I racked up nearly ten hours, something I don&#39;t get to do and often can&#39;t anyway, no matter how exhausted I am. I did wake up feeling a little strung out, hung over I guess. I can&#39;t tell how much of that was DD and how much of that was from sleeping so much. It&#39;s a toss-up. In conclusion, DD is a keeper and goes pretty much into the top shelf of my go-to&#39;s. Oh, and did I mention it didn&#39;t leave me with my head in the fridge? That alone is HUGE. No munchies.

VInitial high was a little bit scatter brained, but once it leveled out it was perfect for getting stuff done. Definitely a good happy pick me up. Relieved pain and stress well. Taste was similar to smell, a bit earthy with a hint of sweet. Super smooth clean hit, doesn&#39;t make you cough like some others might. \u000aBuds were nice and dense, covered in trichomes. Makes it easier to stretch how long it lasts compared to less dense buds. Definitely worth a try if you haven&#39;t yet.

If I only had to smoke 1 strain the rest of my life I would be content with this. It tastes great and smokes smooth. Buds covered in orange hairs with a dank smell. Great all day smoke with no negative come down. Might feel really heady at first.

VUsually I turn to pot for fun and escapism, but tonight, it\u2019s desperation. My period landed today, and I have severe PCOS. Periods are a nightmare of immense hemorrhaging, fun side effects like severe nausea and diarrhea and intense, tear-inducing pain. \u000a\u000aI know this is gonna be a bad one because it\u2019s barely started and I\u2019ve already begun feeling the burning and stabbing in my right side that I always get, but usually not until my cramps are at their worst. I know I\u2019m in for a bad week and all I want to do is curl up in a ball and pray for death.\u000a\u000aInstead I surfed the net for cannabis recs for cramps. Despite my rather large collection, I don\u2019t have most of the strains recommended, but I do have Double Dream, and since one of its parents is the recommended Blue Dream. Since I think this is sativa dominant, I\u2019m sprinkling some of my mom\u2019s homegrown pot on top of my full bowl. I don\u2019t know what strain Mom\u2019s pot is, but she likes indicas, and I want to be extra relaxed since bedtime isn\u2019t that far off. I\u2019ve tried Double Dream a few times before but none of my experiences were that memorable. Still, like I said, I\u2019m not looking to feel high (for once). I just want to stop hurting.\u000a\u000aAs I start, I\u2019d say my pain and nausea are at a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10. 10 is full on sobbing and throwing up, btw. It\u2019s good to be a woman, she said bitterly. \u000a\u000aAbout five minutes in, I\u2019d say my pain has dropped to maybe a six, a slight reduction but I\u2019m still pretty miserable. I\u2019ll keep updating.\u000a\u000a10 minutes in, and there\u2019s definitely been a more noticeable reduction in pain. I\u2019d saying it\u2019s hovering between a four and a five. That said, I don\u2019t want to spend the night at this pain level. I\u2019ll give it another five to ten and then I\u2019m either trying another bowl, or another strain altogether. \u000a\u000aAlright, I\u2019d say I\u2019m about 20 mins in, at least...I\u2019m starting to lose track. I\u2019ve got those cannabis goggles on with the tunnel vision. Still, my pain is significant; I\u2019d say it\u2019s even trying to creep back up a bit. Now a definite 5 to 6. My stomach is burning and upset, though my nausea has lessened somewhat. One more try with a bowl of Double Dream and a dash of mystery indica. \u000a\u000aOK, smoked that second bowl. In the two or three minutes it took me, my pain\u2019s definitely increased, as has my stomach discomfort, and I am not a happy camper. Going to report back in 10 and see if my frown is turned upside down. \u000a\u000aOK, about another 20 minutes in and I\u2019m calling this experiment a failure. My pain and stomach issues have circled back to a 7. It\u2019s really too bad because I\u2019m definitely feeling the high more than I have before and if it wasn\u2019t for the pain, I\u2019d be really happy right now. I put on some of my favorite 80\u2019s/90\u2019s sing along playlists, and if this nightmarish twist on a scarlet fever wasn\u2019t tormenting me, I\u2019d be really enjoying the nostalgia and just chilling out. I don\u2019t doubt that Double Dream would be great for less severe cramps, but for me, my search for the perfect period cure continues.

VExploring medical marijuana with a handful of new-patient coupons has been intensely pleasurable, yet my tolerance level (which used to be fairly low) is now through the roof. To make the best of this moment, I am learning the delicate art of strategic abstinence and strain-switching (not to mention dispensary-switching). After only one educational sampling adventure, I am actively seeking out Really Strong Weed. \u000a\u000aDouble Dream is strong. I smoked a smallish bowl at around 9PM on a Tuesday night and it got me STONED, despite the fact that I had smoked a couple of bowls and taken some hits off my hash pen early that day. My last hit had been about six hours prior. [Is six the magic number of hours?]\u000a\u000aAfter smoking my bowl of Double Dream, a pervasive euphoria wrapped around me like a warm cloak. I felt happy, talkative, energized, and socially confident. I got a heavy dose of the rushing sense of relief that is the reason I smoke marijuana in the first place. \u000a\u000aI estimate that my high lasted about an hour and a half, which felt longish to me. During the last half hour, I felt a bit shaky and emotional, but that might have been due to my social circumstances at that moment.\u000a\u000aDouble Dream might be a bit strong for daytime use, though I did feel energized throughout and a positive desire to &quot;sit up straight,&quot; both literally and figuratively. The potential emotional shakes could be a negative for those who suffer from extreme anxiety or PTSD. I suffer from moderate anxiety and general shitty mood disorder, and Double Dream was on the good edge of what I can enjoy. I recommend it.

VExcellent energetic social day time strain. The Blue Dream really shines and the smell is similar, but unique. Has that flowery fruit like cleaner smell in the best of ways. Took little hit out of my water pipe and felt a nice little kick of chest expansion, along with a light headedness almost immediately. Gave me a much needed boost of energy to help do a little late night cleaning around the house. It was also thought provoking which left me a little gabby. Hope to keep this around.

VExploring medical marijuana with a handful of new-patient coupons has been intensely pleasurable, yet my tolerance level (which used to be fairly low) is now through the roof. To make the best of this moment, I am learning the delicate art of strategic abstinence and strain-switching (not to mention dispensary-switching). After only one educational sampling adventure, I am actively seeking out Really Strong Weed. \u000a\u000aDouble Dream is strong. I smoked a smallish bowl at around 9PM on a Tuesday night and it got me STONED, despite the fact that I had smoked a couple of bowls and taken some hits off my hash pen early that day. My last hit had been about six hours prior. [Is six the magic number of hours?]\u000a\u000aAfter smoking my bowl of Double Dream, a pervasive euphoria wrapped around me like a warm cloak. I felt happy, talkative, energized, and socially confident. I got a heavy dose of the rushing sense of relief that is the reason I smoke marijuana in the first place. \u000a\u000aI estimate that my high lasted about an hour and a half, which felt longish to me. During the last half hour, I felt a bit shaky and emotional, but that might have been due to my social circumstances at that moment.\u000a\u000aDouble Dream might be a bit strong for daytime use, though I did feel energized throughout and a positive desire to &quot;sit up straight,&quot; both literally and figuratively. The potential emotional shakes could be a negative for those who suffer from extreme anxiety or PTSD. I suffer from moderate anxiety and general shitty mood disorder, and Double Dream was on the good edge of what I can enjoy. I recommend it.

VInitial high was a little bit scatter brained, but once it leveled out it was perfect for getting stuff done. Definitely a good happy pick me up. Relieved pain and stress well. Taste was similar to smell, a bit earthy with a hint of sweet. Super smooth clean hit, doesn&#39;t make you cough like some others might. \u000aBuds were nice and dense, covered in trichomes. Makes it easier to stretch how long it lasts compared to less dense buds. Definitely worth a try if you haven&#39;t yet.

VI tried this late last night (vape at 350F). It has a really nice scent, probably the best smelling strain I&#39;ve tried. Like a combination of berries and flowers.\u000aThe effects were definitely more sativa-like than Blue Dream (my go-to strain). This is a hybrid of hybrids of hybrids if you trace the genetics. \u000aIt gave me a light buzz that lasted for hours, didn&#39;t help with sleep at all and may have kept me up for a couple of hours. No dark-room visuals at all (colors or patterns), sense of sensual touch was enhanced, and while it didn&#39;t induce any erotic fantasies, it seemed to enhance their feeling of reality. Probably a great strain for daytime sex, but I&#39;d avoid it before bedtime.

Not a worry in the world with this beautiful hybrid. I would strongly recommend this strain to anyone who has pain, anxiety, PTSD or depression. Double Dream put me in a beautiful place and I look forward to going back one day. I wouldn&#39;t recommend before bed. Better for a daytime smoke.

VUsually I turn to pot for fun and escapism, but tonight, it\u2019s desperation. My period landed today, and I have severe PCOS. Periods are a nightmare of immense hemorrhaging, fun side effects like severe nausea and diarrhea and intense, tear-inducing pain. \u000a\u000aI know this is gonna be a bad one because it\u2019s barely started and I\u2019ve already begun feeling the burning and stabbing in my right side that I always get, but usually not until my cramps are at their worst. I know I\u2019m in for a bad week and all I want to do is curl up in a ball and pray for death.\u000a\u000aInstead I surfed the net for cannabis recs for cramps. Despite my rather large collection, I don\u2019t have most of the strains recommended, but I do have Double Dream, and since one of its parents is the recommended Blue Dream. Since I think this is sativa dominant, I\u2019m sprinkling some of my mom\u2019s homegrown pot on top of my full bowl. I don\u2019t know what strain Mom\u2019s pot is, but she likes indicas, and I want to be extra relaxed since bedtime isn\u2019t that far off. I\u2019ve tried Double Dream a few times before but none of my experiences were that memorable. Still, like I said, I\u2019m not looking to feel high (for once). I just want to stop hurting.\u000a\u000aAs I start, I\u2019d say my pain and nausea are at a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10. 10 is full on sobbing and throwing up, btw. It\u2019s good to be a woman, she said bitterly. \u000a\u000aAbout five minutes in, I\u2019d say my pain has dropped to maybe a six, a slight reduction but I\u2019m still pretty miserable. I\u2019ll keep updating.\u000a\u000a10 minutes in, and there\u2019s definitely been a more noticeable reduction in pain. I\u2019d saying it\u2019s hovering between a four and a five. That said, I don\u2019t want to spend the night at this pain level. I\u2019ll give it another five to ten and then I\u2019m either trying another bowl, or another strain altogether. \u000a\u000aAlright, I\u2019d say I\u2019m about 20 mins in, at least...I\u2019m starting to lose track. I\u2019ve got those cannabis goggles on with the tunnel vision. Still, my pain is significant; I\u2019d say it\u2019s even trying to creep back up a bit. Now a definite 5 to 6. My stomach is burning and upset, though my nausea has lessened somewhat. One more try with a bowl of Double Dream and a dash of mystery indica. \u000a\u000aOK, smoked that second bowl. In the two or three minutes it took me, my pain\u2019s definitely increased, as has my stomach discomfort, and I am not a happy camper. Going to report back in 10 and see if my frown is turned upside down. \u000a\u000aOK, about another 20 minutes in and I\u2019m calling this experiment a failure. My pain and stomach issues have circled back to a 7. It\u2019s really too bad because I\u2019m definitely feeling the high more than I have before and if it wasn\u2019t for the pain, I\u2019d be really happy right now. I put on some of my favorite 80\u2019s/90\u2019s sing along playlists, and if this nightmarish twist on a scarlet fever wasn\u2019t tormenting me, I\u2019d be really enjoying the nostalgia and just chilling out. I don\u2019t doubt that Double Dream would be great for less severe cramps, but for me, my search for the perfect period cure continues.

VA great strain for a night of entertainment. Or just fun really; its similar to a Haze strain and it packs a really great uplifted/euphoric high. Smells really great and its a nice tender bud. I highly recommend it. Breathe easy\u270c&#127996;\ufe0f

VDouble Dream is super dreamy. &#128525; I picked some up on a whim, smoked it, and was very... unprepared... for the intensity of the high. It starts as a warm high that spreads immediately to the face and head, and then there&#39;s... not a rush, but an intensely spacey, euphoric, dreamy headspace. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m prone to anxiety and I&#39;ve never, never had anxiety with Double Dream... it&#39;s just relaxing and mood uplifting enough to keep me from the bad side, but I could see how too much could induce panic or paranoia in some people. \u000a\u000aFor me, though, it&#39;s an amazing trip into grinny daydreams, followed by a less intense, giggly, relaxing high. You won&#39;t be able to go to work or drive a car, but it&#39;ll keep you up and social.

VOne of my new favorites. Within minutes your body and head start to relax. Then it turns into mostly a head high. Very concentrated, energetic, giggly. The buds are dark with deep greens but are mostly covered with orange and dark red hairs. Sweet berry, floral scent. The taste is similar to the smell, sweet and smooth. I prefer this over blue dream.

VA great name for an even greater strain. I was so high in such a clear minded way I question if I was even high. Double Dream is a great strain for medical patients. I&#39;m a patient myself (epilepsy). If you have things to do during the day or even at night and don&#39;t want that dominant head &quot;high&quot; we all love when we are going to sleep...then Double Dream is for you. If you need to be &quot;up&quot; or creative then I highly recommend this strain.

V4.5. this was awesome to wake up with. a very happy high with the added relieve dulling the pain. the flavor was similar to blue dream but that was expected with a strain of these parents.  the bud itself was lighter green and frosty, a very present sweet floral smell came rushing out. upon breaking the flower crystals shimmered in light beautifully. my only regret is that I jade to set fire to this..not really very happy I did.  that first hit was just as it smelled floral with a sweet Berry finish. this is in serious thought of betting pushed into my top 10.

VThis for me was the first strain that does everything for me. At least for a day time strain. It was very helpful in stress, anxiety, pain, creativeness, and over all brought me great focus. This is a very uplifting strain for me.\u000a\u000a It has a nice spicyness, I assume comes from the Haze side of the Blueberry indica x Haze to make the Blue Dream. Blue Dream is very dominant for me in the flavors.

Nice sweet fruity citrus taste with hashy notes, hits immediately with an invigorating head rush and euphoria, and with a few puffs settles into a great body buzz too.   A little may makes for a social buzz, a bunch for a night of tunes, snacks and chilling on the couch!
