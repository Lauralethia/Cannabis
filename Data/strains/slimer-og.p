VWe are a fan of this strain. One of the Flintstoners, a frequent user, was incredibly baked after consuming only one bowl of this strain. The effect was fairly goofy   at first followed by a very relaxed and calming high.\u000a\u000aYaba Daba Do,\u000a\u000aThe FlintStoners

VThis is a great hybrid. I am not usually a fan of Indica dominate, but this strain changes my mind a bit. It is a great pick me or, a great way to kick back and relax, maybe talk and/or be creative.

Va five star indica dominant hybrid.A  great bud for those who love OGs considering it is a quad strain.I get plenty of energy on this strain but i am also really &quot;huh?&quot; high.I walked into and out of the closet 3 times before I came out with the socks I needed.Take it easy with Slimer because the comedown can put you to sleep.I strongly recommend Slimer,dont let the ugly name fool ya.

VMy boyfriend and I picked up some Slimer OG live resin. Sometimes smoking makes me feel dumb (high), but this stuff makes me feel coherent and content. Very relaxing comforting stuff. My boyfriend definitely felt the dry eyes, other than that I feel like it&#39;s a very balanced hybrid.
