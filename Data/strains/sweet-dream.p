VIt&#39;s a pretty heavy headed high. The Indica is definitely what I feel the most. I&#39;m vert relaxed. Calm. Able to think a little clearly and focus a little more as a result of not being able to keep still, like in class. \u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t smoke this throughout the day, but definitely would before bed.

VThis is a nice strain. I vaped a little bit and felt relaxed yet focused and alert. The high lasted a decent time too. This is a prefect daytime strain to help with stress and pain.

VGreat smell and flavor. No anxiety. Light and mellow high. A double-threat in that SD doesn\u2019t slow you down or deplete your energy or motivation but can be great for relaxation or sleep if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.
