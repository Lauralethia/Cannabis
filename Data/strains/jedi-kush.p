VDecent cerebral high that takes awhile to set-on. After a full bowl, day-dreams come into focus, and troubles melt away. Seems to make users really giggly - when my friends and I smoked it together we were all laughing like hyenas. This is NOT something you want to smoke before needing to focus or do something important, as I found it incredibly hard to focus on anything other than how awesome whatever I was watching was.

VJedi Kush will put you out. JK is very sedative a vaporized .1 of a gram before going to bed and it knocked me right out in 15 minutes. The downside is that I was a bit wonky in the morning. \u000a\u000aIf you need a deep sleep to recover and you don&#39;t have to do anything early the next day I recommend consuming Jedi Kush.\u000a\u000aThe taste is very dark and mysterious it&#39;s hard for me to explain\u000aI recommend JK if your experiencing\u000a1.

VI didn&#39;t understand when my budtended told me it was a creeper weed... when I smoked my bowl after a long T-Break, I instantly felt quite high, but then I just got higher... and higher.... and higher... One bowl of this stuff, and I was gone. The body high is intense, not much couchlock, but still has a nice heaviness to it. The head high is comforting and warm, unlike some sativa&#39;s I have smoked that give a very happy, euphoric high. The smell of the bud was a strong citrus-y, pine smell, with a hint of skunk in the background. It tasted like it smelled, and the smoke was very smooth, letting me take a bit hit without coughing a lung out. \u000a\u000aOverall, for my first indica, this was an excellent choice.

VI really loved the relaxing sensation this strain provided me. It&#39;s definitely one of my top favourite strains I&#39;ve ever smoked. I highly recommend this strain for night time use or anytime you want to ease back from a long day at work or school.

VOk, so my numero uno, five star, top shelf, place of honor and legend is ~DeathStar~. Also among my top 10 strains is good ol&#39; reliable ~San Fernando Valley~ kush. Combine the two and Kaboom!!! Blast off! Mega stoney results ensue. Slowy does the buzz creep its way to couch locking candy wrapper daze.\u000a Mild smell, pungent taste. Inhale bangs as deisely twists and kushy sweet earth hit my pallet.\u000aExhale swims in Death Stars essence all potent and chemical.\u000aBuzz relieves mind and body stress. \u000aJust a great cross.\u000aJust sayin...

VSo far I&#39;ve only smoked this, but I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to take my Magical Butter machine on its inaugural run with the rest of the bud I have. I&#39;m trying to find a strain for my grandma, who has severe arthritis and COPD, but she can&#39;t handle the taste of MMJ in food. The smoke on this is so mild that I&#39;m pretty confident this is one she can handle the taste of in butter... as confident as a n00b can be, at least. Very decent high, though very subtle. It takes a while to kick in, but it&#39;s a nice, soft, heavy body high with a lot of thinking and daydreaming.

Nice yields, with about a 8-9 week flowering time.  First time I grew it, didn&#39;t care for the way it twisted around it&#39;s self.  Ended up very surprised by it&#39;s potency.  It is one of my staple grows when it&#39;s around; along with Heirloom Thai (Thai Stick).

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000aPros: Fast acting, provides relaxation to the mind and medium pain relief to the body. Provides tingling feeling starting in the legs. Doesn&#39;t make you immediately tired, however with added consumption can help you get to sleep if needed. Increased appetite.\u000aCons: Occasionial harsh feeling on pull and exhale on back of throat. Dry Mouth  is prevalent. Had occasional headache, once after waking up and once as the medicinal effects were wearing off.\u000aOther: Earthy/Flowery taste, with a little piney. While effects were fast, was a little cerebral almost a light headband effect at times. Did cause a few headaches. Started to become harsh upon second vape in Volcano chamber (Other flowers usually start becoming harsh the third vape fill). While not a bad strain, I would recommend others due to the headaches and varying vape quality. I wanted this to be the Yoda of Jedi Kush but ended up being Qui Gon Jin, still a Jedi but a disappointment nevertheless.

VSo far I&#39;ve only smoked this, but I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to take my Magical Butter machine on its inaugural run with the rest of the bud I have. I&#39;m trying to find a strain for my grandma, who has severe arthritis and COPD, but she can&#39;t handle the taste of MMJ in food. The smoke on this is so mild that I&#39;m pretty confident this is one she can handle the taste of in butter... as confident as a n00b can be, at least. Very decent high, though very subtle. It takes a while to kick in, but it&#39;s a nice, soft, heavy body high with a lot of thinking and daydreaming.

VNot much taste and a little harsh smoking, but like they say, gotta cough to get off! Gave me a great high and didn&#39;t take much to do so. Would recommend if you&#39;re just trying to relax.

VI&#39;d have to say it&#39;s by far the best strain I&#39;ve ever smoked. I have degenerative discs and fibromyalgia,  so I deal with a lot of chronic pain. this made me completely relaxed as well took my pain away and I have quite the amazing head high.

VBest for use at night when you want to sleep real good. May the force be with you. The stone is strong with this one.
