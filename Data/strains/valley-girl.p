VI am currently suffering from depression and I picked up the shatter and dabber it and let me tell you it is very tasty and it was very uplifting. it has a nice behind the eyes and body relaxing high. I would highly recommend those who want a 50/50 strain and those who have depression.

VValley Girl is an interesting mix of SFV OG and Fire OG - they come together to make a very balanced hybrid. The effect is very euphoric and happy and would be great for those with anxiety or depression. A slight body high but I still feel energetic and ready to tackle the day. The organic cut I got was a little leafy and is lacking on bag appeal, but the high more than makes up for it. 4/5

VHaving anxiety problems i tend to stay away from the ones with anxious or paranoia effects. This one was one of the worst for me, very unpleasant. I ended up making edibles with it. To each their own. I envy those of you that don&#39;t have those issues because this seems to be a very highly rated strain.
