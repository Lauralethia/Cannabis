VIve been debating for a hot minute if I like LIKE LIKE this strain or just like. First, you&#39;re gonna get stoned not totally...well not at first.  But eventually.  Its creep weed. Taste is lemony and has a woodsy aftertaste. Smells hella funky, but in a good way. Pretty buds, most were fluffy with red veins throughout.

VThis strain definitely had its sativa moments as well as its indica. within 20 min of me smoking the flower, I felt motivated to sort laundry and start dinner early. however within two hours of flower smoke I felt the body high. its slowly creeps up on you and its calming.

VI grabbed this strain because I wanted to try out some more sativa dominant hybrids. I enjoy this strain a lot for it&#39;s euphoric effects. As good hybrids tend to do, it brought me to a really trippy headspace that&#39;s fun in groups. The downside I found with this one is that it&#39;s a little on the sedating side, which becomes noticeable when the euphoria tapers off. I also found the flavor to be on the earthy side, which leads me to believe that I may have gotten a more ICE leaning phenotype. I would like to get a different batch and see if my experience is any different.

VA good high. Ice Grapefruit gave a good energizing head rush and had good focus. There is a good relaxing body high along with it that&#39;s not too strong but will get stronger later on. This could be use for anytime of the day imo. \u000aAs for medical use it&#39;s good for fatigue, pain, and excellent for depression. And this could be a decent anti anxiety but maybe not for everyone.

VSome of the best smelling buds ever. Makes my mouth water in flowering wanna eat the leaves sometimes. Nice bag appeal and a breeze to grow. It smelled so good I kept calling it Tropical Ice it was more of a mango grapefruit mix. small buds grew in the center of the fan leaf never seen that happen b4 looked cool. The only thing I disliked was the duration it had no legs.. lol. Good daytime Sativa Dom strain for sure. Not much of a body high period. Good chit!
