VI don&#39;t know if I just got a bad batch, but this strain does NOTHING for me. No buzz, it burns really quick, and makes me feel like I just wasted my time and money. Total bummer.

VDelicious mild taste (rolled a joint) \u000aLight green in color with red hairs and lots of crystals. \u000aI was recommended this strain for daytime use against my back pain, it was a great choice. \u000aA little dry mouth but a clean clear head high that lessened the pain and tension in my back. Highly recommend.

VI broke the bud up and  immediately smelled the sweet bubble-gum aroma. Very smooth high, with long lasting effects. Smoked this with my little brother and he said it made him feel really happy. One of my favorite hybrids! \u000a\u000aAbout to smoke my third joint! :)

VNot bad, but I can&#39;t think of any particular effects it had. Felt like a generic, all-purpose high, nothing mind-blowing. I think I was only able to reach a very high high once or twice. It&#39;s good, but nothing special. Too much other stuff out there for me to try, so I probably won&#39;t be coming back to this one.

VA light effect on the body. Not much on the end of body relaxation but my mind is not frustrated or angry at the thing I was just angry about and I feel happy and relaxed mentally. My body more than a deep relaxation is more of a body feels like\u000aJello feeling. It has a great lightness to it as I mentioned so really good for day time and clear thinking while elevating mood.
