VTangilope. I tasted this strain from Total Accountability dispensary in Benson, AZ. Available in flower and pre-rolls when tasted. Sinsemilla. Lovely mature well-cured flower. Lots of reddish pistils in medium density nuggets. Opaque resin glands bordering on amber add to the reddish tones. Medium leaf trim. Nugget size, 1&quot; to 1.5+&quot;. Flower has a sweet citrus aroma. It has a more tangerine aftertaste after the draw. Smoke is medium with the citrus fragrance. THC content? Probably within the range. I would be suspect of any claims over 24. It&#39;s in the genes my friends. You can grow a spectacular flower specimen, but the genetics are set. Grower in this sample did a splendid job! I can just imagine the live buds. This medicine was used as an all-day anxiety reliever and sleep aid. Although with use throughout the day, no trouble sleeping. Did not get in the way of either creative or physical work. Made me a bit chatty upon medication, but then mellowed to steady medium euphoria. No real increase in munchies, although that&#39;s a rarity for me personally. Recommend? Yes, give it a shot. It&#39;s sweet. Wish I could upload some pics. Can you do that on this site?

VAny Strain crossed with Tangie will always tempt me.  So naturally when I saw this Strain at ShowGrow Ramona I had to get me some.  The smell of the flower for me Fruity, Floral, Minty... This weed smells Great ! They could make an Air Freshner out of this Shit :)  Smoked my standard half bowl out of a Glass Pipe and the Taste .... Meh...  Pine followed by a mouthful of Dirt and Tar... The High comes on steady and starts out Brite, Focused, a little upbeat.  Then the High becomes less Brite and More Spacey...  Then More Spacey and Psychedelic. Then Oddly, the high begins to taper off about 20-30min in... and I&#39;m ready to dole out a Harsh Review but then the 2ND WAVE HITS....:)  Spacey, Psychedelic and Heavy !!! for a Solid Hour to an Hour and a Half.  Then as the High slowly fades it becomes Spacey and Relaxing.   This is a great cross of Tangie and Chocolope, however I still rank Sour Tangie higher than this strain but only by a Thin Margin.  Leafly Needs to put a Half Star or better yet a Tenth Star Scoring System on their Rating Review.  If they did I would Rate this Strain a 4.6, and Sour Tangie a 4.7.  The quality of the all the Strains out there really deserve this level of Rating Precision.\u000aBeing a Weed Snob in Southern California.... Priceless :)

VThis strain gives off a powerful citrus aroma and it tastes exactly how it smells. Its pretty visually appealing as it is coated in orange hairs and trichomes. It&#39;s one of my favorite tasting strains because it taste like some damn oranges . After smoking tangilope I feel super energized and happy, its a great day time high but be careful not to over do it because this is some top shelf sativa and a friend has told me he felt almost jittery after smoking this flower . This has been my go to strain for the past few months and if you can get your hands on it I definitely recommend you pick some up. My particle cut was bred by DNA genetics and grown by Cannacruz in santa cruz california they did a great job with it \u270c&#128077;

VVery fruity and also retains that chocolope flavour too. Buds look great and unique when growing and the vape and smoke from this strain is fantastic. Definitely advise people try vaping. I used a plenty from storz and bickle and could taste all of the subtle flavours and aromas. If you are into experiencing different terpenes and haven&#39;t tried this strain I advise you give it a chance.

VI&#39;m a sativa man, and Tangilope hits all the right spots for me in terms of taste, potency, immediate effect, and nature of the high.  My current dab stash includes some Tangilope shatter that has quickly become my new favorite concentrate strain.  The taste is a wonderful, bright, complex, citrus - not sweet citrus, but the kind that wakes you up in the morning like you find in orange juice, grapefruits, and lemons.  The expansion in the lungs and quickly soaring immediate high are the things sativa dreams are made of ... a very nice &#39;refresher&#39; sativa.  The high tends to be energetic, creative, uplifting, and social ... excellent daytime smoke that doesn&#39;t end with a body crash or mental comedown.  Great alternative to Jack Herer, Hazes, Durban Poison, and others that can be a bit more anxious in their high.

VOne of my favs. Not many people know about how great this  is. Strongest smelling fruit flavor ever. I put a real tangerine beside it an was so dead on. Then this version makes it really sativish. So if you like sativa. This one should try. The taste is well fruity smooth real smooth and undertones of chocolate. It grow easy. They can get tall but not as much as one with think for Sativa. Buzz-Happy, Euphoria, Pure Joy, Creative, Enegetic almost fell like superman. Oddly it killed the pain or I was so toasted I couldn&#39;t notice the pain.  I also like Tangie by itself too but this one is for peps that like chocolope , and tengerines you love this.

This is an excellent strain to start the day with. The tangie taste is as uplifting and sparkely as the effects. If possible it\u2019s a great strain to always have on hand.

VThe social version of Chocolope. Chocolope&#39;s motivational powers and &quot;everything is awesome!&quot; euphoria are dampened just enough to make it conducive to a fun night of activities and laughing with friends. Slight munchie effect, no paranoia or anxiety. The anti-depressant effect is there as well, though it doesn&#39;t have the lasting afterglow that Chocolope does. \u000a\u000aBasically, this is Chocolope-lite. Great for anyone who wants a boost to their day.

VTangilope is a day time winner. This strain helps me medically for severe ADD/ADHD. It&#39;s like taking a ritalin it just doesn&#39;t last as long. It helps with focus, mental clarity, and completing tasks. Great for use in the morning and throughout the work day. I give Tangilope a high score of 8 out of 10 as medicine for ADD/ADHD. The taste is tingly, zesty tangy, sparkly and uplifting, just like the effects. I recommend this Tangilope to anyone looking for daytime relief from ADD/ADHD and to anyone who wants to try an excellent sativa.

VI use this one for stress and depression.  It helps a lot. I am able to use it in about 2 hour cycles.  It gives me a kick of energy and I am able to get some chores done.  Then I take a rest and come down a bit and decide if I want to do any more.

VI can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve smoked the parent&#39;s of this particular strain before. But they&#39;ve produced an AMAZING child! The pictures users have uploaded are accurate, this bud is dark green and covered in red hairs. The fragrance is sweet and citrusy, with undertones of mint or Eucalyptus. Its not the clear headed high that Cinderella 99 or Blue Dream creates, but still give it a 8/10 overall. Creativeness is at an all time high with this strain and music really stands out. I would recommend this strain for anything from walking outside with your headphones on, to concerts or events. Its not overwhelmingly potent, but can surprise you, so first timers: use caution. I preferred this in a joint above all else, seemed to really bring out the flavor of the terpenes. Sleeping immediately after smoking is a crime, enjoy this one, while the sun is out. There are plenty of other strains for that.

VThis is one of the first time i tried quality weed.. i&#39;m so happy i tried Tangilope, tastes good and the high is wonderful for me. I&#39;m nowhere near the most smiling person in the world, but when i smoke Tangilope, a small smile is printed into my face. Even with a cbd lip balm, i can say it doesn&#39;t really help relieve back pains. It&#39;s really more of a celebral happy, creative strain. It&#39;s also very strong but didn&#39;t make me cough once, around 20% THC.

VReally nice cross of two great sativa strains, worth checking out if you like either of them. Took on way more Tangie in smell and appearance but had upbeat euphoric like sativa effects like I expect from Chocolope and that mild coffee-type taste does come through on the smoke. A little too spacey to be truly focused on work but a great daytime option for everything else. 4.5/5.

VBest smelling tangie strain I&#39;ve smelled to date. Tangie has a very sharp astringent pledgy type smell and the nose on Tangelope is more on the creamy side like a 50-50 bar. Not super strong, tests out at around 15% usually, so that and its sativa dominance makes this for a great day smoke. Super easy to grow cuz she can take a beating and packs on the chunk in the last couple weeks which makes her a good one for beginner growers. Needs some training and a leafing regiment because she really bushes out if you aren&#39;t on it. If you see this one grab it, you definitely wont be bummed when you gotta triple baggy it.
