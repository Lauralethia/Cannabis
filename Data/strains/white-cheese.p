VWhen I first tried a cheese strain it was U.K cheese. White Cheese is a good cross. Not as good as U.K cheese but definitely up there. Smoke is a little harsher than others but its got a great taste. Lemony/chocolatey. Great aftertaste. It smokes very slow in comparison to other strains. Rolls very smoothly. Very nice headbuzz, body buzz to the shoulders. Long lasting high and smells amazing. Guys, any cheese strain is a must have imo. If you see this at your local dispensary do not let it pass. I remember going to a local dispensary, super shady, my go to place was closed that day. This place claimed to sell blue cheese and ive got to say its the first time ive been willing to throw out weed. Luckily I only got 2 grams of it. Please make sure you purchase this strain from a reputable place after going through a doctors referral. Otherwise you run the risk of buying something that its not. Just a friendly reminder.. happy toking!

VThis bud grabbed me by the nose and demanded that I pay attention; she smells so good that you gotta keep her in an air-tight because that dank cheese aroma loves to flow. \u000a\u000aHit a bag off of my Volcano and had an awesome head rush and sustained head high which spreads into a very nice body buzz. \u000a\u000aGreat strain for a happy and and stress free Saturday morning. Awesome I-Dominant that flirts nicely with its Sativa attributes. First words that come to mind: happy, low to no stress, smiling, the music sounds awesome. \u000a\u000aKeep a big glass of water close and enjoy the day.

VAs per usual cheese strains at hit or miss, if you love the cheese then this ones for you. It has a pungent cheese flavour and aroma. This strain is a hybrid so it does not deliver an overwhelming indica lockdown like the other cheese strains do.

VWhen you crack open the jar, it smells like gods vagina! Just so pungent, and cheesy but slightly sweat and skunky, that any cheese lover will love for it&#39;s awesome 60% indica anti-anxiety muscle relaxant affects. Its a awesome strain for any one who is a indica fan but also doe&#39;s not won&#39;t to doze off.
