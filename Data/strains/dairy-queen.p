VWOW is pretty much all I can say. I live in North Carolina so good bud doesn&#39;t come by often. I flew to California in Santa Cruz to visit my brother, he met me at the airport with a huge blunt of this god bud. I started hallucinating, I was the center of the world and I was looking in on everything else through a tube. I was away from everyone and I felt fucking amazing. I was in a whole new world. It might have been the jet lag or the milkshake but when I got back to my brothers apartment I vomited and took a nap. Best weed if the fucking world.

VMigraine pain 6; nausea 4 when I medicated round 1800 or so. Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. No anxiety/paranoia (an absolute must for me). Head high kinda heavy but no couch lock which is nice. Body high exactly what I needed. This one is good for after work/evening use. Definitely good for bedtime too. Highly recommend for evening use for pain/nausea. Yay!

VThis version was an outdoor grow.  Very loose buds.  A good amount of pain relief with a pretty spacey high.  Lost track of time while being focused on random things.  Definitely an increase of appetite and thirst as well.  Feels mildly psychedelic, altering your perception of surroundings, sometimes accompanied by some mild dizziness.

VDq compares well to hybrids like Super Lemon Haze or possibly even Blue Dream. If you are like most, then you WILL be contented with Dq.  The big difference is Dq&#39;s unique stink of cheese and fruitiness of red cherries in a liqueur sauce smell. No really - it smells great!  As with most strong Sativas, expect a bit of paranoia.  4.5 Cherries.  Jack Flash is also a super nice hybrid.  ns

I love the smell of this strain it&#39;s very bright orange and saturated around darkened leaves.Very Pungent vape, I cant even hold in all of the vape, it leaks out of the orpheus of my face. Its very pepper kick to the back hits hard.Have your water or maple water with you when you take this strain cotton mouth like crazy. A little spacy, but no depression or stress which is awesome so far, I do feel like a halo or a dent around my head. Very different I would recommend this for pain since it&#39;s slowing my typing down. Anxiety is gone I feel very mellow and relaxed very heavy body parts this is great!

VFirst things first. The aroma of this strain is unlike any other: it smells like cheesecake, with an undertone of sweetness. Tastes sweet through a vape and joints are smooth. Had a small joint before hitting the gym and the second I finished getting changed I was left with a smile and an immature laughing until I got started - it was purely focused energy from there on. Better then any pre-workouts I&#39;ve tried!

I had never heard of it but the numbers seemed fairly impressive and Chris as never steered me wrong in the past so I decided to for an eighth of that and then a new batch of this killer looking &#39;Blackberry&#39; which is one of my personal all time favorites. So I went home immediately to test out the new stuff &quot;DQ&quot;,and After about 4-5 rips from my bubbler I began feeling the full effects after around 5 minutes or so and when It comes it hits hard, so in my opinion it&#39;s a creeper, so Watch Out! No, but seriously, I definitely gotta thank my buddy next time Im in for the recommendation Overall it&#39;s a very well balanced, smooth flowery taste, very Mellow, and yet also in way uplifting both mentally and physically, but above all, most importantly no paranoia and coach lock.

V       Got it from Az best meds, fantastic! Took me a while to realize I liked it, has a strong almost cherry cough syrup taste under the strawberry, vanilla and sour...... through the vape. It has psychoactive properties for sure, kind of reminds me of widow. Way more hazy for sure, not speedy, great for day or night. Need to get stuff done, no will and you smoke this...... It gets done. Anxiety crusher, I have seizures from extreme stress&amp;anxiety. Perfect

VThis is the most flavorful bud I&#39;ve had in a while, to truly enjoy this strain you should run it through a vaporizer. The strawberry and vanilla flavors meld to create a very unique strawberry cream flavor. A good buzz that was heavy on the munchies and warm cuddly feelings for me. This would be a great strain to make hash from.

VI smoked this strain in a preroll when I got home from work. I only had to smoke 1/3 of a gram before I was quite high.\u000a\u000aUsually it takes around half to a full gram for me.. I highly recommend this strain for those who want a really spacey head high without the sleepy feeling. Even after a long day of work and a smoke, I didn&#39;t feel tired enough to sleep right away. (I&#39;m sure by the time I finish my preroll, it will be a different story..)\u000a\u000aAlso, note that this strain leaves a slight bitter taste in your mouth. I feel like mine may have been fertilized with something... Make sure to learn from my mistake and buy only organic weed.

VI&#39;d say this strain is a 60/40 Sativa Dominant Hybrid. This strain&#39;s onset is pretty fast due to the caryophyllene content. The limonene  present in the strain causes an uplifting affect. Can also cause slight aniexty / paranoia in patients who have GAD, etc. Very much a balance of head and body.

VI love the smell of this strain. The bag I got had a great fruity smell with some mild cheesy smell in the back, kind of like a fruity yogurt. People talk about the different phenos with this strain and i would definatley say I got the pi&#241;a colada or coconut pheno, however you want to describe it, it&#39;s great. The smoke was smooth, not too heavy, and it had a sweet taste. The high crept on over 15 minutes as I enjoyed a cup of coffee; and what a great combo these make. For me it was more cerebral, but I was able to get rid of some early morning aches. A good daytime weed, perfect to greet the day and ride through the afternoon. My hats off to grower on this particular batch.

VMigraine pain 5; nausea 4 when I medicated round 1900 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (an absolute must for me). Body high perfect. Head high heavy but not overwhelming. Actually tastes creamy like ice cream! Could get up &amp; clean house. Could also crash as it&#39;s my bedtime. Highly recommend for after work/other evening use for pain/nausea.

VI&#39;d say this strain is a 60/40 Sativa Dominant Hybrid. This strain&#39;s onset is pretty fast due to the caryophyllene content. The limonene  present in the strain causes an uplifting affect. Can also cause slight aniexty / paranoia in patients who have GAD, etc. Very much a balance of head and body.

VVery enjoyable strain, good for daytime use as it has more sativa leaning effects.  I was seriously doubtful of the sweet and vanilla flavors this strain claimed to produce but they were definitely evident.  Relaxes you without making you feel overly sleepy, ideal for a calm day at the beach or out somewhere in nature.  One of my preferred strains recently.

VI&#39;ve tried a few strains out there. This one immediately intrigued me by the smell. It&#39;s very different. I first smoked it yesterday, outside in the sun. It didn&#39;t take long for me to feel the effects. Once I did I thought to myself wow this is really good. I just really like the high I get. I felt really good, yet not tired. Which is good since I smoked around 5pm. It&#39;s without a doubt something I&#39;ll get again. Added to favorites. 5 star rating from this guy. &#128076;&#127996;

VAs soon as the jar was opened at The Jazz Club, the Cheese genetics were identifiable by the smell alone; smooth and pungent like a good asiago. The taste is similar, but more mild and sweet. There&#39;s a relaxed feel to it, couch-locked yet not tired. pleasant visual sensations have come on as well, with lights glowing brighter and colors looking sharper. Quite a unique strain.

V7.5 Rounded up. \u000aExcellent hybrid. I always smell dried apricots and mangos along with that &quot;creamy&quot; flavor people have been describing. Tastes almost as good as it smells, which is a huge plus in my book. Nice tight sticky med sized buds forrest green nugs with orange hairs, glistening in clear and milky trichomes. I&#39;ve tried the kind with the purple hairs and found it felt more body heavy and less cerebral than the orange variety. Both smell and taste delicious. Try it once is my saying. (I&#39;ve &#39;tried&#39; this several times!!) No comment on the idea that it makes you crave ice cream, or that ice cream is more enjoyable after some DQ. ;)

VTried a gram of this strain despite the description at the dispensary saying it was for beginners. The smell is hard to describe, but I thought it had quite a bit of citrus notes and sweetness, almost like candy. The buds were relatively dense and light green with burnt orange hair and crystals throughout. The taste is another hard thing to put my finger on. The smoke isn&#39;t too harsh. Some strawberry comes to mind and definitely that citrusy, almost cleaning supply feel comes into it as well. I&#39;d rename it strawberry shortcake. The high is nice and happy. Not too heavy or incapacitating. Bubbly and contented, a little creative, kinda hungry. Social. Easily distracted. Made me feel kind of like a cute anime cartoon made with all pastels.

VDamn... This strain is amazing! It was sweet, and tangy. The smoke was smooth, and not that heavy. Pretty bomb flower for being packaged as a joint. This growers game is fuckin on point!

VI specifically smoked this strain this morning, before 7 am, to treat some lower GI pain. Within two minutes the pain and distress went away, and ten or so more minutes later I&#39;m feeling an uplifting, happy high. Definitely have cotton mouth, eyes are a little dry. I&#39;m also stoned enough that I would try to do complicated or precise work.

I&#39;m definitely going to take my time with this strain, to ensure the true power of it is fully expressed. My happiness is greatly increased and it makes my depression vanish. Although I get a bit dizzy and feel kinda paranoid, small amounts of this strain is plenty.

VIf you are looking for a discreet strain for vaping Dairy Queen is a real winner. The bud itself does gives off a slight tell tale of the familiar marijuana aroma along with vanilla and pepper. While loaded in my vaporizer prior to vaping it does smell slightly but to a passerby it smells like a room of sugar cones. Vaped I taste vanilla some caramelized fruit and a chemical nose followed by cheese. Lingering smell from vaping is that of cooked sugar cookies.
