VVery Fast acting, this one shots you right on the dome and you soon look like that scene in the Pinocchio cartoon where he takes his first big hit on pleasure island and his eyes fill with a tear, his face goes green and he cant hit the 8 ball lol.  Fun strain in moderation, very motivational, happy vibes and an inclination to go out.  Beyond a bowl it shifts to a hybrid and 3 bowls in becomes a light indica  \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHwJ16MbXHU

VSuperb. Being from Tacoma a 45 minute drive to Seattle this strain hits home. A perfect sativa. No anxiousness. Just a relaxed cerebral experience where your cares seem to fade away. While staying motivated. I just put in a 8 hour shift at work and it seemed like no time at all. I was relaxed happy and not worried about time! That was a bowl before and on lunch. Expensive but worth it! I could see this maybe being the best wake and bake meds they have out there

VI avoided due to the name - I am a mature cannabis user and do not seek out things named &#39;crack&#39;, &#39;poison&#39;, &#39;cough&#39; or &#39;f*ck&#39;.\u000a\u000aWow. My loss! Seattle Cough is now a go-to strain for me. It has the best of the sativa effects - uplifting, mental stimulation, creative impulses - layered with just enough body relaxation and chill to provide a fantastic experience.\u000a\u000aI detect a moderate amount of expansion when smoked, so maybe that is where the cough originates?\u000a\u000aI can partake anytime other than right before bedtime. I never get speedy or wound up or OCD, only fascinatingly high.

VHonestly the first time I smoked this strain I was really let down. I&#39;d been told how great it would be how amazing it was. There just didn&#39;t seem to anything special about it at all generic taste, generic smoke, just boring. But after having smoked it another few days I can say it has a fun upbeat high,  and the flavor is a mello citrus flavor that leans toward a grapefruit flavor that&#39;s really quite nice once you taste it. So I&#39;ll give it 4 stars a bit of a letdown but might learn to really miss this one.

It&#39;s a Festivus miracle. \u000aI&#39;ve been trying all of the strains since moving to Washington, and was starting to think that all was hopeless and that maybe it was time to take a break. \u000aAlas, I&#39;ve found what works for this long-time stoner. \u000a\u000aSmooth like butter. Creative and with it. I feel good.

VIt&#39;s very delicious. But very very potent. Not my all the time weed but it is always available at my band&#39;s studio so I smoke it pretty regularly. It doesn&#39;t hit right away so you really need to be careful. There is nothing creative about it when you over-smoke. Otherwise I dig

VCitrus flavors with a skunky earth-pine kick (Not sure what that last part means, but definitely citrus). Great, quick, straight-to-the-dome high. Dry mouth, and a small tickle cough easily negated with a swig of beer, or your beverage of choice. Overall a solid strain, I just finished a joint of this and feel like I could focus on some specific task and succeed in accomplishing it. Dutch Brothers Farms &amp; The Stash Box...Thank you
