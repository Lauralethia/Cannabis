VAnother great strain for medical users. It brings a blankness to the mind that is like getting a breath of air from anxious thoughts. I enjoy how easy it is to achieve the body high in this one, as well as how long it lasts. It definitely turned off the chatty channel that my husband and I are usually stuck on, and it was nice to enjoy a relaxing quiet evening at home together in each other&#39;s company. I still feel like I could get up and go if I needed, but I also feel relaxed enough that I am confident that tonight I won&#39;t be staring at the ceiling until 5am thinking about existential crap that gives me anxiety. \u000a\u000aSide note: Cartoons (Pixar-type animation in particular) are great to watch with this strain.

VKnown and named for its place of origin, Mendocino County in Northern California, &quot;The Purps&quot; as it is commonly referred to came to me in the form of tight, popcorn sized nugs, almost completely deep purple in hue, and frosted heavily in resins and thc.  Its aroma in the jar is light and citrusy, almost haze-ish.  THe buds break easily and pack well, leading to a lungful of heavy white smoke.  THe high, for me, came almost as a creeper.  About 10 minutes after sampling this strain on a clean palette, it hit me like a purple monkey driving a purple train down some purple tracks to Purpsville!  I was outdoors and everything snapped into focus around me, and I was left giggly and happy - and not bogged down and lethargic, even after several tokes.  Purps for the win!

VThis is my go to strain for helping me get motivated to work around the house with less pain than normal. I have been on opiates for over 10 years, this is the first strain to help combat pain and lack of motivation. I have since cut my pain meds in half in a little over 5 months and I feel better overall. All due to this strain. I don&#39;t get a heavy high from it, so I find it is best for daytime usage. It is just strong enough to do the trick with lasting effects. And I always can find it too.

VI had the chance of seeing the purps grown at a friends house and loved the look of the plant at the end of flowering. It look like the plant was incased in glass. Couldn&#39;t wait to sample...when I did I was shocked by how smooth they smoke was. About as harsh as a Newport. Didn&#39;t think it was hitting me at first. Then sometime between walking to the kitchen and back to my room I was on another planet. Best strain I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;ve been smoking for 25 years.

VMendocino Purple, or The Purps - as I got it - is a lovely expression of the purple gene in full gear. the aroma is ultimately coniferous and forest flourish with a flavor profile of caramelized pine with a deep undertone of eucalyptus on the exhale. georgous, dense buds that aren&#39;t over stiff, allowing the nuggets to grow beautiful, round and stocky. beautiful gold and orange hairs with abundant clear trichomes with maybe 5-10% amber. The high was creative and soft with excellent pain alleviation as well as keeping inflamed joints at ease. great for exercise if your demotivayor is pain and/or stiffness related. plus the FLAVVVORRR!!!!

Another half hour or so and the euphoria and munchies are here and my vision is doing something a little off. Some arousal as well. Not a bad strain so far.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. First try. Trying to be. more cautious, I took two puffs and waited a half hour. All I noticed was an overall slightly stupid feeling. Not in a bad way, just mentally a tad slower and physically a little unbalanced. Back to the garage for four more good hits. Another half hour or so and the euphoria and munchies are here and my vision is doing something a little off. Some arousal as well. Not a bad strain so far. I will be asleep before I get to ride this one all the way out. The body buzz is nowhere near as strong as White Widow. More like NYPD.

VOldie but a goody of a nighttime strain.  The pheno had a pungent earthy grape smell.    Smoked from double disc perc blubber and the grape flavor really came across nicely along with with hints of caramel and pepper.  Euphoric  relaxing high kicks in within a few minutes with the body relaxation coming on a little more slowly.

VI really never had a purp before but this one I really like. I had a double fusion done in my back. As soon as I could walk again I went on the hunt for a pain and stress med I found this one at a local dispensary. Not my favorite dispensary (HDR) but I took my broken a** over and checked it out! I ended up with 3.5g and out the door. Really nice heavy head hitter. Pain relief lasted about 2 hours. No paranoid feeling no stress I will add to my fav&#39;s list. Be safe Be well &amp; grow!

VI have been sampling several strains to relieve pain. This wouldn&#39;t have been a top choice as it is relatively low percentage of CBD, but it works effectively for pain management &amp; lasted 3+ hours.\u000aIt is a very functional high that almost sneaks up on you. Works as a motivator to make me want to do housework &amp; be happy about doing housework. It&#39;s a mood uplifter &amp; makes music much more enjoyable. I&#39;m not a gamer, but imagine it would work well for them. Effectfor my depression &amp; anxiety, but also helps me concentrate w ADHD. \u000aIt does turn off that noisiness of anxiety but maybe too well. I wouldn&#39;t drive or operate equipment. It just seems a bit &quot;Spacey&quot; for those types of activities\u000aIt is an indica heavy hybrid so I was concerned it would knock me out, but the crash doesn&#39;t come until much later than expected.\u000aThe buds are very dense &amp; crystal formed. It seem to last much longer than other buds. Deep purple in color w orange hairs. Very outdoorsy smell. Taste is outdoorsy, as well.

VThe Purps is a great heady heavy hitter that will leave amateur smokers wonder why they&#39;ve been staring at the wall for an hour after smoking. The flavor is raw, earthy and sweet to the nose with wonderful floral notes tickling the taste buds with delight. A great night cap smoke as it will leave you &quot;dazed and confused&quot;. &#128077;&#127996; The batch I had was from Hug Farms and I got it at Bloom Well in Bend.

VExcellent medicinal use for stress, depression, and anxiety. I&#39;ve tried several other strains recommended for depression, and, though they do work in their own way, none of them so far have been able to be quite as effective as this strain.

VPurps sneaks up on you like a thief in the night. Initial reaction is that this stuff is crap, 10 minutes later you&#39;re pinned to the couch, 30 minutes later it&#39;s bedtime. Biggest drawback is that there are no legs to the high. Maybe it&#39;s a batch deficiency but if this would last more than an hour, it would be a 4.5 to 5-star strain.

VPretty sure this is the old school &quot;purps&quot; that we used to see but then it turned into &quot;Grandaddy Purple/Purps&quot; around 2003-2004 when people still LOVED to play the name game to whoever was willing. Whatever the case may be i still don&#39;t see this around much if at all. But i do remember it being pungent almost like coffee when smoked or even when the jar was opened from afar. Dark purple all over, dense and bright with tiny orange hairs. Similar to urkle but probably the pre-cursor....

VI have been sampling several strains to relieve pain. This wouldn&#39;t have been a top choice as it is relatively low percentage of CBD, but it works effectively for pain management &amp; lasted 3+ hours.\u000aIt is a very functional high that almost sneaks up on you. Works as a motivator to make me want to do housework &amp; be happy about doing housework. It&#39;s a mood uplifter &amp; makes music much more enjoyable. I&#39;m not a gamer, but imagine it would work well for them. Effectfor my depression &amp; anxiety, but also helps me concentrate w ADHD. \u000aIt does turn off that noisiness of anxiety but maybe too well. I wouldn&#39;t drive or operate equipment. It just seems a bit &quot;Spacey&quot; for those types of activities\u000aIt is an indica heavy hybrid so I was concerned it would knock me out, but the crash doesn&#39;t come until much later than expected.\u000aThe buds are very dense &amp; crystal formed. It seem to last much longer than other buds. Deep purple in color w orange hairs. Very outdoorsy smell. Taste is outdoorsy, as well.

VOne of the strains I&#39;ve spent the most time with, just smoked the last of what I had right now.  Let me tell you this now, she is an exceptional herb.  The high she gives is unique, you feel full of energy yet your eyes feel heavy.  You definitely feel it in the eyes first.  But then you come down form that into a relaxing sleep. On first inhale you&#39;ll taste a very delicious piney, woodsy, light berry, pungent, aroma that will intoxicate you.  On exhale, (I used a water bong to smoke this strain by the way), it&#39;s smooth yet strong, she had me coughing like a mother fu*ker.  Anyways, happy blazing.

Vive had this strain more than any other in my life. used to grab too much of this at once. its been since 2009 that ive had &quot;da purps&quot;..... i had a good understanding at the timr for the info available, but off memory thid strain is amazing. super indica dominant but i could stay up and hang out with room mates or in a light pre or post party setting, 20 or so people. amazing for video games, lack of apetite, and sex. i never include that when rating strains but this one in particular brings that memory. tasted and smelled so muxh like grape and berry and just... purple. if i ever make it out west, i will be reuiniting with mendo purps after a decade plus away.

The high is uplifting and giggly, but not racy. Flavor was on point when consumed as a terpy wax, and had no harshness. Wanted to buy another gram but unfortunately the dispo was already sold out, but will keep my eyes out to enjoy again.

VThis cut was from Root Down in Washington State. Called the purps this was my least favorite strain so far in the retail weed market. The only reason I gave it two stars were; one for being legal (low bar I know), two it was a well cured well trimmed bud. Other than that......meh...The smell was near nonexistent of grape and was more stale hey. I ended up smoking near the whole gram package before I felt anything and that was a short lived weak body high that was mildly relaxing. Very disappointed in a strain that has roots in so many other great strains I love.

At one point I felt like I was floating a few inches off the ground and gliding across the hardwood, frictionless.\u000a\u000aReally pleasant with a gentle comedown and mild hallucinations. It was almost too much at one point, but the high never got out of control.

VThis strain is more than beautiful. I found it&#39;s beauty to be more intoxifying than my experience smoking it, even trimming and curing the yield felt like an honor. \u000aThe bud is dense, light green with deep hues of purple covered in light orange hairs and a crazy amount of trichomes. The smell is not extreme maybe a little earthy and fruity, but very nice.\u000aThe smoke is light and smooth with a fruity almost earthy aftertaste. It is delicious. \u000aMy only concern about this strain is the THC level. \u000aI love the high, it&#39;s mellow, giggly, calm and my anxiety dulls but I feel as if it could be a lot more potent.\u000aEven at 40/60 sativa indica, Mendo Purps is medically raised with a low THC for patients with a very low tolerance.\u000aThis strain is ideal for many but simply does not work for me.\u000aAll in all in my experience, this strain is worth it for patients who need a low THC bud for anxiety and or mental illness/disorders especially or just for fun, for it&#39;s beauty is breathtaking.

VThe buds had a sweet aroma of citrusy and slightly earthy tones.  Visually they were stunning, soft as velvet to the touch, and when ground up the smell was mouth watering.  The smoke was smooth and the after taste had a noticeable floral tone.  Amazing, simply amazing.  The high was relaxation and stress relief/anxiety relief.  Great bud

VI thought this was a pretty good strain. I thought it was somewhat heady, but also relaxed my body. I got very tired after smoking this if I smoked at night. I think this is really good day time weed, with a high that will make you want to be in a more natural place (i.e. the outdoors).

VWOW! My new favorite! As someone who&#39;s naturally &quot;stessy&quot; type person and this strain brought me down a few notches to where I am able to relax a little bit. I would highly recommend this for people with high anxiety issues. Mellow high thet made me giggly and hungry. The buds were nice and big and dark purple, almost black, in some buds with tons of pretty sparkly crystals all throughout. Will be sad to smoke what little is left after reading how hard it is to find.

VThis is a beautiful strain of marijuana. \u000aThe bud is beautiful not only to the eyes but the touch as well. It is dense and neatly packed. The color is mainly green with deep hues of purple and it is covered in light orange hairs with a significant amount of trichomes.\u000aThe smoke comes on very smooth inhale and exhale. It is a bit earthy with a hint of citrus and/or fruit in my opinion. It&#39;s delicious.\u000aDespite it&#39;s low THC level, the high is very pleasurable and relaxing. It definitely helps with anxiety and I highly recommend it for that reason but I do feel that it is intended for low tolerant people.\u000aAll in all, Mendo Purps is a beautiful plant to harvest and love but for me, the high is a bit weak.

VI bought a gram, which I do when trying new strains and making comparisons. I will not buy this again. It wasn&#39;t horrible (and bearing in mind people&#39;s experiences can be quite different) it did not do what I had hoped. I smoked a bowl and felt stoned, yes, but in a very &quot;blurry&quot; way. That&#39;s the best way I can describe it. I was basically feeling body relaxation that was quite strong; made me a little dizzy and wobbly on my feet, as though I were drunk, though I do not use alcohol at all. As I say, it wasn&#39;t horrible. I just ate a couple of apples and went to sleep! If that&#39;s the goal, then it meets them. No harm done. That&#39;s why I like to try small amounts of things. This one just won&#39;t be on my &quot;repeat&quot; list.

VWas very excited to try this, after reading overall description here on Leafly and at the bud shop.   Used the vap method for fibro pain before heading out to do errands.   I loved the relaxed effect to both body and mind.  Everything was goooooood.  There was a little paranoia/anxiousness that tried to set in early on...but was able to go on and not think about it.   Felt at my best taking my time as I did errands.  But as I headed home a few hrs, later the crash started to kick...despite still feeling it in my system.  I then remembered this has some Durban Poison in it.    It does the SAME thing to me.  The crash lasted about 3 hrs.....  Not fun.  I found it is best just to wait it out.  But now, all is well again.  Glad I just bought a gram!   Now it&#39;s time for some Yoda OG :)
