VI&#39;m not usually a fan of sativas, as I am prone to anxiety, but I got this as a free sample from work and tried it out last night. All I can say is I am giggly and feeling very hazy. It&#39;s definitely high energy, but relaxing at the same time. I wish I had more than just a gram! Highly recommended!

VThis strain is amazing I picked up some RHS live resin by Weed Bunny I was told the flower used was by Doc and Yeti farms best Sativa Dope Cup winner. It&#39;s a perfect daytime strain that starts with a boost of energy and mood, it&#39;s pretty focused while still having some relaxing qualities that don&#39;t leave u feeling sleepy. Because of it&#39;s balance it&#39;d probably be a great strain for studying or homework also. The flavor is very bright (live resin) and spicy but finishes with a strong citrus flavor that I absolutely love. Overall I would definitely recommend and buy this product again will be on the lookout for other examples of Red Headed Stranger

VThe red head is not a woman but the devil. I have been smoking for years and have never been afraid to smoke and to smoke myself into a coma. This is much different, after a bong with layers of Kief I felt like I was on some coke or something. My heart was pounding like crazy but at the same time I was really enjoying music and such. I would be very careful on how much of this devil you smoke. It\u2019s scary to drive on too, I can always stay focused on the road but this takes you somewhere else. Take caution when smoking this strain, if not careful it will take you to hell. Very powerful stuff, new users steer clear or smoke VERY little.

VPerky, functional, and focused, Revolution&#39;s Red Headed Stranger is a great daytime go-to for maintaining a motivated workflow. If you like keeping your wits about you while leaving behind the fatigue and anxiety that muddle your productivity, look no further. As far as stiff-lipped, bracing sativas go, it compares in efficacy to GTI&#39;s Durban Poison, though flavor-wise the two are worlds apart. RHS flower expresses rustic, vegetal tones, like an unwashed organic carrot at the peak of the season, while the concentrate form showcases more delicate hints of cucumber and rosewater. Whenever I need an instant pick-me-up to get back to the grind, I know this strain&#39;s got me covered.

VBit of a harshness at the back of the throat with this one, particularly with a joint. Flavors on this one are slightly citrus, but slightly tobacco. Maybe campfire taste. Pretty instant lift of mood. Nice little body high, and the understanding that this is actually a somewhat different high than some sativas. The smoke is, as the joint burns down, tasty at points, not great at others. Out of the bong it&#39;s like orange candy. So choose the bong, obviously. High was strong, lasted intensely for about 45 minutes to an hour. Nothing truly outstanding here, but also not bad.

After smoking this strain I noticed a few things, the slight cerebral high was uplifting and it was easy to get up and get things done around the house. The cartridge really brought out the earthy/berry taste of the herb. Major cottonmouth, luckily I also picked up a 50 mg medicated pink lemonade to go! Great strain, will absolutely pick up again in the future

VMy dispensary sold this to me as a hybrid and it feels like one more so than a sativa. Buds I got were frosty as all hell and had bits of bright purple scattered through out the nugs. Thc percentage was super low @ %17.10 ....2nd lowest I have had since becomimg a certified medical marijuana patient 3 months ago. Total Cbd content was %1.10 although it feels higher. This weed is perfect for morning before work or those with a low tolerance looking for pain relief usually only given by a heavy hitting indica but still want the head in the clouds feeling without that infamous headband feeling,,,,, gorgeous nugs, if I didn&#39;t purchase at a dispensary that tests and labels products (no fkn shit I know) I would guess this weed was much more potent in a thc way. Buds are a nice Kelly green with average ,rust colored pistil coverage but COVERED in trichomes. Was able to get a kief bowl after every gram of this stuff if I put it in the freezer to make the resin glands break easier. Bottom line -- great medicine, but a lot of people will want something more kush or gorilla glue like.

VThe smell of this strain is great, and the taste from start to finish is outstanding! In my experience, the flavor started off very smooth, and it had a slightly sour note on the exhale. Definitely one of the smoother strains I\u2019ve tried. The sativa effects were definitely at the forefront, but the indica effects came through in a manageable amount; not enough to couch-lock you. As my fianc&#233;e put it, \u201cMy shoes feel amazing.\u201d We were both energized throughout our stroll following the smoke session. Highly recommend this strain for hiking adventures, or for anything else active.

VThis is a day time winner and I give it a very high score of 8.5 out of 10 on the helpful for ADD/ADHD scale. Smooth taste of citrus and wood that doesn\u2019t make me cough unless I take a huge hit. Really helps clear the mind of all the noise and let\u2019s me focus on my work. It also relieves some anxiety. Helps reduce muscle tension associated with anxiety. The effects are similar to White Buffalo. This is one of my favorite Sativas right now.

VBit of a harshness at the back of the throat with this one, particularly with a joint. Flavors on this one are slightly citrus, but slightly tobacco. Maybe campfire taste. Pretty instant lift of mood. Nice little body high, and the understanding that this is actually a somewhat different high than some sativas. The smoke is, as the joint burns down, tasty at points, not great at others. Out of the bong it&#39;s like orange candy. So choose the bong, obviously. High was strong, lasted intensely for about 45 minutes to an hour. Nothing truly outstanding here, but also not bad.

VPerky, functional, and focused, Revolution&#39;s Red Headed Stranger is a great daytime go-to for maintaining a motivated workflow. If you like keeping your wits about you while leaving behind the fatigue and anxiety that muddle your productivity, look no further. As far as stiff-lipped, bracing sativas go, it compares in efficacy to GTI&#39;s Durban Poison, though flavor-wise the two are worlds apart. RHS flower expresses rustic, vegetal tones, like an unwashed organic carrot at the peak of the season, while the concentrate form showcases more delicate hints of cucumber and rosewater. Whenever I need an instant pick-me-up to get back to the grind, I know this strain&#39;s got me covered.

VFirst few draws of this from a Revolution Terp Tank and I&#39;m  blown away! I prefer vaping and edibles to smoke. I have found my PTSD is best medicated with indica dominate strains as well as blends with higher CBD. Most sativas leave me edgy and  anxiety prone. RHS has been wonderfully smooth in flavor, vape, and high. Just enough cerebral high along with a relaxing smooth body high. Wonderful pre-stretghing or massage or yoga. Eventually settles enough to melt away and gently fall asleep. Very happy and enjoyable progression.

After smoking this strain I noticed a few things, the slight cerebral high was uplifting and it was easy to get up and get things done around the house. The cartridge really brought out the earthy/berry taste of the herb. Major cottonmouth, luckily I also picked up a 50 mg medicated pink lemonade to go!

VThe red head is not a woman but the devil. I have been smoking for years and have never been afraid to smoke and to smoke myself into a coma. This is much different, after a bong with layers of Kief I felt like I was on some coke or something. My heart was pounding like crazy but at the same time I was really enjoying music and such. I would be very careful on how much of this devil you smoke. It\u2019s scary to drive on too, I can always stay focused on the road but this takes you somewhere else. Take caution when smoking this strain, if not careful it will take you to hell. Very powerful stuff, new users steer clear or smoke VERY little.

VMy dispensary sold this to me as a hybrid and it feels like one more so than a sativa. Buds I got were frosty as all hell and had bits of bright purple scattered through out the nugs. Thc percentage was super low @ %17.10 ....2nd lowest I have had since becomimg a certified medical marijuana patient 3 months ago. Total Cbd content was %1.10 although it feels higher. This weed is perfect for morning before work or those with a low tolerance looking for pain relief usually only given by a heavy hitting indica but still want the head in the clouds feeling without that infamous headband feeling,,,,, gorgeous nugs, if I didn&#39;t purchase at a dispensary that tests and labels products (no fkn shit I know) I would guess this weed was much more potent in a thc way. Buds are a nice Kelly green with average ,rust colored pistil coverage but COVERED in trichomes. Was able to get a kief bowl after every gram of this stuff if I put it in the freezer to make the resin glands break easier. Bottom line -- great medicine, but a lot of people will want something more kush or gorilla glue like.

VThis is a review for Revolution Lab in Illinois. They have offered a variety pack that includes 1/8 of dry flower, 1/2 gram budder, 1/2 gram shatter. The flower has 25% THC content, and the concentrates each have 88%. This product is an excellent value. \u000a     The shatter is called nug run pull &amp; snap. It has a great texture, excellent flavor, and it is very potent. It stretches like caramel, but then it snaps off cleanly. It was very easy to get off of the parchment and into a silicone container. \u000a     The dry flower has grapefruit/citrus notes. It is very strong and fast-acting with uplifting and relaxing effects. Vaping this flower was very enjoyable. I also felt very social and chatty.\u000a     The budder is by far my favorite. It breaks very cleanly and crumbles with additional pressure. The budder holds a good disc shape that makes it easy to portion out. The effect feels more potent and immediate to me as compared to the shatter. 3 to 4 puffs from vape pen left me feeling relaxed and chatty.\u000a     All 3 of these products are great and I would buy them again individually. As a variety box with a discount, it is awesome! Because of this variety pack, I am curious to see if Revolution  has the same quality and potency for their other concentrates.

VIt was a very strong cerebral buzz. What sets this strain apart from other strong sativas I&#39;ve tried is this one seems to put you in a stroned daze, where you&#39;re not tried but you could stare are something for hours and think about it. This strain might be awesome to use in a situation where you need creativity on a project or a different perspective on something. Extremely mental strain with a huge high that lasts better than average.

VI am relatively new to marijuana, and have only tried 2 strains before this one. Red Headed Stranger gave me a crazy body high I hadn&#39;t experienced before, and I&#39;m not crazy about it. My feet started tapping, and I could only watch them. My hands started shaking, and it took a few minutes to figure out why I was having trouble picking things up. And it made me incredibly edgy and paranoid. Not paranoid of people, but of horror novel situations...I had to go pee, and couldn&#39;t look in the tub or in the mirror for fear of some bloody, gruesome scene, or what may be looking back at me from the mirrors. The effects are lingering today, just the high itself, though. But o don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be using this one again. \u000aMy husband liked this one, but said he was a little on edge, but nothing major.
