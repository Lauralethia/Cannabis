VTried this stuff for the first time tonight - I took the first hit off the bowl and my buddy took the second - he coughed hard and as he told me that was a harsh hit I realized I was already starting to get high... Thats amazing for me. Later in the evening we smoked again and he didn&#39;t realize it was the same and said &quot;wow that tastes nice!&quot; . Loving this stuff! Gets that heady high where you think about something, and then something else before someone says something and you&#39;re like &quot;what?&quot; . A+

VIt was awesome. Every time I open the bag, the whole house starts to reek. Kinda funny to my roommates because they know when I&#39;m about to smoke. lol. This stuff really gives me and my friend the worst (or best) case of the giggles we have ever had. Everything was funny and everything was great. Very nice, hard, thick buds. A lot of tri&#39;s that sparkle under the light. A great smoke-it-and-chill-out strain. We got through one joint between two of us and called it a night, although I think that was because we couldn&#39;t get off the couch to get more weed. It really did a number on my eyes also. Very dry and red. Eye drops where a must with me.

VBought some Cali grown Super Skunk yesterday that was dusted white in trichomes and was as loud as an Asian porn actress. As a hybrid, the lightfooted and dreamy sativa effects are there.. but they&#39;re balanced and at times even overpowered by the more obtuse indica influences.  Smoked lightly, Super Skunk comes on at a pace you can control. Easy toking leaves you feeling dreamy, creative, and with a very nice body relaxation that&#39;s great for stress. True to its sativa roots, low to mid level buzzes are enjoyable but pass somewhat quickly. \u000a\u000a Overmedicate, however, and Super Skunk is more than strong enough to jack your ass... the good news is that if you do end up in a too stoned kind of place  you won&#39;t be there for a painfully long time. Great meds.. especially for stress at moderate to low-high doses. Recommend.

VSmoked this a while back, perhaps even when I first started smoking. Remember lying on the grass feeling the warmth of the sun course through my entire body. Any form of stress I may have had seemed to vanish almost completely and then when we went for a swim, I felt truly connected with the water.\u000a\u000aGreat smoke during the summertime if you can go outside and take in nature. The high is calm and the come down is very mellow, doesn&#39;t leave you tired as I find normal skunk to do.

VThe best strain I&#39;ve ever had. Helps to relieve stress, lowers the pain level (I suffer from bowel desease) and makes me feel very calm. It brings beautiful state of mind, but often makes me incredibly horny. After two days of using I became unsatisfiable. That could become kinda annoying after few days...

I would absolutely recommend this strain to anyone of my friends. I would also remind them that.... this is what CANNABIS is suppose to taste like! lol... My Expectations are met!

VSolid Indica strain with pleasant taste. At light to moderate doses, provides excellent pain relief and euphoria. At heavier doses, causes this reviewer severe cotton mouth and neurological disturbances. By that I mean it becomes sketchy to hold or carry anything because my entire system experiences these &quot;nerve shocks&quot; that have been known to cause me to involuntarily lose my grip on items in my hand or stumble because it felt like my legs gave out for just a moment. Haven&#39;t ever been seriously injured, but a good thing to keep in mind. I find 2-3 proper hits does it for me, and I live with intense chronic pain. Very relaxing!

VSuper Skunk tastes delicious. It\u2019s everything skunk should taste like. At first my cares are lifted away. I get a little giggly and feel like doing something active but 20 minutes later I\u2019m ready to take a nap. I use cannabis throughout the day. If I were only able to pick one strain it wouldn\u2019t be super skunk because it\u2019s not practical for day time use. This is rainy day or nighttime strain.

VThis is hands down my favorite strain. Father in law grew some years ago and gave us a pound. I have not been able to find it in clubs or elsewhere since. Husband bought me some seeds for the holidays and I have 5 beautiful girls ready to harvest this weekend. \u000a\u000aI have searched high and low for another strain that hits me as this one does. The instant head change is a must for my depression and PTSD. Super Skunk wraps me up in a warm blanket by the fire and pets my hair while telling me everything is going to be alright. If I am having trouble sleeping, I just smoke a little more than usual and I am out for a good 6 hours. My motivation seems to kick me in the ass and I can actually get housework done. Some family members said that it made them a bit paranoid, but I never experienced any paranoia, even with my anxiety and PTSD. Also great with relieving my scoliosis pain, headaches and joint pain. \u000a\u000aOnly bad side that I found was that if I smoked on an empty stomach, I would get the serious munchies. If I ate beforehand I had no issues. \u000a\u000aCan&#39;t wait to try out my girls here in a few weeks!

VReview Update: On my last review of this strain I told my first impression of the strain. In this ocasion I smoked alone, in my room, and the effects werent that nice. However, today I smoked a joint with 2 friends in the middle of the woods in the afternoon. I think I never laughed so hard in my life. We were easily laughing out loud for 5 straight minutes. Abs aching, crying, and we couldnt even breathe! It was my best experience with weed yet. In my last review I said I didnt recommend it to novice smokers. Now I recomend it. Just do it in a nice environment, with friends and the perfect chat location. This strain really does give you the munchies so always have some chocolate biscuits or something sweet with you.

The high is all Indica IMO and There is plenty of it...No paranoia and noooo stress. Creeps up on you and after 10-15 minutes your pains And sorrows will be gone:). Great for People Who train a lot as it is a proper painkiller. I smoke it after the gym and the muscles just relax and soften up..

VI suffer from chronic back and neck pain and migrans. I was looking for a strain that would get rid of my pain without feeling baked. The smoke is really smooth, not much flavor, and relived my pain for about 20 minutes.

V4.6 out of 5, the last review I gave on this strain was meant to to on Ron Burgandy bud, not a huge fan. Anyhow this is the first time I&#39;ve had super skunk and Its a strong, effective tool against pain and the stresses of life. Hits hard and has that pungent smell that is unmistakable. Great strain, fun too. Body and mind feeling lifted :)

Works great for both medicinal and recreational use. Great painreliever and it gets you real wasted too;) Best suited for evenings If you&#39;re gonna smoke heavily because it will put even a  seasoned stoner to sleep. Mainly for Indicalovers. .\u000a\u000a

VReview Update: On my last review of this strain I told my first impression of the strain. In this ocasion I smoked alone, in my room, and the effects werent that nice. However, today I smoked a joint with 2 friends in the middle of the woods in the afternoon. I think I never laughed so hard in my life. We were easily laughing out loud for 5 straight minutes. Abs aching, crying, and we couldnt even breathe! It was my best experience with weed yet. In my last review I said I didnt recommend it to novice smokers. Now I recomend it. Just do it in a nice environment, with friends and the perfect chat location. This strain really does give you the munchies so always have some chocolate biscuits or something sweet with you.

VI  just got a great few buds of this, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily smell skunky or taste skunky if smoked. But I am using it for post surgical chronic pain,  and the surgery damaged my lung,  so I&#39;m not big on smoking now. I read the lineage, and thought this would be a perfect fit for my bedtime ingestion!  Oooohhh, whatever you do,  don&#39;t eat this stuff unless you can find a way to seriously mask everything about the saut&#233;ed results! I  slept great, but getting it down was a real issue both times. Cooked in coconut oil,  and soaked up the oil and herb with bread. Tasted exactly how I imagine a skunk&#39;s scent gland would taste, and it LINGERS for awhile! Otherwise,  it&#39;s potent and will cause an amazing couch lock that is very good at relieving pain. No paranoia--only issue is very dry mouth,  but who cares when you&#39;re curled up asleep and happy? Love it!

VWhen I was younger, I was smoking everything I could for varieties sake and I remember Super Skunk stood out and gave me the greatest high of all.\u000a In fact I only grow this strain right now. The phenotype I have grows vigorously, and flowers very fast. Mine smells of lemon, skunk and sweet, earthy, cheese. Very dense nugs and perhaps the ultimate, when it comes to post-workout relief as it pushes feelings of mental euphoria and heavy body relaxation with a good appetite boost to finish.

VLove this . . . and when grown properly to it&#39;s peak of trich-goodness, it becomes a sweet perfect India (unless, like all strains, you keep on toking and thus the effects will lead to tiredness or just plain apathy when you should not be lazy).  Its not a full Indica but if you smoke 2 hits, then go about your business, it&#39;s like a natural Xanax. LOL.  Its not a drug like Xanax, but the relaxation provided is just the same and probably - LIKLEY - far supreme, and its a very nice strain to grow. Indoor is good for this because of the small nature of the plant &quot;bush&quot; (SOG ScROG etc) if you wish because when grown properly, these majestic plants from heaven will give to you wonderfully dense pungent nuggets and if you&#39;re growing for yourself and only self-consumption, then this will work from all growers like you to the pro dude. Its a great strain.

VQuite chronic. Smoked a fat bowl so I got hella high for a long time. Didnt exactly make me feel talkative but was still able to speak if needed to. Sitting on a bench while zoning out with friend was pretty fun. Definetly a must try strain. Sadly eyes got hella red and would be considered obvious if people know whats up. Coming down from it would make you tired fsure, but not tired enough to crash and sleep. Would reccommend a different strain if ur not tryna sit around and talk with friend while zoning out the entire time.

VThis shit is called Super Skunk for a reason! !  Smoked this 15 yrs ago in Denmark and it&#39;s still One of The best Classics around. Smells like a weedfarm tho so be aware. The high is all Indica IMO and There is plenty of it...No paranoia and noooo stress. Creeps up on you and after 10-15 minutes your pains And sorrows will be gone:). Great for People Who train a lot as it is a proper painkiller. I smoke it after the gym and the muscles just relax and soften up..

VNot bad. I\u2019ve grown two of these (indoors). They weren\u2019t too tall, but boy did they smell. Fed them nothing but water and seaweed extract. In 3 months they were harvested, and cured for like a month or so. The smoke is nice (I haven\u2019t tried a lot of strains though), moderate couch-lock, relaxing as hell, very light paranoia on the first few minutes. Effects last 2 hours or so. Sleep comes really easy with this one, and you sleep like a baby too. I found this strain to be great for a beginner like myself; not too overwhelming. Recommended.

VThe name says it all. What a great smelling bud. It has a  strong citrus/fuel aroma similar to Sour Diesel. I smoked it out of a bong and the taste was mild in compare-sent to the smell. The high was kind of a creeper. About 5 minutes after smoking it, I realized that I was REALLY stoned. It&#39;s a great stress relieving strain. It&#39;s perfect after a hard day at work, when I still need to push on. The effect is very happy and uplifting, but spacy at times. I actually saw trails when objects were moving fast. That of course was after revisiting my bong many, many times. Although, the high lasts a long time even after a single hit. Sometimes up to a hour and half. Interestingly, about 45 minutes after I smoked it, the effect becomes more of a body high than head. \u000a\u000aIt is definitely a &quot;day starter, or enhancer&quot; not a &quot;day ender.&quot;

VUsually a very fine, stony indica; but the specific curing process the grower used took away from the usually wonderful terpene content of this plant. I&#39;m assuming they were impatient and quick-cured on some racks under light. Super Skunk is usually a very pungent strain, and fantastic for Indica and Sativa Lovers alike. Usually has a rubbery, skunky, citrus smell. However, this does seem to help my back.

VIt&#39;s a nice sweet taste. Good indica couch lock. More intense than Mr. nice in hybrid category, its potency is intense. Sativa effects are sort of limited but a notch or two better than nice, well worth it. Mr. Nice is mellower though, but skunk gives you less paranoid feeling. Good if you want to be numb and creative. Munches  are noticeable.

VI liked it for nerve pain when I smoked it and was fortunate to find a seed in the eighth I purchased, so I grew a plant out in my backyard. I finished it off with compact florescent lights in the basement. A very tall plant with a nice dense cola abundantly frosted with trichomes. Very stinky buds.\u000aI got 4 ounces from it and the finished product was even better than the original. This is a must have for nerve pain for any part of the body, and the high is excellent.

VMost flower that is extremely Euphoric can be a bit much for me;  However Super Skunk was a very smooth onset, and powerful punch.  It causes a great uplifting high, with a lot of spacing off and some silence, then BAM bursting with creativity and a positive attitude.  Although it does make me extremely tired after the head buzz comes down, so only smoke if you&#39;re planning on staying in.\u000aDo not hesitate to try if it&#39;s available.

VThis totally saved my New Years, or ruined it, depending on how you look at it. Super smooth, and it kicks in gradually, and then it keeps kicking in until it kicks you into a couch or bed, and that&#39;s where you&#39;ll probably stay. Unless you consume it at a playground designed like a pirate ship, and then it&#39;ll release your inner child. \u000a3/5 Pirates.

VQuickly becoming one of my favorite strains. Usually vape other sativas, have always liked diesel and mid-grades, but I find that two puffs is all that is needed to alleviate stress, depression, pain and nausea making just a gram for me last two weeks (I&#39;m not a heavy user though). Since I use cannabis for IBS and pain and nausea associated with it as well as depression and indicas are generally too sedating, this works perfectly and is a good balance. It can be quite strong though inducing anxiety, dizziness and some paranoia for me, so take that precaurion. Just take it slow if this is a good grow, it is a wonderful flower and strong medicine. Highly recommended.

VI tried this when I was young and inexperienced. Stuff was so potent you could smell it from a good ten feet away... Even though it was triple wrapped and zipped in my coat pocket. Smoked it at an anime convention. Best convention experience ever. I was normally very nervous in large crowds when I was younger. One bowl of this, and had an amazing time just cruising the halls. Came down some time later. Called my friend again, met up, and packed another bowl. When confined in our room, the stuff practically paralyzed us, but once we got moving we were out the door and walking on air. Unfortunately, my mother caught me with it when i came home. She made me come in the bathroom with her, opened the bag, and flushed the remaining .5g of it. I almost cried. The bathroom smelled like it for days. One of my all time favorites. ^^

VThis is a top shelf indica next to master kush. Super potent as to the &#39;Super&#39; name. The flavor is like most indicas, earthy and dank. Mostly it&#39;s known for in strength, and I can see why. Had is next to a &#39;strong&#39; chocolate chunk and was still much better. The high is very couch and muchie heavy, so beware. This is not for novice users. Otherwise insomniacs and indica enthusiasts rejoice in this skunk.

VI acquired this strain in a hash oil Vape cartridge from Craft Elixers. It was a deep, dark color, with a deep dark flavor to accompany it. Lemon, hash, skunk, and the traditional dry herb vapor taste were the profiles, nothing I was used to or acquired a favorite taste to, but I took it. The high was mostly body, but I could feel my eyelids getting heavy. It relaxes my muscles and my body screamed for sleep. My friend and I shared the vape on top of a giant jungle gym by the dock and she said it was the best sleep she needed. Same for me.

Body high allowed me to eat a medium sized dinner &amp; relax after my day ended kinda weird. Head high took me away which was exactly what I needed. I dint notice that dis strain made me either energetic nor sleepy. Must&#39;ve had more of a 50/50 hybrid or something. High lasted bout 3+ hours.

VVery mellow Indica for me. I vaped this strain in oil form and it was lab tested at 59.76% THC and 1.92% CBD. The mellow nature may be due to increased CBD content but I will need more comparisons. Anyone have an opinion? Very tasty, mine was infused with Watermelon terpenes for flavor and the relaxing, body-lock and appetite effects are felt immediately. 5/5 on this strain in E-juice form; what more can you ask for with concentrated cannibinoid levels and enhanced flavor? Will be vaping more. Give this strain a puff!

VClassic indica Afghani meets mid-80&#39;s skunk genetics; personally I think the Afghani is particularly dominant when I run into Super Skunk.  The buds are a mix of greens with lots of orange hair and plump/round like you&#39;d expect from Afghani genetics.  I don&#39;t particularly find it to be super strong (skunky) smelling, but it has a subtle classic cannabis flavor with a prominent hashy-sweetness that is very much a characteristic of it&#39;s indica genetics.  The high has a minor jolt of heady-ness that quickly passes into a full-blow mental/physical relaxation ... very good for anxiety issues, sleep promotion, and appetite stimulation.  Very good night-time smoke and probably effective for those who sometimes feel too much anxiety with more sativa strains.

V10/10 would smoke again. I&#39;ve had plenty of earthy herb, Super Skunk has a really nice taste, the most dominant one in my opinion being its earthiness rather than being skunky. The very subtle sweetness you get when smoking this is pleasant and is subtle enough that it works strangely well with the other flavors, similar to how one who is stoned may create a dish out of abstract ingredients than turn out to taste pretty good. Very relaxing body high.

VSweet smelling, sweet tasting. \u000aThe high was super intense. Would not recomend for novice smokers. This strain started strong in couch lock effects, eye closure and numbness, then started to affect my balance, even laying in bed. Made me paranoid and therefore, dizier. After a while I vomited and the high lowered a lot but stayed in that nice, relaxed and stressless feeling. After a few days I still had intestinal issues. Was it the strain? Something I ate? Cant tell, I only know it started while I was high. Great smell doe, great flavour, amazing to pass on in a party and enjoy the taste.

VSuper Skunk is a unique growing and smelling plant, ive only cultivated it outdoor.  The plants had massive semi-hard colas about arm size, I topped each one 3 times to create a total of 14 colas/per plant all loli - pop style.  The one thing I did NOT like about the genetics were some fluffy bud phenos I got from Nirvana&#39;s seed pack.  While some plants were awesome others were a waste of a season.  Proper Super Skunk should be nice and frosty with good resin content, light green with light orange hairs, and reeks of diesel fuel, literally.   This bud will SIT YOU DOWN, in other words not quite couchlock but not a really active high either, even though it would seem like it would have uplifting effects.

VSmoked up a few joints in a benching area with my mate - bunch of strangers there who id never seen before. Usually I would become anxious and paranoid of my surroundings (worsened when I&#39;m stoned) however when I sparked up the first joint the sudden wave of euphoria sneaks up on you and you&#39;re stoned before you know it. Very chatty when high and felt no paranoia or anxiety. Currently laying in bed still stoned and able to pass out at any minute even though my tolerance is quite high. Rate this bud as my top 10.

V4.75 / 5 WHITE SUPER SKUNK, boy what a strain. Had this in a variety of settings and places but enjoyed it whilst swimming in a pool. Massive head high and highly creative. Best enjoyed in safe / quiet environment (it&#39;s potentness can lead to some wtf/paranoid moments) where you can enjoy the ride and transition to shear &#39;epicness&#39;. Definitely a head high and very strong one at that. I got this in Cortez, Colorado at a local dispensary... It was advertised as having 27.5% THC content. Not to shabby. Smells quite dank to be honest and rather hydroponic but rest assured this does not ruin the follow through taste nor effects. #1 favourite strain so far (slightly ahead of Jack Herer) and would definitely try again and / or recommend for others to light up!\u000a\u000aRemember to take this review with a pinch of salt, every reviews subjective! #StayTuned #CGM
