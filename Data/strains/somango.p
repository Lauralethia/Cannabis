VSo my normal flavor profile tends to go in the pungent, deisel direction and I rarely like a Mango taste in my bud. This sweet treat delivered a unique type of Mango, and I like!\u000a  Great buzz consisting of energy and focus. Played guitar for hours, cleaned house, went out and rapped up the day in my kayak watching the sun go down...\u000a  Bangin pain relief too.

V@C4LabsAZ had the pleasure of testing a very unique strain from our good friends at Arizona Organix. This strain of Somango carries a 1.3 CBD/THC ratio and strong dose of terpenes, particularly the anti-inflammatory and sedative beta-myrcene. This is a powerful medicine for those struggling with epilepsy, inflammation and anxiety.

VSmoked a bowl of beautifully round and fluffy Somango buds (at mine spelled like So Mango&#128516;) and at the start, it was a bit too much - must remember to not smoke on a half empty stomach.\u000aCoughed a bit and throat was on FIRE for a while &#128293; But then it mellowed out into a smooth buzz. This may be an indica, but very intense high for me, mostly physical/emotional. Cerebral effects were most relaxed, funny though also focused and activated. Slightest paranoia but managable - simple acceptance makes it fade. Strong body high - was for example able to isolate muscle groups I can&#39;t normally. Made me reflexive and gave me a body rush at the same time; very heady effect that can lead to small paranoia. Ended in a super sweet mellow body high, like champagne in my veins and tasting like cotton candy mango. Simple and sweet euphoria. &#127775;&#127775;&#127775;&#127775;

VMy review is specifically on a free sample I got from a local dispensary.\u000a\u000aThe taste does not match with any of the other listings. No sweetness, actually fairly harsh,\u000aNo mango or citrus or tree fruit flavor what so ever, almost more of a diesel or earthy coffee taste. \u000a\u000aThe smell is appealing, the nugs are round, not clustered with an array of orange hairs.\u000aThe THC level was labeled at 8-11% THC : 8-11% CBD\u000a1:1 ratio CBD/THC basically.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve heard great things about Harlequin and other rare CBD enriched strains... defiantly not counting out the other strains, just need to try fresher product and from various growers.\u000a3/5

VPicked mine up from Bloom in Phoenix. The taste was a little off and the feeling wasn&#39;t anything to write home about. I would say it is an average buzz that last anywhere from 2 - 3 hours. The indica traits are there but not going to have you stuck on the couch all night but will help you to get some sleep if you aren&#39;t doing anything. Overall I would get another eighth of it. **I used an extreme Q vaporiser

VSomango was a f*cking awesome strain. I became super curious about this one when I read over the strain highlights. When I finally got a chance to smoke it I was blown away. I still can&#39;t understand how &quot;sativa-like&quot; effects and euphoria came from this indica heavy strain. 5 of 5 will buy again. \u000a\u000a

VAmazing taste, and nice feeling while smoking it. lets you get stoned slowly and  enjoy it. It gives you a nice travel to the next level afer the 2nd joint, Were it pushes the high to the next cloud in the zone, were you can lie relaxed and unworried abouy everything, feeling happy and away from the  problems.

Not one to melt my pain though it is good for nausea. The flavor is ok not as much mango but quite sweet and flowery I like it, not the best but good smoke.

VI purchased some Somango from Arizona Organix because of the lower thc and higher cbd content. It smelled very fruity, pine like. very tasteful. I can smoke it in the day time and be comfortable doing daily tasks without getting stuck. no couchlock, but still good to relax.
