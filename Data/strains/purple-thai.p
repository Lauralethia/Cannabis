VOne of my top favorite sativas! Great aroma and flavor. Paired very well with the uplifting mood and joy I felt. I suffer from depression so feeling that kind of happiness, like pure and real happiness, is something that very rarely happens for me so this was a nice surprise. I bought a gram on a whim and ended up going back for an eighth. \u000aI\u2019d definitely recommend this to anyone looking to combat the winter blues or more serious depression. It\u2019s also great for focus. Definitely have an outlet for the energy this strain will give you too!

VA good mellow sativa, very creative and happy, good for pain/stress relief. What I really like is the focus and the mellow I get--Purple Thai&#39;s not an overly cerebral strain to me (Durban Poison winds me up too tight, makes me too chatty and brain buzzy) so its a really good daytime strain for folks like myself! I dig the mild purple/chocolatey/earthyness, too!

VThrow this in with some of the other PTS sativas for an energetic smack in the face. Love their effort to really bring about classic strains that are either landrace or hybrids of landraces. Columbian Gold, Brazil Amazonia, Wild Thai and 1024 sativas from PTS are far and beyond the best sativas I&#39;ve had. Green crack by gold leaf is right up there as well, but the PTS consistency is fantastic.

VI have to admit when I saw purple thai on the label u was like ok here&#39;s another reengineered version of an absolute amazing legendary strain. well I obtained my flower at bank of buds always quality. so anyways I just smoked about 2 grams in a splif and I have a pretty strong tolerance but thai gets me every time I love thai or any south east asian strains for that matter this beautiful  landrace Trinity. for some reason this type of hybrid is  as far out as I like to stray as far as hybrids go. I mean I&#39;m a landrace lover and fan of three way crosses such as this also like monkey paw etc. it&#39;s got that super southeast Asia euphoria that is not to be rivaled and the reason for the Exultation of these amazing strains and their qualities and nuances there is definitely great power in these strains beautiful for anxiety post traumatic stress and the depression that it brings I mean they just smash anxiety and all of its kids. thai strains r Amazing and whatnot thought was gonna be some run the mill gdp crossed into Choco or Mao thai but I was very very happily surprised beautiful nice job guys my hat is off to you I feel awsome soaring higher and higher still. I&#39;m a fan and I would def use this strain again. very stoney if let go a bit and still super heady.
