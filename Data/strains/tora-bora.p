VPicked up an eighth at CBD 6.8%/THC 5.6%. Don&#39;t be fooled by these stats into thinking this is a lightweight. No, sir. You don&#39;t have to go to sleep right now, but you sure as hell aren&#39;t leaving the house after smoking this strain. I&#39;m sedated but not stoned, exactly... Don&#39;t ask me to &quot;think fast&quot; because if you toss something at me I&#39;m just gonna watch it hit me, lmao. I think my body is taking a nap without me. My arms feel 15 lbs heavier! But I gotta say, ALL of my spine pain (I&#39;m held together by screws and rods) and resultant nerve pain in my leg is gone. Super potent medicine. \u000a\u000aJust don&#39;t underestimate this strain. It packs a wallop of a punch.\u000a\u000aOh and it tastes like chai steeped in earth and pine. Very smooth smoke; I&#39;d like to vape it.

Picked up in Salem Oregon.First ran across this strain in Arizona never gave her a chance.\u000aPlease give this strain a chance for  severe pain relief anxiety or sleep.Hard hitter.99 Tora great hybrid taste of Pine, white wine, berry and spice. Smell spicy, pine, blue cheese and woody earthy.Budz compact two toned bora was green with hints of orange . Effects of a couch lock with hint of clear ness. Felt like purple kush with enough cerebral for relaxing in bed enjoying listening to rain outside.

VHigh CBD 12%, THC 6.8% strain provided a nice body buzz after a couple hits, while  remaining clear headed. Nice mix with ACDC as well for Anxiety relief. I can&#39;t take the Sativa strain as it races my heart. This Indica actually lowered by B/P and heart rate thus eliminating any paranoia and/or anxiety. Hope it stays in stock for it really has helped me manage my PTSD.

VI just picked up a e-cigarette while in Denver for 4:20 Tora Bora with extract in it. After about 5 puffs it seems to help with my knee pain. I wish I would have bought some flowers so I could try that, but we were afraid to bring it on the plane home and I didn&#39;t want to get busted at the airport so I settled for an e-cigarette full of extract. Just so everybody knows extracts and edibles we&#39;re actually overlooked when they did our luggage inspection Kama they were more worried about peanut butter and food in the luggage. So remember it&#39;s safe to bring home anything except weed in the flower state. They searched us harder when we left Orlando then they did when we were coming back. 420 was cancelled due to snow in the city wouldn&#39;t cut a permit so we just had to set and our rental house and smoke 38 different brands of marijuana from 5 different dispensaries. That was an experience I&#39;ll never forget. Five different types of weed being passed around buy for people. My lungs still sting from all the smoke LOL

VNote: Review for Tora Bora Bear by Doc Croc. This strain is 10.5% THC and 13.6% CBD. It&#39;s an excellent nighttime bud for pain relief and heavy body effects. Very dank tasting. My favorite high-CBD strain thus far.

VI really enjoy this strain, especially at bedtime or whenever I can really chill. Relaxes my muscles so much that I have had a few muscle spasms right after I smoked it as it takes effect on the cannabinoid HIGHway so to speak lol... Within minutes though I feel relaxed, mellowed, and almost zoned sometimes. Awesome strain for before or after a massage appointment and when I&#39;m having sleep issues I try this one if I can find it. I don&#39;t know about nausea because I usually only have it in the morning with my meds and I don&#39;t like smoking/vaping this one in the morning because I just end up going back to bed and being lazy all day. The other thing I like is that I can blast one bowl and I&#39;m good, that&#39;s a nice quality strain for a long timer like me. Gets me in all the right places and saves me money! Usually I have to smoke a few of something to get the same effects. Mediocre on my asthma, I did cough but not as bad as some strains- a benefit of its relaxing qualities on the bronchial system. In general this is a good medicinal strain and if you see it and you have muscle, sleep, tension, stress, neurologic, ADHD or PTSD this one is worth trying out seriously. Peace y&#39;all I&#39;m off to cut some ZZzzz&#39;s now ;)

VHoly moly, y&#39;all. This one changed everything I thought I knew about CBD indicas. Picked up an eighth at CBD 6.8% THC 5.6%. No big deal, I thought. It&#39;ll help with my pain a little, I thought. No head high with those percentages and that ratio, I thought. WRONG. Within 2 minutes of perhaps toking a little too much of this stuff I was in awe. You should see my heavy-as-lead noodle arms trying write this review out. It&#39;s ridiculous. If someone tossed My keys at me I&#39;d react far too slowly to catch them. My lower ribcage is heavy like my torso decided to take a nap without me. It&#39;s pretty funny. I&#39;m sedated but not overtly sleepy. But guess what guys... my spine pain (I&#39;m basically held together with screws and rods) and resultant nerve pain in my legs are gone. It didn&#39;t just take the edge off... I just don&#39;t feel anything lmao. *Extremely* potent medicine.

VTora Bora is my all time favorite Indica. The batches I have purchased were also high in CBD and there was no anxiety or paranoia at all. The high is euphoric and spacey but will not necessarily put you to bed right away. When sleep does come you will wake up more refreshed than you ever have ever been. I do not know why this particular strain affected me so positively but it is like my entire body was reset for the better. Tora Bora destroys inflammation. I worked in Alaska for three months and when I came home I literally had to pry my fingers open in the morning with considerable pain. After one use of Tora Bora it all went away and I have not had a problem since. As an added bonus, this is one Indica that did not make my tinnitus worse. I just wish that it was more widely available. I should also add that this is probably the most tingly strain of all too.

Great strain for pain, anxiety, and insomnia - not so great for flavor.

V&#128073;This is a very very nice buzz!  It got me out of my previous mood very nicely.  It had the very nice open bag effect I look for but more on the leafy greener side. Its very nice to find out I finally got to smoke some Afghani and its killer with major giggles.&#128299;&#128299;&#128299;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128154;&#128551;\u270c

VThis one is nice, not too heady or super cerebral, pretty mild overall but the body effects are quite nice.  We&#39;ve had some bad weather come through, so my joints have been aching more and this flower helped to calm all that down.  This strain knocks down some pain like no one&#39;s business. The taste isn&#39;t anything spectacular, but my particular batch was well grown and cured.

VFairly unremarkable. This strain is NOT the sought after Indica. It has a profile of about 16% THC to 10% CBDa. The taste, however, was a surprise...the first thing that came to mind was: hmmm, tastes like a hot dog (yes, the food). The second thing that came to mind was: Summer Fair. So, a couple of puffs were unremarkable for body or mind, but taste buds got a shocker! Buds From: 4/16, bluish undertone, sage green cover, average red hairs &amp; crystals.

VThis was the very first strain of weed I bought. It was recommended to me when I explained that I wanted something that would slow my racing thoughts I get from my severe OCD. Boy, did it ever get the job done.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m a lightweight, so a little dab&#39;ll do ya, but it&#39;s very overtly indica. Even if I smoke more than I should, it doesn&#39;t get cerebral for me. It just slows down the world and helps me catch up. It also puts me to sleep if I do it at bedtime. And last, but not least, it helps eliminate my chronic back pain from a torn muscle that healed poorly. Perfect starter weed for someone with my medical needs.

I&#39;m still able to produce while still being heavily medicated. Will come back to this again for sure. Crushes pain, promotes relaxation but not too much relaxation.

VThis is a pure Indica with a CBD:THC ratio of 1:1.4\u000a\u000aThis is excellent medicine for anxiety and calming mania associated with Bipolar disorder.  I don&#39;t think it is possible to become anxious or paranoid smoking this strain.  Also a GREAT medicine for insomnia (which I have).  Most CBD buds are Sativa, so if you have never tried a CBD Indica this is an excellent bud to start.  TB is an official part of my medical regiment.
