VDamn! Sticky flowers have a sweet, fruity, herbal aroma. Taste when vaping is like raw sugar and leaves, with fruity and dank herbal notes. Strong buzzy high, with moderate body stone.  Probably closer to a 4.5 out of 5

VOne of my favorites. Definitely potent and relaxes your body immediately after your first hit. Though, not the best to smoke before class; at least for me. I became very fatigued as it wore off, more so than with other strains. A great intense and happy high!

VWell rounded. Comes with an intense high that last a long time if grown right. Smell is awesome. Plant likes the lights a little bit farther away than most. I was displeased by how fluffy the buds were but I suppose that could be in result of the way I grow. All considering it\u2019s an awesome straight, covers I crystals, and packs a punch.

VThis strain is definitely a very smooth and long lasting effect.\u000aIt has a very strong aroma before you even open the bag you know its going to be good. Mood elevating and enhances social \u000ainteraction in addition to strong good pain relief. Top notch for sure.

VThis strain is impossible to find, but I have a shop that sells it as a co2 concentrate, and from that... Well, it&#39;s honestly amazing. It relieves me of my stress 100% after work as well as helping me sleep without that heavy indica feeling the next day. I strongly recommend this for anyone who loves a great saliva.
