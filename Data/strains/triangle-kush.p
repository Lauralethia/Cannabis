VTasty is the first thing I have to say. Terpy Sauce to the face and right away my body relaxes. My PTSD gives me horrible mental and physical anxiety and those were both taken down a lot. The physical relaxation is a bit heavier than the mental relaxation this is a wonderful all around strain. Don\u2019t use to much or you will be tired but besides that it\u2019s truly a gift.

VThis is some damn fine wine. It smells like sweet earth with notes of diesel and tropical fruit. The taste is slightly sour and very earthy. These are some plump, dense kush-looking nugs with tinges of purple. The high is relaxed but pronounced and focused. This stuff doesn&#39;t bring any of the anxiety that some of the sativa&#39;s have but has almost just as much euphoria. The body buzz is strong but relaxed. I think that&#39;s a good way to characterize this high: strong but not too strong. I&#39;ll be coming back to this one.

VThis strain was a very pleasant surprise for me as for whatever reason I wasn&#39;t expecting to enjoy it so much. The week that I was using this strain consistently, I was also mixing it with some Orange Cream ... made for a perfect blend with the earthy/pine of the Triangle and the citrus kick of the OC.  Effects-wise it was also a perfect blend, relaxing stimulation from the Triangle and anti-anxiety/nausea from the OC.  The Triangle on its own is worth it, though, whether you mix it with anything or not. \u000a\u000aAlso a very, very pleasant strain for any time of the day, and usually I&#39;m pretty particular about when I smoke which strain.

Pretty harsh, skunky, and if you&#39;re not choking already , its got a sweet taste on the exhale. Within 5 minutes i could notice a heavy head buzz setting in,  followed by a nice relaxing full body high. It made me very focused and talkative. overall i loved this strain

VTriangle Kush by Canna Organix out of Washington state Listed as a indica dominate hybrid. I had this in a clear concentrate that is injected on to the dab tool. THC is listed at 54% with an amazing CBG of 20% mind blowingly awesome.\u000a\u000aEffect wise this is in my top three all time favorites not from the initial high, but for the effects that I experienced for three days afterwards. The initial high a clear focused energetic high which was interesting since this is listed as an indica dominate hybrid. I attribute this focused energy effect to the VERY high CBG number. \u000a\u000aThe lasting effects were for three days afterwards I was happy energetic motivated very present and articulate and was engaged when dealing with a task or a conversation with a patient. Virility for men and women was also a interesting factor that I thought was very interesting and enjoyable. \u000a\u000aI have had customers who in wheel chairs that have tried it and it helped with the spasticity also reports of it helping greatly with migraines and depression for days after the intial ingestion. This is the largest direct medical benefit I have seen from a strain less high CBD for inflammation.\u000a\u000ataste was sweet and earthy.\u000a\u000aThere is a lot of research that needs to be done on this stem cell of cannabinoids as it is the precursor to all other cannabinoids in the marijuana plant and ingested in large doses it seems to have a targeted effect on the user that is unique for each with a base of very good benefits that I listed above. This is from the high CBG not just the triangle kush as a strain.\u000a\u000aLove this stuff highly recommend and if you are a medical person research this.

VWhat&#39;s amazing about this strain is that the high just keeps building. I can def tell you that the Oleum dab version of this bud is the greatest I&#39;ve ever had.

VOkay I was skeptical when I saw the first effect was euphoric. I haven&#39;t had a strain that has given me that first stoned feeling since my high school daze. But this stuff right here is amazing ! It is on my top ten for 2015.

VVERY, very nice indica. Every nug looks like they&#39;re rolled in sugary trichomes. Definitely didn&#39;t even want to lay my hands on it without chopsticks. Was the first strain recommended to me in less than 30 seconds inside Natty Rems. If you&#39;re looking for that strong, nice relaxed high but still need to get shit done.. this is just perfect.

VThe &quot;Triangles&quot; I&#39;m finding lately in Colorado stores are NOTHING like Florida Crippy.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m guessing that Triangle Kush is the baby of brick weed and Kush but that&#39;s about it...for me to believe that this is the best that underground Florida growers can produce is hilarious.\u000a\u000aCrip is skunky, spongy, and relaxing.\u000a\u000aThis 2015 Triangle isn&#39;t spongy, skunky, or a relaxing stone. \u000aIt&#39;s stringy, peppery, tiny buds that produce an ash taste in the back of your throat, the high is that of a misguided Sativa. It provides neither the muscle relaxation of a descent Indica/Hybrid nor the Magical Mystery Tour Effect of true Florida Hydro.\u000a\u000aIf your goal is to find that 2003 crop of Crip we still talk about in 2015 I&#39;d recommend a Indica/Dominant isn&#39;t better suited as rope. \u000a
