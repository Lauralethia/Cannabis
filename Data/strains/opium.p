VGood stuff, pretty strong as well.  More on the energizing rather than couch lock side of the strain for me but my elderly parents use it in cookies for better sleep.  A big dose is quite psychoactive and will mess with your head but I&#39;m not Mr. PotNerd to tell you how it compares with other strains, it&#39;s certainly plenty functional enough for shamanic explorations.  The pain relief was excellent for my buddy with steel pins in his reconstructed wrist and arm during the winter freezing cold temperatures.  My Mom (lifelong gardener, no marijuana specific plant growing knowledge) grew this last year and got a big pickle jar (1 gallon size?) full of bud from 4 plants just by starting with good soil and adding compost tea once a week.  The neighbor, who did know how to tend them, got a LOT more bud from the same set of clones and his buddy claimed a 23&#39; plant with a huge harvest off his, feeding his opi-strain plant manure tea, though I did not see that myself.   So our neck of the woods was happy with plenty of  pot to get through the winter with.  I would grow it again but this year am doing other varieties just to get a sense for what different strains have to offer.
