VDJ Short did a good job with this one!  A mellow indica, with an overall euphoric relaxing high.  Long lasting, without the crash and burn that some stronger indicas have.  Super tastiness - if only real blue berries smelled this dank!

VEuphoria without paranoia. Real blueberry smell and taste. Blue and red colored buds. Maybe luck, or maybe the years of testing and breeding DJ Short carried out. Toked many strains, this is still my favorite. I use Flo for a clear(er) day. Similar genetics. Also bred by DJ Short.

VMigraine pain 5; nausea 8 when I medicated round 2230 or so. Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. No anxiety/paranoia (an absolute for me). Body high eased me into a peaceful sleep. Not too heavy hitting; dint immediately pass out which was nice. :-) Head high, well, I think I just said it. I was pretty damn stoned but not @ all overwhelming. Tastes sweet like blueberries. Highly recommend for nighttime use for pain/nausea/insomnia. Check this strain out; did not disappoint! :-)

VAt around 9:00 pm I took a half-bowl rip of this fruity strain. A few minutes after inhalation, I began feeling very relaxed. It felt like I was the worlds softest, most relaxed cat being held in the arms of an even softer cat. Shortly after drifting through this comfortable high, I went down stairs and melted into the blankets of my bed. I slept beautifully. Thank you, Dsb.

VA creeper indeed!\u000aFor the first part, it makes you wonder why it&#39;s listed as an Indica, not much of a body high sets in, your eyes and head feel lightly buzzed and shoulders begin to drop, relax...\u000abut then it hits ya!\u000aDefiantly a strain that you could smoke as you finish doing something physically draining/exhausting.\u000aGives you a good 5-10 minutes to finish up and relax/enjoy the the next couple hours!\u000aSmell is more musty, skunky, pungent.. then it is fruity, or citrusy, or even that of blueberry. \u000aHigh is comparable to a deeper Blue Dream, less head buzz.

VThis mostly Indica plant grows really fast. It is quick to finish, 6-7 weeks. Easy to manicure. Great for SOG. Dense, compact buds. Close internodal spacing. This strain has a nice berry and spice flavor and aroma. It really hits hard behind the eyes. The pressure gets so intense, I have to go to sleep to relieve it. I use it mostly for PMS and as a night time smoke.

V4.5/5. Picked up a nice bag of Blueberry pancakes which is a select pheno of Dj short&#39;s BB, grown by Fire Bros and let me say the name did not mislead. Other than absolute primo bag appeal with crystals on top of crystals, it smelled straight up like blueberry pancakes. With an overwhelming pungent sweetness of blueberries, followed by a mild aroma that I can only attribute to cooking batter. (I know that sounds weird but believe me you just got to smell it for yourself) the high was more balanced as a sativa, my mind was awake and my body chillin&#39; but as I moved on to bowl 2 and up I found myself heavily sedated and almost slumped, took an early nap with this one so don&#39;t overdue it lol. The only reason I didn&#39;t give this a five was because the taste of the burn was a little misleading compared to the smell, a hint of the BB was on the back of my tongue while the rest of it was overpowered by The taste of pure, potent, somewhat harsh, dank. Still really enjoyed it though, and to this day this is the only flower I&#39;ve had that smelled anything like blueberry pancakes, and that is the one thing I go for in my flower is uniqueness and rarity so in that case I would consider this a definite score. And would recommend picking it up if you can find any.

VGrowing up on the best coast; we here in Oregon have always had the best flower available. That&#39;s even when compared to all  the variety &amp; quality that medical &amp; recreational sales &amp; testing have brought! I remember when I was in high school getting batches of clone only Blueberry that were taken off DJ&#39;s own mother plant. It was a beautiful lime green, crystal-coated, dense flower that smelled &amp; tasted just like fresh berries. The buds were so packed with tricomes, that you&#39;d have to struggle to get the darn things off of your fingers when loading the pipe! The high is exactly what I look for when smoking flower, it just seems to slow everything down in my head. I suffer from ADD, not ADHD, so my mind never shuts down &amp; is over-clocked to the extreme. It makes me lose focus &amp; patience with people &amp; tasks. DJ&#39;s Blueberry would slow down my thoughts, but not in a stupefying sense, it&#39;s more like someone just turned down the gain on my brain&#39;s preamp. It also comes with euphoria that&#39;s akin to sitting in your favorite chair, with a warm beverage, next to a cracking fire, all on a cold &amp; stormy day! If you ever have the opportunity to get DJ Short&#39;s Blueberry... Don&#39;t hesitate, buy it, and buy as much as you can, you&#39;ll never find a better indica, period!

VGenerally, DSB is so relaxing on the body aches, muscle cramps and relaxing on the mind. I use it for deep Couch City and deep sleep follows. Yesterday I got a wild hair and decided to puff around 9am. The typical attributes were there especially the full body melt I admire. I will say that the morning session lended some highly noticeable yet subtle effects. For one I definitely noticed more of the Thai influences which feel very serene,calm, almost trance like.  I happened to be in Safeway at the time and the background music which was not at high volume seemed to be speaking to me...I could hear a baby crying atleast 5 aisles over, and I even heard another woman have a sneeze attack somewhere in the store. So the Thai had my senses razor sharp. I felt like I was limitless it was a unique experience  all while waiting for coffee..The music on the car ride home was crystal clear I&#39;m talking studio quality. I also noticed the snow covered mountains to the east and how scenic the Mt Baker view to the North really are...almost a spiritual feeling...Then I arrived home feeling awesome turned on the tube and proceeded to be totally content with a Golf and Basketball back and forth for the next 3 hours relaxed to the max to the point of napping so I then took a puff of Double Dream to revitalize

VGenerally, DSB is so relaxing on the body aches, muscle cramps and relaxing on the mind. I use it for deep Couch City and deep sleep follows. Yesterday I got a wild hair and decided to puff around 9am. The typical attributes were there especially the full body melt I admire. I will say that the morning session lended some highly noticeable yet subtle effects. For one I definitely noticed more of the Thai influences which feel very serene,calm, almost trance like.  I happened to be in Safeway at the time and the background music which was not at high volume seemed to be speaking to me...I could hear a baby crying atleast 5 aisles over, and I even heard another woman have a sneeze attack somewhere in the store. So the Thai had my senses razor sharp. I felt like I was limitless it was a unique experience  all while waiting for coffee..The music on the car ride home was crystal clear I&#39;m talking studio quality. I also noticed the snow covered mountains to the east and how scenic the Mt Baker view to the North really are...almost a spiritual feeling...Then I arrived home feeling awesome turned on the tube and proceeded to be totally content with a Golf and Basketball back and forth for the next 3 hours relaxed to the max to the point of napping so I then took a puff of Double Dream to revitalize

V4.5/5. Picked up a nice bag of Blueberry pancakes which is a select pheno of Dj short&#39;s BB, grown by Fire Bros and let me say the name did not mislead. Other than absolute primo bag appeal with crystals on top of crystals, it smelled straight up like blueberry pancakes. With an overwhelming pungent sweetness of blueberries, followed by a mild aroma that I can only attribute to cooking batter. (I know that sounds weird but believe me you just got to smell it for yourself) the high was more balanced as a sativa, my mind was awake and my body chillin&#39; but as I moved on to bowl 2 and up I found myself heavily sedated and almost slumped, took an early nap with this one so don&#39;t overdue it lol. The only reason I didn&#39;t give this a five was because the taste of the burn was a little misleading compared to the smell, a hint of the BB was on the back of my tongue while the rest of it was overpowered by The taste of pure, potent, somewhat harsh, dank. Still really enjoyed it though, and to this day this is the only flower I&#39;ve had that smelled anything like blueberry pancakes, and that is the one thing I go for in my flower is uniqueness and rarity so in that case I would consider this a definite score. And would recommend picking it up if you can find any.

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings -- Brand: Dama Strain: DJ Short Blueberry Indica-dominant Hybrid -- Potency Analysis: TTL 20% THC 1% CBD 0% THCA 19% -- Cost: $15/gram -- It has a real fruity kind of pot smell and very delicious. The crystals are deep, all over. -- The smoke is big and bold, with serious blueberry flavor. On the inhale, exhale, aftertaste, all were heavy with those blueberry, bright fruit flavors. It was pretty dense, and kind of a moist smoke which I really liked. At the end, the joint I smoked of this was just resiny beyond belief. -- The feel is definitely indica. While I had a bit of happy uplift, mostly this had body-effects like a deep indica. Lots of stupid mental fogginess and body relaxation. I was stuck in the chair and couldn&#39;t get up to go do much of anything, and pretty much everything but watching a movie was beyond my capabilities.

VDJ Short Blueberry from Dama has become a staple for me - especially as a night cap - and it puts me to sleep every time. Its a beautiful thing how well it works! Tastes like blueberrys and at 26% THC, it packs a subtle punch. If you are looking for an energetic high, this will disappoint. Get it if you want a solid Indica with a great flavor and super chill effects.

VThe Look: These Buds look like pale mint green moon rocks they are so dank! Very much like a a really washed out white sandy color I have never seen something so white before very interesting.\u000aThe Structure: It has a nice domed rounded top to the calyxes, these rocket nugs are fat a little curled over like being hunched over if it were to sit-up straight, very few hairs but loaded with Terpene crystals!\u000aThe Smell: Very distinct Eucalyptus, and not much of a berry smell, and no what so ever of any diesel, just fresh intense eucalyptus which is pleasent.\u000aThe Taste: Very floral and a hint of that blueberry you can absolutely taste it like a hint of the flavored waters;... its there, which is really crazy to capture just such specific flavor, Buds have come close, however this flavor is vanilla kush and that&#39;s where the line ends.\u000aThe Effect: If you need to just hit the couch and melt this is a great melting relaxer. I notice for my self I am able to keep on task, not to mention my shoulder pain is gone, I noticed my sweat doesn&#39;t hurt, and its helping me relax those racing thoughts. Great For Depression, Insomnia, ADHD, Stress, Tinnitus, Glaucoma, and overall total mental relaxation its a heavy strain. High Recommended for those that need a really intense reliever, if you are not used to cold sweats be cautious this is a heavy one!!

VThe most identifying trait to this strain is the fruity-sour smell that it carries.  Sweetness fills the air, and sweetness fills your lungs as you inhale the smooth smoke.  If grown right, this strain will blow you away in a relaxing, euphoric getaway.   Perfect for smoking from morning till night, as the high THC content will not knock you out, but will have you feeling as if you are floating on air.

VWow!  Picked an 1/8th of this up at Oasis Cannabis Superstore on sale for $25.  Great deal...great smoke.  The bag appeal wasn&#39;t anything to brag about when I looked it over.  The buds were on the smallish side and not very dense or colorful for that matter.  The aroma was a different matter though and that is the main reason I ended up purchasing some.  To be honest I wasn&#39;t expecting a lot but found it hard to pass it up.  I rolled a half-gram J for the wife and I and we both remarked on the smooth, sweet taste.  Not really blueberry tasting but a bit on the sweet side.  The high was damn-near instantaneous and rolled us for a good two hours.  It was an extremely incredible  body high that had us both grinning from ear to ear.  Very glad I grabbed this and look forward to enjoying the rest of the 1/8th.

VERY expensive ($320 American/10 seeds).\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the original feminized generation wasn&#39;t genetically stable. I read in several magazines about others having similar issues. However, I was still able to grow three plants out. \u000a\u000aBlueish-green in color, and very frosty, with super-dense hard colas. Probably the most narcotic high I&#39;ve ever experienced from just smoking bud. Very sweet, berry-like smell. Short plants, with a Christmas tree appearance. Delicious.

VDJ Short Blueberry makes me happy and puts a smile on my face. My body has pleasant tingling sensations and feels warm (not in the temperature sense). I like to dance, but have to stop as it messes with my balance a little. I easily laugh at jokes I\u2019ve heard before.\u000a\u000aWhen I play games, it makes it more vivid: looking at Skyrim\u2019s environment is so enjoyable. However I played horror games, which was just a terrible idea, and I nearly fell out of my chair at the sudden screaming. \u000a\u000aThis gives me a case of the munchies, along with dry eyes. I also had a tendency to just stare at nothing and zone out.

VThis is one of the strains I ever smoked. The smell is so sweet and fruity. The buds are soild and sticky. When you break open the bud the strong aroma of blueberry just makes your mouth water. It only takes about two or three hits and your good and it taste just like it smells. The effects will hit you almost instantly and leave you in a stuck state.   Preferably a nighttime or weekend chill type of weed.

Let me relax and unwind. was able to sleep sound after hours after medicating. Really enjoyed the blueberry taste along with the sweet skunk as well. Makes for a perfect marriage in this awesome hybrid DJ Short blueberry. The buds look so fine I.m finding it hard to use. Hate breaking them up. This is an art in the care of growing, the timing, lighting, manicuring, plus with Einstein pride in their products and taking care of the patients.\u000a\u000aThx R&amp;C you knocked it out of the park with this DJ Short Blueberry......\u000aGet feeling better Ms. C cya soon.....\u000a

Bringing in the vapor the berry flavor is very noticeable. like the smell of a berry patch in late spring. Taking just a small amount the effects started to take affect. Did not lose to much mental focus but it was noticeable. Body just felt like it was floating everywhere I went. On the way down hunger is noticeable but not horrible. Great strand.

VWow!  Picked an 1/8th of this up at Oasis Cannabis Superstore on sale for $25.  Great deal...great smoke.  The bag appeal wasn&#39;t anything to brag about when I looked it over.  The buds were on the smallish side and not very dense or colorful for that matter.  The aroma was a different matter though and that is the main reason I ended up purchasing some.  To be honest I wasn&#39;t expecting a lot but found it hard to pass it up.  I rolled a half-gram J for the wife and I and we both remarked on the smooth, sweet taste.  Not really blueberry tasting but a bit on the sweet side.  The high was damn-near instantaneous and rolled us for a good two hours.  It was an extremely incredible  body high that had us both grinning from ear to ear.  Very glad I grabbed this and look forward to enjoying the rest of the 1/8th.

VBought one huge bud gram and smoked half about three hours before bed.  The wonderful blueberry smell did transfer, even if slightly, to the smoke flavor.  The body high was great and had me with that &quot;tingly&quot; feeling that good indica strains do. After the two hour high I slept like a baby and woke up feeling great and ready to rock and roll.

VHey guys, I gotta say, this strain is special, just as the description said. I was fortunate to recieve a clone last spring, and man, was it an experience. The plant will teach you so many skills, and is incredibly versatile when it comes to stress training. However, the smoke, is what is shredder. Terpenes from flower unparalleled in nature, with a sweet, tropical, blueberry esque aroma. The high is as lit as the flavors, sedating but not too much, and headie for an indica strain. I would definitely grow this again, and reccomend both new and veteran growers/stoners get their hands on it. Do not sleep.

VFresh and fragrant, this flower leaves a subtle fruitiness taste. I would recommend using small snappers in a bong, as the buds are tight, the flavor looses it&#39;s potency in a pipe. Overall a good time to be had. I would also recommend watching an old cartoon or playing an old NES game, the high is nostalgic.

VI&#39;m in love with DJ Short&#39;s Blueberry. It&#39;s the original rendition of the &quot;blueberry&quot; strain and of course; the best. There are few strains which I think actually live up to their hype, and this is one that does that and much more; parenting an endless line of Blueberry crosses with its strong genetic material as their backbones.

VFirst review, so here it goes. Picked up an 1/8 from Rocky Road Remedies in Vail. Buds were small pale green and smelled strongly of fruity pebbles. Lit it up in the bowl and blueberry was the dominant note. Also pine, sage, and vanilla. Slight harshness in the back of the throat on large hits. The high is body relaxing, but almost a bit of a cerebral high as well. This def wasn&#39;t a couch melder. But it sure did make the couch quite comfy. Helped with pain a little, but really helped with anxiety and ADHD. Had a little dizziness about an hour in, but could be altitude. Headache as well. So far, one of my favorite strains. Love that sweet blueberry taste and it&#39;s an Indica I can smoke during the day when I need to focus, not sleep

VThe taste is amazing, and the high feels wonderful!  The bowl I&#39;m smoking out of looks like a dew-covered sub-tropical forest in bloom, the rising sun glinting off of a waterfall.  The longer I stare into it, the more I feel like I&#39;m sitting there on the edge of the water.  The first rays of the sun carress my skin, hitting the dew on the plants and setting them aglitter with gold.  It&#39;s a very warm and relaxing weed.  My back popped a few times as my muscles relax, and it feels just heavenly.  This has always been one of my favoeite strains.  Powerful and delicious!

VI may up this rating but overall I give it a 3.5, at least the Dama grown stuff I picked up today (I really don&#39;t like their blister-wrap packaging by the way) - it was rather fluffy overall for this price. The Blueberry aroma was really, really muted - not what I remember the &quot;true&quot; Blueberry to be at all. I was expecting a lot, given the reason this strain exists, because the old Blueberry *was* &quot;a lot&quot; - a lot of every kind of awesome. Perhaps the Dama-grow pheno didn&#39;t bring it out as it should. I&quot;ll try another grower. Any other flower name and I&#39;d rate this a tick higher - because it&#39;s really good weed - a nice level indica that is smooth and light enough not to just relegate you to napping, but with all the hype around it I was a bit let down. Still remember my first 3 bags of Blueberry in 90s - this ain&#39;t that.

VI sampled DJ Short&#39;s Blueberry by The Highpoint Reserve.  Testing at 24% THC-A, Sold at Commencement Bay Cannabis. I bought a  Single gram to try, and instantly went back for the 3.5g for $28. This stuff smell just like blueberries, more than any other single weed I have smoked. On the exhale it tastes just like blueberry pancakes. It provides a nice relaxing high. It&#39;s a very functional Indica.

VDJ Short Blueberry makes me happy and puts a smile on my face. My body has pleasant tingling sensations and feels warm (not in the temperature sense). I like to dance, but have to stop as it messes with my balance a little. I easily laugh at jokes I\u2019ve heard before.\u000a\u000aWhen I play games, it makes it more vivid: looking at Skyrim\u2019s environment is so enjoyable. However I played horror games, which was just a terrible idea, and I nearly fell out of my chair at the sudden screaming. \u000a\u000aThis gives me a case of the munchies, along with dry eyes. I also had a tendency to just stare at nothing and zone out.

VIn 2002 I brought the first generation of DJ Short feminized seeds back from Amsterdam, purchased from Paradise Seed Co. VERY expensive ($320 American/10 seeds).\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the original feminized generation wasn&#39;t genetically stable. I read in several magazines about others having similar issues. However, I was still able to grow three plants out. \u000a\u000aBlueish-green in color, and very frosty, with super-dense hard colas. Probably the most narcotic high I&#39;ve ever experienced from just smoking bud. Very sweet, berry-like smell. Short plants, with a Christmas tree appearance. Delicious.

VThis was a good &quot;put you to bed&quot; strain.  Doesn&#39;t &#39;put&#39; you to sleep, but you just want to get comfortable, lay in bed, cuddle up with lots of blankets, and watch tv in bed then pass out later.  I don&#39;t remember this helping me with any type of pain.  It did put a cold sensation in my entire body though, like I felt cold inside.  I had 1/2 a bowl and it tasted like sweet pine, a little chemical taste, but other than that it was sweet.  I didn&#39;t taste berries or fruit, it was more like just sweet, pine, and honey with a pungent, chemical aftertaste.  This was a &quot;low shelf&quot; item where I got it from and it was still really good.  If I try a higher quality, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d give it 5 stars.... but my point is, it&#39;s just a great strain for sleep, even at bottom shelf status.

It was a concentrate an advertised between 75 + 85% THC. The flavor was blueberry like almost too much blueberry for me, I like a little gas in mine. This tasted like some super blueberry from outer space that left me melted to my couch in the best way possible.
