VCritical Kush Created by the team at Barney&#39;s Farm.\u000a\u000aAn unusual blend of fine genetics. Critical Kush is a blending of  the famous Critical Mass with OG Kush. This is a powerful and extremely vigourous indica plant, yielding huge amounts of beautiful stoney  kush. Flowers in just 8 weeks indoors, and grows medium height with great flower-to-leaf ratio. Take pleasure in it&#39;s sticky feel, aromatic sent, crystal-covered buds and knockout-stoney high. The kush taste is unmistakable, and the yield per plant phenomenal. This new hybrid  is a significant advance in modern marijuana breeding. It&#39;s Indica-dominant nature makes it ideal for  relaxation, pain relief, and late night smoking.

VAn amazing way to end a stressful day or week. CK has a beautiful, calming and all over body stone that also provides a positive vibe in the head. The THC hits like a freight train when it comes, its very potent. I have a &quot;1 cone-I&#39;m stoned&quot; tolerance, bug if I really want to get baked I will smoke two. However with CK I only need to be absolutely medicated for hours. She hangs around for a while . A good 3 hours. \u000a\u000aThe come down is one of the most perfect come down strains I&#39;ve had. She just fades away slowly and returns you to a really relaxed state. Sometimes , with a few strains, I&#39;ll feel a slight &quot;hangover&quot; when I exit the high, but CK is almost seamless from the &#39;high mood&#39; to the &#39;real world&#39;.

VThis is the strain I chose for making cannabis oil and for vaporizing for my cancer treatments. The first time I vaporized some of the nuggs, last thing I remember was going for a drink of water after turning on Netflix.   Woke up the next morning with cotton mouth, but it was thebest sleep I&#39;ve had in years. My cannabis oil extraction was done with 200 proof grain alcohol in a Green Oil Machine and I used 1 pound of bud material; from this I obtained 100+ grams of oil. I decarboxylated the oil at 250 degrees for 30 minutes. My first dose of oil (size of a grain of rice) knocked me out for 12 hours. I&#39;m still alive, kicking and cancer-free thanks to Barney&#39;s Critical Kush!\u000a

VTHC % really has nothing to do with  anything. Cannabinoids and Terpene profile work together with THC and CBD to give each individual a unique experience. Everyone is wired differently genetically speaking so a strain that is perfect for person A could be far from perfect for person B. Indica dominant genetics can express sativa traits and vice versa barring how long each flower was alive before harvest. GeeshBros WA are expert non recreational cannabis enthusiasts for over 15 years..just an opinion from a quality control producer\u000a

VCame across a very strong and beautifully grown example in Queensland, Australia that completely floored me with just one cone. Complete mind and body stone that didn&#39;t lift for over 3hrs, and left me feeling like I had just had a long, slow massage. My wife uses medicinally and voted it her favourite strain so far in 2015, she can smoke quite a bit and even she said it was a heavy hitter. 5/5 Stars.\u000a

Had a great time riding around the country side while smoking this extremely earthy strain. There&#39;s no better way to explain the taste than...dirt. It tasted that earthy. This is in no way a complaint. Very connected to my surroundings and blissed out as a maf.

VFirst noticeable in the head like something\u2019s wrapped tightly around your brain. Like the come on of a good alcohol buzz. Slightly stupefying, but confidence boosted, physically enticed, and feeling clear, cool and professional. Contrasting that perceptive clarity, there remains a fuzziness in the brain, like a blanket wrapped around your head. Vision is incredible. Pretty narrow focus, but everything - the lighting, colors, movement, and mood all induce a kind of squirmy, physically pleasurable response. It\u2019s like a switch turning on your creative juices. It\u2019s best at making it easy to see the beauty in things. Music is silky smooth and similarly feel good. Easy to move to, good for dancing. Geez, like everything physical about this strain is both relaxing and stimulating. Sexy time is downright breathtaking - some of the best you can get. Maybe some weightiness in the eyes and medium couch lock, but the positive attributes outnumber. 8/10.

VFull body relaxer, but doesn&#39;t hurt my head at all, just relaxing all my muscles after a super hard day of working on my feet all day no breaks! Dank bulbous nugs that are bushy like, full spectrum green with rich orange hairs that foxtail at the top. Heavy sweet smell reminds me of aca&#237; berries. Wood and musky taste when I inhale this thick vape, bring water its a dry one! I recommend this for joint pain, muscle pain, sore legs arms, and core, great for headaches and focus issues. Its a euphoric happy kind of numbing in just the right areas. I use critical kush when I still need to work after a double shift, I look forward to the work at home because critical kush makes me feel that good. There are brighter lights the more medicated you get, though great vibes for this one. If you suffer from spinal chord injury, ADHD, Insomnia, Anorexia, fatigue as it does give you motivational energy that if you don&#39;t think you are tired you&#39;re not, positive psychology. If you also have asthma its a great strain to take make sure it looks bluish purple to get more cbg! Love this strain this medium heavy strain!

I have pretty bad anxiety and this really gets me to relax and connect with people in large social situations.  It also gets my positive vibe going, which really makes ordinarily annoying things like grocery shopping in crowded places a joy.  It&#39;s hard to explain, but the positive vibes that radiate from me spill over into others and create a great overall experience.  Try it out!

VI have this stain mixed with Blackberry and take a few hits at night before bed (the family hangs all day,  then each do our own thing in the evening). As my quiet time it definately feels like a real treat to myself at the end of the day. After trying this stain, I&#39;ve changed my outlook on indica. Other indica had intensified my depression that I&#39;m working to ease. But after a convincing referral ended with a sample (who could say no then?) I&#39;ll be looking for this in the future. Sativa can sometimes get me too euphoric then feel worse when it wears off, yet my new evening mix gives me the uplifted, joyfullness at a much more mellow level. The perfect balance!

VOne of my favourites yet. When I first got it the smell was what hit me I couldn&#39;t wait to try home and try it, a very strong nice smell. When you smoke it it is really smooth I haven&#39;t choked hard on it other than the little tickle you are supposed to get with good weed. I have diagnosed anxiety, it takes the anxiety away for me all together. I&#39;ve been going out doing a lot this week and haven&#39;t had an attack once. I wish I could get it medically where I live.

VI reviewed this strain a few weeks ago and now I\u2019m almost out. I\u2019ve had more time with it these past couple of weeks so I wanted to review it again...and man am I gonna miss it! It\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful high. Unmistakeable, actually. Starts off cerebral and tastes unique. Like a sharp sour lemon fuzz. Then it mellows right out. It actually stabilises you. It centres you and brings you home. I\u2019m in love with this strain. This batch is top 5 of all time...ENJOY!!

VJust had this for the first time today. Have to say it is a pretty nice indica. Strong, with a high THC %. I feel very relaxed and happy. My pain is at a low 2 out of 10. As opposed to the 7 or 8 I am usually at without smoking.\u000a\u000aThis seems like it will be a very good night time strain to help me sleep, with low levels of pain, and I doubt very much I will remember my dreams/nightmares when I wake up from a rested sleep.

VEvery time i hit critical kush it keeps me relaxed and focused without the heavy sleepiness from most if not all indica&#39;s. It has a large rich skunky and tree textures not to mention a smoke that likes to linger or vape in this case. The sedative relaxation and thick compact buds crack like wood under pressure for each nugget popped off. Larger darker hairs with less hairs. Keeps my body relaxed while my mind takes the wheel I love this strain simply because I have almost no side effects and I feel Great, perfect for pain appetite and of course nerve and nausea medical conditions.

VAn awesome all-round strain, strong &amp; heavy enough effects to smoke in the evening to wind down after a long day &amp; get ready for bed etc, yet can be smoked during the day to bring on happy, positive thoughts &amp; help take on the days tasks confidently. This strain makes my mind very active &amp; gives me a curious, wandering train of thought, so it can be easy for me to become distracted from what I&#39;m doing. Pleasant, subtle flavour notes, incredibly smooth smoke. One of my favourites.

VThis is one of the best strains I&#39;ve ever smoked. Creative and uplifting high but mellow and calm at the same time. This is like the best hybrid if you want to get really high with no anxiety or paranoia. We took a couple of hits from a bong in my best friend&#39;s kitchen which was lit up with christmas lights and in 15 minutes I felt like in a space shuttle. We had a really good time discussing some ideas we just had and listening to Kaytranada&#39;s album. If you like &quot;entertaining&quot; type of high with deep creative thoughts and empathy in the air, but you also want to feel really calm and comfortable with your body, this is certainly a great pick. Highly recommended! Might feel a little bit strong for non-experienced smokers, so start with a small hit.

VGood, chill strain that doesn&#39;t leave you super couchlocked. I went to a girlfriend&#39;s birthday bash and had a nice time hanging out, even though I only knew her and her husband. A warning to those trying to keep their figure: Critical Kush is a one-way ticket to Munchie Town, so steer clear or - in my case - make sure you have healthy snacks around, because you&#39;ll go to town on anything and everything within arm&#39;s distance.

VIf you use Christiania in Copenhagen you can find a really decent batch of weed once every few weeks. I\u2019m talking exceptional. You\u2019ll know because it\u2019ll still be in the giant pillow case sized bag the delivery first dealer used. It\u2019s before it gets repacked and branded by the new dealer. Sometimes when these deliveries contain fire weed the batch sells out in about 3hrs. This happened yesterday. I was by chance browsing a stand who received a delivery. It was amazing looking. Lime green / almost yellow in colour and blanket covered in white fuzz. Critical kush. I bought a 60 bucks worth and went a rolled a J. 30 mins later I passed the stall to buy more and he was almost sold out. \u000a\u000aThe high is strong and cerebral with a deep body buzz. Legs go to jelly pretty fast and you can certainly giggle away on this particular batch. Really nice high. Great for a walk if you can manage it.

VOne of the BEST INDICAS I have had the pleasure to try. The name really sticks out to me because I always think \u201cwow that CRITICAL KUSH was a CRITICAL HIT\u201d whenever I take a hit. It\u2019s potent, relaxing effects are perfect for the evening. Also, High THC with moderate CBD... no wonder it\u2019s so great for my anxiety and depression! This one was able to really put me to sleep without the help of anything else... and I take medication for my insomnia everyday. Couch potato high :)

VNot really an indica sort of person but I rather enjoyed the relaxed and mellow feeling to this strain, also very effective pain relief, also a very good vibe to it and a really strong feeling of affection. Only down side as I find with most indicas I experienced slight paranoia at times. But all in all its definitely one of the better indicas I&#39;ve tried. 4.5

VAn awesome all-round strain, strong &amp; heavy enough effects to smoke in the evening to wind down after a long day &amp; get ready for bed etc, yet can be smoked during the day to bring on happy, positive thoughts &amp; help take on the days tasks confidently. This strain makes my mind very active &amp; gives me a curious, wandering train of thought, so it can be easy for me to become distracted from what I&#39;m doing. Pleasant, subtle flavour notes, incredibly smooth smoke. One of my favourites.

VI have this as a prefilled vape cartridge, and I&#39;ve never used one of those before, so my impression of the flavor may be actually tasting the solvent - but it tastes pretty strongly like petrol smells.\u000a\u000aThe feeling of the high is very nice, though. It crept up on me, took maybe 5 minutes to hit me. Once it did kick in, my muscles relaxed, pain diminished, and I became very content. Relatively clear headed high. \u000a\u000aI imagine if you have too much of this, you&#39;ll fall asleep - but if you have just a little bit, it&#39;s a very nice high.

VUpon opening my bag of Critical Kush I was hit with a really strong earthy smell. The buds were compact and slightly dusty to the touch. Grinding up well. Nice and evenly fluffy. Making for a smooth even spread across the Raw papers I was using. The settings for a really enjoyable smoke commence. A slight tickle to the throat. After the 1st few tokes. Smoked in joints taking longer tokes gives you the full relaxing effect (coughing may occur) so trying this I was instantly hit with the happy relaxing feeling that this strain is known for. After completing the joint. I sat in amazement and satisfaction before finding some left over chocolate cake in my fridge and proceed to pig out. And watch Anchorman 2 for some solid laughs. I would rank this weed 8.9/10. Only let down by a taste I couldn&#39;t describe. Although nice it was slightly confusing. Great high and good for anyone needing help with their appetite!

Strong pain relief effects, insomnia relief, and pure stoned-like euphoria. Heavy on the eyes, giving off a thoroughly stoney experience for the user. Eye-drops are recommended and mostly evening-nighttime use for the average smoker. If user is in daily pain, mental pain, drug addiction/alcholism--withdrawals etc., highly recommending this strain for relief.

VMy girlfriend and I are new patients, and she had never medicated before.  we decided to pick up some Critical CURE, which is a hybrid of this strain and a CBD plant.  We figured that the high CBD content would help her relax and ease into the high... unfortunately it didn&#39;t provide the nice head change that we were expecting, but it definitely made us very relaxed and at ease.  I felt like I could go shopping or go to the movies and have zero stress or paranoia like I do with high THC strains.  all-in-all, it&#39;s great for pain and anxiety, just wanted a bit more of a cerebral feeling.  Again, this review is for the strain Critical CURE, not kush, but that strain is not represented on Leafly yet.

VThis is a strain for the pain! My mom suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis and this strain has really helped her with her pain. That being said, this indica is great because it really helps with pain without being too body heavy weighing you down. My mom really loved this about Critical Mass because not only did it help with the pain, but it kept her engaged and still able to get stuff done. Personally I didn&#39;t find it to be body heavy necessarily, but it made me noticeably tired. All in all, I think it&#39;s a really good tasty strain whose effects can be benefitted by everyone.

VCritical Kush has been the biggest lifesaver for me. I can WALK again, sometimes. I have sever nerve pain in my leg, and I walk with a cane or crutches. Ever since I&#39;ve incorporated this strain into my regimen I&#39;ve been walking with less weight on my cane (saving the carpal tunnel) and I&#39;m becoming more physically activ.e \u000a\u000aI used to be a martial artist and a soldier, and physicality has always been important. It helps my sensitivity to touch. I love that I don&#39;t get the &quot;high&quot; feeling. My head stays clear, my leg pain is reduced by almost 40% and I can FUNCTION. I wish I could give this strain a 6th star.

VOverall, a great indica. Very pungent scent, with hints of earth &amp; skunk. As if it was pulled off the mountains somewhere. Strong pain relief effects, insomnia relief, and pure stoned-like euphoria. Heavy on the eyes, giving off a thoroughly stoney experience for the user. Eye-drops are recommended and mostly evening-nighttime use for the average smoker. If user is in daily pain, mental pain, drug addiction/alcholism--withdrawals etc., highly recommending this strain for relief.

VCritical Kush is some of the best relaxing in the best appetite stimulant I have found for my anorexia and swallowing issues. I find that critical Kush although has a very cold and texture and has very dark leaves but still gives kind of a golden cute to be overall nugget of the bud it&#39;s still packs quite a powerful punch when vaped. This a role of fills the air of berries and dark tree fruit I recommend this for those who have trouble eating or find it hard to have an appetite when you should be eating twice as much as you should when you are recovering from anorexia I&#39;ve been Anorexic my whole lifeand I would say that critical Kush gives me the best body relaxation and comfort when I&#39;m off doing other things and the good thing about this strain is the fact that it has the most relaxing properties that is very critical as it causes the trigger you to eat much bigger meals great for painnausea headaches if you can&#39;t eat it&#39;s really great for that this along with the Indica side also gives me a lot of nice happy uplifting to fax this is of course that doesn&#39;t cause me too much sleeping this and I&#39;ll be able to get a lot of things done with a lot of physical work five stars for this one since the vape isn&#39;t harsh. Expect critical Kush to last about two hours and more if you&#39;re looking for a heavy hitter on pain.

VThis strain is very smooth, a little dry mouth but not too much. This superbly hard indica can make you numb if you take it in a higher dose. After the numbness the cbd kicks in a slightly reduces my numbness making my joints very loose. If you have pain or just need to super realax. Critical kush hits you hard like a truck, can even cause some couch lock. If you need absolute relief critical kushes body high will make you a little sleepy and hungry as well. Great strain flowery, pungent and sage like herbal too but its not strong.

Vthis has become one of my favorite strains. I was having a pretty shitty day when I smoked. I was very anxious and focused only on the bad thoughts. After a couple hits I could feel all the stress lift off my shoulders and I could finally calm down.\u000aThis strain is perfect after a very long day. Very relaxed high that keeps you somewhat focused. The superior relaxation is great for sleep!\u000aCritical Kush is known for its sleepy and relaxing high.\u000aI would recommend this strain to those who are really upset or had a long bad day. Great for depression literally melts the sad away. Also if you want some good sleep I&#39;d try some Critical Kush to wash away your worries and lull you into a restful slumber\u000a\u000a

Vits hard skunky and pungent flavors bring me a nice vape, I love this strain. Right out the gate made me cough really hard this time around its going to be strong for me each cough opens your lungs more for more oxygen intake. Its small buds are compact with a golden goodness I expected  this strain to be darker for the kush lineage, but its light n golden very nice!

VUpon opening my bag of Critical Kush I was hit with a really strong earthy smell. The buds were compact and slightly dusty to the touch. Grinding up well. Nice and evenly fluffy. Making for a smooth even spread across the Raw papers I was using. The settings for a really enjoyable smoke commence. A slight tickle to the throat. After the 1st few tokes. Smoked in joints taking longer tokes gives you the full relaxing effect (coughing may occur) so trying this I was instantly hit with the happy relaxing feeling that this strain is known for. After completing the joint. I sat in amazement and satisfaction before finding some left over chocolate cake in my fridge and proceed to pig out. And watch Anchorman 2 for some solid laughs. I would rank this weed 8.9/10. Only let down by a taste I couldn&#39;t describe. Although nice it was slightly confusing. Great high and good for anyone needing help with their appetite!

VI have this as a prefilled vape cartridge, and I&#39;ve never used one of those before, so my impression of the flavor may be actually tasting the solvent - but it tastes pretty strongly like petrol smells.\u000a\u000aThe feeling of the high is very nice, though. It crept up on me, took maybe 5 minutes to hit me. Once it did kick in, my muscles relaxed, pain diminished, and I became very content. Relatively clear headed high. \u000a\u000aI imagine if you have too much of this, you&#39;ll fall asleep - but if you have just a little bit, it&#39;s a very nice high.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Body relaxation and mild pain relief. Calming effect on the mind, would be good for anxiety or stress. \u000a\u000aCons: Effects either took some time to start or needed additional consumption, (2nd volcano bag) to start (As the pros, the effets worked well, I was surprised by this con). \u000a\u000aOverall/Other:  When the effects kicked in, was relaxing in body and mind and killed pain. I didn&#39;t get sleepy from this strain, but with how relaxing I felt I could see it helping get to sleep for some. No real head high (sativa effects). \u000aTaste was different from other indicas I&#39;ve reviewed (usually they have a piney flavor), but this had an earthy almost flowery taste, which was pleasant, I was surprised that it had no piney taste. Draw/exhale were relatively smooth, little hint of spice on exhale. Little dry mouth.\u000a\u000aWhile not fast acting, I would recommend if you need body/mind relaxation. \u000a

VMy original thoughts were that it doesn&#39;t compare to anything else. It seemed kind of weak. But I let it cure a bit longer, and it is a creeper at first, then slams your everything away. Takes away anxiety, stress, and especially debilitating back pain and inflammation. For a looooooong time. Dry mouth and munchies are not as much as some others, but are still prevalent.

VMy girlfriend and I are new patients, and she had never medicated before.  we decided to pick up some Critical CURE, which is a hybrid of this strain and a CBD plant.  We figured that the high CBD content would help her relax and ease into the high... unfortunately it didn&#39;t provide the nice head change that we were expecting, but it definitely made us very relaxed and at ease.  I felt like I could go shopping or go to the movies and have zero stress or paranoia like I do with high THC strains.  all-in-all, it&#39;s great for pain and anxiety, just wanted a bit more of a cerebral feeling.  Again, this review is for the strain Critical CURE, not kush, but that strain is not represented on Leafly yet.

Makes the world seem brighter, allows you to go thruout your day, and get things done. \u000aI recommend this to anyone who is chronically ill, or who may have PTSD.\u000aSticky big buds full of love, like a long warm hug from a lover on a cold day!

The lineage is exceptional - thoroughbreds, so to speak, with OG Kush (from Chemdawg and Hindu Kush landrace) and Critical Mass (Afghani x Skunk 1). The sativa phenotypes of S1 and Chemdawg balance out what would be a terribly overwhelming indica dominant strain

Over all i give this one a strong 4. the indica is heavy with this one and if you plan on using this one through out the day i warn you if you have tasks that need completing. its a great &quot;after work&quot; flower and the taste is very earthy and fresh. it tastes almost like you&#39;re smoking a fresh head of lettus....in a good way.!

VPretty. Not as good for my own anxiety relief as, say, Nuken, which I found left a clear mind along with a nice body relaxation. CK starts nice in the body, mellows you in, and the high travels to the head after a while and focus starts to get a bit more difficult, thoughts become a bit more abstract. Overall, a nice full experience from start to finish, but definitely a nightcap bud.

VI&#39;m blown away by the way I felt during the beginning of this medicine. Critical Kush is an absolute body numbing no joke high desert really out did them selves this time perfect for sleep! Sometimes I have so many ideas I&#39;m a work o Hollis so it&#39;s hard for me to take breaks. When I need to sleep the cbd in this natural crossing is perfect I swear it must have at least 2 or 2.5% on average love it but sometimes it&#39;s trippy to be that numbed like objects got that weird feeling but not my face I recommend this for people who need pain support the most!

VThis bud is strong! Anyway, the buds are not to dense and are covered in crystals but when you break into them you realise how resinous they are. Light in colour and with nice dark orange hairs. The smell is very earthy and almost piney or spicy. Same with the taste. This weed is very strong and probably the first time I&#39;d ever say watch out. It creeps up on you big time. Less is defiantly more. The high is indica leaning with a nice calm euphoria. Happy and smiley. Great to watch a funny movie, pig out on crap and then sleep. I would take it easy cos I had way to much at first and all the happy and smiley went away. I was out of it. All I was good for was sleep. It&#39;s up there with the best though and has been great for my sciatica and spasms.

VThis is not the best indica I&#39;ve ever smoked but it&#39;s not the worst either.  It&#39;s a very relaxing strain with almost no sativa style effects whatsoever, making it perfect for folks like me who get severe anxiety with almost any sativa. \u000a\u000aThe buds I got were very dry and not very dense.  The aroma for mine was very mild, hardly noticeable.  The flavor is mild as well.  \u000a\u000aThis strain is perfect for an evening relaxing at home or even for the daytime, especially if you need to crush anxiety.  \u000a\u000aCritical Kush could very well be a staple in my cannabis arsenal, and I heartily recommend it.  Just to expect to be totally floored by it. \u000a\u000a\u000aThanks for reading!
