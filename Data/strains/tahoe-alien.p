VI have just received a super care package from a great old friend which contained 6, 3/4 of pounds of 6 strains that I&#39;ve never tried nor heard of.  I had, but almost missed in the packaging were laboratory tests of each strain, as my super-friend knows full well that I love them.  So I will be making 6 Leafy Strain Reviews of these six strains \u000a\u000aThe first tried strain is Tahoe Alien a hybrid strain of Tahoe OG x Alien Kush.  Quite a very tasty bud to be sure !  I really love its blood orange / Meyer Lemon zip to th&#233; Kush terpenes with earthy, and slight red cedar nose.  Which upon exhaling do I ever get wonderful heady Citrus notes and also the ever-earthy Kush flavours which are some of my preferred morning strain notes that I have preferred overall these 47 years of Medical Cannabis growing and use.

VGreat taste and high. Taste like lemony pine sol at first but once it burns a little tast like lemony earthy wood/green tea. The high hits you hard in waves everywhere and makes you laugh your ass off. Definitely worth trying but its more for evening or late night use as it leaves you sleepy.

VI definitely appreciate this strain. Doesn&#39;t exactly knock me on my butt. It doesn&#39;t make me productive either. It did produce a lovely high, giggly and fun, but also chill. I feel like this is a good strain when you&#39;re being social at home. I love the piney sweetness.

VI had some delivered to my job,I could not hide the smell. I had it tucked in my sock+covered by 4 layers(thermals,flannel pjs,sweats,jeans) of pants....my coworkers said they smelled it. Had to stash it outside. I was finally off of work and rolled one up,here it is hours later and I just came to like &quot;what happened? Last thing I remember was leaning back getting comfy&quot;

VI had this strain crossed with Sour Grapes from my dispensary. For some strange reason Ct does not like to name the strains unless it&#39;s called Theraplant 1009. But with a thc content of 23.8%, how can you complain? The sativa hits you immediately followed by a calming relaxing high. Great for depression, anxiety,ADHD,lack of appetite. Great earthy smell.

VThe buds of this Tahoe Alien from Kind Love in Denver are completely covered in sticky amber trichomes. The weed smells so freaking good and the high is stoney and relaxing. After only one bowl was plenty relaxed and ready to zone out watching netflix, knowing full well I&#39;d not be able to follow any storyline being this high.

VI think this is a very good strain. It&#39;s buds have a very resin like feel to them, sticky icky to the max. I have been vaping this strain for a couple months and I find that is a great evening strain. Whenever it is vaped through my PAX I feel totally couch locked. The pain relief I get from this strain is very comparable to that of high CBD and pure indica &amp; sativa strains. A draw back of this is that it makes my eyes and mouth quite dry. The tastes I get are earth, pine, a hint of lemon. The lemon was almost not present in this particular flower, but it is some potent buds. I recommend this strain to any athlete at the end of the day or post workout. It is also good for hanging about on the couch or a prior to a good nights rest.

VPeople from CT need to stop giving reviews! CT has never had just Tahoe Alien at its dispensaries, only strains that included the Tahoe Alien as a parent.. Therefore none of your reviews are valid!\u000aTahoe Alien is an amazing strain that takes on a good 50/50 mix of its parents in both high and appearance/smell...\u000aWhen u break it open you&#39;ll notice some of the purple in there from the purple kush lineage. One of my favorite alien genetics strain
