VFunky smell with hints of dirt and wood. Dark green with purple tinges and orange hairs. Fine strain for putzing around the house doing nothing. Didn\u2019t make me exceptionally happy or anything. Just kind of went about my day with it in the background. It\u2019s fine if that\u2019s all they got but wouldn\u2019t go out my way to find it again.

VThough the name of this flavor is somewhat girly and, well, childish, this flower is anything but. \u000a\u000aShe truly is beautiful. Majestic shades of violent throughout the buds, with a very light scent that&#39;s sweet and citrusy. The taste is incredibly light, but the effect is very strong. Super mellow, soothing, relaxing feeling... the kind of indica that really helps unclench uptight muscles from a long day of work as well as relax your mind.

VCreative, uplifting, mellow, not too stoney but still packs a punch! Purple Princess is a nice bud very purple with alot of orange hairs and tricomes, it smelled just like purps with a kick! The smoke was very good kinda chocolate after taste. i rolled a nice cone joint with some raw papers. The smoke was good, made me feel a lil trippy. at first i took a few hits and nothing happened. i knew the bud was good quality, (its Canna Clinic after all) I waited about two minutes and BAM! You can feel it and its a nice indica high but at the same time not too stoney i got an eight for $35 at south bay canna clinic. My only negatives was the bud didnt look trimmed very well it was pretty leafy normally sbcc always has their bud very nearly trimmed. All in all i rate it a 8 for the price and great uplifting, mellow high.

VYep definitely a creeper! I smoked my usual amount of shatter and sat down to play Borderlands2 with my husband. About 15 min later it hit me like a ton of bricks! For the next 30 min I was so medicated I could barely function LOL not that it was bad. Then it faded to an overall body tingle, definite arousal (much sex was had), and then a serious crash. It was very enjoyable.\u000a\u000aAwesome for sleep and not bad for body pain, just be careful with how much you smoke since it will get stronger in a bit of time.

VIt&#39;s definitely really, really pretty. It has a lot of purple and some orange hairs, and is dense and bushy. I&#39;m guessing it should have a fruitier taste, because I mainly could taste skunk with a little hint of fruitiness. As far as the high itself, it&#39;s definitely sativa dominant, because I got a lot of the head buzz at first and it made me a little anxious. But then after a while it melts down into a nice relaxation. I also didn&#39;t get the munchies hardly at all, which is always a plus. I&#39;d recommend this to someone who wants to get things done, maybe even later in the day, and maybe with a cup of coffee or tea. It should be called princess punch because it comes on a little strong as well!

VHoly shit this stuff is dannnk! When smoked, this shit gets you a really nice head and body high but leaning more towards the head. All in all, it delivers a nice head buzz with a relaxed body. However I noticed when I smoked this, I coughed more than normal (Yeah this shit makes you cough). The flavor of this strain is great as well. Not so much earthy, more fruity tasting in my opinion. All around great strain! I&#39;m impressed!
