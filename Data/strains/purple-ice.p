VThis is a hard-to-find weed. Might be a phenotype of Ice.\u000a\u000aDefinitely a 60/40 S/I hybrid mix\u000a\u000aWhen I smoked, I felt the head igh right away and then around the third hit the body mellow effect came in. Avid smoker here though so it might be a little strong for the non-average smoker.\u000a\u000aSweet, light skunky smell with dense almost tightly packed buds. Grinds very well and is white as ice with ints of purple color on the leaves.\u000a\u000aThis is an ok weed.\u000a

VHard hitting sweet tasting and marvelous. This strain provides the energy to get the job done but don&#39;t over do it or you&#39;ll be spacey and giggly. True to its name, the light and dark purple hues are covered with crystals (ice). This strain is not to be taken lightly because one to many tokes will change everything you thought was going on, it will take over and leave you wondering and trying to remember what your last thought was. lol. A STRONG  beautiful flower to be enjoyed in moderation.
