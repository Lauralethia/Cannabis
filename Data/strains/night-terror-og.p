VPicked this up at Pecos Valley as part of a Friday deal, and will DEFINITELY be back to stock up. It smoothly relaxed me into a solid 7 hrs of sleep, with nice pain relief, muscle relaxation and a calm mind. No small feat with a fused lumbar spine, arthritis and CPTSD on board nightly.

VBeautiful, under appreciated solid indica strain. Vapes mellow &amp; fruity, crescendoes to a lovely light body feeling, then settles in good and hard. Watch out\u2014enough of this strain will stop you in your tracks. Couch lock is real. Tactile and happy, problems wash away, colors and patterns. Perhaps not the norm but this got psychedelic on me with closed-eye visuals and some brilliant explosions, bubble-gum popping in my mind. Sex is mind-blowing, making your whole body sensitive. Settled into a sound 8-hour sleep; woke up happy and rested. Sad to discover I\u2019m down to my last gram, must pick up some more at the dispensary!

VAt first I really didn&#39;t know how I felt about this strain, but it is definitely starting to grow on me. The buds look great. Definitely got that dank look. They are nice and compact with purple, green, and  some red hairs also. Nice dusting of trichomes, too. The flavor is very smooth, I didn&#39;t cough my ass off like I have before with other OG&#39;s. The first time I smoke it. Now to the high. The flowers I got were around 22 percent THC. So it definitely has some kick. The first couple of times I smoked, I had some anxiety. But it seemed to go away in 10 to 15 minutes after that  the high is very enjoyable. Lastly after smoking this strain a couple of times I no longer experienced any anxiety.

VInitial impression: II have noticed that a preponderance of my reviews are Indica dominant strains or hybrids, not to many straight sativa strains. I will do my best to review a myriad of different strains. Any-whosies, this strain was considered one of the cannaseur level strains at Medicine Man in Glendale, CO. I would happily agree with them on this. My initial impression was &quot;wow&quot; this strain looks great, smells great cant wait to see how super fly this strain really is. So I bought an eighth without even trying it; it was totally worth it. I was smitten and impressed.\u000a\u000aI use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.\u000a\u000aAroma: 8.5\u000aDefinitely pungent! This scent reminded me of a tropical lawn, that was just recently cut. It was like fresh cut grass, combined with new garden soil and a tang of berry/citrus. Really a complex package to be digested in a single sitting. I sat at my kitchen table taking turns smelling the original container, and my ground up bud for my joint. I was going back and forth and was really impressed with the aroma and its irresistible complexity. Definitely one of my favorites to date.\u000a\u000aTaste: 9.0\u000aSimplistically stated, &quot;Holy fucking ass-crackers batman&quot;. This tastes like the dreams of small children, delicious! Enough said. One of my favorites to date, definitely in my top 5.\u000a\u000aPotency: 7.5\u000aThe strength of this euphoria was mellow and, pretty powerful. I felt connected, and focused. This was not one of your typical (IN DA Couch lock) Indicas. The strength of this euphoria was really nice. Uplifting while simultaneously spots of lethargy. Focused, and uncaring, it is a great strain\u000a\u000aFinal opinion: I liked, I liked a lot! I would recommend this strain to any cannaseur. This strain has made its way into my personal stash.\u000a\u000aTotal points awarded: 25 out of 30. Great bud, I would like to extend a mark of personal satisfaction and appreciation to whom ever created this strain, kudos. This strain really should be a 4.5 stars out of 5, really remarkable.\u000a\u000aCM~

VWow!.. Where do I start?.. Not many strains impress me to the point of this one . It  absolutely delivers on the heavy indica effects and works on my anxiety and insomnia like no other. It&#39;s such a nice head buzz high too.. I found myself watching a Bob Ross painting demo and actually being able to watch more than 5 minutes   Now I get it.. Woke up refreshed and feeling like I just had dreamscaped Bob Ross winter mountaintop scenes all nite.

VSuperb genetics!! This is a wonderful strain for insomnia, PTSD and anxiety; all of which are extremely heightened for me since I started detoxing from an awful, super heavy benzo 6 weeks ago. I smoked about half of a 1 gram preroll and I don\u2019t remember falling asleep!! I woke up a couple hours later feeling refreshed, creative and happy. This is definitely my new #1 night-time flower. Strains like this are a lovely reminder of the healing power of cannabis. I have been prescribed everything for sleep and nothing allowed me to have restful sleep and feel great when I wake up.

VThe aroma that comes of the flower is strong, neutral, and pleasant. Microdosing is recommended, I found that there were few activities to enjoy, other than being a zombie on the couch. I enjoyed a 2-3 hour window where the effects were pleasant, and there really was no crash or munchies. Laid back. I normally do not enjoy and partake in Indicas, but thus was a treat.

VI had some of this off the recommendation of the budtender at Destination HWY 420 in Clio MI. I&#39;ve slept better the last 2 night&#39;s than I have in year&#39;s. I have frequent Migraines and narcolepsy. Everyone says narcolepsy you get enough sleep... NO, not quality sleep.  I got Quality sleep. I love this strand

VOMG groggy and sleepy within minutes. Perfect for my knee pain, buft I would not recommend if you&#39;re facing an active day. Smells like a dark waxy crayon, and she broke up great into shake and keif in my grinder. Results may vary, but for me, it was a little heavy, like a Xanax bar.

VNice fluffy buds. The smell of the flower wasn&#39;t as strong as most diesels, but a light and pleasant diesel taste was present. Smell was light in general. Good flavor. Fruity, like blueberry. Hint of citrus and pine on the exhale. Pretty standard OG effect. It&#39;s nice. Worked well to ease some high anxiety today. Very calming. Must be strong cause didn&#39;t take a whole lot to reach desired effect. Kinda couch locked. Could see this working well for bedtime too.

VAs a pretty large guy, and very active, from gardening to exercising, to full time student, I&#39;ve been able to fit this strain into every one of those and more with great results. I have severe anxiety and in large amounts this strain may make you have &quot;adverse&quot; side effects,my anxiety does lower during the day but at night it goes up, that could just be me personally. Although, my dreams are EXTREMELY vivid. I don&#39;t dream on anything else. Be ready for one good, long buzz.

VThe Night Terror OG&#39;s structure really reminded me of a cookie strain with the denseness, but had a much heavier couch lock effect. On top of it all I was super happy an giggly. Not much of a smeller but an overall really solid floral flavor. Very much enjoyed this strain.
