VConsumption Method:\u000aVape Cartridge: Golden XTRX Cookie Monster (CO2)\u000a\u000aBattery: Cultivated Industries\u000a\u000aAroma &amp; Flavor:\u000aA sweet, frankincense and pine aroma/flavor on the draw.  After three draws or so, a nice lingering hashy flavor.  Though it tasted good, it vaped rather harsh.\u000a\u000aExperience:\u000aThis one was a bit of a creeper.  Takes about 15 minutes for full effects to kick in.  The head high is fleeting and merely a distraction for a few minutes.  This is followed by a glorious body stone.  Comfortable, mellow and relaxing all blended together sum up the effects.  \u000a\u000aCannabinoid Content:\u000aTHC 52.74%\u000aCBD: ND\u000aCBN: 1.77%\u000aCBG: 1.62%\u000aCBC 2.09%

VTried this on a random choice and was more than surprised. I&#39;ve never seen anything this purple, not even coming close to Death Star or GDP. Very kiefy from the outside in. Peeling apart a nug gives beautiful waxy strands. The high itself is very cerebral and leaves you with a nice residual floating feeling throughout your body.

V&quot;Today me will live in the moment unless it&#39;s unpleasant in which case me will eat a cookie.&quot; Words of wisdom from the blue man himself, Cookie Monster, it&#39;s easy to agree he&#39;d suggest smoking a bowl of his namesake strain as a fine substitute. Coming out of the blue to win several cups in 2014, this potent strain combines the legendary Girl Scout Cookies with the classic OG Kush to create a monster of an indica hybrid. Building on the earthy profile set forth by mama OG, Cookie Monster expands the pungent nose with pine aromas and hints of sweetness that suggest the cookie parent. On the palate, the earthy flavor develops first with a following taste of pastry that&#39;s classic to most cookie hybrids with a sweet finish. Cookie Monster doles out happiness faster than you can smoke it, creating a happy relaxed high that is a little sleepy and a lot euphoric. Watch out though! Just like Cookie Monster you&#39;ll have the muuuuunchies! Medicinally this strain is perfect for those having stomach issues, especially people looking for appetite stimulants, also works great for stress relief, pain relief, anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD.

VAmazing strain! It&#39;s great for anxiety, relaxation and if you want to eat and knock out. I felt very talkative on this strain as well! \u000aOn another note, every time I smoke this, it rose my sexual arousal levels up very high.

VMy brother and I hit about one and a half gravity bongs each, then shared a bowl of this strain. The taste is piney, but there is a slight sweetness to it as well. The buds are quite dense with a lot of orange hairs. Very fresh, and darker in color, with a few very dark green nugs. The high is very enjoyable. Relaxing, but not too strong of an indica feel.

VVery smooth and mellow Indica. If you like grape this is a must-try, it&#39;s very flavorful. You would think it&#39;s earthy tasting because it smells so before you grind it up. Afterwards you can smell the berry terps and taste the grape ones on green hit. It&#39;s a happy euphoric high that is slowly creeping through my body right now..You should definitely put this strain on your &quot;to-do&quot; list ;) Seasoned smokers/chronic pain sufferers this is a good day time functioning Indica. Not so much for beginners.

VThis helped with inflammation, mild to severe muscle pain, moderate to severe nerve pain, and moderate overall pain.  This was an excellent daytime strain for me, the only thing that hits me wrong is that it goes straight to my head - I ended up with a headache, but not bad enough to never smoke it again when my pain gets to be too much.  It smells like dirty feet, pine, a hint of mint, and fairly pungent.  It had a really light smoke and I couldn&#39;t really pick up on any other flavors because I rolled this with a Green Apple Juicy Jay paper - but I suggest a different flavor, didn&#39;t mesh well.  My face completely felt melted after I got half way through my roll.  I literally drooled a few times, my muscles were extremely relaxed.  Maybe I&#39;m just a lightweight, but damn - good stuff, definitely a MUST try!
