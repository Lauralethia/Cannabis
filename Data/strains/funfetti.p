VWow, what a strain this is. If you are not a heavy smoker, you won\u2019t enjoy this as much since the high is so different. It feels great and makes the day brighter. Recommend if you are working and wanted to smoke something that won\u2019t stop you from everyday things

VMy new favorite strain. Cherry Pie packs quiet the punch in this Secret Cookies/ Cherry Pie combination. The bud structure leans toward the cookie side, very dark in nature but the trichs message cover this darker colored bud. The smoke was inutially very fruity while still giving off a strong cookies exhale, reminding you of its notable lineage. Affects lean towards the indica side. Often stuck on the couch while feeling very euphoric. What a punch.

VThis is an exceptional strain.  I sometimes get paranoid/anxious with cannabis use, but just get over it because I like the other effects...this strain made me totally relaxed and I was out like a light within 30 minutes.  I usually go to a pure OG late at night, but this is now my go-to relaxation/happy strain.

VThis is a pretty moderate/maybe even light strain. It&#39;s very clear headed, it also is one of those rare strains that makes just about any activity seem appealing. I also found that reading just about anything is amazing on this strain..I don&#39;t read otherwise haha. Anyways, love having this one on hand..I&#39;ve even went to class on this..retained some stuff  and any topic was super interesting.

VSure as heck tastes like birthday cake. Has that creamy flavor to it. The flower has nice density to it with deep shades of purple. The effect is a nice clean head high and it keeps you there for quite awhile. Try this one out when it is in town. Grown by Bay Exclusives. THC 21.05 CBD .05

VWe created FUNFETTI by crossing CHERRY PIE and ANIMAL COOKIES. Amazing cakey flavor with a rock-solid flower structure. Yields are exceptional when grown correctly. This is a clone only strain.

VYummy joy for the pallet and mind.  One of the clearest head highs I&#39;ve enjoyed ever!  A good soft body effect, and wonderful flavors on the pallet.  Some say it is good for sleeping, I found it energizing and so will use during the day.  Not a nighttime one for me.
