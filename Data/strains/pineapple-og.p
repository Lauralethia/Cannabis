VThe Bud Shape: like a perfect Pinetree sprouts up into a fox tail towards the top followed by the calyx is that in your link and interweave inside the folds of the darker Mossy green leaves.  I would describe the structure as a perfect bud. The pistols are bright orange and red like the sun in New Mexico on the Sandias mountains. \u000aThe Smell: like a fresh fruit lots of lemon and tropical for Sells. Aroma invites kind of like a grapefruit smell along with hints of wood and lavender \u000aThe Taste: markable how it tastes just how it smells grapefruit tropical sweet little bit of sour just the perfect embodiment of this strain in flavor. \u000aThe Toke: very thick,  wisps through the air from my mouth. The toke is kind of like a creeper at first you noticed that lights start becoming a little bit more intense your speech starts to become a little bit more suave and fluent.  You&#39;re able to create  atmosphere is it that can be perfect if you have OCD. Pineapple OG is really great for pain really great for depression and an absolute must for Alzheimer&#39;s. I can recall very fond memories from my childhood.  I have a shortened short term memory. To be able to recall everything I&#39;ve seen today reenact all the conversations I had with everybody and be able to come up with awesome ideas to make my vacation a better day. Pineapple OG you can&#39;t go wrong with it!  Recommend people who suffer from depression OCD Alzheimer&#39;s disease anorexia, glaucoma.  Helps with headaches.  Yes on the lookout for another review later this month! &lt;3 you all stay safe c:

VI started out a die hard indica fan, now after a year of having my card I cherish those Sativa&#39;s that are so unique feeling. Pineapple OG is one of them. Not overly stimulating, this beautiful specimen is amazing for getting things done. Doesn&#39;t cloud your mind.

VVaped in the evening, nice Pineapple and earthy flavor. I find the Pineapple Express is more of a pineapple and piney flavor. A nice boost of energy but still feel relaxed. Pain relief on this strain is fantastic, just like Pineapple Express. I laid in a hammock and watched the clouds and I was seeing some really fun stuff for a bit. Then it mellowed out and was nice for watching TV but I still had energy to do something if I wanted to.

VVaped in the evening and had a great time on this strain. It tastes and smells just like pineapple, and leaves a sweet aftertaste in your mouth. The high was pretty cerebral. I am a relatively new smoker so I felt a bit of anxiety creep in for a bit, but I was able to calm down and had a great time. I would have felt great climbing after smoking some of this strain, or doing any intellectual activity.

A bright pineapple-citrus smell and taste and a smooth high that won&#39;t leave you zoned.  I&#39;ll tell you right now, this shit here had me motivated!  I was medicated but  somehow a little sharper than I am with other strains.  Definitely one of my faves and highly recommended.

VI&#39;d give this 3.5 stars. It&#39;s decent, but both its parents are better alone than mixed together. The best thing it has going for it is flavor... I&#39;m vaping Pineapple OG and damn, spank my ass if it doesn&#39;t taste just like BBQ pineapple. Overall I&#39;d say it gave me a decent head high, made me happy and calm, but the comedown was pure sleepiness.
