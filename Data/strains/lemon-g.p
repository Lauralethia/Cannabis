Vone of the loudest citrus smells out there coupled with a just as powerful skunky undertone some have even described as gravy smell but is most closely described as lemon and musky diesel??? whatever it is its loud and it stays loud.  The lemon presence stays is evident and yummy till the last hit. At first expect about ten minutes of medicated couch lock and muscle relaxation. After expect 60 minutes of a nice sativa focused ride. Very alert not overly silly or happy just well focused and even. Great for first thing in the morning

VOne of the best strains I&#39;ve ever come across.  Lemon G brings a fresh feeling in my lungs when I inhale it.  It is fresh tasting and not at all harsh on the lungs.  It has a very distinct lemon taste and aroma to it.  The aroma is not at all distasteful and so I feel as if you don&#39;t have to worry at all about reeking of it around others as it only leaves a fresh scent of lemons, which the average person would not associate with the general marijuana scent.\u000a\u000aI give this strain a 10 for taste, freshness and the euphoric high it gives.\u000a\u000a

VI love lemon G. I smoked it for 7-8 months and occasionally got other buds. But there is a reason why I kept going back, great head high and it can make you pretty stupid. I always feel upbeat, happy, and giggly. While this can just get you too high it also gives you control over it. A few months ago I traded up for lemon haze (which is the shit), and Grandaddy purple. Even though I don&#39;t smoke it that often anymore I still love it. Honestly nothing bad to say about it, I just got bored of the same stuff after a while.

VThe Lemon G that I got from The LoDo Wellness Center in Denver is definitely aromatic and tastes of citrus; contrary to the description provided on leafly.  It is definitely an uplifting Sativa, but it does have a paranoid Indica effect initially.  It eventually wore off within about ten minutes but I have been a heavy smoker for years so I wouldn&#39;t recommend this strain for new smokers, it might just ruin your whole night lol.  It is, on the other hand, a good strain for the &quot;I&#39;ve got stuff to do&quot; Indica lover.

VLemon G at Terrapin Care station is their prided CBD strain with 13% THC and 9% CBD. Super well rounded and packs that head clearing punch that CBD strains have and gives a tinge through the body with a euphoric sense. Nugs are very dense, berry like packed with orange hairs and a skunky lemon scent. Taste lends more\u000a to that sour skunk than citrus. \u000a

There&#39;s also chunkyness or gluey ness to this high thats easy to embrace because it&#39;s a nice mellow high..unlike how Gorill glue or sour d can hit you wierd if you&#39;re not in the right mood and induce anxiety, I micro and max dosed this one w 0 worry of anxiety on a full 1/2 gram vape.\u000a\u000aLike many &quot;0+&quot; weeds &quot;as in 0+ universal blood type&quot;  this universal strain will amplify other strain characteristics.

VSuper duper.  My caregiver gave me this &quot;from Ohio&quot; strain last week and I can&#39;t get enough. \u000aThough I usually prefer an indica this sativa rocks. \u000aA great smoke if you have chores to do.  Keeps you moving along. Also loads of laughs and giggles.  Very uplifting.  \u000aA good day time smoke or out dancing kind of smoke. \u000aTastes and smells really great, so lemony.  Though very pungent and needs to be in a good glass jar or everyone around you will know you have it on you.

VMy second review on this strain as I have decided it is my all time favorite Sativa (or day time) CBD strain. Gumbi is my favorite Indica (or evening and nighttime) CBD strain. I like the affordability of Lemon G more than Gumbi as well. \u000a.\u000aLemon G is super mellow and offers medical relief. I am someone who gets anxious or edgy from most Sativa strains. Lemon G doesn&#39;t get me dis-functional or anxiously stoned at all! \u000a\u000aFurthermore I find this acts as a &quot;chill pill.&quot; If you are experiencing aggro or are stressed about something, it will ground you and you will find yourself thinking, &quot;Why was I so worked up about that?!&quot; Could even quell a panic attack or worse. So in some sense it gives clarity as well as better perspective. Great stuff!

VThis sativa has a very interesting head buzz; it&#39;s contents are sure to please all. There is a very nice citrus scent, and I&#39;d personally say it gives my pot receptors major erections. If you ever come across this strain, please give it a whiff. To get the best results, grind before hand, as the taste is much better. It does leave your mouth a bit scaly, but I hope you didn&#39;t forget ya drank. Overall, I&#39;d give this 8 Ron Jeremys out of 10. Hope this review helps. fagit

VThis is a mellow but uplifting strain. I notice that it makes me feel a little groggy for about 10 minutes and then that feeling dissipates. Excellent for pain and mood though it does make you a little more stoned than i\u2019d expected based on the reviews. I reach for this when I have cramps or back pain and don\u2019t have to get any work done.

VI purchased a CBD-rich variant at Terrapin in Boulder, CO.  So far, this has been the most effective treatment for back pain I have experienced when I remember to stretch in the morning!  The citrus scent with hints of spice and sweets hits your nose the second you open your jar, becoming more overt after the flower is well-ground.  It&#39;s a very smooth smoke, easy to inhale while down with a cold.  The taste reflects the smell, with a good citrus taste true to its name, shifting to a pleasant hint of leather at the end.  The high is extremely heady and giggly, and overall positive and euphoric.  It keeps me high longer than I like, so this is a good smoke to have recreationally before going out.  Medically, it serves great pain relief and will keep you relaxed and loose if you&#39;re just planning to lounge around at home.  Overall, would recommend for both medical and recreational use!

VFantastic strain. For those who want a strong cerebral sativa but don&#39;t want to forfeit the relaxing body high of a good indica, this is the strain for you. Paranoia (or sativa anxiety) was at a minimum, especially for such a potent sativa. Great Blend of both worlds. Not particularly energetic, but good for day or night use. One of my favorites

VLemon G is one of my new favorite strains. I was Leary at first being that its listed as a Sativa and I&#39;m more of an Indica fan. Which I still dont understand being that it comes from Indica parents. Namely G13..But wow. First off the smell of this strain is amazing. Very strong smell that wakes up the room the minute your open up the packaging container. A very bright Earthy Lemony  smell..  Same with the flavor. A nice earthy Lemony taste of the exhale that lingers on the tounge. For me the effects are Euphoric, relaxing but uplifting at the same time. More Euphoric and relaxing at higher vape temps around 415 degrees and more uplifting on lower temps. But still very similar on either temp. No anxiety whatsoever. And a very smooth vapor. A great any time of the day strain. You wont feel couch locked and lazy if you use it in the morning and it wont keep you up all night if you use it late. By far this will be one of my main go to strains from now on. And most likely my favorite.  A+ . 5 star!!!

VPicked up a quarter of this strain from my local MI dispensary. Was told this beauty was imported from Ohio and that it was potent. Smoked it later that evening and I am now here stating the following feelings in review. Very happy and giggly feelings are strong with a hint of tingling. Used preferably for medical use to help treat pain and nausea, also providing a little stress relief. Negatives haven&#39;t sunk in yet, but I do expect cotton mouth and dry eyes. Length with well pass 80 minutes if smoking a bowl amount. Great taste of lemon and very rare!

VSmoked 1 hit from a small bowl and was very well medicated. Giggled and laughed with my girlfriend at silly things quickly. Proceeded to feel &#39;iced&#39;, where my body was a pleasant numb feeling. I was aware of what I was physically doing with it, but I couldn&#39;t feel it. It was as if I was watching my body go about its business from within my own head. My muscles were incredibly relaxed, to the point I was shaking. Had pretty hard couch lock surprisingly, although I did not feel lazy. Was incredibly engrossed in the show I was watching. (Both my girl and I sat in near silence watching Family Guy for about 2 hours). It went into a stage where I was unable to feel my internal machinery (such as: lungs filling with air, stomach gurgling etc). At the peak, my short term memory was so impaired, I was forgetting things I was saying within the sentence I was saying them. Certainly a fun, bonding way to spend a Sunday night alone with your significant other. As I slowly started to sober up, the &#39;iced&#39; feeling &#39;melted&#39;, and I was able to move again.  Very strong stuff (again, this was all off of one good, deep hit). While my girl and I normally smoke the same amount each Sunday, it&#39;s outdoors while my parents are home, and I believe that curtails my experience. When I was finally able to relax indoors and not have to &#39;keep it on the down-low&#39;, the full power and complexity of the experience could wash over me. I will certainly be medicating to this degree when given another opportunity.

VThe lab analysis for this strain at my dispensary weren&#39;t impressive.  With about 13.5% thca, 0.3%thc and trace cbda, I was buying this strain for the taste and appearance, expecting to have to use more to get to my desired dosage.  The smell is a funky lemon and not so much a fresh lemon.  It is more like the smell of lemon squeezed on fried food.  The flavor is like the smell and kind of like lemon flavored potato chips.  There were lots of crystals and dark brown hairs spread throughout the puffy, light and totally not dense buds.   The high is amazingly happy.  It is a flowing stream of happy, motivating sunshine that comes right from the chest to the back of the eyes in a rhythmic ebb and flow.  Its not all about the thc and cbd percentages, terpenes play a BIG role.  This high is more tangible and enjoyable that a deathstar 23% thc high that I had, which is totally unexpected.

VLemon G is one of my new favorite strains. I was Leary at first being that its listed as a Sativa and I&#39;m more of an Indica fan. Which I still dont understand being that it comes from Indica parents. Namely G13..But wow. First off the smell of this strain is amazing. Very strong smell that wakes up the room the minute your open up the packaging container. A very bright Earthy Lemony  smell..  Same with the flavor. A nice earthy Lemony taste of the exhale that lingers on the tounge. For me the effects are Euphoric, relaxing but uplifting at the same time. More Euphoric and relaxing at higher vape temps around 415 degrees and more uplifting on lower temps. But still very similar on either temp. No anxiety whatsoever. And a very smooth vapor. A great any time of the day strain. You wont feel couch locked and lazy if you use it in the morning and it wont keep you up all night if you use it late. By far this will be one of my main go to strains from now on. And most likely my favorite.  A+ . 5 star!!!

VWow Lemon G, you sure surprised me! \u000a\u000aI figured I was just picking up another lemony sativa that be mediocre nothing special. Wrong!\u000a\u000aThe buzz is VERY uplifting. I suffer from various mood problems, and this brings me out of it very fast.\u000a\u000aPicked up a half gram distillate syringe 40% THc 30% CBD by Terrapin \u000athis is now one of my favorites.\u000a\u000aYou can feel the G13 parent, and ai can medicate any time of day with this.

VThis is a mellow but uplifting strain. I notice that it makes me feel a little groggy for about 10 minutes and then that feeling dissipates. Excellent for pain and mood though it does make you a little more stoned than i\u2019d expected based on the reviews. I reach for this when I have cramps or back pain and don\u2019t have to get any work done.

VLEMON G a nice smooth HIGH CBD STRAIN. for those who have read my reviews know that PAIN controls my life for 25+ years.\u000aI got an 1/8 of this for the CBD n prepared it..CAREFULL I might have gotten a drier batch so check for moisture so ya don\u2019t grind it to dust.\u000aIt was a smooth uplifting feeling slowly releasing stress, spasms and overall MODERATE PAIN...I\u2019m sure if ya added some CBD it would handle stronger or Neuro pain.\u000aThis is a nice mid afternoon as CBD gives ya that clear head \u000are-energized feeling yet the Lemon G keeps ya mellow.\u000a\u000aOverall I like this but if you have EXTREME pain ADD CBD if not this is a nice strain to get relief while nourishing your body with Cannabinoids.

VThis is really great for depression.  I feel that it is uplifting without the accompanying anxiety that I usually associate with heady strains.  It eases my mind and keeps me doing things.  I&#39;m usually down for the count after smoking, but I ended up staying awake much longer than I had intended to during the first night.  The value is good because it is so strong.

VWell, it was definitely a head/cerebral effect. It had hazy in spades. Felt like half of a high though, like it was missing the euphoria, painkilling, and uplifting components of Golden Goat or Strawberry Cough. I wouldn&#39;t call it a bad time, but I would choose something else for the effects I&#39;m after (uplifting, creative, euphoric, anxiety-reducing).

VThe effects of the strain come on very strong and initially can be a tad sedating with an uptick in energy as the effects plateau. The scent of the strain is REMARKABLE, hints of a pungent fuel are buried under an ocean of citrusy lemon. For such a strong smell, the taste is not a very strong one.

VI&#39;ve been dabbing some Lemon G wax over the last few days and I have been totally blown away by the experience! One of the headiest head highs I have ever enjoyed, but it keeps my body loosey-goosey. Colors pop. Music is in surround sound. Even the most mundane experience (like mowing the lawn) becomes an adventure for the mind while the body hangs loose and enjoys the ride. Pretty tasty, too.

VSmoked 1 hit from a small bowl and was very well medicated. Giggled and laughed with my girlfriend at silly things quickly. Proceeded to feel &#39;iced&#39;, where my body was a pleasant numb feeling. I was aware of what I was physically doing with it, but I couldn&#39;t feel it. It was as if I was watching my body go about its business from within my own head. My muscles were incredibly relaxed, to the point I was shaking. Had pretty hard couch lock surprisingly, although I did not feel lazy. Was incredibly engrossed in the show I was watching. (Both my girl and I sat in near silence watching Family Guy for about 2 hours). It went into a stage where I was unable to feel my internal machinery (such as: lungs filling with air, stomach gurgling etc). At the peak, my short term memory was so impaired, I was forgetting things I was saying within the sentence I was saying them. Certainly a fun, bonding way to spend a Sunday night alone with your significant other. As I slowly started to sober up, the &#39;iced&#39; feeling &#39;melted&#39;, and I was able to move again.  Very strong stuff (again, this was all off of one good, deep hit). While my girl and I normally smoke the same amount each Sunday, it&#39;s outdoors while my parents are home, and I believe that curtails my experience. When I was finally able to relax indoors and not have to &#39;keep it on the down-low&#39;, the full power and complexity of the experience could wash over me. I will certainly be medicating to this degree when given another opportunity.

VI got a half oz of this strain and it is easily some of the best I have smoked. In the 9 years of my smoking career this Lemon G packs quite a punch. The dense nugs full of trichomes and hairs that just shimmer in the light. Besides its beautiful appearance, the potency is top shelf quality with effects lasting easily 2.5-3 hours of relief! One of my favorite strains thus far and hopefully I will be able to continue a relationship with this strain. 5/5!?
