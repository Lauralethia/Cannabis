VI. Love. Frida. This is an excellent Indica CBD, which for me. is always best for evening pain and insomnia. I felt tingly and warm after vaping some flower and it was amazing how my significant musculoskeletal pain really eased away with this, as did nerve and migraine pain on other occasions. I love high CBD strains and this is an excellent sample from Raven Grass. If you smoke this you will definitely feel the THC effects, but nothing too intense or anxiety inducing. Similar to Gilda, but with more THC effect and the warm tingling in my legs and areas of pain are superior in Frida. Also, LOVE the glass jars; unlike other brands that use glass, Raven Grass uses metal lids with a rubberized ring in the top that truly seals in the freshness of the product so it\u2019s not completely dry when you buy it. I appreciate any company that tries to steer clear of plastic. &#127795;&#129498;&#127995;\u200d\u2640\ufe0f&#127758;

VI have become more interested in CBD strains lately and ive been obtaining them from Raven Grass. I first tried &#39;Gilda&#39; and that felt like a nice warm blanket and provided comfort, really great for wanting to relax after a long day.\u000a\u000aI recently got &#39;Frida&#39;, also from Raven Grass, and I&#39;d have to say this strain really provided me with some great relief to my psoriatic arthritis but I got the similar feeling of Gilda, but it was more of a meditative feeling than a lay on the couch and relax feeling. It really helped with anxiety abd felt like a sigh of relief.

VThis strain is the best ever. I deal with high anxiety and panic attacks and it does the job. It&#39;s also very high quality and comes from another famous strain that I&#39;ve had called AC/DC. I fully disagree with the negatives saying anxiety because I can&#39;t smoke full strength strains high thc and this never makes me feel the same way. It&#39;s sister Gilda is also amazing

VIf you are looking for pain relief and don&#39;t want the high, this is the best I have found. \u000aI bought the concentrate -- and found it the best solution for pain and inflammation. Other strains had mixed results -- and I needed something without a high but with a strong CBD.

VI smoke this for crohns disease. This was the first time I have purchased this. I originally went into the store to purchase Alien Rock Candy but the lad advised me to try Frida due to its high CBD. \u000a\u000aI can assure people I got hit hard by the high even with a small amount. I usually smoke Sour Tsanami so not sure why that never gave me such a high. \u000a\u000aI will try again over time to see how it helps with my inflammation.

VThis is what I turn to as an athlete when I&#39;m nursing a serious injury.  Pain and the inability to sleep are the main reasons I seek out high CBD strains and concentrates, and Frida...she is the Queen. \u000a\u000aA lot of users might feel slightly high on this, but I honestly attribute that to the extreme relaxation that takes over your body about 5 minutes into your session.  There isn&#39;t much of a cerebral feel to this, but your body will melt.  Sleep is not going to be a hard thing to find if you take a healthy helping of what Frida has to offer.  \u000a\u000aThe inflammation reduction is real here.  It&#39;s the equivalent of toking on some seriously strong Aleve or Tylenol.  Your relief is noticeable almost immediately but with your wits still about you.

VI was actually looking for ACDC when the budtender recommended this strain for me. Given the two strains are related, I figured it was worth a shot.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s described as meditative on here, and I think that&#39;s a perfect word to describe the feeling of this strain. I could never close my eyes and try to meditate while stoned, just too dizzying, but I still sorta feel like I&#39;m in that same headspace when I&#39;m high on this strain.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve gotten a chance to mix it with some Harlequin, overall, a pretty mellow feeling, it&#39;s saved me from some pretty gnarly roller coaster-type highs.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s definitely a strain I&#39;ll continue to smoke, but, go through it pretty quick, haha! It&#39;s a nice strain for me.

VA friend suggested this strain for my arthritis. He said he didn&#39;t get the stoned feeling. Um, I did! It was a bit harsh to smoke, but kicked in within minutes. Super relaxing and pain free evening for me. I will definitely be smoking this before bed more often.

VI love mixing this strain with some of my other weed. I try to balance the mix to around a 1:1 CBD/THC ratio. I have some strains that are +30% in THC that tend to be overwhelming at times so adding this helps to alleviate the anxiety / negative effects.
