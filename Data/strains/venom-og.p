VBought 2 grams from a local dispensary. The Looks: Like a giant yucca plant the way it sticks out like a pointy bush. The hairs on this are heavily darkened maroon color. Closer up there are some small compact lavender poking through. Shaped like a trimmed rose bud/medium sized popcorn kernel; I can hardly see any calyxes the terps and stubble leaf cover up the integrated structure. These are some super dank nuggets they are heavily hairy and super tough to break apart!\u000aThe Smell: Musty, Gasoline/Petrol, chemical and pungent peanut smell like AK-47. \u000aThe Bag is super heavy thick fog, so thick I can&#39;t read any number gage dial on it through the vape. \u000aThe Taste: Is Must, wood, chestnut and very harsh and dry. The vape lingers for a bit as it stick around swirling in the over headlight.\u000aSo far its making me more relaxed as irt starts to react on the top of my head and eyes that soon follow. It starting to react on the joints that hurt the most hamstrings and slowly warm buzz over my temps on the sides of my head. The stoner heavy relaxed kind of yea man attitude arrives in my mind, I am more reactive as time seems to slow down for me in my quick and mighty reflexes. I recommend those who need a relaxed body bud happily concentrated mind. I suffer from a wide range of health problems including anorexia, Fatigue, Glaucoma, and chronic depression/stress, with ADHD and lots of pain. If you suffer from a wide range of not having an appetite, and I have also found that it helps keep my allergies away its good, but needs to be heavier and the taste is bleh. I feel kind of happy a little euphoric, though could definitely be stronger for sure!

VFull body high, including a relaxed, calm head buzz. Highly soothing, especially good for sore muscles.  Great for watching a movie, any kind would be highly entertaining and may even inspire.

VI really like Venom OG but for me it is not like your typical MJ that gets you really high. I prefer to use this strain at night. Using it regularly for a week I had some insomnia but after a week I slept like a baby. I found it very relaxing both for the muscles and the soul. This is a nice strain to relax in the evenings or to top off before bed to help you sleep. I did not experience couchlock or extreme fatigue or sleepiness. If you smoke a lot you can get a slight headache/head pressure when inhaling. I would not recommend it if you are looking for a more intense cerebral high, however, his could become my evening &quot;go to&quot; strain.\u000a\u000aThe strain can make you very social to the point of causing diarrhea of the mouth. You will be apt to get dry mouth though so keep your favorite beverage handy! Munchies were very manageable which was a big plus for me.\u000a\u000aThe ultimate compliment I can give this strain is it helps me unplug from work at the end of the day.

So if you are looking at different bud, this strain will grab you with its red hairs. Beware...

VI picked this one up at essence on the strip in Vegas and was from Desert Grown Farms. Amazing smell and the buds are dense and tightly packed with a beautiful coating of trichomes. We have gone through about an ounce of this so far and it is definitely one of my favorites. Be careful though, I smoked too much on the second time I ended up getting paranoid(only time it ever happened on this strain)

VVery Euphoric strain. The name does it justice on that front. Not 100% sure on the genetics of the strain but I enjoyed it. Not a top-shelf strain but I picked it up for $8 a gram. $75 for 14 grams. I still have a bit that i&#39;m saving for the next time I go to a movie. Colors and sounds are very amplified. Music sounds great. Would be a great medicinal strain for those who are either Depressed, Anxious, or Stressed!

VI bought an eighth of this for bedtime use, and wow. Great mind relaxer, but a very subtle body high which made it great for my migraines. My only complaint with it is that it isn&#39;t super euphoric, so it isn&#39;t fantastic for out of the house use IMO. Extremely body-locking.

VDecent one for relaxation and pain management later in the day. I have found this to be a good head high as much as a physical relief but indica (and it&#39;s relatives) often make me very lazy- not such a bad thing before bed or if you having trouble relaxing. For some sensitive people I could see this strain making them paranoid. I like listening to headphones as I drift off to sleep with this strain, music or meditation and deep relaxation. The taste was kinda &quot;icy&quot; if you know what I mean, and I did cough a bit more than I like but it&#39;s worth it lol Only two blasts on the bong and I was feeling it which is wicked for a long timer like me and after a snack and warm milk I&#39;m kicking arthritis &amp; insomnia in the ass \u262e\ufe0f

VBelieve it or not I scored some venom og in Oklahoma City. At first I thought this place was too conservative for cannabis (it is) but apparently good stuff is available. I got 14 gms for $150 which I thought was a deal but I read one of the reviews on this page where the person scored the same amount for $75. I&#39;d love to be buying at that price. \u000a\u000aAnyway, the strain is as described in the main description on this page - the buds are forest green with orange hairs and has what I find an incredible skunky lime piny and diesel ( I can taste the diesel when I smoke it) smell to it. It&#39;s incredible what people are doing with Marijuana these days.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I would prefer another strain for daily use that wouldn&#39;t make me lounge like venom og does. However, this strain is really good for medical use IMO.

VI suffer from migraines and this strain helps alleviate the pain and also help with the nausea. This is the highest strain of CBD that I&#39;ve tried so far and I really liked it. I would recommend this strain to anybody who doesn&#39;t normally smoke because it has a lower % of THC and a higher level of CBD. It is great for pain. Also it does have that skunky smell that is pretty strong. I like it and it smells of that dankyness, that I associate with quality product.

VAmazing High-CBD strain. This nug was tested at 6% CBD, I believe, which is about 10 times the average of most strains on the market right now. Less THC too, so there is virtually no disorienting effects. \u000aIt&#39;s a lot like a very heavy indica, but more focused, awake and aroused.  \u000aSeems to get the blood flowing - I felt horny and my skin was flushed. My toes have been numb more lately. Remedy fixed this. May be of help to MS and Raynaud&#39;s sufferers. \u000aNot much can be said much about flavor, other than that it&#39;s very earthy and woodsy. Notes of wormwood. A bit of a medicine flavor, actually. Doesn&#39;t have that typical marijuana smell, so it&#39;s very discreet.

VPowerful! This strain tastes amazing with strong pine and diesel. I love OG\u2019s and this one is definitely a hard hitter. You could smoke too much of this though. Smoked most of a joint and it laid me out. I didn\u2019t wake up refreshed though I woke up with that buzzy high pitched hangover so I would keep this to a few hits at a time. But damn the flavor you just wanna keep smoking it to taste that flavor. Great OG strain for high tolerance people.

I&#39;ve received it in kief form, which my magnificently hunk of a hotty husband who so generously uses his very  and &quot;oh so talented&quot; hands to roll it into the tastiest, &quot;joints made of Blackberry Kush and varieties of kief&#39;s&quot;.  Tonight&#39;s was with Venom kief.\u000aIt takes me nearly a whole joint to myself, but it reliably makes me able to fall asleep much more quickly.  \u000a\u000aMy #1 choice for insomnia

VJust picked up this strain as well, and its phenomenal! Smoked its in my bong before i went to sleep and it did justice for me. It smells very well, its almost earthy but fresh (just what i like in my indicas) its dense and breaks down quite well. Hits smooth and it was very tasty, the high was nice, relaxing, calming and it got me ready for bed and took away my migraines. All in all the Venom Og is well worth getting.

VI tried this one because it was high in CBD and it&#39;s percentages were in line with the rest of what I tried. I live with pain and muscle spasms. While it did cover my pain, I didn&#39;t enjoy this at all. Neither did the person who smoked it with me. It left her edgy, with a racing heart, unable to relax for more than an hour afterwards. It left me not remotely tired, uncomfortable, not relaxed. It hits you fast and hard. I wouldn&#39;t do this one at night if your looking to chill. Better if you have a bunch of stuff to do, and are busy, it might put you in the mood to clean the house. \u000aBut I really didn&#39;t enjoy it.

Smoked most of a joint and it laid me out. I didn\u2019t wake up refreshed though I woke up with that buzzy high pitched hangover so I would keep this to a few hits at a time. But damn the flavor you just wanna keep smoking it to taste that flavor. Great OG strain for high tolerance people.

VDecent one for relaxation and pain management later in the day. I have found this to be a good head high as much as a physical relief but indica (and it&#39;s relatives) often make me very lazy- not such a bad thing before bed or if you having trouble relaxing. For some sensitive people I could see this strain making them paranoid. I like listening to headphones as I drift off to sleep with this strain, music or meditation and deep relaxation. The taste was kinda &quot;icy&quot; if you know what I mean, and I did cough a bit more than I like but it&#39;s worth it lol Only two blasts on the bong and I was feeling it which is wicked for a long timer like me and after a snack and warm milk I&#39;m kicking arthritis &amp; insomnia in the ass \u262e\ufe0f

VBelieve it or not I scored some venom og in Oklahoma City. At first I thought this place was too conservative for cannabis (it is) but apparently good stuff is available. I got 14 gms for $150 which I thought was a deal but I read one of the reviews on this page where the person scored the same amount for $75. I&#39;d love to be buying at that price. \u000a\u000aAnyway, the strain is as described in the main description on this page - the buds are forest green with orange hairs and has what I find an incredible skunky lime piny and diesel ( I can taste the diesel when I smoke it) smell to it. It&#39;s incredible what people are doing with Marijuana these days.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I would prefer another strain for daily use that wouldn&#39;t make me lounge like venom og does. However, this strain is really good for medical use IMO.

Vthis strain is great.  Overall there is a sutle head high, and feel very relaxed.  Not the largest nugs, but smell very piney, lemony, diesel, and minty.

VVenom is a really good strain to just smoke throughout a relaxing day and chill.  It takes the edge off stress without causing complacency or knocking you out too hard.

VVenom OG is a strong hitting Indica, with a sharp taste. Be careful if your a lightweight cuz this stuff will floor you!   8.0/10

VSurprised Leafly was missing this strain. Expect a strong hit for the lungs with this one. The high comes quick, unfortunately with a dry mouth as well. Make sure to have a lot of food, you&#39;re going to need it. Overall a good strand.

VFuchi AF! Smelled heavy on pine, dank, skunky, pungent, but there was that nice berry scent and a bit of sweet citrus. Tasted sweet, piney, flowery, woody, and like prechewed lemon heads - the citrus was light, but not lemon pledge heavy. The smoke was nice and smooth, easy to take in. This strain was amazing for muscle spasms and pain, nerve pain, back pain, helped me not feel my dislocated ribs, and helped with inflammation because my Costochondritis pain went away. The downside is I became extremely emotional and zoned out a lot, super spacy. Personally, I don&#39;t like crying like a bitch all of the time and this made me do that. I want to make a point and say I didn&#39;t have any seizures while medicated on this strain, I don&#39;t know whether or not it &#39;helped&#39; and it&#39;s coincidence that I just haven&#39;t had any - but I wanted to throw that out there just in case it helps someone else.

VTangerine Haze smells and tastes just like you expect it to. It is a 60/40 sativa dominant hybrid that hits fast and gives you the effects of a sativa with a little body buzz.
