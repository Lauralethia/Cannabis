VIt gets 4 stars just because the bud I sampled was a bit harsh, and made me cough. \u000aHowever. It&#39;s got a smooth flavor, a nice slow onset of the buzz, I almost instantly felt my stress melt away with the first puff, and the rumors about the aroused feeling are definitely true.

VGood day time strain. No side effects as far as I could tell. Probably not so great of a strain for bed, contrary to the budtender recommendation.

VMy personal favorite. Fun for when you&#39;re with someone else *wink wink* For a sativa its got a pretty relaxing high if you don&#39;t do too much of it.

VSmall compact buds that break up perfectly for the bong. Smell has that familiar, fuelish bite, co-mingled with a citrusy thing. I wasn&#39;t particularly taken by the taste, either on the inhale or the exhale. The high though, is quick and strong. Surely you can feel the sativa rush, but I&#39;m also feeling pretty spacey and easily distracted. Not in a bad way, I can still focus on this review, haha, just that I don&#39;t think I&#39;d try this if I were somewhere I had to be &quot;on.&quot;

VProbably the best sativa I&#39;ve ever smoked. Amazing smell, slight bite on the taste but an immediate head change. It&#39;s like a good Scotch whiskey and would be a sin to waste.
