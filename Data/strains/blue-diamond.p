VIde give it a 3.5. There was nothing bad about this one but there was also nothing too outstanding. What I did like was the way it worked for stress/anxiety. It took a minute but once it hit, I was just calm and content. Very nice body buzz that lasted long enough to get to know the strain but then would be gone. Sort of left me wanting more but enjoyable nonetheless. Not to much of a cerebral experience but kinda hovered in the back of my mind. Tasted pretty nice. Earthy and sweet. Left a pungent taste that lingered for a while. Wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to try again.

V I woke up this morning and went straight for the Blue Diamond. I vape a 90% distillate from a pen. First few draws I had a nice headband effect, 100+mg in and I now feel like a tiny woman is sitting atop and massaging each of my eyelids ... I feel no pain and total relaxation and peace. This strain tastes berry and sweet with a touch of gassiness to it. Very smooth. I don\u2019t give 5.0/5.0 easy! (Holy Grail &amp; Fire OG are the only other liquid vapes I\u2019ve rated this high) Definitely getting this one again at any opportunity. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to relax and be super chilled out.

VThis strain carries a good potency. There&#39;s a very subtle notes of pine and berry when you smell or taste it. The buzz is relatively intense and start with a pleasant euphoria to rapidly finish with a body couch lock trip. A bit strong for a beginner but nice for an average user. Very good to go to sleep or for a chill movie night.

VA very nice relaxing, stress relieving and anti-anxiety strain... Absolutely perfect for ending a long and stressful day at work. Puts you in a great mood, and makes it really easy to talk to anyone. However if over indulged upon, one often finds themselves staring off into space for long periods at a time, and eating everything and anything in the kitchen. \u000aBut I would give this strain a 4.7 outta 5

VBlue diamond was amazing. It was my first time trying this strain and it blew me away. You can feel the effects in seconds! It is an extreme head high. Very uplifting, I felt relieve of stress, depression, and  anxiety. This is  definitely for  day time use. One thing that is amazing about this strain is it helped me focus alot. I usually have a hard time focusing, and that is one of the reasons I use Sativa.  This strain improved my focus, and it helped me get things done like paperwork. While it helped alleviate my symptoms, It also expanded my mind.  The buzz lasted for a long time, and I felt relieve and uplifted.\u000a\u000aIf you are looking for a strain to stay up, get creative, and get thing&#39;s done, I recommend Blue Diamond.

VVery potent strain! Full of medicine and thc ;) it&#39;s a very strong cerebral stimulating effect, but also head tingling. It&#39;s very uplifting and makes you so giggly and a couple of hits (some what milky from a bong). I got stuck on this last night. (so high you can&#39;t move just sit there and watch everything move) I was on a straight trip. I&#39;m high on it now but not as bad lol ;). By the way it was a good trip not a bad trip like many first time medicated patients. If you happen to find this get it! It&#39;s in most larger dispensaries in Denver btw :) you just have to ask for it.

VI got this &quot;platinum&quot; version. The smell was very platinum as expected. Smells super fuchi, dank, deep berries, and pine mixed in with some fertilizer. Packed 1/2 a bowl and it was a pretty smooth and light smoke, tasted like flower petals, sweet, piney, dank, and raw bell peppers... mmmm! This helped with inflammation and asthma - I could breathe pretty decently on this. Helped with my back pain 4/5, my spine injuries 5/5, and I didn&#39;t cough once. It didn&#39;t help with nerve pain or other muscle pain - just the back (which is great for someone who needs back relief). I felt the peek, was nice - got stoned, was a creeper though.

VVery time warping strain. NOT a good strain for arthritis or chronic back pain, even after several bowls I could still feel my pain pretty clearly. Sometimes when I smoke this I tend to get paranoid, something I&#39;ve never felt with any other strain. Would recommend if you&#39;re looking for an strong head high

VBrought this to a party last night and we had a blast. First off it doesnt hit you ober the head is slowly fades in and keeps steady. Time slows down and everything is better jokes become funnier, people dont hold back anymore.. One of the best socialble herbs Ive smoked in a while. Cheers!

VThe first few joints had a nice effect but it changed very quickly; after less than a week I started having big headaches right after the 2nd or 3rd joint. I don&#39;t recommend it if you smoke often and a lot. Also, I began to get tired and felt heavy quite quickly.

VSurprisingly good. First time I\u2019ve tried this strain and it definitely helped me eat a full meal including a salad (minus the lettuce) and calmed me down enough to relax. Good taste, not too harsh on the lungs, and I had a cold! Perfect for a relaxing day when you\u2019re not feeling well I guess. But still good overall.

VI got this as an extract, clear gold, hard pull-snap. The flavor was amazing. It was like I had a berry RUNTZ in my mouth, sugar and all. \u000a\u000aPotency was nothing special. Its a very relaxing high. It settled my stomach and put me in an excellent mood. I couldn&#39;t stop smiling. It also made for a great night&#39;s sleep.

VThis is a fine herb to smoke and chill back in a winter. The taste is sweet and earthly kinda like hashish but less harsh. The trip is light, and tender. Just make sure to stay hydrated, a pineapple juice would be the perfect match for the blue diamond ;)

VBlue Diamond is one of kind of indica smokes I have had. The sweet, fresh uplifting aroma give it a mellow smoke, not harsh at all. The effects take a little time to kick in, but when they do it&#39;s everso lasting. No headaches, clean to the dome euphoric high with It&#39;s own hidden secrets, I can confirm Blue diamond is a natural  aphrodisiac, long lasting for men. In other words this green can be a alternative to the BLUE pill.

VI could barely move, I ached all over and could barely move my neck. Three small full tokes and I am feeling a bit more able to move and the pain is relieved from 8/10 to 3/10. Pretty good medicine and from the law of good financial sense, only about 3 dollars. After the heady feeling dissipated, the pain relief lasted for a full 4 hours. Thank you Blue Diamond!
