VPersonally the best strain for myself I&#39;ve ever experimented with. Gives me a clear minded head high, but i can also be relaxed when I don&#39;t have things to get\u000a done around the house. \u000a

VEverything, from the bud structure to the fragrant sweet floral smell with a strong herbal spiciness, yell pure sativa. But the effects are where it really reveals itself in its full glory - an intense, soaring head high born aloft by a sense of euphoria which wells up from deep within and contaminates your entire being with an infectious joyfulness. And the trippiness is there too - at times, the vast mental space of your expanded consciousness can become difficult to navigate, if you smoke enough. Yet you always have the positive will within you and a surge of that light, tingling body high - almost elecric - enveloping your body, that you can find your eventual destination. Throughout this journey, time dilation and even mild visuals may please the senses as the mind rapidly wanders through many strange yet pleasing thought-patterns, which weave an intricate web of overlapping yet separate thought patterns looping back around to meet and meld in with each other until eventually they grow too intricately fused to still be separated or even distinguished as separates or even be remembered.... wait that was I thinking about?\u000aSeriously though, this is a powerful, heady, energetic sativa which in small doses will leave you energized and uplifted to do various day-time activities, while high doses will blast you so high mentally, that those same activities may be difficult simply due to extreme cerebral impairment (even though the body remains feeling light, not heavy or tired). Great smoke! Careful though, I could see this causing some anxiety or paranoia for those who don&#39;t like sativas or have a low tolerance and aren&#39;t prepared for the type of effects this type of weed will have on you. But for sativa lovers, this is a must try!

VVery nice Sativa.  Light floral flavor via vaping.  We liked the relaxing head high, yet able to get things done.
