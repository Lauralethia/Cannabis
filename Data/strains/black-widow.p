Vmr. nice&#39;s black widow is a wonderful strain. thats why its all over the world under the name white widow. however when mr.nice (creator) left ghsc he co started a company. so what once was white is now is black.\u000a\u000aand there is a noticeable difference between mr.nice&#39;s black and all other whites. and if you smoke them, you&#39;ll know. (unless you happen to come across any white widow cuttings, plants, or seeds that were made by ghsc a bit before mr.nice a.k.a howard marks left ghsc. then you are very lucky)\u000a\u000athe scent is sweet and a bit like ammonia. some earthy undertones. the taste is nice and piney.\u000a\u000athe high is a bit social but if your laying down you might  fall asleep. clean stone. \u000a\u000a

VOMG! I&#39;ve been new to this and bouncing around a bit. Most of my preferred ways to indulge have been ingesting edibles, vaping small samples of flower and the oil THC cartridges. It&#39;s mostly for anxiety and muscle spasms. Teaching...\u000a\u000aAnyway, (shout out intended) I went to my awesome dispensary and was first introduced to this and another strain by Jenn. She initially suggested a different one for me.  But I&#39;m a rebel and heard so much about the controversy over this strain.As an English teacher I like conflict so I just had to try.\u000a\u000aMeh! and disappointment, especially  compared to other hybrids tried. Wish I listen to the experts. You live and learn. \u000a\u000aBut let&#39;s fast forward.\u000a\u000aJust gave it another try based on a friend&#39;s suggestion. I used a bong! \u000a\u000aThis. Weed. Is. The. Best!!!\u000a\u000aFinally, (again, shout out intended) I feel something that addresses my anxiety, tension spasms and elevates my mind! I came home at 6ish after being in traffic to visit Ermont for weed and then home. I cooked and went shopping for a school project and am now writing this. After I will grade some quizzes I intended to do tomorrow. It is 10:30pm, and usually I am dead tired and achy. \u000a\u000aYou should also know I am 45, a woman going through &quot;the change&quot; and nights are often uncomfortable. I haven&#39;t had a flash. They are regular at night regardless of whether I sleep. I feel relaxed but so calm in mind too and ready to focus. Also, in the background there is a tingly sensation, euphoria? Arousal? Not sure. It is slight but there. \u000a\u000aMy friend said earlier when I tried it, I wasn&#39;t practiced with the method. Maybe I did something wrong? I think so as I only had a gram, but probably wasted most with clumsy skill. \u000a\u000aI give this 4 stars. It was earthy, sensual and smooth on inhale. Almost musky and herbal on exhale. First I noticed a keen sense of self, sinking and relaxing. Then, the world got lighter, less burdened and the weight was binding and comforting, but not entrapment. I was able to continue business as usual. I have mental stamina, but not so much as to cause insomnia. I know I can sleep at will.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve had a few other strains that were indica hybrids. Most don&#39;t last very long. This is lingering and softly dissipating, no anxiety rush or desire to take another toke. I&#39;m all good!\u000a\u000aMother earth and skillfull growers, thank you for this strain. Thank you Jenn and Ermont for helping me have access to it!

Whenever I see it, I have to buy it. The next time I come into the dispensary, It&#39;s always been gone. At every dispensary I&#39;ve gone to that has had it, the case seems to be the same.

VBud smells like ammonia but once vaped tastes sweet and musky. Instant soaring head high (makes you a little giggly) and an all over body buzz. It feels like every blood vessel in my body is vibrating..  feels amaaazing. Kills all my IBD related pain and still gives me an appetite even on the worst of days. I&#39;m an indica lover and need something very medicinal, and black widow exceeds my standards.

VI kept passing over buying this strain from my LP when it was available at $9 per gram because, as per the strain description, I figured it wasn&#39;t going to be the best to relieve my medical symptoms. It was reduced to $6 a gram and I thought at that price I would give it a try. I was not disappointed!! This strain is very mellow, relaxing and actually relieved my chronic pain effectively. It is a creeper though....the full effects take about 1/2 hour to be really felt. The result is a very pleasant &quot;high&quot; with appetite stimulation and eventually .......zzzzzz.  Great strain :o)

VThe Black Widow Marijuana strain has been referred to as the evil sister to the White Widow Marijuana stain. Exactly like the White Widow strain, the Black Widow has a very high THC concentration, and will put you on the couch for long periods of time if too much is consumed. Though is that is the desired effect, then by all means consume as much as you want. The Black Widow stain is a sativa-dominant hybrid that once won first place at the 1995 Cannabis Cup.

VFirst time trying it. Didn&#39;t think it would do much after the first few puffs. 3 in total. 15 minuets later- it crept up gradually. Nice smooth happy weed. Cant stop smiling. Very relaxing. Not racy or paranoid. A completely functional stone mildly potent.. As other patients describe it- takes a small amount to have a substantial effect. Highly recommended to add to your flower palette.

VThe Black Widow Marijuana strain has been referred to as the evil sister to the White Widow Marijuana stain. Exactly like the White Widow strain, the Black Widow has a very high THC concentration, and will put you on the couch for long periods of time if too much is consumed. Though is that is the desired effect, then by all means consume as much as you want. The Black Widow stain is a sativa-dominant hybrid that once won first place at the 1995 Cannabis Cup.

The earthiness really comes through well in the oil I must say I&#39;ve smoked a lot of weed in my time, I love it! There is nothing better tasting than a quality BHO and the Black Widow oil I have right now looks amazing like light gold honey, smells amazing like fresh terps, and at 87% THC it&#39;s high is awesome upbeat, while still being mildly relaxing and plenty euphoric great strain for a group setting very social. White Widow / Black Widow who cares there both awesome.

VReally really good daytime strain. Picked up the last gram of oil in the shop. Amazing flavor instantly took me back to better days. The earthiness really comes through well in the oil I must say I&#39;ve smoked a lot of weed in my time, I love it! There is nothing better tasting than a quality BHO and the Black Widow oil I have right now looks amazing like light gold honey, smells amazing like fresh terps, and at 87% THC it&#39;s high is awesome upbeat, while still being mildly relaxing and plenty euphoric great strain for a group setting very social. White Widow / Black Widow who cares there both awesome.

VI was sceptical about this strain being near as good as white widow but was quite pleased. Its soft and crumbs nicely, its not particularly very strong smelling but has a nice and soft aroma to it. I found the high quite dreamy and uplifting in general and sat around with a happy grin on my face for the duration :)\u000a\u000aAfter grinding it up the smell seemed to intensify.

VI found this strain pretty boring. Most seedbanks say this strain is mostly sativa ,but I found it to not be very powerful or cerebral and felt more of the indica side. It does give the  munchies fairly well so it is good in that area. I would not really suggest anyone to try this strain ,and would suggest you find some other hybrid to use.

It&#39;s mostly a pressured dizziness in my head than anything else, and that&#39;s not normal even if it were a straight 100% Sativa. I would actually prefer the effects from a Sativa dominant strain than whatever type of &#39;high&#39; this is, and that&#39;s coming from a person who is an Indica fanboy.

VBlack Widow is great, until she&#39;s not. This strain has a paranoia bite to it that lives up to her name. The first time I smoked it, it was an amazing, enjoyable high, with just one hit. My girlfriend, who is a seasoned smoker, smoked three hits and hated how it made her feel. The next time I smoked it, I think I took two or three hits. It&#39;s creeper. And when it hit me about 20 minutes later, I was running for the CBD pills and black peppercorns to calm down F*** down. So, if you like intensity, and high THC, this might be the girl for you. For me, I&#39;d consider mixing it was something a little kinder like Blue Dream or Purple Kush.

I can still focus and be functioning and can be a saviour. Advice: if you aren&#39;t a regular smoker don&#39;t plan to do activities on this. It&#39;s heavy

VMy go to strain. Advice: Unless you&#39;re a seasoned smoker, don&#39;t plan to do anything active when you try it. I find as a regular smoker and Black Widow slows me down to a nice normal pace, is an amazing relief for anxiety, pain and helps my mania. I keep this buddy aside for times of real need

Vthis is some of the stuff i first started out on,  it was very dark and broke down pretty easy, when smoked it tasted sorta bitter and burned pretty quick, either way the experience was enjoyable, its one of those walk around strains, you can still focus on everything you&#39;re doing, but ur more inspired with it. id recommend this to anyone just looking lift their day.

VDidn&#39;t smoke much of this, so that might be why it wasn&#39;t that strong. Gave me a feeling of wellbeing. I could carry on a conversation without a problem. I was able to move around easy. Great for help with relaxation without making me feel like I couldn&#39;t move. Seemed to give me dryer eyes than usual. I will have to try smoking a larger amount next time.

VThis is going to be a surprisingly precise &amp; straight to the point review with little clamoring about in the land of long winds as is the usual route that I never tread upon in short detail, but can this time if this over the top long ass run off paragraph of a sentence ever lets me get the best of it by lassoing it down with a....\u000a\u000aPeriod.  Ok, now that the above shenanigans has come to an end it can easily be said that these ramblings just uttered by me are more exciting &amp; buzzworthy.   Like the black yin to its middle ground hybrid boring white yang neither widow deserves to remarry.  Not much for any of the senses &amp; leaves me often wondering if I ever got high?  \u000a\u000aMaybe another time, after the somberness of this widows funeral ends I&#39;ll tell a humurous, slightly edgy memory of my first time buying Black Widow.  That is a hoot, but for today lets leave the dead in their graves &amp; smoke some diggity dank while we are alive.  Amen

VSmoke it for weeks and it wasn&#39;t my favourite... couch locked.. body high more than cerebral high.. strange taste that I got tired of, the buzz don&#39;t last long, but it&#39;s gentle for the throat. I would recommend to smoke it before going to bed, strangly, its a sativa hybrid.. Got me so paranoid that I started hearing noises and I had to stop doing anything until they were gone. Not a fan of the buzz but great before sleeping and gave me hell of munchies

VAfter reading about this strain, and buying a pkg of 18 seeds from Mr. Nice I finally popped 4 of them this Spring and grew them in my backyard, 3 in Smart pots, and 1 in my raised bed garden mixed in with my tomatoes, peppers, etc.. it&#39; s a very pretty plant that grew vigorously and had to be topped several times, and pulled and tied down to try and keep it from being visible. Of the 4 seeds I popped I had 100% females, and the plant in my raised bed started to flower in early August and had some very potent and lovely looking bud by the middle of September. I unfortunately had a thief who ripped me off for a pretty far along Durban Poison growing in a pot and after a 2 week hiatus he/she/it returned and stole another large and fairly mature Durban with a few small branches of my Widow, and some Locomotion and Cuvee from TGA to boot so I cut the the rest, mature and immature alike. Still had a fair bit of decent flower and after drying and finally having a chance to try it I&#39;m very pleased with Black Widow, which is very potent with a pleasant taste and attractive appearance. I only grow for myself and to give friends some cannabis as gifts but believe commercial growers would find this a profitable strain to grow.

VVisualize one of your favorite foods and imagine thousands of tingly nerve endings being satisfied.  Eating is one of the drawbacks if you are on a diet.  The Black Widow stain is my favorite because of the eating sensations I receive when hunger strikes my stomache.  I haven&#39;t eaten much because of  an infection so Black Widow has helped me with my current eating issue.  Hunger may strike yet I can control my calories especially when I cannot walk.

VReally quick but intense body and mind soar. Huge munchies weed, I would make sure you have food or you&#39;ll be throwing a tantrum. Body buzz goes really short but super strong and brings on a slight amount of arouse. Smoke is musky, smell is terrible. Good bud but not a favorite.

VGiven the name , this strain is super disappointing. Obviously I maybe had a bad batch but i been a mmj patient for grew months , and this flower had the lowest total thc percentage coming in at %16.50. The high was a very mild heavy head high that lasted a while ( which is why it&#39;s getting 3 not 2 stars.)

Vone of those stains that looks phenomenal amd smells like heaven but just doesn&#39;t live up to your expectations. i mean it&#39;s not a bad strain just very typical. if you like a standard indica then this will suit you. i like unique traits in a bud so this one kind of falls in the back of mind. it was top shelf tested at 25% so it looks like to me that it&#39;s within its genetics to be somewhat mediocre.
