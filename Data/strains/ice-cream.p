VI love this strain. A little light on the throat hit for me i find, but that makes it great for joints when you have already ravaged your throat from heavy dabs ;) \u000a\u000aAll in all, a nice mild hybrid with good all around properties. Maybe one of the most balanced strains I&#39;ve ever tried.

VIncredibly smooth hitting, BEAUTIFUL flowers. The smoothness and the taste will keep you going back for more, it\u2019s just a delight to smoke. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s effects are pretty immediate, you can feel the calm wave of peace roll over you. It\u2019s happy, euphoric, uplifting. I picked up this strain for my cabinet due to reviews for use with PMS. I felt less stabby afterwards, ladies, it\u2019s a good one. \u000a\u000aThe only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is its a more sativa dominant hybrid, missing some of body feel. \u000a\u000a&#127793;&#127793;&#127793;&#127793;

VThis strain is covered in Trichomes and is easy to break apart and grind. The taste truly tastes sweet, the smoke is smooth and the nugs are a nice size and contain some beautiful light purple. The high is a very energetic giggly high with the side of munchies! I gave this a 4 due to the high not lasting more then 1 hour

VThis is such a nice smooth tasty smoke that will literally give you the warm &amp; fuzzies! This strain provides such a pleasant and uplifting high.  You can go about doing your tasks during the day and just be happy to be alive.  This would be an excellent strain for depression as it is produces such an even keel / consistent high without being overly euphoric that you can&#39;t keep your wits about you. I really like this strain and will always have it as part of my regular go to strains, of course when you can get your hands on it.   Highly Recommended!!!

VMy best description of the high would be &quot;Soft dreamy high&quot;. By this i mean that the head high is very dreamy and the body high is absolute relaxation. You can smoke tons of this, you won&#39;t get couch locked or get a &quot;kush&quot; kinda body high. This is not gonna get you destroyed like girl scout cookies or other strong strains.

VI smoked some of this last night, and needless to say, I definitely slept like a baby.  This crept up on me, I&#39;m not gonna lie, and I&#39;m still a lightweight.  I was chilling outside listening to music while smoking and as soon as my ass walked back inside the house, my high really started to pick up.  For the first 5-10 mins I played guitar, then when I could start feeling a full body high kick in, I decided to just lay down and listen to music.  Definitely getting some more of this bud soon, and I would recommend anyone try it at least once!

VI purchased this strain in an attempt to find something to help me wind down and pass out after a long day at work. While it did calm me down and helped me relax, once I did go to sleep, I tended to wake up a 2-3 hours later. I definitely experienced some awesome euphoria and it helped with my back pain. Would have rated 5 stars if the high lasted longer.

VThis is great weed, decently frosty.. Honestly not the best looking buds hence my eighth was mids at $25 for an eighth though it&#39;s a great deal. It&#39;s fire, you can just tell they&#39;re lower buds from the plant but nonetheless still frosty, very pungent smelling and very tasty buds.. You can tell with a nice long cure they would be mouth watering in taste.. Tastes like vanilla ice cream with a very,very subtle fruity undertone. The high is Sativa at first then goes to a mild indica sedative high but still packing the psychedelic and energetic sativa qualites. Only ranking it a four because they are the top shelf buds.. They&#39;re the lower less dense buds from the plant which usually dont match the top colas in density and trich coverage.. Usually less dense and they&#39;re smaller nugs...

VThis bud smells real good. I smoked a bowl of this strain and the relaxing euphoric effects took over me very rapidly. I felt super couched yet talk active and focused. \u000a\u000aThe high got a bit extreme when I began to get more of a mixed head and body high. I got super stone and my mind was loving it. Happy vibes kicked in and everything else was good. Little to no paranoia or any anxiety. \u000a\u000aThis strain is great for happy vibes and a relaxing, chilled out sort of buzz. A movie with some friends at home would be my use for this. I\u2019d also use it to make depressing thoughts go away. Over all it gives me happy thoughts and a smile on my face along with a relaxed body. \u000a\u000acouch&gt;

VThis strain is notorious for it&#39;s taste - very smooth and earthy.  It has very prominent indica effects - spacey and numbing.  The head high is more sativa and keeps the indica effects afloat.  If I smoke too much of it I could totally get anxious - very potent too.  i highly recommend this high if you like getting messed up.  - D. Avacado Ph.D.

VWe found this baby out East as &quot;Cream Dream,&quot; but soon learned it was actually Ice Cream, based on it&#39;s effects, touch, and taste.  This strain is a kief machine! Very dense nugs and looks very similar to the structure and color(s) of Sour Diesel. \u000a\u000aI struggle every morning with some GI stuff which has me on the toilet with bucket in hand which I now consider pretty standard lol. I usually try to smoke right when I wake up to keep my dizziness/nausea in check and &#39;Ice Cream&#39; pushed that feeling right down in my stomach instantly after about 2 light drags. \u000a\u000aMy girlfriend has a more serious skin condition called &#39;Epidermolysis Bullosa&#39; -- which is a rare skin disease that causes blistering...so she&#39;s living with open wounds all over her body, as I&#39;m sure you can Google, or imagine. Anyway, pain level 11 all day every day. She says that only 2 hits of Ice Cream do what her liquid Tylenol w/ Codeine does for her instantly. \u000a\u000aDefinitely look into Ice Cream if you&#39;re dealing with heavy pain on a day to day basis!
