VIt&#39;s definitely potent. Smoke this and your problems melt away faster than a snowcone in Phoenix. Hits you quick and it&#39;s a quality high. While you can smoke this and have a really good time, I see it as very effective medicine for people who suffer from depression.

VNamed after the one and only Kimbo Slice, this strain will kick your ass in the best way possible. I smoked this at about 7:30pm and it instantly put me in a triangle hold of chillness. I refused to tap and carried on through 2 more rounds. That&#39;s when I was hit in the face with a spinning backhand of total relaxation, followed by an upper cut of pure bliss, I was out cold in the 3rd. Perfect body high with a mellow euphoric buzz. Smoke late at night.

VA really nice journey! I really like using this strain after a physical workout or if I&#39;m really keyed-up and need some time and guidance to chill. It has a really nice Sativa hit in the beginning that just knocks the shit out of whatever depression or bad mood happens to be hanging around, replacing them with a big happy smile. After a bit, it smooths out into a cerebral experience, and I understand the spin of the planet, followed by the onset of help-me-to-bed Indica that helps me sleep deep. Insomnia can&#39;t stand up to the power punches delivered by Kimbo (RIP). It smells like hybrid weed, mostly citrus with some turpentine/pine. This strain provides a consistent journey each time and I can count on it to make me a better person :)

VSo I&#39;m a new smoker, so most strains hit me but I&#39;ve repeatedly bought Kimbo Kush, I have really enjoyed the mind and body high this gives me. I have really bad insomnia and anxiety and this has helped me greatly! \u000a\u000aI&#39;d say this is a more mild strain in the point of taste and cough. This strain I hardly cough compared to others. But this hits me hard and I never even finish the rolls, it lasts a few hours then slowly starts to drift off. \u000a\u000a

VAnother excellent kush! These buds were super frosty and shimmered off the darker green nugs. There are spots of purple throughout the buds. The smell is very light. Just smells like clean fresh marijuana really. The smoke goes down smooth with a little cough after exhale. Great smoke for sessions say... before your going out to meet people? It&#39;s a very mellow low key kinda high feeling. I know I smoked enough to be baked but I still feel very in control of myself and I certainly do not look or feel like I&#39;d be suspect of being baked. haha Great strain for day time smoking imo. Not to heavy. Great for beginner smokers I&#39;d guess... I like it. And I love that it is named KIMBO Kush. Lol Though it is not a knock out stain to me.

Vhad a morning migraine, pretty damn ripped. Glad I chose this for a second run through, it&#39;s just completely getting me better however, the smoke is somewhat significantly denser which makes it harsher however I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the case I just ran it through the smoothest piece I had and it had just extremely thick harsh smoke so I mean be ready to cough a lot but overall great strain.

VFlavor is not incredibly strong. Ur has notes of fruit and earthiness. The strength of this strain comes in its relaxation effects. It will really knock you out and give you some serious couch lock. Great for pain or sleep aid! Or winding down at the end of the day. Though it is a hybrid its indica effects are very pronounced and make for a great Kush experience. Caution: It&#39;s named Kimbo Kush after the street/UFC fighter Kimbo Slice and hits just as hard as he did with a high THC content that will leave you body and head high.

VI am giving this four stars because of it&#39;s potency. I smoke daily and consider myself to have a pretty high tolerance. I had a small toke of this from my bong (keep in mind I usually smoke joints or out of a pipe so the use of the bong heightened the potency) and within 5 minutes I was higher than I&#39;ve been probably this year. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t remember most of the night, besides giggling uncontrollably not necessarily in a good way and feeling anxious and disoriented, I also felt nauseous and like I was on the verge of getting spins. I am going to try taking some out of the pipe tonight and am hoping to experience more of the positive effects I&quot;m sure this strain has. \u000a\u000aWarning to newer cannabis users, this isn&#39;t a strain to be taken lightly so unless you want to have a negative experience I would definitely recommend starting really slow or leaving this to more experienced users.

VKimbo Kush! \u000a\u000aI have been waiting for quite awhile to try this strain out. I got some top quality bud from my local shop and couldn&#39;t wait to fire up this supposed &quot; knock out &quot; indica. \u000a\u000aIt tasted very strange to me but also very pleasant. Fruity is the best word to describe it ... burnt up tropical fruit peels or something. With a dash of nutty in it. So unusual but good. \u000a\u000aThe throat his was very light indeed and my flower was slow burning ... like a log of oak. \u000a\u000aThe high didn&#39;t waste any time setting in. Everything got Very slowed down ... it reminded me of that thing people would take in the judge dread movie that slowed everything down. God that movie was good .... Anyways. \u000a\u000aI felt very at ease and also very couch locked ... I didnt want to do anything at all and I couldnt drive. definitely a nighttime strain and not one to do if kiddos are up and about. \u000a\u000aSo if you are looking for a fruity treat that will put yo booty to sleep ! Then check out kimbo kush.

I tend to smoke a lot at night and only once when I wake up, maybe it was my dosage. other than the anxiety i would say 5 stars.

VKimbo Kush has become one of top 10 strains of all time. I specifically seek out strains that produce a high like this. Starts slow as it creeps up, first you feel it in the head as a nice uplifting and very relaxing sensation takes over. Then  the body high kicks in and its like gravity was turned up, as the head high clears up but stays euphoric and uplifted throughout. Great for relaxing, relieving anxiety, stress, going for a walk, talking with friends, or just giving into the raging munchies and watching some videos. \u000a\u000aIt tastes clean, almost minty, slightly earthy, sweet, and with a bit of pine. Smells the same as it tastes, and will leave you wanting another taste, esp when vaped. \u000a\u000aThis is not a strain to miss, if you see it, get it, I know I will when I see it again (thats when you know its a great strain).

VThis gives you the most pleasant aftertaste in your mouth. It\u2019s like the opposite of the aftertaste you get from cranberry juice. \u000aVery floral, sweet and citrusy. \u000aAlso it\u2019s a kind of indica hybrid where you\u2019re relaxed and melted but also intrigued and will make you easily impressed by mundane shit. \u000aI get super chatty while high but this is much more than chatty, it\u2019s genuine interest to learn as much as you can about mundane things like why going to the moon was just an Olympic sport to the countries.

I see this with personal friends too, what rocks my world has no effect on them and vice versa...apparently I&#39;m the guy that Kimbo won&#39;t work for.

VThis strain is a wonderful get-home-from-work-and -unwind-for-bed strain! The first hit is bright and relaxing. It puts a bright, happy mood twist on the roughest day. From there I&#39;m free to read or do whatever. But, with each hit the indica effects increase until inducing sleep. The body high is light, all my aches and pains disappear. It is wonderful for nausea or stomach pain. It disappears with one hit. Very Low on the munchies scale. And the next day I&#39;m refreshed! Clear, no brain fog hangover. I really love this strain for evening unwinding and restorative sleep!!

VOh I loved it. Got some from my friend. He im more of a indica  person, so he was like you&#39;ll love this one. Yea I dont even ask which strain I have until after I smoke it. With this one. I did the same. This stuff is strong I could only do 2 puffs, It goes in has real nice taste, to me like a lil hashplant to a large blackberry smell you can smell of the smoke. It got me so stoned.  It was more of pschodelic at first due to strength and i would say im a heavy weight. Havent missed a day smoking in 4 yrs minus a tooth getting pulled. Everything mellowed out after I got seated and I kinda just didnt want to move so couchlock and real sci fi thing when I was seated and was just enamered by everything. It was really like the start of a trip where you know oh i might have a just a one to many but turns out awesome. This strain is one I am going to have to do meself soon. I havent had that feeling since I think it was tangie or tangie and chocolate tangilope it was thats how the high was but was so good smell of just the smoke burning you almost didnt want to inhale it had a thick thick smoke of blackberrys. Now enough said. I would like to review it again later in the week. I still have some left and i dont do alot of reviews but I had get this one out there. I have also had alot of starfighter strains they are always super strong. but i think im going to do this strain and try out some blackberry kush. I would save this weed for trippy maybe at trance or dance event, After you have had a few mushies of mdma but save this for the peak because it bomb. And i just tryed Wifi last week no review but it was bomb too and Gorilla Glue #4 now the Gorilla glue i prob should have review and the white with fire og it was just so mellow this to my was trippy. This plant I am already making you a motherplant spot. I just wish I would have got a cut of my buddies before he finished it because im going to have to hit that right pheno but it is well worth it Exotic Genetics you really showed out as a seed bank to be taken litely if I had to work for one of these fairly knew seedbanks it be these guys I see banks that start out with strains that have been available for 10 years and act like it just came out so maybe i am still high. Oh i got mad good sleep too. Now i am going to put on my salves for the day and see where the vibes take me.

Bought an eighth, smoked a bowl, and immediately both my fianc&#233; and myself were hit with extreme anxiety.  My fianc&#233; then the next day on his own, smoked it, (he also has a super high tolerance), and realized he had extreme anxiety from it, which he usually doesn&#39;t get.  This will not be one we get again.\u000aThat being said: It is a very beautiful bud covered in trichomes.  I wish we didn&#39;t have the effects from it because it&#39;s gorgeous and tasty.
