VOptimus prime is the mainstream name here in Seattle...AND IT\u2019S AMAZING. It perfects hungry, happy, sleepy. Had it during a music improv and it was the best day of my life hands down. All the laughing, food, music, and friends were at level 10. This strain has taken the crown from Sunset Sherbet by a margin in my opinion. There\u2019re both extremely similar in effects and strength. You can\u2019t go wrong with either.

VThis strain is always a favorite, the top favorite in fact, the potency of the strain is really dependent on the grower and really test the growers thumb- \u000aI would highly recommend this strain for pain, relaxation, especially for when your are in any kind of pain, or if you&#39;re sick. But for the most part this is a solid all around strain if you can hang with a heavy indica. If you know you get &quot;stuck&quot; on most indica&#39;s, just be prepared to be just that while being ultimately relaxed; good movie watching strain &#128525;&#128523;

VOPTIMUS PRIME from Little Egypt and that is what it is .. a prime strain that the first thing you notice is the smoothness of the smoke .. none of the harsh throat burn .. also know as &quot;3X&quot; ..  2-5 hits will start you on your way for the day and a 1/2 joint or small bowl will do you for several hours of a delightful period without pain !! \u000a\u000aOver do it and beware of Couch Lock and the sleepiness that will follow for some inexperienced smokers for us oldies with back pain it will help allow you to be active and live again !! \u000aCan be a good bed time medicine for those with sleep disorders !!

VMy favorite Indica... For those looking for an anxiety-relieving med, that will deliver a strong, grounded sense of peace and well-being, this is the strain. No blasting or face-peeling here-- the effect creep up within the first ten mins but they are def strong. Fantastic for insomnia too, but the calming blissful waves are great for quiet contemplation too.

VI got this as Optimus Prime.  The smell of this bud was just.... really good.  I could sit here all day just smelling it - I almost wanted to just eat it.  It was dense and fluffy, almost like a fat stale marshmallow.  Tasted so yummy, there was a berry flavor, a deep sweet flavor that lingers, some herbal flavors, then that pine you just get because well, it is what it is.  Worked for my vertebrae, disc, and muscle pain.  I was able to quietly relax, my body was able to release the tension, and I could fall asleep easily.  Didn&#39;t put me to sleep, I was just able to sleep because it made me so relaxed.  Didn&#39;t hit me like a normal Indica, but I still liked it.

VThis strain gets three stars for me as a medical user. I smoke for chronic pain and anxiety issues. This strain had a psychoactive effect on me that was pleasant, and it lasted for a good amount of time. After I smoked to put me over the edge and into a body high (something pretty signature in this strain), the body high was nice, but lasted all of twenty minutes at most. Perhaps it is how my individual body chemistry responds, so for what it is worth to medical users, I smoke mainly heavy Indicas and  I/H&#39;s for bipolar disorder and anxiety issues, as well as appetite disorder and insomnia. I have a built up a high THC tolerance by now. If you are in my boat or a similar one, perhaps keep looking or stick to the parent strains of this triple cross (I think the medicinal properties of each strain actually thinned out as a result of the crossovers). As a patient, I found I do not get as much bang for my buck with this strain, but for recreational  users, the lengthy head high is long lasting and the experience as a whole is worth it.

VThis is my favorite strain to grow and smoke. Everyone who has smoked with me know this as T.T.C. short for Three Times Crazy. Nobody could get a hold on the taste and tried to say its just bubba but I&#39;ve grown that before too along with other kush strains. The cut was from a friend in oakland he called it optimus prime and they were about 7-8 inches and stunk like loud. The purple colas you get are so resinous its crazy! The name is also some of the bay areas favorite strains so they named it after the group 3xKrazy from Oakland. Fits it pretty well i think so &quot;KEEP IT ON THE REAL&quot; and always smoke fire!

Smells a lot like bubba, looks a lot like OG definite packs a punch. First time I heard of or seen this strain and I&#39;m very happy with it. Great for pain, anxiety, stress, and insomnia.

VFor me, this strain was a random pick, for a $55 for (any) strain / 5 gram special.  I picked a random indica as one of my 5 grams, Optimus Prime or 3X Crazy.  The aroma is earthy and \u000aFrom the first toke a feeling as if all was well with the world hit me, and sedated any stress from the day.  I had a few deep thoughts, now clear headed from the medicine.. Then at some point I laid down and I slept like a baby that night, and woke up feeling  grounded, not heavy,  the new day upon me. It was as if it relaxed and soothed me so gently I eventually fell asleep.  It creeps up a little and I know people who have hit this strain and fallen right asleep, and some do take this for insomnia. 3X is not over bearing  or electric but cuddling and clearing to your sense of balance and self. I felt  I straddled gently between peace and euphoria. Another time I smoked this after soccer and it relieved pain in my legs and relieved a sinus headache. All its positive effects make it obvious the trifecta of power of the 3 different indicas combined to create this strain in the 3 of 3X Crazy.  The aroma is earthy to the nose and sweet to the under tone.

Va friend came over with a some 3 times crazy, he picked up from the local dispensery. I checked it out for alittle, looked at it under the flash light on my phone. definitely looked very nice, had a great density to it also. We broke it down and rolled it up into a regular flavored Swisher, so that we could get the full flavor &amp; taste of the flower. I rated it 4 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend it, if your local dispenser ever has it. definitely grab it.

VI enjoy this indica strain. But I like all of the strains that make up this strain so....big surprise. \u000aThis was actually the last flower gram I purchased before switching over to dabbing for good. It was heavy hitting enough I still felt it, I normally am awake no matter what until 3-4AM and I get up @ 7Am but with Optimus Prime here I was knocked out by 1AM and didn&#39;t wake up until 10am.\u000a\u000aI could notice the bubba kush flavor the most. also a hashy taste

VI vaped this. I went on my nightly run and took my vaporizer with me. In the beginning of my run I couldn&#39;t feel the effects of this strain. It slowly started creeping on me. It started with a head change and then it took over my body. I was running like I was sprinting, at least that&#39;s what it felt like. Ran close to 3.8 miles 11:11/mile a little slow but better than my old times. I got home took a shower finished hw and fell asleep. Fell asleep HARD. (that doesn&#39;t right) I would recommend to anyone that needs some pain relief, stress and to treat insomnia.

VA fun, engaging high. Mostly felt in the head - disassociated, floating...totally disconnected from the body. Spacey, but bright, glowy, and warm. In fact, that may be the dominant emotional state: comfortable and cozy. Vision is relaxed and unfocused. There\u2019s a transportive nostalgia to it - like living in a fond memory. All&#39;s right with the world. Feels light and capable despite how distant your perception is. Music is improved a bit, it\u2019s pretty interesting to get into but there\u2019s an unfortunate distance that keeps pushing it into the background. Probably a result of a narrow focus. Unfortunately, similar for watching things; it\u2019s pretty compelling, just not...quite...there. Good for work due to its happily euphoric, zen-like mental state - which is the strain&#39;s highest attribute.

VWow! This was recommended to me by the budtender for relaxation and pain management and he was right on the money! \u000a\u000aI tried this for the first time yesterday evening, a little right before my husband and I went out for dinner.. It starts as a head high then settles in. I felt it first in the oddest of ways- in between my eyes at my forehead, in almost a numbing sensation.  It nicely masked my pain and I was very relaxed and happy, able to truly enjoy a meal out without constantly squirming with discomfort. \u000a\u000aI definitely had some mind wandering with just the small amount and I could tell that, with a little more, I wouldn&#39;t be in much condition for a public social outing, much more content to veg on the couch with a big smile on my face, so be warned or prepared. \u000a\u000aThe effect lasted about 90 minutes. I had a slight amount of paranoia, but not enough to cause any distress. \u000a\u000aHybrid (75% Indica + 25% Sativa)

VAbsolutely love this strain! It&#39;s become a new favorite for me. I&#39;m vaping on some right now. Love the taste and honestly one of the best smelling ones I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s a pretty hard hitting strain and even though it doesn&#39;t last too terribly long, it is great. Very giggly and relaxed. I layed flipping through Facebook taking buzzfeed quizzes and you know how stupid those are, I thought they were hilarious. I&#39;m not the type to laugh out loud but this had me super giggly and I really needed that. I take this for fibromyalgia and it is great for the tight muscles and really relaxes and uplifts you until you get tired enough to sleep. 5 stars easy.

VWow. #3xCrazy or #OptimisPrime by @indomechanic is no joke. From the #bagappeal to the lungs, this was a full force, top notch smoke. The smell stands alone and about the same to say about the #terpene profile. It reminded me of #cookies but there was a slight peak of #pinene I believe that made for a nice, delicious taste. At about 18% #Thc, the joint burned almost perfectly with a slightly gray ash. Pretty decent flush on this one and overall very stoked on finding a new #cultivator with skills. This one gets 4.4\u2b50\ufe0f out of 5 stars for me. Can&#39;t wait to go through the rest of the flavors! Props @indomechanic, real flavor!&#128588;&#128079;&#128293;&#128266; Available at #Oregrown Inc. in Bend.

VI like to keep things honest for an individual who isn&#39;t already a daily smoker. This strain couch locked me 3x more then any strain prior and I didn&#39;t like the feeling of having such a tall order of body high. I went into this strain blind and thought I had a much higher tolerance. Low and behold this should be smoked in small increments, revisiting how much is right for you in 20 minute periods. I personally would suggest to take this strain slow to see exactly how glued to the couch you would like to be. If you don&#39;t like couchlock (like me) just get another strain.
