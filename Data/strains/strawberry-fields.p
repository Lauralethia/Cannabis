VHoly shit! This knocked me on my ass, in a good way. I\u2019ve been in the process of getting off medication for a nerve condition I have in my leg that tends to flare up at night. Not only did one puff of this (vaped CO2 concentrate) get me feeling great, I also slept harder than I have in months. The high definitely hits you hard, but if you brace yourself and just embrace it, you\u2019ll enjoy the ride.  This is definitely a nighttime, stay at home and watch movies strain.  I really enjoyed the high.  Extremely euphoric with a body high I wasn\u2019t expecting due to other reviews of this I\u2019ve read.  Woke up a little groggy for the first few minutes, but I think it had more to do with sleeping so hard (8+ hours) than any sort of hangover. Once I had a cup of coffee I felt refreshed and clearheaded. I\u2019d highly recommend this strain for anyone dealing with pain or depression/stress/insomnia(I find those three often go hand in hand).  Good luck and hope this helps!

VHad this in a cartridge, only three draws it took to get me  stoned. And I\ufe0f mean stones (yes stones- how many?- I\ufe0f don\u2019t know\u2019, a lot of them!) high. I\u2019ve been reading the review as a wake and bake, creeper, or clear headed but man I\ufe0f could not blend in a crowd with this, I\ufe0f would try but would be soon found licking a side walk- thinking \u201cthis isnt normal, But why haven\u2019t I\ufe0f been doing this all along?!\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s all// if you get the cartridge beware you will get all introspective, want to write that long lost best friend you had that you never keep in contact with, eat that last chicken wing in the fridge that\u2019s been sitting there for who KNOWS?! How long!!! Play with your dog until you realize an hour has gone by and the dog doesn\u2019t even want the taco you\u2019ve been throwing around you 100 sq foot house, crawl into bed to write a long redundant review but not before you change all your pillow cases while thinking \u201cwhy, why am I\ufe0f standing on a ladder changing pillowcases\u201d and you body goes \u201c because I\ufe0f can\u201d. It\u2019s a heavy hitter, it hits fast and hard. Just like your mom. ;)

This one still gets me stoned and that indica feeling I love, going to go pick up a little extra for later, peace \u270c\ufe0f J$

VBefore this strain, weed as a \u201cpain reliever\u201d always seemed like a lie to me, because it just lets me tune in to my body and all the places it hurts. But Strawberry Fields has changed EVERYTHING. It\u2019s subtle as it sets in, doesn\u2019t make me look high (and barely any eye/mouth dryness), and is blissfully relaxing! I notice my mind gets clearer and more focused (the opposite of EVERY other indica I\u2019ve tried!) and I\u2019m happy whether I\u2019m relaxing, chatting, or just scrolling through the internet. (Colors and shapes are beautiful!) It doesn\u2019t help me fall asleep but I always rest well afterwards, and wake up clear and refreshed. It\u2019s even helped my digestion and inflammation. STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER!

VHave this in a concentrate from a PA medical brand called Moxie.  Great consistency to the budder, one of best consistencies I&#39;ve seen yet.  Subtle taste, it&#39;s interesting to imagine the strawberry flavor not as candy like but the actual strawberry.  Sweet and a bit plant like in profile, but very good.\u000a\u000aStrong great effect from the bidder, burns super clean and has lasting nice sleepy effects.

VOne of the first strains I was advised to try and it did not disappoint. This is one of my fall-back favorites. Takes away that chronic stress and gives you a euphoric buzz while you remain feeling relaxed. Easy to use during the day but doesn&#39;t disappoint when it comes to insomnia. This strain is a good place to start if you&#39;re looking for a nice euphoric, tingly high but suffer from anxiety and the like.

VThe taste of strawberry filled my mouth as I exhaled the smoke. I did not feel that burn in my throat that had many times before. No instead I felt the calm that began to fill my body. I put the pipe back up to my mouth and repeated the process until I could no longer bring myself to move from my position amongst my pillows. As I lay there staring at my ceiling it occurs to me that the fields of strawberry I had just crossed through had sent me to a place I never wanted to leave again. Away from the hustle and bustle. Far from the stress the world around us holds. To my own little paradise I call Euphoria.\u000a\u000aIn other words I highly recommend this strain.

VLet me take you down cause we&#39;re going to Strawberry Fields Forever!!  My favorite line to that song is &quot;it&#39;s getting hard to be someone, but it all works out.  It doesn&#39;t matter much to me.  Much like that fabulous Beatle&#39;s song this strain is far out, a bit whimsical &amp; will take eventually take us down for a good rest.  \u000a\u000aNow whether that rest is actual REM sleep or just laying back to ponder the tales of the universe through fairy tale vision.  And in this stony lull of a thc daydream I&#39;m the hero riding a big nugget of SF through the sky like Valcor from Never Ending Story, but fluffier, greener with the gift of pain relief for both head &amp; body.  That is the kind of weed this is.  Comfort weed.  Creative bud.  Cannabis that is almost personalized in that it will take the individual to whatever is needed to relax them specifically.\u000a\u000aThere is several examples of this in my experiences, but to save the world from a review turned 3 part novel feel free to message me.  Really not sure anyone could go wrong with this strain unless they were trying to get hyper because not gonna happen.  Or the high THC content might not agree with folks just starting out with ganja, but really this is not paranoia reefer at all.  Top of the line for pain relief.  No joke, it works on the same level as opiates minus all the nasty side effects.  Only thing is there can be kind of a groggy hangover feeling next day because this is potent flower.  My cure for that is to smoke more =)\u000a\u000aSaved taste/smell for last because SF makes that easy.  It&#39;s awesome!!  Never got so much a strawberry smell, def berrylike, to me it smells exactly like Skunk #1.  Bought this flower about 5 times from 3 different stores and to no avail it smells that way every time.  There is a spicy note to it and when breaking apart the perfect glistening nugget with a crispy snap the smell gets intense.  Wish they made candles scented like that. Dreamy, quality cannabis that is so close to 5 stars that rating could go up by end of day.  \u000a\u000aStrawberry Fields Forever!!!

VI&#39;m high on Strawberry Fields, as I type. SF has a very tingly body high and a cerebral high, hence me typing this rate :-) and very visual. I use cannabis primarily for insomnia/pain. SF is excellent if you&#39;re going to sleep \u2014 because it has a heavy body high. SF, perfect to unwind with after a long day and then eventually nod off.

VFunny thing I picked up 1/4 of Sirius Black &amp; a 1/4 this. I\u2019m a medical patient &amp; about $hit my pants when I realized how much I was paying for the Sirius Black but I was getting a sweet enough deal on the Strawberry Fields to stop from asking her to put it back on the shelf lol. Plus the Sirius Black had so much purple in it it was seriously black, seriously;) lol. Anyways I expected at that price &amp; from the looks of it that it would blow me away right? I mean that\u2019s what we hope for when you\u2019re wallets under that much fire right? Nope, it was the Strawberry Fields that blew me away at more than half the price ... it is AMAZING!!! So I really don\u2019t feel robbed at all, I just wished I\u2019d bought a 1/2 of this instead ;) it\u2019s that good. Relaxed happy focused &amp; oddly filled with a calm energy to seize the day.

VA nice terpy sativa dominant strain crossed with Crocket&#39;s Tangie X  Strawberry banana. \u000a\u000aIt has a nice clean sativa high and the buds looks very light green frosty, with very prominent orange hairs resembling it&#39;s tangie parent. \u000a\u000aA great strain for the morning, it will get you auxiliarted and put some spice in your life.

VTrying out the Strawberry &#127827; Fields MoxiePA distillate Cart &#128168; Goin in I\u2019m anxious physically and mentally let\u2019s hope this helps\u000a.\u000a.\u000a2 puffs and coughing begins. I feel my body get hit with warmth firsts as my head feels heavier almost like the air is heavier and pushing me down. I feel happier as well mentally not stressing and more in the moment. I feel my body tingling as well which is nice for any pain. I also feel like I can feel any inflammation or muscle pain just reduce. I feel like music sounds better I\u2019m also more satisfied doing what ever. It\u2019s a help for ADD type symptoms as well as PTSD such as anxiety and stress and even physical anxiety. I was weary of a distillate to be honest. But after taking a look at the lab report and taking a look at the Terpenes even though low amounts the ones there Are ones attack anxiety and attack inflammation so this is sticking true to its make up which is exactly what you want it also tastes wonderful if you enjoy strawberry if you do not enjoy strawberry you will absolutely hate this :-) so be sure to keep that in mind as well. \u000a.\u000a.\u000aThis is definitely a very relaxing strain but it also does not put me to sleep so it\u2019s nice really for anytime use relaxation it is not too intense and all but it does relax the mind and the body I highly would recommend. Another puff now &#128513; time to enjoy this wonderful strawberry tasting medicine as I wander into my own Strawberry Fields thanks so much to Moxie Pennsylvania and to pure Penn and Solevo for the meds locally.  I\u2019m happy I picked up two. My mind gets happier and happier and I feel light and heavy at the same time &#128541; This also relaxes my\u000aStomach so I\u2019d say great for my PTSD and Stomach diseases\u2764\ufe0f \u000a.\u000a.\u000aAt 86.36% cannabinoids it absolutely packs a punch only need a couple of hits and you\u2019re ready to go for 2 to 3 hours sometimes one hour depending on the symptoms and how bad it is but definitely is a great medicine looking forward to medicating with it! \u000a.\u000a.\u000aI\u2019d say it\u2019s about a 3 to 4 puff maximum for me and I\u2019m ready to go so definitely be sure to medicate properly and enjoy have a wonderful day and be sure to ask any questions you may have I am here to help spread information and hope that you also get relief.

Went inside with my friends, I was by far the highest one. Spent 3 hours in the corner of the room with a hard ass dick, laughing my ass off for no reason. Had a moment where I was thinking a lot which made me the slightest bit paranoid but it only lasted a couple minutes. This strain out of what I&#39;ve smoked so far had me the most time fucked out of them all. I would sit there for five minutes and think it&#39;d been 20. I like it.

VLike medicalguy, I was provided this strain as a sativa-dominant hybrid. I smoked this strain with the Hydrology 9 Vape which really brought the wonderful strawberry taste and smell. Its definitely a noticeable body high...sore muscles and other pains are fleeding, almost immediately. Also, at least so far, mind is noticing the high but is still functional and relatively clear. This is a relaxing strain good for a rainy day or weekend...let her work her magic and those are the ideal times. For those with dry mouth, a good fruit drink or summer beer with lime will do.

At times I would feel it in my eyes as a dulling, and that&#39;s it for the body buzz. I felt this was more a sativa.

Most phenos are more like 90% indica dominant...Strawberry Cough however is roughly 75/25 Sativa dominant. Any strain that takes 55 days to flower is Indica...Sativa is more upbeat, functional for most and is def more like taking the edge off...Indica on the other hand is the slow motion, heavy limbed, confusing at times and prrodicrs
