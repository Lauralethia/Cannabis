VBlue Champagne (Blue Dream X Champagne Kush) is one fine strain. When these sticky, dense, vivid green buds are ground up, they release the classic blueberry and spice scent of the Blue Dream, along with a hint of a tingling in the nose from the Champagne Kush. The taste is a little diminished, though nothing to scoff at. I was pretty good. Moving onto the high, it&#39;s very mellow, perfect focus medicine. The perfect combo between head and body. It definitely helps me interact with people, keeping me up and dancing while still allowing me to relax and not be so awkward. I will definitely buy this again.

VBlue Champagne is a great day starter. I know, I started my day with this wonderful strain and I must admit only a fool would complain!\u000a\u000aHow do you think I got the energy to get up and get out for some urgent must do errands?\u000a\u000aThis Blue Champagne is not for the kids \u2013 it\u2019s for grown-ups silly. Smoking this bud will inspire you to make and close deals.\u000a\u000aWhat a beautiful plant Blue Champagne is\u2026not only does it keep me calm but it keeps my mind on my money and it got me thinking: how can I take yours?\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this bud for people who like to practice the religion of Capitalism. People like Richard Branson \u2013 he smokes and we know all about it. I know; from one capitalist to another Richard would adore this strain.  Another name that comes to mind would be Elizabeth Taylor \u2013 she would come up with new beauty ideas to get all your money. A new perfume line perhaps?\u000a\u000aThis bud will help Elizabeth to capitalize on the marketplace and it might also help her to get creative and find a new husband. After the high is over she\u2019ll divorce him like she always does\u2026\u000a\u000aLadies: that\u2019s a women to look up too \u2013 not Madonna or J LO and guess what? Elizabeth didn\u2019t have to show any body parts to get paid. What a smart woman!\u000a\u000aKnow why? \u2018Cuz Liz has been medicated for years. That\u2019s why!\u000a\u000aPuff puff and hit the gold \u2013 it will help you to keep your mind on your pay-roll.\u000a\u000aJacky 18:03

VI was very excited to try this one out. It had a pungent blueberry order that you could smell from across the room when you opened the jar. Buds were tight and icy. Tasted very reminiscent of blue dream, very sweet. Little harsh, not bad though. Nice change up from your usual blue dream. Great hybrid.
