VThis strain is awesome it was the first I grew legally and then I grew again this year . I&#39;ll try to post some pics if I can figure it out. Starts to turn purple if outdoors and towards end of cycle of it&#39;s cold enough outside. Smells incredible, fruity ,earthy, nice thick dense buds with a purplish hue and tons of orange hairs. Perfect for daytime as it does not overpower you

VI got a gram of ripped bubba extract yesterday. After not being physically active much due to working on a computer all day (and a deep love of crispy pork) i played tennis a lot last week and dug a hole in clay (digging i havent done much in a long time). As a result of being out of shape i was mad sore. I woke up all night with pain, ripped a couple dabs of ripped bubba, and I went straight from anxious, stressed, depressed, and sinus infected with so much pain, to sitting here on my phone writing this review because this strain actually makes me feel more optimistic than usual and i feel compelled to share my experience.

VTight yellowish-green clusters of small, resin-caked calyxes are very nice to look at. Mild musty cheese aroma in the jar with a faint citrus smell when broken up. Flavor is very subtle - almost tasteless, but a whisper of savory herb remains in the mouth on exhale. True sativa effect (which is a surprise coming from such dense flowers,) medium-duration, medium-intensity. Not bad, but not awesome.

VThis is my first review on Leafly because I&#39;ve never smoked enough of one specific train to really get a feel for it. I&#39;ve gone through more than an ounce of this stuff in the past couple weeks and it&#39;s truly shaped up to be one of my favorites. First of all, it is kiefy beyond anything I had ever seen. Each nug coated with a thick dusting of kief, enough that even a mid-size nug would give me enough kief for a full kief pack of my bowl. This strain might be a Sativa dominant hybrid, but it definitely gives you the heavy, heady feeling of an indica. While it doesn&#39;t put you to sleep like an indica, it leaves you in a shape of true relaxation where one could easily fall asleep comfortably, but doesn&#39;t necessarily have to. It also goes well with food, providing a good amount of the munchies that all dank bud should. Overall, this flower in particular is incredibly satisfying and suitable to anyone wanting to relax, feel great, sleep well, and enjoy life.

VCurious having Jack&#39;s distant clarity during Bubba&#39;s potent come on. I&#39;m afraid they don&#39;t harmonize super well. There&#39;s a persistent, disquieting...offness. Like foods or colors that don&#39;t QUITE pair. Not bad...just, a tad below neutral.\u000a\u000aThe tingly, racy sativa surges like a current over your body. Again, the Jack clarity seems at odds with the distance of the high. The clearness does allow thoughts to flow freely and is exceptionally easy to concentrate. It&#39;s a positive high you can appropriately zone out to and not be bothered by the passage of time.\u000a\u000aThere&#39;s a peaceful comfort coming about now. It&#39;s settling in, becoming more relaxing and euphoric. Oh my gosh...now I&#39;m on a roller coaster soaring off! Holy dissociative...this is borderline nitrous.\u000a\u000aMusic and visuals are enjoyable enough, but frankly it&#39;d be fair to expect more. What it does have going for it is an awesome ability to zone the fuck out and easily go on the coolest mental trips. Your consciousness is like a pea - tiny, but focused amidst a dampening ether.\u000a\u000aA bit unnerving now. My hackles are raising for no reason. Eesh...time to distract myself.
