VThe batch I got was tested at 29% thc 1.6% cbd, which I feel like is higher than the norm for this strain grown by pioneer nugs. I was thinking it might hit me like a ton of bricks so I really eased into it and wow. This was probably one of the nicest highs I have ever had. Came on almost instantly and kept me in an even heady and body state for most the evening watching Planet Earth 2. Maybe it was the animals and scenery that made this smoke so good but either way I think I found a new fave! Curious to see if a normal lower potency batch has the same effects. I feel like it will.

Vbuds created by the pixies themselves holy sh.t they&#39;re so crystallized. it&#39;s that bud you put off to the side until the end because it&#39;s too pretty to smoke. it also tastes like a blue dream almost and follows with a long relaxing and motivation buzz

VGreat euphoric high while remaining pretty chill. Definitely a hybrid feeling to it, but leaning slightly more towards sativa. Wouldn&#39;t want to do it at night, but it also isn&#39;t going to inspire me to clean the garage. Good Saturday afternoon choice.

Vthis strain was more energizing than I typically expect from a hybrid; it might be due to its potency - my sample was 24% THC. I wouldn&#39;t call it &#39;jittery&#39; (like green crack or cinex), but I was practically vibrating. fortunately, the sativa-like energizing effect wasn&#39;t accompanied by any tendency toward getting too caught up in my thoughts. one additional plus for this one: both times that I&#39;ve tried it, there was a noticeable analgesic effect. potent, energizing, analgesic - a lovely strain, recommended (unless you&#39;re looking for sedation). btw, for all you flavor-seekers: there was a noticeable blueberry flavor, from low to high temperature vaporizing.

VI reacted totally different than anyone. I&#39;m probably going to stay away from due to horrible headache post high. There were waves of euphoria that went into a wave of physical exhaustion with the end result being pass out which was my goal due to a stressful day and wanted mind free to sleep. The final goal of sleep was achieved but the journey there was not pleasurable
