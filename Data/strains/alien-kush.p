VAfter smoking this strain for a week or so I can say that it&#39;s intense on the body and the brain follows suit. Some key moments I had: I could hear my eyes blinking loudly (it sounded like a door closing lol), beer-induced stomach rumblies were put well to ease, emotions were amplified heavily at times, and I ate like I was Cookie Monster at Willy Wonka&#39;s factory. Only gave me anxiety once, which accounts for the minus-1 star, and that&#39;s when I took a rather large hit. I&#39;d definitely say a little goes a long way with this one, it&#39;s a cute little high but this little kitty CAN bite.

Vgreat strain for relaxing at the end of the day. I mainly like sativa heavy hybrids, but like to change it up every now and again.  Heavy body high, when smoked, tastes amazing out of the vaporizer,  highly recommend for sleepy time smoking.

VI bought this strain based on its review of being a good sativa. \u000aAfter smoking a bong in the morning I found it to hit me more  like a indica. \u000aI didnt like how it couch locks me and make me zone out with a busy mind. \u000aI found it worsened my anxiety and depression and didnt lift me up like my jack herer or jack frost does.  \u000aThis strain will for sure be saved for migrains and bad fibromyalgia pain days where i just wanna sleep. \u000aCheers &amp; Happy Smoking

VThe strain alone isn&#39;t amazing, but when cross-pollinated with pretty much anything it makes some incredible strains.  Every single phenotype I&#39;ve smoked that had Fire Alien OG genetics bred into it has been perfectly dense yet fluffy, and absolutely coated in white frost. If you&#39;re looking to breed something new, I would highly recommend Fire Alien to be your better half, you won&#39;t regret it.

VBurns nicely in a pipe and did not create a smell when smoked. Started to kick in within 5 minutes, but the first thing I noticed was cotton mouth (I wasn&#39;t a big fan). Made me super paranoid and felt like I was going to faint, but once that went away it was amazing. The High lasted Approximately 4.5 hours.

Vvery potent strain took only a few hits, maybe 1 or 2 at night and it was felt immediately very relaxing. It was definitely a body high for me for sure, which I prefer. lasted about two to three hour high I&#39;d say which is pretty decent. chill at home for this one for sure because it did kind of make me and my bf have slight a run with paranoia.

VThis stuff is strong (and I smoke or vape daily) but one of the most beautiful strains I&#39;ve had. Alien Kush has made for some amazing evenings. It starts as a nice head high. I usually hang out outside a little bit first, listen to the birds and enjoy the breeze. Then I go inside and watch something exciting (last night it was Avengers Infinity War) because Alien Kush makes it even more exciting. By the end of the movie, I&#39;ve melted into a puddle of relaxation and feel like I&#39;m gently swaying in a hammock. Then I have incredible, tingly toes, intense emotional connection sex. Alien Kush is awesome.

I really like the taste it actually taste a bit like ok although it has a lil taste of chemical and earthy and the effect it gives I decided to smoke it in  a joint and it was perfect for me since it took away some pain and diverts my mind to think about new creative  things.

VTough strain to describe. For me it&#39;s really the best of both worlds. It gives me an immediate rush of euphoria similar to a sativa before settling into more of a relaxed, full body indicated style high, minus the fatigue. Whereas a lot of sativas make my mind rush, this allows me to focus intently and really magnifies any emotions I&#39;m feeling, for better or for worse. I watched the Walking Dead premiere on this...so intense. I&#39;m adding this to he permanent rotation.

VThis stuff is strong (and I smoke or vape daily) but one of the most beautiful strains I&#39;ve had. Alien Kush has made for some amazing evenings. It starts as a nice head high. I usually hang out outside a little bit first, listen to the birds and enjoy the breeze. Then I go inside and watch something exciting (last night it was Avengers Infinity War) because Alien Kush makes it even more exciting. By the end of the movie, I&#39;ve melted into a puddle of relaxation and feel like I&#39;m gently swaying in a hammock. Then I have incredible, tingly toes, intense emotional connection sex. Alien Kush is awesome.

Vvery potent strain took only a few hits, maybe 1 or 2 at night and it was felt immediately very relaxing. It was definitely a body high for me for sure, which I prefer. lasted about two to three hour high I&#39;d say which is pretty decent. chill at home for this one for sure because it did kind of make me and my bf have slight a run with paranoia.

V9/10 This strain did exactly what the description said, I really wish to the Garden of Weeden that those initial effects can be made to last longer, such an instant rush of bliss. I&#39;ve been having trouble feeling an appetite recently but this strain sure helps stimulate that. Would recommend.
