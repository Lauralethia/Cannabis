VI experimented and grew Orange Creamsicle last summer, harvested it last fall, and its been curing (with Boveda packs...so amazing!) ever since then. Outrageously appealing smell of citrus and earth. In my Pax 2 the taste is very mild, bordering on non-existant, probably making it a good starter strain for novices. What is interesting is the after-taste...the citrus pleasantly lingers and it is really tasty at that point. Only 2 hits and I&#39;m feeling GREAT. Very buzzy and uplifting. Definitely a perfect strain to help get through the day&#39;s shitstorm from our nation&#39;s capital without slitting my wrists.

Such an incredible taste, literally like the very popsicle itself. Where I am right now (off a king sized spliff) is better than I have ever felt right now, this bud brings me truly closer to myself, the world, the universe, and beyond.

As a daily user, I&#39;m always on the lookout for something that will heighten my senses and motivate me to be active and experience things vs. just a sedating effect which would give me solid sleep.

VEverything about this strain is fantastic. The taste, the aroma, the texture of the buds, the beautiful presentation of orange and green. When smoked in a joint or one hitter, you can really taste the strong tropical flavor, actually reminiscent of a orange creamsicle pop, or more seeming more similarly to me as a glass of orange juice. A great smoke, with a floaty, very strong body and head high, a true hybrid and a true favorite of mine. Very strong too, one moment you think you&#39;re fine and decide to take a couple more hits, the next you find yourself floating out in space. So good!

VGreat strain!\u000aMine was tested at 10.7 thc.\u000aThe buds were just above mids, nice orange hairs with just a bit of tri coverage. The scent of the bud is citrus with a bit of sweet and woodsy smell.\u000a\u000aThe high is great! Very mellow, mainly head but a healthy dose of body high.\u000aIt energizes you, but not in a speedy kind of way, and you&#39;re nice and focused and happy.\u000a\u000aDidn&#39;t taste much of the&quot;orange&quot; but there is a tinge of sweet underlying the mainly woody scent.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain for light activities like hanging out at the beach or the park.\u000aNot great for hiking as it gives you a mellow energy.\u000a\u000aMakes you a wee bit dizzy and sleep on the come down.\u000aDefinitely would buy again for 10 bucks
