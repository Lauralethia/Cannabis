VChecked out Billo in Steamboat Springs and picked up a pre-roll of this along with some other goodies. We purchased it on the fly...kind of like some of the stuff you grab in the checkout lane  y&#39;know? It sounded decent, so what the hell eh?\u000aThe wife and I would probably give it a 3.5 rating if we could, but it leaned a little closer to a 4 just because it was fairly smooth and tasted decent. It may have been better if we&#39;d purchased flower versus a pre-roll but we&#39;re ok with pre-rolls normally to make a determination if we&#39;d like to purchase it again.\u000aThe effects lasted just about an hour and was more of a head high than the body high we tend to shoot for when selecting strains. We weren&#39;t disappointed but weren&#39;t all that impressed either.

VThe strain makes me feel hyper-critical. Very different type of High. Bought it on the Tange lineage.

VLove this strain . Perfect hybrid, the relaxed of the indica and the trippiness of the sativa make it a fun high for sure .  I usually can blaze about 3 joints of decent herb and function fine ; I smoked half a j of this shit and was stuck , hahah.  An enjoyable stuck, of course ... :)

VThe taste is great, especially when vaping flower in my pax unit.  I recommend this strain for just kicking back and relaxing. Had a long day and this helped me chill out nicely.

VTotally an amazing strain I typically enjoy indica&#39;s for my MS this has a mouth watering sweet orange flavor that intensifies as you exhale! (Blow the smoke through your nose total game changer ) I have found a new day time smoke!
