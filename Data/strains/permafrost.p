VPermafrost is a true gift for sufferers of anxiety and depression. It works wonders in the morning as an engine starter and replaced my red bull/coffee.  Permafrost has a nutty taste that is reminiscent of white widow, though no where near as strong, mixed with a mint like flavor. The instant effects have driven away several panic attacks and for that reason alone I always try to keep some permafrost on hand.

VOne of my favorites, me and my friend got super chopped of this strain and somehow convinced our German Teacher to leave the whole room to us before she left. I&#39;m sorry for getting off topic, so I&#39;ll talk about the high now. In a nutshell I&#39;d say the greatest effect it had on me is it made me just be in a very good mood and very talkative in a calm way, as well as a good one to get the munchies with because it seemed like food tasted better then when I was chopped on other occasions in different strains. In the end it&#39;s great Weed and if it&#39;s available to you, you need to hope on the opportunity!

VI really like this strain. I just randomly came across it and was pleasantly surprised that this strain is cheap (where I bought it anyways), tastes great, and works wonders for my anxiety. I wasn\u2019t expecting the strain to curve it at all but it did so that\u2019s always a big plus for me in strains. Big buds with beautiful crystals. Makes me happy, euphoric, relaxed, and focused. I\u2019m able to enjoy tv watching, creative writing, or basically anything with this. Absolutely no couch lock for me and I love that &#128077;&#127995; for sure will buy again.

VI&#39;ve smoked several different phenotypes of permafrost..   Right now I have the best batch i have ever gotten from my MMJ dealer, perfectly cured and sparkly smelly and yummy all the way around, so i thought I would write a review real quick.  First of all the smell of this stuff is very sweet and piney, very nice.  The smell after smoked is truly unique and seriously fkin pungent and dank.  The high is a creeper, very full body and mind effects completely heavy but functional effects.  Good for heavy smokers like myself, although i&#39;m more partial to haze sativa dominant hybrids, or anything blueberry.  the peak high for permafrost doesn&#39;t last quite as long as other smokes,  although the body effects linger sufficiently. it packs more of a punch than most sativa dominant hybrids but doesn&#39;t last as long imo.  Nice punch to the dome to unwind the day thats for sure, overall a solid hybrid if grown properly, for day or night use.

V1st off a couple of things, I live in Sacramento and this strain is huge here in nor cal and after speaking to MANY MASTER GROWERS of this exact strain, the TRUE GENETICS are actually (White Widow x Northern Lights). Its considered to be very close to a 50/50 hybrid. I&#39;ve bought this strain from 6 different dispensaries here in Sac and I even bought an 8th of it while visiting my Dad in Washington and all 7 times the label showed that the lineage is in fact white widow crossed with northern lights, and since I&#39;ve smoked both white widow and northern lights on their own a million times, I know their taste, effects, and all of their traits and I can honestly say that permafrost is definitely white widow crossed with northern lights. Anyone who brings up this trainwreck bullshit or anything else that adds a huge amount of sativa is just idiotic. Now there may be strains out there that are white widow crossed with trainwreck or some other strong sativa, but whoever bred those strains needs to change the name of it and stop calling it permafrost cuz its simply not permafrost. But I must say that the REAL permafrost is AMAZING!!!

VOne of my favorite all time, all around strains. Potent midday to late afternoon strain. Slightly heavy for morning but still doable if need be. The perfect hybrid of all time! Slightly heavier than White Widow in terms of effects. Taste much like WW also. If i had to pick only one strain for all the time, this would be it. That&#39;s how much I like this strain. Only downside is the taste is not fruity (although I still like the taste), and it can be slightly harsh sometimes, but not way overly harsh. My lungs are kind of sensitive due to I smoked cigarettes for 20 years. Thank God THC and CBD kills cancer tumors or I&#39;d be dead right now BTW.

VThis is a great strain, I mean fucking great. It definitely creeps up on you..and when you peak, the floaty head high along with the subtle stoney couch lock body high is just perfect. It doesn&#39;t make you tired but it doesn&#39;t get you too creative, uplifted either. It&#39;s a perfect blend of both worlds with the sativa rush slightly overpowering its chilled indica sister. I&#39;m keyed off this right now as I write this, it&#39;s been about 45 minutes now and It is definitely creeping up as we speak. Like I said, perfect pairing of both planets..becoming one, and becoming one colossal, epic fucking strain.

VThis strain has a lightly sweet and minty smell. The flower has a medium amount of resin on it. The flowers density was medium and the light green color provided a nice compromise to the darkness of the hairs. \u000aPerfect for its ability to inspire and provide an increased sense of focus, Permafrost provides a high that could be described as euphoric, happy, focused, and driven. One interesting thing is that Permafrost didn&#39;t make us want to be social nor did it make us overly conversational or talkative. \u000aPermafrost is perfect for a morning session or something to help you kick off a big project.

VI&#39;m over 40 I just remember that we used to have brown waiting green weed and then somebody said the word hydroponic and the next thing I knew is I had permafrost and I remember it and it was 23 +years ago and it&#39;s was around after I gave up smoking after I had bills and kids. Still got bills.........kids grown both college aged. It will creep  on you body after head first no punching in my face just comes over you a real pleasure relaxing and no paranoia very social. If you have nobody to talk to you go ahead  smoke to much you&#39;ll be bed locked.

VI really like this strain a lot so far! It can bring you out of the doldrums very swiftly. I also think it&#39;s tasty and the clear head high is very refreshing. I get definite euphoria and a general sense of peace from this. It&#39;s not a jolt like a normal sativa, this is definitely a slow and steady wins the race type of high. I&#39;d recommend it highly!

VThis strain has a lightly sweet and minty smell. The flower has a medium amount of resin on it. The flowers density was medium and the light green color provided a nice compromise to the darkness of the hairs. \u000aPerfect for its ability to inspire and provide an increased sense of focus, Permafrost provides a high that could be described as euphoric, happy, focused, and driven. One interesting thing is that Permafrost didn&#39;t make us want to be social nor did it make us overly conversational or talkative. \u000aPermafrost is perfect for a morning session or something to help you kick off a big project. I find that it really helps to increase my level of focus while working on repetitive tasks.

VThis is a long-time favorite strain.  Very uplifting, and happy, stress melts away as euphoria sets in.  Great day-time, social high, awesome for social gamers.  The body high is strong, joints feel warm, and are warmer to the touch relaxing any joint pain, or stiffness.  Muscles relax, and you just live happily.  This strain, without fail, also is great as an aphrodisiac.  I have found it to surprisingly do better at that with the more Sativa dominant phenotypes, but not once have I ever had a bad Permafrost.  Taste is pleasantly piney, and herbal, similar to Vegetable Thin crackers I suppose, with notes of sage as well.  I get similar effects from Blue Dream, and Chernobyl which both last longer than Permafrost, but Permafrost of the three is the best all-around, do-it-all Hybrid.  Permafrost is the Hybrid strain against which all other Hybrids should be measured.

VMy favorite strain by far. Pain relief is definitely the best medical attribute. The effects are amazing. Permafrost starts slow, with a happy calming effect. As one&#39;s high builds, the user begins to feel creative. A climatic euphoria now trancends over the body and lasts about 20 minutes. After the climax, the user feels creative for approx. 30 min. Then the user maintains a happy feeling for approx. 50 min. Pain relief can last up to four hours between doses.

Though, my mind feels so blank when I&#39;m smoking this stuff that sometimes I just sit there doing nothing and not realize it. Whether that&#39;s good or bad is personal preference. I felt good while high on Permafrost, but it was uneventful. Still, it&#39;s definitely a solid strain. I got the munchies hard (I had a McDouble I didn&#39;t want to finish because I felt full before I got high, but then that sandwich looked irresistible).

Vi\u2019m bipolar. concentration, mania, depression, anxiety and chronic insomnia are all painful symptoms. i smoke medicinally so i only need two average hits for it to take effect. obviously, the sativa is almost instantaneously induced, gets real heady, like i need to do something, anything... energy was present. in about 20 minutes the underlying indica emerges hitting me in waves and as i watch a movie, i must fight to stay awake at time. the big deal is that with this crazy hybrid is i need less anxiety medicine and focus and relaxation are in the mix. i would say, just be prepared to relax quickly if you stop moving. \u000a\u000aanother side note... i would argue highly we are smoking some Ww here... i know how my spiders creep.

VI picked up 2 grams for Permafrost from different farms to compare them against each other. One was a lower THC then the other so it was not even a close. Not my all time fav but still very tasty. I tried this with an Ice cube in my bong and it left the smoke smooth and cold, which complimented this strain nicely. Really relaxing body feeling and mind for that matter.

VPurchased from Higher Leaf in Kirkland\u000aFlower: named aptly, Permafrost is ridiculously frosty. Big fluffy nugs, some almost the size of clementines. Smell reminds me of northern lights. Old school aroma. \u000aCrumble: a bit on the leafy side, didn&#39;t grind as well as I thought it would. Perhaps it was a dryer batch. \u000aBurn: smooth and clean, even. Doesn&#39;t want to stay lit long so I suppose it&#39;s good for bongs and pipes. Not so much for joints and blunts. \u000aTaste: don&#39;t expect any fruity terpenes or top shelf style food references, just plain old earthy piney skunky dope. \u000aHigh: clear minded buzz. Relaxing but no couch lock. What I would expect from a sativa with 20% THC. \u000aOverall: 7.5/10\u000a

VDefinitely a strain for the seasoned smoker! A couple puffs of permafrost will have you feeling great and euphoric in no time. The more of this strain you smoke the heavier the effects will be! Great for going out with friends or when you have some time to be around the outdoors.

This is by far my favorite strain, the smell, the taste, the high, everything about it is great. It has a really relaxing high but I also found I could sit and studying for hours on end while smoking this. Overall, I give this strain a 5/5.

It&#39;s light, not overwhelming, and i&#39;ve been using it to help me fall asleep, and save my more potent stuff for later.  No big revelations or deep thoughts, but it is uplifting.

VMy favorite for when I want an indica type effect (I know it is described as sativa oriented hybrid by most). This is a very strgon hybrid, that will make you pretty mellow. Actually there are 3 different versions. Mine I am speaking of right now is the original, which has purple stalk and stems. The other versions are similar, but not always. I&#39;ve had weak permafrost before too. If you want a hybrid that is sort of like white widow, but just a bit stronger, and more indica feeling, that&#39;s permafrost. Nice thing is it&#39;s so strong you don&#39;t have to smoke much. You can feel it in the eyes, and in the head, it makes you hungry everytime so watch  out (with the original version, the others not as much). Hrd to get any work done on this.

VI&#39;m not sure I smoked the described herb here. My effects are quite different from what I expected. It&#39;s not affecting me like a sativa at all, makes me mellow and lazy. Like I want to grab a big bag of chips or popcorn and watch South Park for a few hours. The nugs were certainly frosty, gorgeous and sparkly... Maybe I should save the rest for xmas eve and snack and relax all evening. But for myself it&#39;s not a good daytime medicine at all.

VPermafrost... Such a beautiful flower. This strain is one of the few that stays true to its name. The structure of the bud is very similar to Trainwreck with the glossy White Widow finish. This strain tastes similar to molasses finished dirt grown Afghani with a hint of Trainwreck. Earthy, sweet, and skunky. I would like this strain more if I didn&#39;t dislike Trainwreck from having it too much over the years. The stone is pleasant and relaxing with  out the sleepy effect. Best for use when you would like to chill indica style later in the day.

VGood Strain, will couch lock you for a little while in larger doses but very relaxed. Regular dosage will leave you with some nice visual effects, a nice body calm, all around a good bud if you are going to be out and about or socializing at a party etc. Not the bud to smoke if you are trying to get work done on a computer/behind a desk in my opinion. A good strain but not something I would smoke regularly.

VA little slow to come on but when you feel it, you really feel it. I found it really increased my creativity and I felt great. The downsides, for me, was a little bit of social anxiety and paranoia.

VBe careful, this strain grows on you. I tried it and liked it and the next thing I knew this strain was like an old friend to come home to after a hard day at work. \u000a\u000aIt bulldozes stress, yet does not cause couch lock. I used it before playing drums for a few hours and the strain tickled my creativity. Too much brought on a caffeine type buzz that doesn&#39;t work for de-stressing if you are sitting still. So you should be doing something creative or physical. \u000a\u000aAnother good thing about this strain is that (to me) it is a very forgiving strain if you do take some big hits. Some strains instantly turn into paranoia if you do too much too soon. (Be freaking careful using Red Dragon for example!) But Permafrost (like an old friend) soon becomes familiar and easy to enjoy no matter how you hit it.

VI picked up 2 grams for Permafrost from different farms to compare them against each other. One was a lower THC then the other so it was not even a close. Not my all time fav but still very tasty. I tried this with an Ice cube in my bong and it left the smoke smooth and cold, which complimented this strain nicely. Really relaxing body feeling and mind for that matter. Was listening to Three Little Birds and loving every second of it.

I had already got a couple other things so I asked for 2 grams of permafrost without even looking at it because I was in a hurry (Stupid move). The bud was very plain looking. Nothing special at all. Plus it was BONE DRY. It was horrible. The smoke was harsh and the high was barely even felt. I just got a bad batch and will try again. But 6/10 for me right now.

VI&#39;ve smoked quite a bit of bud but this is by far my favorite. If you&#39;re able to get your hands on this 10/10 strain then do it! You won&#39;t regret it!

VEach time I try this strain it disappoints, no punch, short duration with little med value. After several different sources I think this one is just not for me.
