VGot this strain branded as Ken&#39;s OG from Royal Tree. Fantastic buds, and great flavor. Mellow relaxed high that has led into significant arousal and absolutely fantastic sex. One of my favorite strains here in Seattle.

VHas a fluffy feel too it and a fruity smell to it. Burns great but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to someone who has a taste for stronger and more potent stands such as AK-47 or OG Sour Diesel.

VGreat overall strain, not sure bout the cat that said theirs had no flavor, I feel sorry for you guys!?!?  Berries-grapes mixed nicely with the OG Kush and sour diesel to really bring out the potent High and delicious terpy!!!! A little anxiety and paranoia but slightly

VThis is a review of kens kush from Fireline a i 502 producer\u000aThe bud was covered in trichomes a light green color.  Very citrusy smell to the buds.  Upon smoking in the waterpipe there is a nice hashy taste with overtones of citrus on your lips.   The high is a high powered kush high not the best for going to sleep for me at least but it is a good day time  strain.

VThis review is on Ken&#39;s Kush sugar by Slaughter Genetics out of Colorado Springs, C.O..\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed the cross of these three strains.  The GDP really sweetens up the mix and adds a touch of grape. I love grape.  The high itself was comfortable, but I still got a sativa emphasis similar to Sour Kush or Headband but not overwhelming.  I can&#39;t speak for the actual herb but it made for tasty oil.  9/10

VI only purchased a pre roll of Ken&#39;s kush. I felt like I needed more to feel it&#39;s full potential strain effects. Fantastic smell, slow burning. Definitely a strain to recommend if you&#39;re by yourself
