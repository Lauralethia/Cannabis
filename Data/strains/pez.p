VA friend of mine just harvested and this was one of the strains that he gifted me. The buds were very dense and sticky (so sticky that I usually grind my weed this stuff was hell on my grinder even a high quality one like a Cali Crusher Home Grown.) They are a light blueish grey green and while being very dense they aren&#39;t chunky and have a good amount of bright orange hairs the flavor is very sweet I&#39;ve heard it describes as minty honey it&#39;s very good and very different I&#39;ve never tasted anything else that I thought this tastes like PEZ. I was told that this tested in at about 20% total THC. I&#39;ve also noticed recently that THC totals don&#39;t necessarily matter as much as some people think I&#39;ve often times felt much more &quot;highly medicated&quot; on strains with much lower THC content than others and this strain feels great it&#39;s extremely relaxing without feeling like I wana take a nap I really like this strain and I appreciate what this strain can be when you get someone with the knowledge willing to put in the time and care. I&#39;m very interested to see how much different this strain will be coming from a recreational grower with less time but more money to spend. Anyway this can be a great strain kinda akin to smoking a Valium or something thanks to T.B. for the amazing sample looking forward to more. If you like indica and the buds look good deffinetly try this strain!

VPez is a Washington State Clone only originally from Lopez Island, which is where it got it&#39;s name. The Pez plant produces dense spear head nuggets that have a hunger inducing effect that&#39;s sure to please.

VAnother of my favorites! Smells amazing when broken up, has fairly dense and hairy nugs that aren\u2019t too sticky and grind up well. Has an aroma of blueberries, sweet fruit candy, and fresh earthiness. Great body high and strong but clean mental high as well.

VThe honey taste of this strain is smooth and sweet. It&#39;s  very satisfying flavor. Even though this is an indica strain, it&#39;s effects don&#39;t couch lock you for the most part. You could smoke this to just hang out on your couch or bed and do some gaming for the evening. It&#39;s relaxing, but doesn&#39;t make you sleepy. It also piques your creativity a bit, too.

VAmazing taste with pulls of lemon icing, sweet grass, and a pine smell. Found that this strain gave me some mental clarity (though I kept losing my train of thought) with a mild body high and some clumsiness. Fell asleep after an hour or so. A great Pacific Northwest strain! Strain 2 of 100.

VExactly what I want from an indica.  Makes you relaxed and sleepy.  Taste is slight citrus heavy diesel.  But definitely smooth.  I sleep great and do not feel bad at all the next day.  Definitely not for daytime use unless mixed with a sativa.  I did a mix of this and Hong Kong Diesel...  totally different experience but an incredible high.  Probably one of the best in my opinion.   I&#39;ll keep tokin this...
