VI just recently tried this strain for the first time today. Mt. Rainier is great for daytime use, or a &quot;wake and bake.&quot; I smoked one bowl of this strain at 8:50 am and got so high that I didn&#39;t come down until 12:30 pm. It&#39;s an amazing hybrid, just enough Indica to give you a powerful body high in the beginning, and not make you too tired. I came home and started to write a part of my sociology essay that is due in 9 days. And after reviewing it, it was clear that the paragraph I rewrote was so much better than the original questioned paragraph about how sociology is like/unlike hard science. The creativeness and focus this strain gave me was amazing. Mt. Rainier is a great strain to smoke when you have things to do, like feed four horses in the morning (I do that every morning) and write a new part of your sociology paper. 5 DAYS LATER. I woke up today (the day of my math 120 college test) and smoked one bowl of Mt. Rainier around 7:30 am and took my math 120 test at 10:30 am, I was still a little high and I took my time, and answered every question except for three which I did not know, and reviewed my answers before submitting. And I got a really good score, 85%! This is an unforgettable strain for a wake and bake.

Vtruthfully 3 1/2 stars\u000a\u000aThis strain leaves no doubt as to what it is as it smells strong from the minute you open up the package. Within minutes the room will take on the smell, woodsy and skunky are great descriptors as the smell is nearly overwhelming. However, once you get past that the bud itself is a dark green and leafy and quite sticky.\u000a\u000aWhile I was expecting a rough drag on the vape, Rainier is fairly mellow in comparison to its expectation. The high doesn&#39;t hit you too quickly and once it does come on it lasts for quite a while. On my first drag the effects lasted a good 2 1/2-3 hours and I debated about taking another drag before hitting the sheets but decided to ride it out and sleep came over me fairly quickly. I plan on giving it another go tonight as it was a fairly light high that would allow me to do other things without getting too deep into my own thoughts. \u000a\u000aThis would be a good strain to use when doing household chores or pulling weeds as the buzz will allow you to do mundane things without getting bored but not too high where you make mistakes.

VGood active strain, would say more sativa than indica. It was interesting, kind of a &quot;light&quot; high.

VThis strain is so tasty. It smells like Christmas to me somehow, like butter cookies. light colored, frosty nugs with orange hairs. The smoke is delicious.

VAwesome high.... easily one of my wife and I&#39;s favorite strains. Great mix of a head and body high. This is our go to strain for sure.
