Vsmells like cherry cola gummies, delicious!  The smell in the air after a hit has a zang to it, almost like the cherry cola (Roy Rogers) turns into a Shirley Temple since it has a more citrusy aspect to it.\u000a\u000aThis indica seemed much more like a sativa.  I didn&#39;t get much body effects from it, and the type of head high was not really of interest to me.\u000a\u000aHad some Granddaddy Purple a few hours before, and that one was way more powerful than this one.

VI have chronic pain in my back, and depression and this strain really centered me! I don&#39;t take my mess anymore due to the option of smoking, but this strain by far! She&#39;s so sweet and smooth and cradles you gently into euphoric calms. I didn&#39;t feel to paranoid but rather fidgety and got a lot done ha! But I highly recommend if you are in a funk and have pain, take back control of your body! Get productive again.

VI was able to score 4.5 grams of some very sweet smelling (and VERY kief covered, [like, for real. The pollen catch on my grinder was FULL of good stuff]!)                  Central California outdoor for about $20. Now, being outdoor (and probably not treated with proper respect and maintenance), this was not the best batch I could have found.                                     So why did I give it 4 stars? Well, even though this was some Reggie outdoor, the sweet, cherry/berry smell and taste were still VERY intriguing and worth savoring. This strain would be perfect in dessert edibles.                                         The effects themselves (with my batch that is) leaves something to be desired. However, I feel if I had gotten a better batch than I did (i.e.: a Hydro/Indoor batch..) it had the potential to be a powerhouse Indica, maybe even up there with my absolute favorite Indica: Blackberry Kush.                                         So I say if you have some outdoor of this strain, maybe consider making edibles. If you don&#39;t have enough to do so, it&#39;s terpene profile is worth a tasty smoke. So I gave this one 4 stars because if grown right and taken good care of, this has the potential to be an AMAZING strain.

The flower was fine and resembled more of a trimmed bush than a dense bud. \u000a\u000aA very nice social smoke to look cool while writing or chilling at a picnic/concert. I&#39;d recommend this strain for beginners as an very pleasing introductory course to cannabis. \u000a\u000aEnjoy newbies!!!

It doesn&#39;t muck very much with your brain but you&#39;re left with that feeling that it&#39;s all going to be ok and in the end, life is amazing. I took it for some massive pain that usually aspirin or t3&#39;s can&#39;t handle. So far, she&#39;s holing up very nicely. I&#39;m aware that the injury is there (which is important because some pain is a result from a pain injury) so you don&#39;t forget about it or over exert yourself.
