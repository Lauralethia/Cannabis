VThis bud came compact and looked awful but once smoked it gave a nice cerebral high that lasted about an hour and a half. The buds are all squashed together and a dark green colour. The smell is very herbal rather than cannabis smell but when burned you can smell that it&#39;s cannabis.

Vits really not pretty (illegally imported therefore compacted) but hell is it good, spicy fruity taste, long lasting energizing high, yet relaxing, and gets you in the mood for your wife if you see what i mean. Waaay better than the frosty chemically grown stuff, pure natural outdoor, dont hit you hard

VTried different local strains. They say the best is from the west, in my case that was more than true :)\u000aIt&#39;s the kind of herb you can enjoy all day and not feel dizzy or anxious. It&#39;s effects are complementary on your state of mind and body. In the morning, helps to get some energy, in the noon with relaxation and social activities, while in the evening smooths you down to a sleepy and calm feeling.

VThe Jamaican is always good to take because you like to be relaxed after being energetic. This is alright to take the advantage to be under her effect by the way she is good to find your pleasure by her inhalation. Easy to appreciate and to find good, don&#39;t hesitate to take the much you can, it&#39;s a strong but simple flower.
