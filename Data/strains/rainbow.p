VA sweet, super dense bud that leaves you feeling like you&#39;re floating in the zero gravity of outer space. This fruity indica dominant strain leaves your mind in the clouds with your body buzzing on the ground. The smoke for me was pretty harsh but I love the high you get from it. Waves of euphoria that tingles in your toes and fingers make this bud a top 5 bud, if you can get it do it!!

VVery sweet smell to these buds, but not overpowering. Would recommend for someone who wants pain management but still have a good head high. I have a somewhat high tolerance and after two bowls I was pretty lifted, got a tingly body throughout along with more social, but if you smoke too much you&#39;ll get a headache from this one. Really good strain!

VThis was an intense high! It somehow manages to make you feel blasted in outer space without being heavy or stoney. Makes you feel like you have no body... I wouldn&#39;t even say it&#39;s relaxing or numbing, it&#39;s almost like your body is simply outside your scope of awareness. It made my head a little speedy, but not in a bad way. I personally would have preferred less head high, but that&#39;s just me.

VThis review is based off a Cannasol batch packed in 8/15 and imbibed 1/16.\u000a\u000aWow. Seeing is believing with this strain. It&#39;s obvious upon glimpsing these nugs that they were hearty, healthy, and potent. But even more communicative of this strain&#39;s quality is the smell and taste of both bud and smoke. It is among the top three or two for me, personally. More generally. the grow choice here with this strain is absolutely brilliantly selected and executed, especially considering Cannasol grows sun-only. A unique gem of  top top shelf for a good price (aka mistaken for midshelf). Thanks Uncle Ike&#39;s!

VThis tasted like fruit punch! The smell is overwhelmingly wonderful. I questioned if I was smoking candy at one point. The high was happy and functional with a super comfy body buzz that keeps you on your feet. This is one of my go to video game strains. Love Walden&#39;s cut of it!!

VThe best thing ever. For now... Really perfect. The best fruity flavour and a great happy high. Not for pre-parties, not perfect so much for sleeping. Need a lot of energy but the feeling of happiness and electric body has no price.

VWow. First time trying this, used it for cramps. While it wasn&#39;t knocking me out, I wouldn&#39;t use this on a day when I need to get shit done. My attention span? Gone. Can&#39;t focus. Felt like I needed an adult because it wasn&#39;t going to be me. Helped with the pain, though. Dry mouth. \u000a\u000a(Used a pre-roll from Harvest of Tempe. Vaped with a pulsar apx.)
