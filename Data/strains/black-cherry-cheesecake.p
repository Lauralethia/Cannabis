VThis strain is the best thing ever since sliced bread. Got a nice head high, not too intense like Silvertip where it rushes to your head and not too slow like Mega Jackpot. It was right in the middle and that was exactly what I was looking for.\u000aAte a whole box of Oreos after taking three hits off a preroll I bought from Lucid. Halfway through, I had the genius idea of putting Milka chocolate in the cookie. Blew my mind with how good it was. Played video games and could focus enough not to suck too much, and I never truly spaced out. I had no worries, and I talked to my friend just fine. The aftermath was feeling really, really tired. Which for me is perfect,  because I have a hard time sleeping. If you have anxiety or depression like me, I highly recommend this strain. And if you want to have fun and then sleep like a baby, I have to tell you to try this out.

VThis is a good tasting strain, it burns nicely and the inhaled smoke is pleasant. I am not sure I agree with the description as the bud that I smoked did not have that much fruity taste or purple color or red hairs, but it was still very pleasant to smoke and nice aromatic aftertaste. The effects are more alert than totally relaxing, a true hybrid blend of Indica and Sativa. To me this strain beckons to be rolled in a joint and taken for a long walk down river, whilst talking with a friend. It has a social friendly vibe to me.

Just listen to some music that makes you feel comfortable and drift off to sleep.  Any negative side effects for me have been non existent besides a little dry mouth and that&#39;s it.

Vthe color on this strain is my favorite aspect about it, even more so than the trichome coverage.  it&#39;s deep purple and bright orange hairs give off an almost toxic vibe but the name is on point.  the flavor is slightly fruity, kinda cheesy and definitely a treat for the discerning palate.  the high is very lazy, read for reading, I felt it mostly in the body but experienced a couple giggle fits.  &#128513;&#128513;&#128513;

VAbsolutely beautiful, the most deep purple bud I&#39;ve ever seen. Sweet smell and smoke. Very relaxing and creative high -- the couchlock grows on you, but it&#39;s still a very mental strain; everything seems to flow.

VI\u2019m more of a pain patient, so that\u2019s why so few stars. The smell is on-point, as is the definitive color. The gorgeous bouquet is a feast for the nose, while the colors are reminiscent of those found within cherry pie. Flowers are deeply reddish-hued/cherry-red in parts and covered with lemon-yellow crystals. The trichomes are deeply honey-amber in color, nearly the caramel color of pie crust. \u000aThis strain is a feast for the senses: great nose &amp; excellent bag appeal. Reminds me of a cookies-type strain crossed with a bit of a diesel. This hybrid does take the edge off. You won\u2019t be out of the game, but you\u2019ll be wound just a little less tight. No couch lock. Clear-headed, positive and gentle medicine.

VPicked up a couple grams of this in Michigan, holy hell. The budtender said it was not top shelf, but i had to get it just based on the look and smell alone. Once i tested the strain, i was not disappointed. It held up against other &quot;top shelf&quot; strains i bought like gorilla glue, and pipe dream. The entire bud is dark purple with bright orange hairs. Great taste, would not smoke before work. The indica is heavy in this strain. Two thumbs up!!

VI\u2019ve recently obtained a large quantity of this strain for my back pain and for my sleeping issues. And holy crap was this a good choice. Not only is the cannabis pungent in its smell it\u2019s incredibly strong. I smoked about 3/4 of a joint and I was stoned to the bone. I later took a bong rip and could only got so far before I had to sit down. This strain definitely help my back, haven\u2019t felt a thing since medicating and I finally slept 13 hours the other day!! Amazing herb!

VIt&#39;s either Dark or Black Cherry Cheesecake. 1st strain I couldn&#39;t find on Leafly. Migraine pain 7; nausea 5 when I medicated round 1930? This one hits ya slow but hard. 5-10 min to start workin. Pain 3 @ worst; nausea gone. Body high very nice. Head buzz euphoric but not too strong. This one could be a worker bud or a sleepy bud; depending on what ya wanna do. Tasted more like cherry cola than cherry cheesecake. Noted a nutty undertone but didn&#39;t notice a cheesy taste. Gonna hafta try this one again. Def recommend! :-)
