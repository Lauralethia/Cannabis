VPhenomenal strain, would recommend to anyone looking to experience a high CBD sativa with no tiring side-effects. If you get this strain organic (certified), it will smell like tropical fruit, cloves and subtle mint/lemon hints. There is also the common CBD smell which brings a subtle warmth/earthiness into the mix. \u000a\u000aWhen smoked, this flower tastes primarily like ripe peaches and honey, with a decadent flowery/earthy taste mixed in. Hands down one of the best tasting strains I have tried, almost unbelievably similar to real peach with honey.\u000a\u000aThe calming CBD + CBG effects synergize with the low THC percentage in a way I have never experienced before. It&#39;s so balanced that the buzz is almost neutral, but still subtly apparent. Very good strain for all kinds of outdoor activities, poses no threat to motor skills, and is a vigorously effective mood enhancer. One of the best tasting/smelling strains I have ever tried.\u000a\u000aI think in other reviews where it smells anything but breathtaking and sweet, they had non-organic product. Absolutely no negative symptoms from this flower, and is as smooth smoked as you would expect vaped. If you get a chance to try this strain organic, it is definitely worth it. This is an example of AAA strain genetics.

VThis is the second CBD strain I&#39;ve smoked and I really really like it for day time smoking. Especially before I have to go out into a social setting. Calms me down, gives me energy, makes me social and giggly. I suffer from a panic disorder and BPD (borderline personality disorder) and my episodes of mood swings that can occur in seconds have been so bad lately, but I smoke this strain and it instantly calms me down, and lets me be happy and not feel so torn between feelings and out of control of my emotions.

VOne of the most clear-headed spirit lifting strains you can come across. Hard to find. Hard to find done well. When treated with care during grow, you can feel her energy explode over time, especially during a late flower and rigorous bloom. Doesn&#39;t need over-care but beware, prone to mold. She has very unique effects if put under a variety of conditions. &quot;Perfect&quot; conditions will cause her to have dense, exotic buds. Colder and more arid environments will show more whispy buds, yet still scent and flavor rich, intense berry-like parfume aroma with vibrant purple to green contrasts, white firey hairs to explode full red before harvest. A delight to all the senses.

VAs a sativa dominant strain, it gives you a very strong and mental highness, but in my opinion the both flavor and smell are too spicy: it seems to smoke origan, chili pepper and curry.\u000aNot recommended for night-time use and for the good fellows of the real hemp strains&#39; flavors.
