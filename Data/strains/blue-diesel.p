VStrain: Blue City Diesel (Blueberry / NYC Diesel cross -- Sativa leaning Hybrid)\u000aTHC: 19.91%\u000aCBD: 0.06%\u000aLocation found: Local Herb Collective \u000aDate purchased: 4.1.16\u000aPrice: $10.00/g\u000aWeight: 1.0g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: This particular batch was especially berry and earthy. I have seen a bunch of Blue City Diesel and this had more of a blueberry type smell than some Blueberry strains I have sampled. The mix of berries and diesely earth is unique and pungent.\u000aLook: Lighter green, pretty dense nugs with darker orange hairs. Kif coated and trimmed well. \u000aTaste: Smooth, heavy berry flavor with the diesel flavor quickly catching up and overpowering to remind me it was part of this equation.\u000aRecommendation for medicine: I have heard this one is an Indica for some. This one has got me up and going several times before and now. It would not be a strain I would use before bed, it feels a bit creative for that for me. Could be good for some for socializing, opening up and being a little more talkative.

Oh lawd, what don&#39;t I have going on? But seriously, as I was reading the reviews (cause I&#39;ve already gone over the other info) I can feel this start shutting off my damaged nerve receptors. If that&#39;s not a small miracle, I just don&#39;t know what is. Literally two hits, and I&#39;m ready to go conquer the mf day. Thank you to the person or people who breed this strain.

VBlue city diesel (blueberry x NYC Diesel)&#160;\u000aHad a chance to try this strain from a batch that had been properly cured for 90+ days. This strain comes from two of my favorite strains, blueberry (indica dominant) and NYC Diesel (primarily sativa dominant)&#160;\u000aAppearance: has the short leaves of an indica. Buds are of medium density, easy to break apart. Color is light green with light orange hairs and a dense forest of crystals.\u000aSmell: the overwhelming odor is that of diesel fuel.\u000aTaste:&#160;&#160;Smooth, not harsh - didn&#39;t cough once during the whole bowl.\u000aExperience: This is one of the most complex strains I&#39;ve experienced. It is a bit of a creeper. It starts as a kind of spacey high. Takes an effort to hold a complex train of thought. Social interaction with others would not be a problem. No paranoia. About 5 minutes later, the body effects kicked in and provided a deep relaxation. This strain would be great for muscle pain and spasms. Also good for relaxation and stress relief.\u000aDuration: about an hour at full effect, then tapers off over the next hour and a half. Left me dry eyed and ready to take a nap. Not very energetic at all. Very interesting how it migrates from a sativa high to an indica, with two separate peaks.\u000a\u000aOverall, BCD is a good relaxing toke for the end of the day. In my top ten 9/10.

VMy first time smoking something that is named and cataloged. Before this it had only been rural Indian weed or hashish. So I was looking forward to this and expecting good things.\u000a\u000aI eagerly brought this home and loaded my college-tested bong with it. I generally smoke it with tobacco (as most do in India), but I wanted an unadulterated experience of something like this; It smelled brilliant too, with the softness of berries but still carrying a little pungency of diesel. \u000a\u000aAnyway, I proceeded with my ritual. However, instead of forcefully vacuuming the pipe like I was used to with the hashish peppered tobacco, I decided to gently caress this herb to flames. Holding in my first lung full of this pungent smoke burnt me. It was harsher than I expected and I let it out uncomfortably. For my next lung full, I did not try to hold it in and comfortably released it out in a couple of seconds. I let it linger a bit longer over my tongue too, giving me a much better experience of the flavours this strain carried. I felt like I had just learnt the right way to smoke a bong after 2-3 years.\u000a\u000aIt didn&#39;t really hit me until a couple minuted later and when it did, it was beautiful. A wide smile soon engulfed my face while I giggled for no reason. It was really pleasing and I texted my dealer conveying just that.\u000a\u000aI personally found it to be more of a head high. Very euphoric and bright as it hits you. Although, after 30-45 minutes the buzz mellows down to a more relaxed and satisfying sensation. A very ideal curve for an after-the-work smoke. Also having smoked it before leaving for work, I&#39;d say it does make the day at work a bit more interesting, but I would prefer something less euphoric. Something that doesn&#39;t make me smile like a fool at work. At night after I top of my after-work hit with another one it wears off to a sleepy, tiring and overpowering sensation and you drift off into next morning.\u000a\u000aDefinitely fulfilled the expectations I had built up in my mind - which were pretty high to be honest. Looking forward to trying out more such delights!

VEasy to grow autoflower with a good yield, this is a plant I always keep in rotation. The buds are always big and covered with trichs, and the smell is super potent too. If grown, dried, and cured properly, the bud has a strong pine and diesel taste, with a little bit of a lemony undertone. It&#39;s definitely a nice sativa that you feel in the face almost right away. It&#39;s a strong high, but you stay energized and uplifted. I&#39;d recommend it to anyone.

VA pungent strain whose palate is dominated by a sweet aroma of blueberries and violets. Notes of spicy herbs and a grapefruit-like citrus balance the flavor and remind the smoker of this strain&#39;s diesel heritage. Blue Diesel is a potent hybrid that is just barely on the indica side, but its psychedelic and immediate head-high doesn&#39;t cause couch-lock.

The pain relief was amazing for a daytime strain and as an anxious person I was very happy that this strain caused no stress or anxiety.  The effects were: Happy, Motivated, Ultimate Pain Relief.  Decently potent.  This is one of the few strains I would buy an ounce of.\u000a9/10

It is by far the BEST strain Ive come across when in comes to producing kief. My grinder is almost full and it&#39;s been about two weeks since I got this bud. Not to mention I&#39;ve been digging into the kief stash pretty frequently. A great quality to this strain is it&#39;s flavor. It tastes great! Blueberry when it inhales, and diesel when it comes out. It&#39;s almost as if the taste of the inhale wakes you up a bit and the exhale kinda mellows you out. Great choice for daytime!

VThis is a very well balanced hybrid that provides a nice head and body hug without fatigue. It is happy and light, and could be used during the daytime or evening. It provides a very positive outlook and fantastic body feeling, with the perfect blend of relaxation, reduced anxiety, and uplifted energy.

VGreat strain! It&#39;s got a pretty punchy body buzz but it&#39;s also uplifting and not too drowsy considering the potency. It is by far the BEST strain Ive come across when in comes to producing kief. My grinder is almost full and it&#39;s been about two weeks since I got this bud. Not to mention I&#39;ve been digging into the kief stash pretty frequently. A great quality to this strain is it&#39;s flavor. It tastes great! Blueberry when it inhales, and diesel when it comes out. It&#39;s almost as if the taste of the inhale wakes you up a bit and the exhale kinda mellows you out. Great choice for daytime! I recommend this strain 10/10.

Perfect for when you&#39;re stressed. I smoked it after studying for 8 hours straight and I was so tense and tired. After smoking it, I felt so good, relaxed and all my tension just disappeared. You can feel it within just a few minutes, after my first hit I felt amazing already. It&#39;s also SUPER dank, you can smell it through the bag. Highly recommended.

V It has a lightly fruity, peppery taste in my vaporizer and I achieve ideal altitude after about two hits, which is just right. Two hits is the right dose in my mind, because it means you can just take one if you need to be mostly clear-headed, or three if you really want to dig into it. \u000aI feel like it comes on faster than the others, but that could just be me. I definitely feel it after the second hit, and I&#39;ve taken to setting a five minute timer to check in with myself and see if I feel like another. Usually I don&#39;t.

V It has a lightly fruity, peppery taste in my vaporizer and I achieve ideal altitude after about two hits, which is just right. Two hits is the right dose in my mind, because it means you can just take one if you need to be mostly clear-headed, or three if you really want to dig into it. \u000aI feel like it comes on faster than the others, but that could just be me. I definitely feel it after the second hit, and I&#39;ve taken to setting a five minute timer to check in with myself and see if I feel like another. Usually I don&#39;t.

VSo I am smoking as I write this review and I have only hit this hybrid 3 times and I am already feeling a nice buzz and my nausea is dissipating.  I am already a fan of Blue Dream and it is my favorite sativa Kama although when I want just a little more than a sativa but not quite a hardcore indica, this hybrid is perfect of Sour Diesel makes the ratio perfect. And the taste of this strain is so sweet very light and just delites the taste buds... so needless to say I have a new favorite hybrid at this ratio! Lolz!

VTonight I bought a new Clear Path brand vape cartridge, Blue City Diesel. The parents of Blue City Diesel are Blueberry and NYC Diesel, and this one tested at 68.72% THC and 2.44% CBD.\u000a\u000aThe high is a lovely clear headed one like that of Blue Dream, and it is the most sour strain I&#39;ve ever experienced! There is a light berry flavor but the rest of the flavor is pure sour with the smoothe sizzle of the diesel. Initially I&#39;m not taking to the taste of these vapors, but I could also see the taste growing on me too. Time will tell!\u000a\u000aClear Path is the best brand metal tipped cartridge I&#39;ve used to date and the oil is clear, light, and of primo quality.  I can&#39;t go wrong with this one for that reason alone.\u000a\u000aI can&#39;t see myself buying this again; for the same high I&#39;d much rather vape Blue Dream.

VThis type of the strain I got is made with Blueberry kush..  And it&#39;s called Blue City Diesel. And It&#39;s not quite all gas and no brakes.. Though it&#39;ll uplift you and charge you followed by a nice long lasting body-buzz. Along with the taste of berry is the light and fumey  potent Diesel flavor with a little earthy accent due to it&#39;s fine kushy parent.

VA maximum of 4/5. Fat nugs that are thick and covered in orange hairs. Good hybrid that tastes delicious and is mellow on your throat. After a few bowl packs, things will set in nicely. Use its versatility to your advantage.  Great for settling down after a long day at work, or for a quick ripski before running errands or some shit. Either way, you&#39;ll have an eased and blissful head and body high after giving it a little while to set in

VA friend gifted me a prerolled of Blue Diesel from Denver Col. \u000a\u000aThe taste isn&#39;t what I expected, possibly because shake might of been used to make the prerolled - I&#39;ve been told that shake doesn&#39;t have the full flavor as the buds do. \u000a\u000aThe roach seems to have a nice amount of resin and the smoke has a nice aroma. \u000a\u000aIt also seems to have a bit of an after taste. Maybe the diesel taste? IDK for sure since this is the first diesel I&quot;ve tried. \u000a\u000aNice and fast acting. Shared with a few friends, I write this review with a sweet head change and a calm feeling.. I&#39;m not sure of how it would work with my anxiety, since my reason for smoking today is smiply to chill out and revamp for the week ahead. It seems to be great to slow down my racing thoughts. Totally meeting my expectations, I give this strain a two thumbs up!.

VAnother good diesel. Diesel&#39;s and I get along great. This has a nice strong initial punch which settles down to a more calming body high. The flavor was mostly a strong chronic flavor with a hint of sweetness in exhale. This one would be good for some one with stress related issues. THC 19.30

Head high strong &amp; very nice. Body high dang near perfect. Must&#39;ve had a hard week. Usually this strain gives me energy &amp; went straight to sleep after medicating.

VBlue diesel is absolutely perfect for nighttime strain if you&#39;re looking something to keep you happy but mellow you out at the exact same time blue diesel is the strain for you. Anything that has a blueberry father will contain a very dense nugs. I really like blueberry diesel for its sleepy and most relaxing touch blue diesel is hard to come by. it&#39;s Skunky features and taste will leave you guessing where the strain came from it&#39;s a nice cheese and overall a very well-balanced strain I really like this and I hope you guy/gals will too if you happen to come across this do not be hesitant always try new things.it&#39;s great for mood headaches pain PTSD. Anorexia tinnitus stress and anger. OCD As well as manic depression.

Vif i had one word to describe this strain it would be &quot;fruity&quot;.  With a lot of of other strains that i was told were fruity, the taste was there, but not as prevalent as in this one.  As soon as i took my first hit i noticed the strong blueberry flavor, it was comprable to that of a vape.  The high was great as well, relaxing, yet not overpowering like some indica dominant hybrids. overall i rate this a 9.5  out of 10

VBlue City Diesel is quickly becoming my new favorite strain. I tend to forget how amazing this strain is until I pick up a preroll or gram and by the time I come back for more it&#39;s gone! EXCELLENT for anxiety and it&#39;s a great daytime strain but is very relaxing at the same time.

Vif i had one word to describe this strain it would be &quot;fruity&quot;.  With a lot of of other strains that i was told were fruity, the taste was there, but not as prevalent as in this one.  As soon as i took my first hit i noticed the strong blueberry flavor, it was comprable to that of a vape.  The high was great as well, relaxing, yet not overpowering like some indica dominant hybrids. overall i rate this a 9.5  out of 10

Very cheerful and happy up front which fades into a calm relaxation.  Great hybrid pulling the good effects from both sides together so fluidly. 7.5 body high 7 head high 6 for flavor. The blueberry did come through though only in the end. Strain did cause dry mouth like most which tool away from the flavor.

VSmell: Straight up classic smell of Sour Diesel mixed with you guessed it, Blue Cheese.  It has a very pungent odor and extremely unique smell that is vastly different from other pot reeking of fuel and cheese.  It\u2019s like a battle is going on between the two strains for overall smell.  At first it seems like the sour is winning then all you smell is the blue and it goes back and fourth like that.\u000a\u000aTaste: The inhale is easy and smooth while initial exhale is slightly sour it is soon overwhelmed with the taste of a fine blue cheese that leaves your mouth nostrils with an after taste of cheese making your mouth water for more.\u000a\u000aBuzz Type: Heavy body high that makes me tingle allover as it creeps on me and I have a little mind trip that leaves me feeling happy and motivated.  I\u2019d say it\u2019s an uplifting smoke that alleviates the body pains and frees the mind to go about your day.\u000a\u000a\u000a

VAmazing strain. Tastes strongly of both it&#39;s blueberry and diesel parents. Strong body buzz accommodated with a strong head high. Great for a day out on the town, but also helpful when trying to get to bed at night. A Swiss Army knife of strains, this can benefit in ways both a strong sativa and strong indica can do. Would definitely recommend to frequent medicators, but would advise caution to newbies. 4.5/5

VI tried my first batch of Blue Diesel @ArizonaOrganix and loooved it. I&#39;m a big Sour Diesel fan and have never had any bad experiences with Blueberry so this makes a really nice pair. It tastes nice and smokes clean. For being an Indica, it didn&#39;t knock me on my ass as much as expected. The Sour Diesel does a great job counteracting the knock-out tendencies. I definitely think this is a strain worth trying; especially \u000aif you&#39;re getting it where I get it.\u000a

VNugs I acquired of this Blueberry and NYC Diesel cross were dense, frosty, and a vibrant green color. Blue Diesel possesses a strong diesel-y aroma, with slight hints of berry. Smoked great out of a blunt. The high was excellent, striking a perfect balance between head and body high. Felt fairly energetic and functional, but also could&#39;ve easily sunken into the couch. Wonderful stuff. Also experienced a bit of a creative burst. Would smoke again and highly recommended.

Motivating but also relaxing at the same time - I&#39;d be just as happy sitting back and watching the clouds roll by as I would mowing the yard. Very good weed for nearly any situation. A perfect 50/50 hybrid - best of both worlds, right down the middle.

VI love this strain!!! It&#39;s a great bed-time strain, but also just very flavorful.\u000aOne can smell a deep amount of berry, as well as a hint  of diesel. Great for those who want to try diesel, but don&#39;t appreciate the diesel aroma. This  Blueberry X NYC Diesel has phenomenal trichomes, and should be given several sessions. This is an epic strain, very potent.

VA very pleasant slightly indica-dominant hybrid that takes more after it&#39;s Blueberry parent in my opinion but not being too stony for daytime use. It gives a great body stone useful for many medical conditions, as well as  a real euphoric cerebral buzz that can get psychedelic at times. Smells like a big bowl of several different kind of fruits (like blueberry, apple, and grapefruit), which carries on into its fruity, earthy taste. Overall, a very nice hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa I&#39;m guessing) that produces the desirable effects from both indica and sativa: Sidenote - This strain makes me wonder what kind of strain could have been created by crossing the Blueberry with just regular Sour Diesel instead of NYC diesel...

VFifty year old weed virgin again. l find this a pleasant and manageable strain. I tend to overdo it on my first run with a new strain. This was a pleasant smoke that didn&#39;t hit too hard and let me function for the next two hours before bumping me up with an uplifting body high that I probably would have pulled the car over for had it hit while I was driving. I wish I had had more time with this one to see where it took me and to maybe smoke a little more to see where the ceiling is. I rank this one up near White Widow on my list of favs. At times I might choose this some over WW simply because as much as I am growing to love my Widow, she takes me too high too easily for the needs of some days.

Best smell &amp; taste to date, very berrylike. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Doesn&#39;t hit ya like a ton of bricks but does hit ya pretty quick. Pain &amp; nausea gone. Dizzy but ok. I&#39;ve been sick also with sinusitis. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (a must). I ewnt to sleep soon after medicating but not sure if it was due to the strain. Head buzz &amp; body high dang near perfect. Highly recommend this strain; especially for daytime use.

VIt&#39;s actually blueberries, they&#39;re not just saying that.  I wasn&#39;t even high yet when I opened my nice seller&#39;s smell proof bag and yet I sat there just sniffing it for like 2 minutes being like &quot;HOLY CRAP, This BLUEBERRY descendant plant smells like BLUEBERRIES&quot;\u000a\u000aTook about 5 min after first draw for anything approaching the full effect to hit.  The effect I did get as it came in over those few minutes was a little anxious.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t quite call the high energetic, but it seems quite good at squashing my depression brand fatigue.  This one actually seems to make me happy where most sativa makes me anxious.\u000a\u000aLets me sort of smother out stress.  Feel like I could choose from a variety of activities and be content, but also full contentment choosing to just sit and be.  Wonderful feeling of body being in a warm blanket, tingly.  \u000a\u000aRemaining fruity taste in my mouth after stopping vaping as the high still builds a little is a super pleasant side effect.\u000a\u000aDid have an ear ache for a short period about 20 min after fully stopping, which I don&#39;t think has happened to me before, but it passed just a few min after and then it was smooth sailing.\u000a\u000aNot a super indulgent strain.  I didn&#39;t get super hungry, and food was definitely better, but not as amazing as other strains have made it seem.  This was kind of the general trend, I was happy to be and interact with the world, didn&#39;t get me too out of my mind.  Definitely liked the experience overall.

VPicked up 1.5 g of the blue diesel today at my favorite shop and it&#39;s covered in red hair is like pretty much more than leaves it&#39;s crystal fine structure its. Bulky like structure into bed that type of Mountain structuretones of Blue Diesel and of course tree flower followed the notes of this but.as I exhale the vape I noticed that the blueberry lingers for a bit and then slowly fades away this type of demonstration of the strain allows me to guess how hard the bud hits. You can hold it in for a long time but I&#39;m glad  that doesn&#39;t Buck like a horse. Blueberry for the heavy hitter from pay if you&#39;re looking to be knocked out asleep inside comes along with the pain I really recommend this for a very nighttime strain or for a late evening but I do not recommend this for daytime use as it will make you tired and sleepy great Strain. it keeps me uplifted happy but slowly fades it was sleepy as well I love it.

VI smoked this strain after cutting my ankle spearfishing so I smoked like 5 bowls out of an apple. I then had to take a 45 minute uber ride home that was very difficult to keep composed during. When I got home I was still high until I fell asleep several hours later. Suffice to say I enjoyed this strain thoroughly.

VDefinitely dig this cross between Blue Dream and Sour Diesel. Picked this up from the local weed man and it&#39;s been a definite front runner on my list of favorite strains. Super stony, consistent high, super relaxing, uplifting as well as pain relief for daysssss. Good for depression, pain &amp; anxiety. Not the one for AM use unless you go easy because this one tends to creep but all around a decent strain for those who are the heaviest of smokers. Definitely the strain to be smoking on before and after an adventure

VAmazing stuff... Super potent, after just a few hits you&#39;re good. Since it&#39;s so potent it will last a long time and you won&#39;t run out of it very fast. Definitely helps with stress, tension and pain. It makes you feel like you&#39;re in a fluffy uplifted cloud. It&#39;s now one of my top favorite strains. I feel like I have a high tolerance lately and it&#39;s been taking a lot for me to get high but this stuff is so good it knocks me out after 1 or 2 hits. This stuff has made me more high than I have been in a long while... Everyone I know who has tried it agrees me with how potent this stuff is, and they&#39;re pretty big smokers too. It&#39;s super dank and it tastes pretty good too.

VMinn Dan\u000a\u000aI expected to see the NYC Diesel / Blueberry cross on this one. I didn&#39;t know the west coast sour Diesel was being called Blue Diesel, Jordan of the islands has the NYC in his cross that I grew out from seed a few years back. That was my first  success at a top notch  and rounded mix of sativa/Indica smoke. Other than taste I believe the effects are very similar. I enjoyed being able to move without the constant ache that arthritis has caused me. Pain is something that takes very strong meds to alleviate and Blue City Diesel did it for me so any Diesel Blueberry  cross produces top notch pain relief and a joy feeling along with it.

I am already a fan of Blue Dream and it is my favorite sativa Kama although when I want just a little more than a sativa but not quite a hardcore indica, this hybrid is perfect of Sour Diesel makes the ratio perfect. And the taste of this strain is so sweet very light and just delites the taste buds... so needless to say I have a new favorite hybrid at this ratio! Lolz!

A very relaxing, happy, productive strain.  Flow is the word that comes to mind.  \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a niche strain for me, a great wake and bake.  I don\u2019t think I would use this when I wanted to sleep:)  Reading and other cerebral activities would be very satisfying.

I can taste the blueberry in this strain. Hits ya in 5-10 min. I think pain/nausea were gone. Cleaned house after medicating. This strain&#39;s very good for daytime use. Head buzz very nice &amp; body high also dang near perfect. This one&#39;s def on my fav list! :-)

VI&#39;ve been smoking on an ounce of this strain for the past 2 weeks. it&#39;s great for anxiety, body pains, and it is an indica-dominant strain, but this strain never makes you too tired to do something. No fatigue and no major munchies. Good body buzz but it does not last long. The come down is fast in about an hour and a half since last smoked on average. The bud has a sweet, dark berry aroma along with a earthy, diesel smell. Opening the bag made the whole room smell in 15 seconds. Great bud and mostly smoked out of wiz khalifa raw papers

VI do like this strain a lot. It&#39;s strong, relaxing, but unlike some other reviewers, I do find it makes me sleepy and I&#39;m not motivated at all! I&#39;m just sitting here, listening to music and messing about online, and there&#39;s no way I feel like cleaning or cooking, or even going for a walk! So I bought quite a bit of it, as I do not get paranoia, munchies, anxiety or too spacey when using this, and I always try to accumulate strains I know do not cause those (very undesirable, imo) effects! As long as I don&#39;t need to talk to an actual live person, it&#39;s good, but I couldn&#39;t work or be even a little bit productive when smoking this! For me, it has to be a sit and veg, or watch a tv show, or maybe do some creative writing..... I gave it four stars. It&#39;s a current regular strain, along with Pineapple. They complement each other really nicely, and cover all situations and scenarios, between the two of them :)

VI normally love this flower,  however this batch from this dispensary, is not my favorite...\u000a\u000aWhy?  When you eat the same meal over and over you develop a taste for that dish.  You know what it &quot;should&quot; taste like...\u000a\u000aThat&#39;s the same way I see my bud.  I rate taste factor first and high second.  Obviously because we can moderate our high by the amount of intake....  in other words, &quot;if it tastes good -- it is good!&quot;  We tend t smoke more.  Plus, you can always take another hit to improve your high.  Is the percentage of THC that important?\u000a\u000aFact:  Dispensary shop keepers typically rate their weed by THC percentile.  Yes taste plays into this but its mainly the THC that drives the price point.\u000a\u000aAs a consumer, I&#39;m suggesting that the system will reverse at some point.  The market demand for &quot;taste&quot; will eventually outpace the demand for high THC.  This means there are a lot of good choices on the bottom and mid shelf of the dispensary.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m sorry for a lengthy intro... but this is a favorite strain and this is one of those times when you need to hear the back story.\u000a\u000aThis particular flower has an average Blue Diesel flavor with a lot of alfalfa smells and taste.  \u000a\u000aThe flower wasn&#39;t cured long enough making it hard to keep lit...  Tastes like more Plain Blue than Diesel.  The Blueberry wasn&#39;t pronounce - just a hint.\u000a\u000aAlthough this flower looks and smells great -- the flavor fell flat.  In my opinion, the grower failed to bring out enough of the flavor pallet to make this batch a hit.

Vwell to give my honest opinion i think that blue diesel is one of the worst strains ive every had... i mean if it was blue diesel or shwag i would pick shwag. My reasoning behind this is me and my friend bout about 10gs of Blue diesel and my friend had a a panic attack and for me it made me really scared and paranoid. So i though eh probally just not a good trip or somthin but the next day i smoked it again and i had a seizer like episode so just be careful
