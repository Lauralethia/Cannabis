VGot ahold of this last night, told it was brought all the way from California. Tastes rather earthy on the exhale, the high quickly grows on you and its like your mind spins on two ends. Gets you really contemplative in a speedy sort of way, gives you a lot of new insights on anything ranging from a TV show to a philosophical conversation. Best smoked through a pipe for this one, the bubbler we got seemed to kill most of that high. Definitely toke this on evenings just once per day! Munchies are somewhere on the mid-level, not as terrible as Sour Diesel&#39;s, the last strain I smoked.

VI must say this isn&#39;t exactly what I expected and even though a lot of people here feel this is  a true sativa effect,I must disagree.I think the 40% indica mix fails to bring out those true sativa qualities which are being overpowered by the  indica plant.The 5-10 minute trademark sativa &#39;&#39;hit you in the head with a sledgehammer&#39;&#39; was inspiring though.Buzz very strong also gives  shortness of breath; greatly appreciated and overall quite separate from other plants I&#39;ve ever tried. Good for &#39;&#39;couch lock&#39;&#39; or just hanging out with good friends.Not something I&#39;d wait another 3 months to grow.

VDeff smoke this how ever you want. Smell is sweet wood rot with a kind of pungent gas. Also the smells-taste, is like a fresh stack of money. Insane looking trichs! Smoke is pleasant, deff tap it before you get a cotton mouth ass hit.  The feeling is like having a tiny black hole in the middle of your brain. Not a fast acting, tasty, chronic smoking flower. Maybe better as crumble or in treats.

VSpace Bomb was recommended by the good people at The Center for Palliative Care in Seattle, WA as having a well rounded effect. They were not lying. From the first hit, which was very smooth, the sativa hit first and gave me a very euphoric feeling. Then the colors start getting more vivid as my mind spins, thinking all these new creative thoughts. After a couple more hits I can feel the indica start working, helping my mussels relax. The sativa is definitely more prominent, so I wouldn&#39;t use this at night.

VOne of my favorite strains, equal to the electrifying sativa Durban Poison for euphoric and energizing effects, but without any of the anxiety edge that can come along with DP.  For my money, Space Bob is infinitely superior to its legendary parent, Space Queen.  Even though it&#39;s only a 60% Sativa hybrid, the effects of Space Bomb feel primarily like Sativa.

VAcquired medically from Planet Joe at the NW Cannabis Market. Space Bomb has an incredibly complex flavor and aroma, like few others. Sweet, and earthy notes of pine, sage, a sweet floral flavor I can&#39;t quite describe specifically. The many layered flavor is definitely to be savored. The effect comes on gently, but definite. Living up to its name and parentage, your head is lifted to a floaty, ebbing and flowing peaceful happiness. Even heavy worries fade a bit, as the heavy, tingling body feel takes over. Pain melts, and eases away replaced by a wonderful euphoria to match the peaceful mental state. Sense of touch is amplified making that hot shower feel incredible, and be that much more effective at relaxing the mind and body. A great overall effect, happy, creative mind with substantial physical relief and pleasure. Great at improving appetite. Be calm, and happy, feel good throughout your day, as Space Bomb allows one to still be active, if a bit daydreamy. Recommend it for everyone, couples will love it.

VSpaceBomb did its job as a sativa; woke me up, kept me focused... but it was very seedy, unfortunately I spent more time picking out the seeds than enjoying my high. The flavor is very earthy, the flavor to me did not match its scent.\u000a\u000aIt was on sale as a 20$ 8th and now I know why. I wouldn&#39;t waste your time with this strain unless its a decent price.
