VCherry creme pie is mmm mmm good. I just got an 1/4 of this and very glad I did. I got it for its appetite stimulating properties, and it did help. It also made me very relaxed and happy, but not zoned out. Really very nice and I will be back for more. Yum.

VRe-evaluation: a friend heard of my negative experience with this strain, and offered me some he&#39;d been curing for a while.  The flavors are MUCH improved, nearly to the point of decadence.  The high is far more potent, though still far from what I would call thorough or satisfying.  still not viable for my conditions.  while earning two more stars for flavor and potency, it really deserves more like a 3.7-3.8 rating, IMO.

VVery nice strain. It smells good and works well. I found it to be a little &quot;twiggy&quot; but still effective. I alternate this , and Sunshine Daydream to help with my ankle sugery recovery.  Good stuff.

VSo far my favorite strain. Love the taste of cherry and a bit of pine. Works wonders for my chronic pain. Super relaxing with a clear head.

VGreat for headaches!!  I am very headache prone, including migraines, and this strain does the trick.  The other effects  definitely lean more on the indica side; relaxing, munchies, etc. but I don&#39;t care as long as that headache is gone.  ;)

VThanks so much to Sunrise Wellness for the recommendation, I love this strain! Smokes and tastes beautiful and has a hint of mandarin and spice if you ask me. Lots of terpenes, caked and perfectly cured and flushed. Very calming in mind and body, I was focused and uplifted. I\u2019ve added this to my faves and hope to find it again &#128077;&#127995;

V5/10 head high\u000a7.5 body buzz\u000a\u000aIf you want to get stuff done and want a decent buzz this strain is great. Nice flavours vannila and cherry,  not harsh at all coming out of bong.\u000aIf your looking for sleep relief this isnt great but for anxiety and bipolar it does the job. No paranoia at all.

VI must have recieved a particularly poor cut.  While having decent bag appeal, this strain tasted more like Cherry Garlic Skunk Anus.  Although testing around 19%, the high was weak and uninspiring, nor did it show promise for my particular medical needs.  Rarely do I regret purchasing a new strain, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I was eager to give this one another chance.\u000aMethod: vaporized with a Firefly2

VDisgusting.  Smells like Cherry cough drops.  Absolutely nothing like weed. \u000a\u000aI bought this from Health for Life in Mesa, Az.   I know for certain this is NOT the plant a natural scent of flavor. \u000a\u000aSorry for the negative review but I have to draw attention to this issue every way I can: They are artificially flavoring bud that has no smell of its own! All over the state!  Almost all the meds have a fake smell!  All sterile hydro, with random additives uses to fool people.  It&#39;s not even strains, just random hydro with adulterants!  I will always hate this strain because I bought a FAKE.  Not an imitation, Az MMJ is FAKE.  If the name says cherry,  it gets cherry cough syrup!  If the name says Citrus, it gets citrus perfumed! I do not understand why I am the only person in this state who sees this.  It is so obvious. People here are under a spell! Smoking hydro weed that had essential oils and syrup in the res!
