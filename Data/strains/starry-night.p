VSativas typically heighten my anxiety and panic, but starry night was different. I did get jumpy a bit one time but several other days it&#39;s the perfect meds for my depression and retreating behavior. Gets me out of a funk or motivates me to stay focused.

VI&#39;d give this 1000 ml tank a 6 rating if I could. PTS in IL makes this tank, and it is the first time since trying it in the summer of 2016 that it has been re-stocked. The flavor is pine, lemon, and dry fruit. The effect is very potent and sets in with only a few puffs. Stress reduction, easing of invasive thoughts, and pleasant relaxation all set in right away. It is non-drowsy, but it does cause mild appetite increase. This is a great strain for day time use. At a $70 price point when all other competitors are selling 500 ml for $50 - $90 this tank is an absolute best value product. I would 100% always select tanks from this PTS product line because of the quality, potency, and value. I look forward to trying the other strains/flavors that are available.

VThis is amazing! I have it in shatter &amp; it\u2019s perfect for gym day or spring cleaning. The pine brings you back to childhood memories of playing at the park &amp; the lemon is refreshing! I\u2019m in love!
