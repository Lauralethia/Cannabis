VMagnificent smell and taste, great for muscle spasms. I have back problems and this strain fits the bill! Love it! \u000a\u000aThe taste is really something to be savoured. Roll a nice blunt of this stuff and relax!

VHigh CBD strain, leans towards a sativa. Great for pain relief. Day time use preferred! Very light head high, no body high for me. Great for people who are looking for CBD benefit and or who don\u2019t tolerate the effects of THC dominant strains.
