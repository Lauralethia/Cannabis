VExtremely Underrated.\u000a\u000aAmazing taste and it&#39;s SUPER STRONG. I&#39;d say it is one of the strongest weeds I&#39;ve had the pleasure of smoking. Buds are completely loaded with crystal and beyond sticky. There are blackish hints throughout the bud, very exotic looking. The scent is crazy but I find it hard to describe. Hints of lemon/citrus, kinda sweet but very earthy/pungent. It&#39;s super complex. The taste is just as unique; very lemony and piney with that distinct kushy indica taste. Smoke is super smooth &amp; it makes you want to keep smoking. This strain is a slow creeper and heavy hitter.

VA sweet, almost floral scent was released during grinding. Dense, delicious buds. Really helps with &#39;living in the moment&#39; because it reduces any deep thinking, worrying or stress. It hasn&#39;t taken away my body pain but kind of masks it, making it bearable. One possible negative is that I have a slight headache after smoking, which is rare for me. Tasty!

VAn incredibly powerful indica.  I was recommended this strain by a budtender at my local dispensary for some insomnia and restlessness I had been experiencing.  He was right -- not only did it relieve my anxiety and insomnia but I felt so relaxed that I felt as if I was becoming weightless. \u000a\u000aI believe that the genetics of this strain have been perfected; both the effects and taste are superb.  I will definitely buy this strain again. \u000a\u000aCons:  not recommended for anything else other than nighttime use.  You will be useless afterwords.

VEl Jefe isa powerful indica that has an earthy and piney flavour.   This strain is a cross between Abusive OG and Rare Darkness #1.  It gave me a relaxing and euphoric high, that brought on sleepiness an hour later.  This strain is great for pain releif as it helped with my muscle spasms and body pain, lowered my anxiety, slowed down my mind and helped me combat my insomnia.  I love this strain!!!

VVery pungent, earthy odor, though not unpleasant. Extremely smooth inhale. Tasty exhale. The high was a slight creeper for me, but arrived with a swelling, powerful body and mind warmth. I think I have a relatively high tolerance for flower, and when I smoked two bowls of El Jefe I already had some THC in my system, so one would think the effects would be quite mild. Quite the contrary with this beauty.
