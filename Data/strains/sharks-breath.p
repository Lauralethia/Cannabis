VThis strain shows the clear influence of its very opposite parents. There is a very nice relaxing body to this buzz but there&#39;s an even greater floaty and happy head high. I find it quite easy to be socially engaged and I&#39;m also quite clear headed. I very much recommend Sharksbreath for almost any activity or time or day. A perfect balance and a great time.

I do like that it doesn&#39;t linger after smoking a bowl however and the high is fantastic!!! I felt happy and super relaxed. It&#39;s becoming my new favorite for ending a long day.

Vone of the better strains I&#39;ve tried. The high is slow to settle in but envelops you into a nice crisp body high. one thing I really enjoy with this hybrid is my ability to think quite well as well as being plenty social. on higher doses the indica tints provide a pleasent head high and sleepiness. does not smell strong but carries a sweet, fruity, peach like odor. a smooth even smoke, though very sticky and dense. i enjoy this strain a lot as i find so many good uses for it.

VIt&#39;s been almost 20 years since I&#39;ve been in the scene and boy have things changed. After much research I decided on this strain to help with my stress and pains. I&#39;ve got psoriatic arthritis and constantly have pains in my knees, hands and shoulders. The buzz was a slight body buzz and the grin muscles were put to work. I noticed my pains less, but they were still there. The entire day I&#39;ve remedicated while here at work (from home) and I&#39;ve been able to get quite a bit done. I&#39;m really surprised how focused I can be with my headphones on listening to music while enjoying being stoned.

VI got some top shelf of this and it was wonderful! Way more focused than I would have thought from an Indica mix. It was very cerebral and I felt like I could get a lot done, especially after 1 hit. I took a second at night and fell asleep. I have ADD and this was the first strain that actually made me focused. Also it is very relaxing and you hit cruising altitude right away. Its a very comfortable, mellow high that made us talkative and actually sharpened our minds. This may even be a daytime strain for me which I would not have expected from a supposedly Indica.

VMy experience with Sharksbreath was different than most of the reviews here. I was using a new vape pen and admittedly took too much of a first hit by accident. Yowzers! I never did THAT again!  Nausea, dizziness, nasty bile taste in my throat.  Ugh. I\u2019ve been working on finding the right \u201cdosage\u201d to get the nice warm, tingly body high I liked without the knock-your-effing-socks-off zing about 5 minutes after the first draw. It hits me hard and then once it mellows out it\u2019s great, but if you don\u2019t do ENOUGH then you don\u2019t get anything except a bile taste in your mouth. And maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m using a vape pen, but to me it\u2019s got quite a harsh taste, even in small amounts. Ok, I admit I\u2019m a wuss, but just thought I\u2019d warn some of the other wusses out there to start slow. Once you get a range on it, it\u2019s relaxing and warm.

VI approached sharksbreath confidently, having taken many chillful toques of kush on many occasions. Upon exhalation of my first quite ambitious toke, I felt a calming wave of euphoric pleasure spread all the way down to my toes and back up to my face, where ripples of pleasure caused my lip to spastically gyrate as a result of the climactic sensory overload. After emerging from my disoriented state, I took a seat on my couch and began a translucent, out of body experience and felt as if I was omniscient. The sesh was going quite chillfully thus far to say the least..So I swiftly packed myself another bowl wich induced a psychoactive overload that caused my blood pressure to drop and forced me to the ground where I eventually started seizing and foaming from the mouth. When I recovered from the seizure, I began to uncontrollably shit blood. You could say that sharksbreath bit my dick off. After that traumatic experience, I started throwing up blood in my slumber. I awoke to red and brown sheets. It was a shitty experience but overall pretty good weed.
