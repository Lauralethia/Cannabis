VLooks and smells amazing. Super sticky, crystallized nuggets of joy. The two of us, who are well versed in blazing down, were hitting a decent sized doobie, and we decided to put it out halfway. It was that good. Immediate head effects, and body feels pain-free. Taste is almost difficult to describe upon smoking the second half, as it seemed to change throughout. Maybe I&#39;m just high as fuck. We picked ours up from &#39;MCMH High Society&#39; here in Detroit, and are very pleased with our 2 grams for $25 purchase.

VGreat strain! Mine wasn&#39;t purple but it was very good weed. Rock hard buds and a little bit goes a long way. This batch I have is far more head than body. Not energetic or racy, just heady. Mine was also called Purple Alien, not Purple Alien OG but I assume they are the same.

Vvery good herb. overall I expected more of an instant high because of the alien genetics of the strain but I was suprised to find that it has a very mellow initial feeling when taking hits from a bong. I was by no means dissapointed by the flavor of the smoke and the nugs themselves had a very appealing scent. I ended up getting slightly more indica effects and the high culminated with a case of the munchies that I haven&#39;t seen the likes of since I first smoked blue dream.

VGreat stand, perfect for relaxing. It also works really well as a pain deterrent. I have large amount of back pain and it helps a lot to keep my mind off the pain. Vaping the flower has a smooth and enjoyable after taste. Highly enjoyable, I will be getting more of this soon.

VAfter trying a concentrate of this from Roil Extracts, I can say that this is an overall wonderful strain. Great earthy, citrus, sweet tastes. My mind and body feels simultaneously light and heavy, and it&#39;s a high functioning strain. If i had to use this on a daily basis, it would be for pain relief or insomnia.

VOk I just Harvested!! I Think to date this was my best!! Very easy to grow! very sticky and sweet smelling. The smoke itself is very strong.Kind of harsh but doesn&#39;t expand to much in the lungs. Very euphoric high. Long lasting. I recommend to first time growers. Good Medicine Great for sleeping!!

VThis strain hit me in a much different way than anything I&#39;ve experienced in the past.  Normally, strains that offer pain relief or other physical based effects (Indica dominant) still leave me with a general &#39;high&#39; feeling.  However, Purple Alien OG seemed to almost perfectly emulate my own natural impulses without any (or very little) in the way of headiness.\u000a\u000aIt was almost as if PAO camouflaged its presence.  This was both good and bad: getting relief without compromising your mental focus is good but the effects it enacted were much more caustic.\u000a\u000aUsually with anti-insomnia strains there is a pleasurable (&quot;high&quot;) feeling associated with relaxing or falling asleep.  PAO made me feel like my body itself was desperate for sleep.  Almost like it didn&#39;t make me tired- it made me think _I_ was tired.  Same with couchlock; it didn&#39;t feel like anything to sit and do nothing but when I tried to get up it felt like my _muscles_ were unresponsive.  \u000a\u000aIt was kind of awesome but also kind of scary (in a way).  It seems like a great strain for certain types of activities and I liked that I didn&#39;t experience a great deal of cotton mouth or &#39;munchies&#39;.  On the other hand, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for those who are inexperienced as the effects can be surprising and take you off guard.  The first time I smoked it I went from energetic and happy to _oh my god I have to find a place to lay down or I&#39;m going to pass out_.

VHad this strain freshly cut and given from a friend. The smell is very fresh, a nice grape-like scent to it. As the name implies, there is some purple on the bud.\u000a\u000aAfter a smoke, it tastes pretty good. The effects mainly help in getting easily aroused and good for sex. Otherwise if you just want to unwind, its good for meditative trips if you have a lot. Or just relax and watch the television and have a great laugh.\u000a\u000aI recommend this weed mainly for home activities, it&#39;s more for relaxing and chilling.

VPhenomenal indica, great for afternoons or evenings and pain/tension. Both looks and tastes amazing: smells/tastes like a mix of berry and og, with a surprising (delicious) citrus aftertaste. Great for relaxing muscles, sleep, and I find it very helpful for migraines and nausea. \u000aOther than MAYBE GDP, this has become my favorite purple.
