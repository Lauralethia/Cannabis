VI smoke more then most and this strain might be good for someone looking for a mellow, fun, peppy sativa. Awesome looking chronic smell.

VIt was good for just hanging out and talking. My friend has a very low tolerance and threw up about an hour in after two hits in a row. Seeing that usually would have me in a dark space, mentally, but it didn\u2019t go there with this strain.\u000aNow, this might be a coincidence (I only smoked it once because of this) but my throat the day after was absolutely destroyed. I\u2019m talking as bad or worse than the last dregs of a cold, which for me is pretty terrible. Water and cough drops did not help. I was almost convinced that I was actually for real sick. It cleared up after two days but MAN that was not fun.\u000aThat\u2019s the only reason for 3 stars. It would\u2019ve easily been a 4 star smoke, docked one because it really is very mild, but that throat dryness really fucked me up. Also it made my friend barf, so.
