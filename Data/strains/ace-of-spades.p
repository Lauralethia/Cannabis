VThis is simply a terrific hybrid. I tend to favor Sativas and Sativa dominant hybrids as I need a med that allows me to work. \u000a\u000aA strong Sativa high kicks in immediately with the first bong rip. It&#39;s focused, energetic, at the same time it&#39;s relaxing. The Indica component provides a good body stone to go along with the head high. Only downside: the relaxing component can turn into sleepiness, that depends on how much I consume.\u000a\u000aWith one or two bong rips, I&#39;m great, able to focus and stay on task for what I need to accomplish. When I&#39;m ready to fully relax at the end of the day I can still smoke this and go to sleep no problem.\u000a\u000aOverall a great weed that&#39;s hard hitting while the effects can be varied with level of consumption.

VFirst time trying and I enjoyed the earthy pungent but not to harsh and with just a hint of berry taste.  Smell was nice but not overpowering.  Packed a raw cone and would have stopped at half but enjoyed smoking.  Effects came on slowly for me but were very noticeable and provided excellent pain, nausea anxiety and depression relief.  I didn&#39;t get hungry, but stomach was calmed.  I would purchase again.

VIf this is the Ace of Spades from the growers: The Happy Crowd.\u000a\u000aLots of stems and water leaves (The little leaves that fall off right before it&#39;s time to harvest) Which means this plant was harvested too early, not cured properly either. It was very earthy, which can be a good thing sometimes, but it was not so in this case. \u000a\u000aI have Rheumatoid Arthritis, The pain in my body changes drastically in location and all the time. By this i mean that one week my back hurts, the next week my shoulders may hurt, or my knees, etc.. But the point i&#39;m getting to is this:\u000a\u000aI purchased 2 grams of your product to relieve my pain (This is a purple strain if i am not mistaken, which typically does wonders for my body pains. Sadly it was 2 grams i never should&#39;ve bought. And here&#39;s why:\u000a\u000aIve never smoked a bowl and still been in excruciating pain afterwards.. But with this product, I smoked an entire 2 grams and only felt something along the lines of the buzz i used to get when i first started smoking cigarettes. So sadly, i have to deal with a week of devastating body pains because my &quot;medication isn&#39;t potent enough, or at all&quot;\u000a\u000aSadly i cannot say i would recommend this to anyone, even my greatest enemy. It&#39;s going to be iffy for me to purchase a The Happy Crowd product again in the future.. But in the case i do purchase a product from you again, my only advice is this:\u000a\u000a1: Terpenes=Taste\u000a2: Water Leaves typically begin to fall off the plant just before the perfect time to harvest.\u000a3: please do not sell people stems :(

VThe taste of this one didn&#39;t blow me away like it did other reviewers, but it wasn&#39;t bad by any means--just not the main event. After a bowl of this in the vaporizer, I was feeling really good and my back pain was significantly reduced. Note how many reviewers agree that this strain causes euphoria; there&#39;s a reason! I was dancing on sunshine for at least an hour or two. I was then able to sit down and get some computer work done before the effects expired. The focus level on this one is fairly good. Would recommend this strain.

VA particularly striking phenotype of an indica-dominant hybrid varietal. Her lineage of Black Cherry Soda and Jack the Ripper create a fusion of terpene profiles that express tart cherry and dark chocolate undertones punctuated with citronella zests. An active cerebral clarity combines with a moderate body stone to a produce a reliably functional and calming high. Flowers present as stunning multicolored bouquets of intertwined emerald and amethyst calyxes offering moderate-high cannabinoid production.  This varietal is available from TreeHawk Farms in Chimacum, WA.

Vthe Ace of Spades has the essence of chocolate covered strawberries. So delicious!! It burns so smooth and clean, nothing left but white ash, so you know it&#39;s clean. Organically grown and it shows in the flavor. Dense and covered in sticky crystals. The sticky resin in this bud really burns great. Large hits are easy, very smooth. The feeling is a body stone mixed with a bit of a cerebral high. I was feeling terrible before I smoked it. I was feeling horrible nausea that was causing dry heaves. I took 3 large hits and now I feel good enough to sit up and type this review!! Nausea is nearly gone and I feel relaxed and happy. Thank you Oregon Medigreen, you always make me feel great!!

VThe thing that stood out to me about this bud was the look. It was beautiful! Light green STRAIGHT CAKED in trichs and covered in these short dark orange hairs. The smell was appealing kind of lemony and earthy. The earthiness comes through in the exhale and stays as an aftertaste. The high is very strong. It starts as an almost racy Sativa high than mellows out to a nice body stone later. Medicinally I would say its good for Stress, Pain, Nausea, and Appetite Stimuant. 3.5/5

VAce of Spades is a delicious strain and one of the prettiest I have ever seen! Colors of deep blue and purples, bright green and red hairs make this bud unique and exotic, out of this world. Great taste, with hints of berry and fruit with a little citrus mixed in. Great high, balanced and smooth. Super relaxing but not cloudy or a knockout. I HIGHLY recommend. Anything crossed with Jack the Ripper has been fantastic! Try Agent Orange or Pennywise, both TGA strains and both are fantastic, super flavorful, unique flowers for all the connoisseurs out there!

VWhat a strange indica! It hits me like a Big Splashy Sunshine Sativa that made me hyper and a bit dizzy. The body stone is not that noticeable, but it definitely has a very clear, cerebral high to it.  \u000a\u000aI think I would go easy with this guy. The smell is lusciously fruity, with fruity smoke and after taste. Makes you want to smoke more. Good for pain, but maybe not so much for sleep or even to do things that require sharp thinking. Probably very good for doing outdoor activities :)

The trichomes on the leaves are very heavily present throughout.

This combined with the fact that I hadn&#39;t smoked in 2 weeks, I was on the couch at midnight. Slept like a log and woke up at 2pm the next day. In all a great stress reliever. As for looks, the nugs have very light dusting of purple. The tricombs looked as orange as the bud itself. Large amounts of kief and the stickiness was almost comparable to a concentrate.

VSuper dense buds that fluff up beautifully when you grind it. The smell is just glorious, sweet and earthy. The vapor is smooth and easy to hold. The effects come on pretty quickly which is nice for quick pain relief. It feels like a true indica with a nice body stone that I can feel from head to toe. If I smoke a lot, it&#39;ll make me want to lay down and watch tv or go to sleep. If I smoke a little, then I feel good and can function fine without feeling too blitzed. I smoke this all the time because it really relieves my pain. I have a high tolerance and this stuff works for me. Oregon Medigreen is truly the best!!

VStrain: Ace of Spades (Black Cherry Soda / Jack the Ripper cross -- Indica)\u000aTHC: 19.71%\u000aCBD: 0.03%\u000aGrower: Unknown\u000aLocation found: Portland Canna Connection\u000aDate purchased: 3.7.16 \u000aPrice: $6/g\u000aWeight: 1.1g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: I have been on a Jack Herer rampage of finally understanding why the crosses are so grand. I wish I was the first to smell Black Cherry Soda and put the two together...then proved myself right. It does have a carbonated, cherry soda smell. It is eerie and I like it. Jack Soda? Soda of the Ripper? I dunno, J1 is messing with my brain.\u000aLook: This was some greenhouse type herb. It might not have been the most potent version of this strain but it was a fair representation. Tight, darker green colored nuggets.\u000aTaste: To me anything with Jack crossed within its genes seems to overpower just about everything. The Black Cherry Soda held its own on this one. Pleasant and fairly smooth. \u000aRecommendation for medicine: It made me focused and energetic but it was middle of the day for this one.

I was a little reluctant due to the cost  but after trying it there is no doubt that it is worth it. My experience was an overall feeling of happiness. I felt upbeat motivated and also had moderate pain relief. I highly recommend this concentrate. It is that good.

I go for some ace of spades, body and mind are treated for any problem. My mind embraces joy and peace. My nerves are settled and my muscles are messaged. No stress and no pain. Strong euphoria that settles to a happy contentment. Smoke is smooth and tasty like cherry cola candy. Lung expansion creeps up after exhale like a ghost dab hit from the air in the room. Goosebumps and a hot flash can happen from a good toke. Cough is very late and long. Dry eyes is the only negative that I notice.\u000aOrgrow does a great job (just got it from commencement bay at 29% thc), green haven\u2019s AoS is ok. Treehawk farms had an eye candy AoS that was bone dry. A good AoS will smell like cherry cola. Effervescent with lemon cherry hops, with a hint of pine. Bright colors all over, lots of purple nugs with bright green leaves and long bright orange hairs. Good amount of trich. The smell and the look of AoS is amazing.\u000a\u000aI recommend this strain for all day and anything as it provides a strong stoned high without mind fog, anxiety, or couch lock.\u000aOne of my favorite strains.

VThis is the very first strain of pot I ever smoked when I was 14. Whenever I taste that sweet earthy berry smoke enter my lungs, its as if time has stood still, and I am back in high school again ditching class to smoke with my buddies. Definitely a versatile strain in the sense it is a powerful indica but when smoked during the day the mental clarity shines through more as a sativa than when smoked at night, might be a psychological thing? but this is definitely one of those strains I will never turn down just as much as I wouldn&#39;t turn down Jack Herer or Blue Cheese.

VThis bud was pretty darn potent smoked out of the bong. I smoked a couple bong hits of some sativa hybrid first (like 4 lungfuls of smoke) then I busted out my freshly purchased Ace of spades buds and loaded the bong once... the Indica Ace of spades overpowered the other weed so making me feel stoned pretty heavily for 30minutes after toking up. I got a dreamy dazed type of feeling in my head and wanted to sit down to relax. My body felt like I was taking some muscle relaxers and I was calm yet not really sleepy or tired. My mood was very uplifted and I may have gotten the giggles if I wasn&#39;t a regular pot smoker with a little tolerance to the effect of marijuana. I only needed small amount to get high on this strain and feel the medicinal effects of the cannabinoids. I would suggest that you should try this strain out if you love Indica and if you want to relieve stress, lower anxiety and chill out. You can still function well with small doses of this strain so smoking during the day is fine if you want to still get work done. I like it a lot.

VI had a hard time placing the smell of the one, funky. Real frosty nugs that are compact as you\u2019d expect from an indica but really bright green. Ten minutes in and the effects are calming of the mind but not fuzzy or cloudy. Also a nice body high without the heavy limbs of other indicas. I I made cookies cleaned up and then ate way too much. Will be an after work go to for sure.

VI grew this one outdoors last summer in 2012.  I&#39;m usually a big fan of the &#39;purples&#39; and not only love the buzz, but the overall deep purple color(s) of the leaves.  One of the things I loved about this strain was that the leaves stayed green...but the nugs themselves turned purple with spots of what can only be described as &#39;red wine&#39; in color.  One of the most eye catching, beautiful plants.

VI gotta tell ya, for what I smoke got, this is my new favorite. PTSD, anxiety, and some neverending back pain from a accident last year all taken down to a very livable ground. One bowl and done. My mind slows down, all that stress melts away and I can just chill. My back still hurts but I don&#39;t need a percocet and that&#39;s fucking perfect for me. I get that nice thunder blanket hug. Not heavy like weighed down but that deep hard relax. Like a complete decompress and let everything melt away. Serious chill some. Munchies gonna make me a fat kid but for all my woes taken out in spades by a single strain? Worth it.

Absolute body high - full vibrations through the body paired with heavy limbs and almost immediate hunger increase. It\u2019s a smooth high that really just washes over you calmly. Very very enjoyable high, but definitely for the end of the day. Grab your self some food, and get ready to veg. \u000a\u000aThe only down side was the flavor, definitely a harsh smoke in my opinion.

Highly recommend this one. I love Black Cherry Soda but haven\u2019t had Jack the Ripper (although have definitely wanted to try it) so I was excited about this and it did not disappoint.

VThis strain I tried in vape cartridge by Curio Wellness. The oil within the cartridge was very dark and viscous. Smell and taste I would best describe as earthy/ dirt like. I am not too particularly found of it. It seems to be very short acting, I found myself having to vape again every 15-30mins to continue pain management. I did night have couch lock or increased hunger while I used this strain. I tend to like to use this strain in the mornings and on the go.

VI had a hard time placing the smell of the one, funky. Real frosty nugs that are compact as you\u2019d expect from an indica but really bright green. Ten minutes in and the effects are calming of the mind but not fuzzy or cloudy. Also a nice body high without the heavy limbs of other indicas. I I made cookies cleaned up and then ate way too much. Will be an after work go to for sure.

VThis bud was pretty darn potent smoked out of the bong. I smoked a couple bong hits of some sativa hybrid first (like 4 lungfuls of smoke) then I busted out my freshly purchased Ace of spades buds and loaded the bong once... the Indica Ace of spades overpowered the other weed so making me feel stoned pretty heavily for 30minutes after toking up. I got a dreamy dazed type of feeling in my head and wanted to sit down to relax. My body felt like I was taking some muscle relaxers and I was calm yet not really sleepy or tired. My mood was very uplifted and I may have gotten the giggles if I wasn&#39;t a regular pot smoker with a little tolerance to the effect of marijuana. I only needed small amount to get high on this strain and feel the medicinal effects of the cannabinoids. I would suggest that you should try this strain out if you love Indica and if you want to relieve stress, lower anxiety and chill out. You can still function well with small doses of this strain so smoking during the day is fine if you want to still get work done. I like it a lot.

VThis is the very first strain of pot I ever smoked when I was 14. Whenever I taste that sweet earthy berry smoke enter my lungs, its as if time has stood still, and I am back in high school again ditching class to smoke with my buddies. Definitely a versatile strain in the sense it is a powerful indica but when smoked during the day the mental clarity shines through more as a sativa than when smoked at night, might be a psychological thing? but this is definitely one of those strains I will never turn down just as much as I wouldn&#39;t turn down Jack Herer or Blue Cheese.

VI picked up a couple grams of Ace Of Spades and a new (four piece) grinder the other day. Last night, I got an amazing, full night of sleep. The sweet dirt/earth taste of this strain is mouth-watering and reminiscent of it&#39;s Black Cherry Soda parentage. The coloring of the nugs lies between greenish-purple (...gurple??) which makes the numerous orange hairs stand out beautifully. A pleasant, relaxing high, I fell asleep in the middle of reading.\u000a\u000aPerfectly suited for end-of-the-day aches+pains and helping you get that 8 hour chunk of shuteye.

VNice, sweet strain. I vape all my weed but I could still taste the sweetness of the bud. Kicks in a little slow but once it does, it kicks in hard. Helped my anxiety and depression and relaxed both body and mind. Great for chilling but I did notice it kept me up. Maybe not the best strain for before bed but overall it&#39;s great!

VI was extremely impressed with this strain; the dense and sticky nugs had a very unique odor that gave me a hint of the dankness to come. This weed left me with an absolutely insane body high that left me pretty much useless for awhile. Extremely relaxing effects- definetly good for listening to music or watching a movie. Recommend if you enjoy heavy indicas.

VAce of spades is listed as a indica dominate hybrid with a THC of 15.7 %\u000a\u000aThe high is an active mellow that is very functional for me as it is a lower THC. I like to have this when I have small projects to get done where I need to pay attention, but it&#39;s ok to be a little high. It&#39;s also good for movie watching as you&#39;re relaxed and alert but not so high you can&#39;t pay attention or your suspension of disbelief gets wonky.\u000a\u000aTasted earthy and a little citrusy.
