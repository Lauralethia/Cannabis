VBeautiful flower.  You can get up and do what you need to do and at the same time, if you sit back for too long, you&#39;ll be stuck on couch lock. Great for insomnia.

VGreat strain.  The indica effects come on first for a relaxing high with minimal anxiety. Then after about 30 min it shifts to a more sativa dominant high.  A very enjoyable flower that is both sweet and citrus limonine smell with a dank old mans jacket undertone of myrcene that meshes well. Due to a great terrapin profile it is very enjoyable to smoke.  it has a decent tolerance to nutrients but I recommend TLO for this strain. With great looking buds packed full of tricromes that are dense and sticky it&#39;s well worth a try.\u000a

VIt can definitely creep on you but only over about 15 mins I&#39;d say.  Best qualities of this strain are insomnia relief (Number 1!), and relaxation that can be a bit mind-numbing at times. I find myself zoning out inadvertently.  Not necessarily a bad thing. I only smoke this after 8 p.m. or so myself, although the strain I got tested at 10% THC so overall it&#39;s a moderate high in intensity and strength.  Has a unique smell and taste to it. Sweet and piney  with a hint of some sort of berry musk. Great go-to Indicated IMO.

VFirst thing we said when we finally got hit was...\u000a&quot;This is so nice&quot;.\u000a\u000aThis strain is such a beautiful and calming type. My body felt great, almost totally erased unlike other indica that fee almost heavy in their body effect.\u000a\u000aSlept like a damn rock.\u000a\u000aToday I&#39;m smoking early and feel pretty motivated as well as it hasn&#39;t affected my brain too much.
