VDefinitely has that og feel. Super mellow and pretty heavy high but a nice one. Music I feels so good. Y&#39;all ever listen to angus and Julia stone while stoned?? My god. Perfect for anything outdoors. Had this at my local market in the a.m. while drinking an horchata and made me feel so happy I was greeting everyone around em and joining coversations. a must try!!

This berry bodacious-babe also provides intense-but-man-ageable euphoria.. sure to please us-ol\u2019 timers &amp; newbies, alike \u2014&gt; this is a rising-5\u2b50\ufe0f-phenom! &#128076;&#127995;

VAfter some time away from the devils lettuce, I was able to try this strain and really enjoyed the experience. I felt like the high stayed mostly around the head area and left the body slightly buzzing... excellent strain for an afternoon walk or hangout!

VPROS: \u000aVery good at relieving pain and stress. No apparent change to blood pressure. If used cautiously, it can be safe for certain types of work, including driving. \u000a\u000aCONS:\u000aIt can give a bit of the munchies, but not uncontrollable. It does have a burn-out phase that can be perfect for napping or bedding down for the night.

VHad 3 fem&#39;s in an indoor and the yield was approximately 4.5 Oz. undried. Just smoked a blunt of strawberry OG,but i do not recommended it because it changes the flavour of a strain that its known for its fruity aroma and taste. When you light a joint of this strain you will be transported into a fruit salad full of berries and relaxation. The effects are uplifting and the aroma is like an authentic fruit garden!\u000a\u000aEffects 5/5\u000aAroma 5/5\u000aOverall quality of strain 5/5\u000a\u000aCheers!

VMore sativa to me which already I&#39;m not a huge fan of. This strain smelled great and for a day time smoke I would get it again. Probably great for a day at the beach. Not bad at all.

VCepa de Cali Connection, ese sabor a tierra mojada de las OG pero exagerado! con un toque frutal intenso que acompa&#241;a el sabor base de la OG Kush. Hibrido para usar es cualquier hora del dia.
