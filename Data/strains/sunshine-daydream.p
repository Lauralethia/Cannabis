VStill feeling this one out but i thought it deserves a review :). When i vaporized this i felt &quot;edgier&quot; than expected for a indica dominant which threw me a bit which may have contributed to the racy anxiety i felt. Nothing panicy but not content or relaxed either. \u000a\u000aNow that ive had a taste i  know to experiment with this one during the daytime. BTW when i bought mine it was listed as a hybrid.

VUnlike anything I&#39;ve experienced before. I usually stick with Indicas as i deal with anxiety. This came highly recommended and I got in in a rosin. I did one TINY dab and it came on FAST and heavy. Very overwhelming as time and space became altered so I felt anxious but the actual panic never came. After walking around for about an hour and then eating a bit I started to level off and the indica side kicked in. THEN it was thoroughly enjoyable sitting and listening to music. Never had a strain like this that bordered on a mild trip.  Ride lasted 3 hours and I slept great. Clearly my tolerance is too low and a noob mistake was made dabbing. In the future I&#39;ll go for flower in my vape to have better dosage control so I can hopefully skip the first part and go right to the very enjoyable second part.

I look for anything that will help calm the inflammation I have from Crohn\u2019s Disease and this strain brought such relief; I honestly almost cried because I\u2019ve tried just about everything and this truly took the pain away, it\u2019s relief I\u2019ve never experienced before..\u000a\u000aThe head high is also really good - helped me deal with some depression and anxiety.
