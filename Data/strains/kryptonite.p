V50/50 sweet/fruity &amp; earthy flavor and scent. It&#39;s slightly dank in that it forces it&#39;s way up your nose on it&#39;s terms. Tastes as it smells, good. Looks dark green &amp; dark purple/black with some orange hairs and a lot of trichromes. Not so dense as an indica but spacey and dense like an og kush or sour diesel. Long heavy high. Head is heavy and muscles are relaxed like a bobble head. My back pain is gone. No pills, Dr... I&#39;m gonna sleep soon which is approx 75-80 min in. Inhaled 2 &amp; 1/2 bags so far. Will maybe do 1-2 more b4 bed in about 1 hour. No headache but not totally clear headed in the sense that I&#39;m ill-equipped to do critical thinking, I want to play a video game. Great bed-time indica alternate to purps. Will stay in one of my stash jars. From Herban Nation Delivery Service Sacramento, CA. Will also review the &quot;strawberry sour diesel ear wax rocks&quot;: added .3 grams with some Kryptonite (.5 grams fresh) in the volcano 410* Fh- 11:30pm- 1st big bag&gt; 10 min later next bag w/ .3 more bud &amp; .3 more ear wax rocks. Immediately I feel it just got kicked up to another level!!! I thought the wax would make it a racy high, but no, it just amplified the Kryptonite and NEED to now go to bed. Wonderful! I will drift off to dreamland peacefully and pain free. This is very strong now. Also from Herban Nation Delivery, $30/gram.

Vpicked up at Minerva in Albuquerque NM for $10 a gram. tested at 22.02%thc and .3%cbd. very nice looking budz, with nice darker orange hairs and was medium greenness with pieces of purple calyxes here and there. I can rate the taste or smell due to a little common cold I&#39;ve got. very nice cerebral high and very relaxing body high. reminds me of a good grown master Kush. did not make me to tired either. very good anytime indica dominant strain, wud definitely recommend to anyone that like indica&#39;s.  helped pretty good for my pain and nerve damage and help my PTSD a good bit\u23e9\u25fd&#128559;&#128572;&#128077;

THANK GOD FOR KRYPTONITE!! I have been able to eat &amp; keep food down. I haven&#39;t had any head pain.  I&#39;m lucky to have found this strain.\u000aDoesn&#39;t make me sleep, wish it did.

VI only smoked enough to get me to my hyper-stoned stage right before i would get to relaxation mode. I felt like King Kong, like i could do any fucking thing i wanted. So it honestly scared me because i didnt want to do some stupid shit. But I still like it, i just smoked just enough for that bad trip. \u000a\u000aHighly Recommended to someone with Insomnia, or any Pains. :)

VKryptonite is a strain for when you want your body to feel good but don&#39;t want your head to be too cloudy.  I was very focused and clear, but I wasn&#39;t at all productive with this strain. Well, I was reproductive, LOL.  It&#39;s a great strain for making out,  and wanna get touchy-feely.  Be careful when you lay down with your partner, though - it can put you to sleep if you get heavy-handed with it, and then there won&#39;t be any heavy hands on you :(.  Less giddy than Passion Fruit, but similarly arousing.  When I used it without my makeout partner around, I wound up listening to music and staring at the visualization in full screen on my computer.

VI had a &quot;Grape&quot; Kryptonite, pretty amazing stuff.  Smelled of grapes, faint, but it had the scent - looked a bit purple too.  It had a slightly sweet aftertaste, like grape tea if it existed.  This Kryptonite made me fairly sleepy, although I could fight the sleep, I just didn&#39;t want to.  I was so chill and mellow, I wanted to just let it happen.  Worked for my muscle pain, headache, and cramps (hooray).  Tastes a lot sweeter if you vape it.

VMostly a fuzzy/muddy head high. Causes you to have very short-term perception - so everything seems new and exciting every second. Opposite of &quot;clear-minded&quot;.\u000a\u000aThere&#39;s a good sense of euphoria that&#39;s just barely enough to keep me from becoming TOO aware of myself. There&#39;s a lingering uncertainty, though, that I could live without.\u000a\u000aPhysical high is great! Very warm and tingly...almost LCD like. The tactile sensations are similarly reminiscent of mdma. Potent! Provided THE BEST sexy time I&#39;ve ever experienced.\u000a\u000aOverall, quite happy! While on it, things ring true in hilarious ways.\u000a\u000aThis strain provided the overwhelming sense of nostalgia I&#39;ve been looking for. Would be perfect for reliving old cartoons from your childhood.\u000a\u000aLonnnng, lingering effect. Still felt a little muddy the following morning. But wasn&#39;t &quot;bad&quot;.

VA grapey flavor and calmed my body down first then my head. Made me feel inspired and less depressed. My eyes feel heavy not so much my body. My head slightly aches but its tolerable. Now my eyes might be kinda low because it 12:23 am. On that homework grind! Now back to the weed, I personally think its sweet and sour as well as grapey and earthy

VKryptonite is one of the best strains I&#39;ve ever had. I am a fan of its parent Mendocino purps and it&#39;s cousin black tuna. \u000a\u000aAll well sedating strains  when you need a good nights  rest. \u000a\u000aKrytonite is indica dominant but a little more versatile. It&#39;s great if you have severe pain and want to power through your day although you will be a tad groggy.

VThis will be my oddest review yet.  First night we vaped this strain, it was very relaxing and enjoyable.   However the next 2 nights it seemed had a very mild affect.  This possibly could have been due to our mood as we were normal the first  night, but stressed out the next 2.   Either way, there wasn&#39;t a noticeable flavor via vaping.

VBy far one of my favorite indica strains. The flavor is nothing to ride home about but the high is phenomenal. This strain comes on very smooth and extremely heavy. Almost like a morphine induced high. Excellent for pain management and insomnia. This strain will leave you feeling like you&#39;re floating on a cloud when you inevitably drift off. The hunger wasn&#39;t necessarily an issue for me with this strain though which is a bonus. As someone who has suffered from insomnia for the past 13 years I would recommend this strain to anyone with the same troubles. If you can find it at your local dispensary, BUY IT AND LOTS OF IT.

While I had, according to them, lots of &quot;hate&quot; to quell, I gave them my money anyway.  The bud, did have that growhouse taste, and made my throat feel coated in a non-medicinal way - but the Indica high kept me going back until I was broke and detoxing.

This Indica strain got me so high, that after we were done smoking we were going to make a couple throws (Disc Golf) I couldn&#39;t even throw the disc far, I was so stoned. This strain will forever be one of my top Indica strains.

This strain treated all that and more. It made me in a better mood . Didn\u2019t have any negatives. \u000aI used it the first time before bed to relax and get some rest. But what was awesome that morning usually I have to start the day but addressing my injuries. But it\u2019s somehow lingered. And I got up with no pain and in a cheerfully mood. Lasted til about lunch. \u000aI recommend this. Maybe bad for Superman but damn good for me.

VSo ive heard of a few different crosses but i beleive the one ive obtained from my local dispensary is the mendocino purp genetics. These buds are very pungent if your trying to conceal the smell you&#39;ll gave some trouble lol! Light light green in color with orangeish redish hue of hairs blanketed in Trichomes from the thick stems to the kief covered leafs. The taste is why i believe its got Mendo purp in its genetics because you instantly get that purple thats upon inhalation &amp; even more in your exhale ! Its an all time favorite of mine being that i am a huge flavor junkie ! Th high is quick &amp; hits you both un the head and the bofy leaving you extremely relaxed. I use this @ Night time alot &amp; love smoking it duting the day but only in small dosages as this strain can easily leave you implanted in the couch with the munchies ! Haha overall if you havent tried this or want to itsa must have in your medicine cabinet !

VMy pain threshold has been pushed even farther. So I get these things (this was only me second one) called a  psuedoaneurysm or false aneurysm. The pain is no joke it goes with your heart beat, pulsatile pain. I&#39;ve given child birth naturally and I&#39;d rather go thru the natural birth of triplets than experience this pain again.\u000aSo began the hunt for an indica that had strong pain relieving properties. It doesn&#39;t make me sleepy which is disappointing, but I&#39;m grateful it gets rid of the pain.

VI&#39;ll never forget this strain. One day my friend came to get me from class. I ditched lunch and last period. And we went to the Paseos Park and smoked a couple bowls. This Indica strain got me so high, that after we were done smoking we were going to make a couple throws (Disc Golf) I couldn&#39;t even throw the disc far, I was so stoned. This strain will forever be one of my top Indica strains.

VGreat one. I\u2019ve been look to have a nice balanced indica . I suffer some was painful injuries, which gives me some bad anxiety. Of course stressful as a result. This strain treated all that and more. It made me in a better mood . Didn\u2019t have any negatives. \u000aI used it the first time before bed to relax and get some rest. But what was awesome that morning usually I have to start the day but addressing my injuries. But it\u2019s somehow lingered. And I got up with no pain and in a cheerfully mood. Lasted til about lunch. \u000aI recommend this. Maybe bad for Superman but damn good for me.

Texture is very thick and dense, looks like somebody just dropped the nugs in a pileful of kief. It has a very mild purple color with big dust-yellow hairs. \u000aSmooth smoke, great for allday smoke.

VGrape Kryptonite packs a powerful punch. It has a fruity smell and taste, with purple colors. It comes on rather slowly and the effects include relaxation, elimination of stress, and some ease of pain. It has a nice balance to it, that you won&#39;t find in some strains that are heavy indicas or sativas.

VI bought this as I was told it would be a good sleep smoke.  (and it was on sale for $7 a gram!)  The bud was beautiful to look at and the smell was sweet and pleasant.  The high wasn&#39;t as sleepy as promised and that turned out to be a good thing.  For me, the Kryptonite didn&#39;t knock out my inner Superman but it did give me a nice buzz, perfect for watching evening TV (think Family Guy reruns) or movies.  I thought things were funnier than they probably were but hey there&#39;s nothing wrong with that! There was something old school  about this blend - it just takes you to a happy place but doesn&#39;t lock you down there.

VI&#39;ve smoked Kryptonite only once and it came from My Spot. I bought an 8th of this when it was a fresh, new, and more potent strain than the previous that My Spot has received. After speaking with the nice gentlemen about this strain I learned that it didn&#39;t have that OG smell most indicas have so I was kind of skeptical about it but ended up taking it anyway. The smell was really fruity and tropical like, buds had lots of crystals, fluffy, and really sticky. When smoking it, it goes down pretty smooth and the high is more sativa like. I didn&#39;t feel sleepy and heavy, hunger did occur though. Overall it was a good strain but not what I would pick first because I like the more heavier high. My Spot has really good too quality bud so I would recommend them. P.T.B

VFor people with pain, this strain will ease you down that scale of pain down to a tolerable level. It has benefits of an indica, that melt away the pain from back, headache, joint pain, muscle pain. Also, this strain is great for sleep and a very useful anti anxiety variety. I recommend this to anyone that has a tolerance well built and is in need of some reliable relief. When grown with a form of blackstrap derivative, this smoke has a smooth candy finish, reminiscent of its parents.
