VWhat a great strain for my back! My doc gave me some roids, something athletes aren&#39;t supposed to take, to see if that would ease thevpain, not at all. This strain after 2-3 hits, my pain is gone and I feel so relaxed but not sleepy at all. This strain is good for patients with pain, cramps, headaches and stress.

VStrong medicine, in some ways reminded me of a blue dream like strain. Herbal and fruity smell. Happy,  talky high, hard to keep a straight face. first two hits went smoothly...probably shouldn&#39;t have had a third hit from the bong. I was so high, I had to duck my head under passing satellites. see &quot;Himalayas&quot;, www.Soundcloud.com/the-high-chameleons

Vdear space hoes,  this is your galactic overlord dr avocado speaking.  I bring you news of a strain called sour pebbles.   as my earthly underlings know, I am not much of an sativa man.  but this is a rare exception.  this strain is gentle and uplifting.  it&#39;s euphoric as well.  enjoy the sunniness of this strain.  over and out.

V5/5 top notch strain for wake and bake and daily consumption. has a wonderful fruity/sour/pungent smell that is very pleasant. smokes well and is on the stronger side so if your tolerance is low I wouldn&#39;t suggest more than 3-5 tokes of a bowl. only roll it up if your looking to smoke a joint and go on an adventure thru the woods on a nature walk
