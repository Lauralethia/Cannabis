VShe\u2019s so fine. \u000a\u000aFirm and dense and very sticky, she smells sweet and skunky. \u000a\u000aThe first puff was like a sweet dream, she\u2019s so earthy, woodsy, like sitting in the dim forest surrounded by deep mossy loam and the sound of raindrops on shaking ferns. My surprise and joy at her flavor joins with the wave of calm contentment that starts in my limbs and reaches my head in a crashing wave. More puffs follow, smooth milky smoke and soon I feel quite comfortable, warm and contented. She\u2019s a new favorite for sure. \u000a

VI love Indicas for the evening when I really want to relax.  This is such a nice mellow, long lasting high that will put a smile on your face and maybe make you listen to some music or hang with that someone special.  Really relaxing and uplifting, but will send you to bed if you smoke too much. No paranoia, just mellow.  Cheers!!  Enjoy

VGreat strain, an indica dominant hybrid that doesn&#39;t trip me up a lot but gives me energy joy and relaxation during social events. I find I can open myself more on this strain. Doesn&#39;t keep me up all night but doesn&#39;t knock me out either. Hope to see more positive results from other users in the near future!

VMy step-dad usually gives me weed to try out to see which would help with my anxiety best and this strain is defiantly one of my faves I&#39;ve felt a lot better especially because I smoke on the mornings and I&#39;m more motivated to do more but the negative of being anxious do make the come downs a little harsh but overall I do like this strain and would be smoking this more in the future

VReally nice Indica.  Classic in its effects, but a little more complex than a straight up Indica.  Great for just hanging out with friends because while it is relaxing, it doesn&#39;t put you to sleep.  Great flavor and taste as well.  Fruity. grapey, berry with some breadiness/yeast.

VI absolutely cannot get over the smell. it might be hard to believe but the taste is even better, very sweet. Excellent for pain, Ive got a rotator cuff injury (shoulder) and this strain made me forget all about it. I did get some of that &quot;couch lock&quot; feeling but it isnt overwhelming, great strain to chill/relax and smoke but not something that sends me into the realm of slumber. 9/10 would buy again.

VCherry Pie is one of the best hybrids ever and GDP has always been one of my favorite indicas so I knew this was a no brainer.  It has a  skunky piney sweet smell. Tastes great in a pipe. I was surprised to find out that the THC percentage was only 10-15%, but feels like more,awesome for nighttime. It is light green with with orange hairs also has some purple all throughout.

VI suffer from chronic pain due to scoliosis &amp; \u201dcorrective\u201d spinal surgeries. I have a strong tolerance and need a little more than the average person. Fifteen minutes ago my back was burning and in spasm. I just finished 1 gram of PC flower via the Volcano &#128579;. My pain has diminished by 80% right away. I can feel the my muscles loosen and I am happy. I usually vape another gram but for now, everything is Irie. If you suffer from chronic muscle &amp; nerve pain, this particular strain will help. High Hopes my friends.

Pink Champagne is a cross between the ever strong Grand Daddy Purps with Cherry Pie giving her the thick resinous buds with layers on layers of golden frost... this strain is a perfect indica hybrid with its pungent flavours that will have your mouth wanting more, while smoking i could feel a slight tingle as this strain hit my blood stream, my eyes became low with a red tint as it laid me back into the couch the head high was a clear type high but with the addition of GDP this strain has couch locking effects excellent for stress pain and insomnia
