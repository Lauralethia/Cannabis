VForm: Shatter\u000aBrand: Canamo Concentrates\u000aTHC: 72%\u000a\u000aAppearance 5/5\u000a- Amazing looking, beautiful amber colored shatter mostly translucent.\u000a\u000aTaste 4/5\u000a -Nothing special, slightly harsh.\u000a\u000aFeel 5/5\u000a- Very euphoric indeed. I usually don&#39;t care for chemdawg strains, but the euphoria is unreal.  This stuff would be great to manage my nausea (I suffer from something that makes me feel like I&#39;m always motion sick....vertigo maybe? I also suffered through a psuedoaneurysm which is pain worse than natural birth which I&#39;ve gone thru &amp; this strain is helping my tension headache as well eliminating my nausea). \u000a\u000aIf you find this strain pick it up, you&#39;ll be so haply yi

VBoss Hogg has a wonderful aroma and flavor notes. For me the euphoric effects are a bit strong but it gradually settles into a nice numbing body high which is great for my hip and back pain. I did not find that it helps with focus at all. I may have been tired from work but I know I was super absent minded after smoking this strain.

VI tend to be a sativa girl but wanted to try this for stress relieve and lower back muscle tension. Definitely more of a body high than head high but still some cerebral effects. It completely relaxed me, muscle tension melted away. I did end up taking a nap but I am not sure that was because of the bud. Also great fro appetite stimulation. I will likely keep this on hand for when I am struggling with my back.

VSmoking Boss Hogg to get high is the equivalent of drinking a ton of O&#39;douls to get drunk - it, aint happening! That being said, it is a great muscle relaxer and pain reliever. Yesterday was squat day, today is watching Motor Trend Ignition episodes on YouTube day. This Boss Hogg from Native Roots Adams definitely leans towards heavily Indica dominance. Yet, the odd thing is - it isn&#39;t a Old School tranquilizer to the neck couchlock feeling. Generally I&#39;m all for the trippy, high THC, and high THCV space out. After this I just might start working more Indicas into the mix.

VIllinois batch 17% THC. Let me just say I am not a fan. I think Boss Hogg may be the name of their cat that sprayed on the crop because all I tasted was ammonia. My house smelled like litter box after a few bowls. I did its job don&#39;t get me wrong , it has an effect, I just can&#39;t stand the flavor

VUsed Liberty Tincture - .6ml about 6mg I almost instantly feel relaxation come over my body and my mind state slightly relax. And I feel slight euphoria. provided mood elevation minutes later great euphoria slight and very mild body relaxation but enough to take away any physical anxiety relaxed my stomach enabling me to eat and truly is a great medicine. I\u2019m gunna try .65ml of Boss Hogg ...Ok Mellows out the body and the mind nice euphoria happiness relaxation takes away anxiety and stress but .65 mL was definitely too much So I\u2019m going to stick with about .55 or .6 mL was almost a little bit to euphoric and in your head at that point lol. I think this is going to be my new go to strain as it is a cheaper tincture than the one I was previously getting and it will last much longer as I am using less I am able to get away with only using .6 mL every two hours each bottle should last me a little bit over a week

VI have a feeling this would be a really good in a group, but unfortunately I use most of my pot in private, so I know I&#39;m not getting the full effect. I&#39;ve mostly just pulled a few buds off and put them over a screen before, but I decided to grind some up and pack a bowl for use over the next few days. Holy hell, it knocked me right on my ass. If you&#39;re gonna grind it alone, put on some rad music and prepare for a trip. Shit, I actually had to keep eating so I could try and get it down to a manageable high. not trying that again in a hurry, at least not with this strain.
