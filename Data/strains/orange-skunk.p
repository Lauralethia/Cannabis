VGot this after it was recommended by the bud tender. Normally I&#39;m not a fan of sativas or sativa dominant hybrids, they always give me anxiety, but this was anything but. Nice dark green appearance with lots of orange hairs and crystals. Nice fruity smell but still very skunky. Great high ! Lots of head high without it being too much with just a nice amount of indica relaxation. I was able to smoke this and work with no problems. Really liked it and would 100% buy again

VI&#39;m so happy to see this strain finally added to Leafly! My regular neighborhood dispensary carries it quite frequently, and the owner has told me it&#39;s a customer favorite. I can certainly understand why, as a few fat buds of Orange Skunk always bring a smile to my face. :) This strain is named appropriately, as it is both very skunky (use a Stink Sack!) and very orange-y (the citrus half of this hybrid is definitely prominent in both taste and smell).

VLet&#39;s get one thing straight...it tastes nothing like oranges. In fact it&#39;s a bit harsh. Overall great chilled high. You&#39;ll enjoy this better with company rather than sitting alone watching T.V. Despite it feeling a little more india dominant, you can still get stuff done, depending on your mindset. Watch out for the munchies though, they usually sudden onset, but easy to repel with mints.\u000a

VI expected little from this to be honest. But I have to say the body high is very nice. Almost worth the atrocious dry, itcy irritated eyes that come along with it. I&#39;ll go with Bubba or Master or coma over this if I want a good indica because that is I could feel. Almost no sativa effect for me. It&#39;s a much better than average relief on the body however, I just can&#39;t get past the eye annoyance.

VBeautiful dense green sparkly nugs with bright orange hairs make this a pleasure to gaze upon...smell IS orangey skunky goodness, and the flavor carries through till the last hit.  Great medicine for pain relief and relaxation with no dry red eyes for me, as others have mentioned.
