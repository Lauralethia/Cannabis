VNeed to get rid of some stress? Blueberry pie is the way to go! A nice smooth smoke with a hint of sweetness, Blueberry Pie is a great way to end the day! One of the biggest triggers for seizures is stress, and Blueberry Pie is a great way to control my stress and ease my seizures! While it doesn&#39;t do much to help with my pain, this strain is a definite necessity that improves the quality of my everyday life! Everyone should have a little blueberry pie in their house!

VI should start off by saying I deal with severe pain during my periods and am usually at a point where I can&#39;t function beyond simply crying and clutching at my body. I have tried so many different strains to touch the pain in my back/uterus and nothing has ever worked like this. This doesn&#39;t play up my extreme emotions or cause me to have anxiety, I can genuinely relax and lay back without any pain. However it does take about one and a half to two bowls to get me to that point and once I am there the head high is extremely potent. So if you&#39;re looking to relax deeply and have a day on the couch free from your pain, this is absolutely perfect. I don&#39;t have anything notable to say about the flavor because honestly I was eating chips while I was smoking lol I got mine at world of weed in Tacoma from the brand pilot. The actual flower was a little dry but I won&#39;t blame the strain for it

After grinding, these same smells become much more pungent.\u000a\u000aThe buds are tight, dense and covered in trichomes. They have a bright green color with some short light brown and amber hairs. One nug even had a blueish hue to it!\u000a\u000aThe smoke is tasty and sweet! The inhale is very reminiscent of GSC in it&#39;s flavor and the exhale reminds me of blueberry syrup, yum! \u000a\u000aThe high is happy and relaxing. One big toke and my eyes got low really fast!\u000a\u000aIn the end, this strain is fantastic! As far as hybrids go, this definitely leans indica, perfect for a mellow mindset.

Mellow and relaxing, seems less potent than either parent but still has a nice well rounded buzz to it. Would like to see a cut that leans a bit more to the GSC side. Found Cookie Wreck to be a better sativa/GSC cross with similar but stronger effects personally. 3.5/5.

VI was gonna give this strain\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50, but the taste of the terpines are wonderful, but as for the strength of this medicine,could be a Lil higher. All in all this is a very good daytime smoke and allows u to do the things u need to do without the mind racing, and the self induced anxieties, most of us create. I think that&#39;s y most of us smokers started smoking in the first place. To elevate stress,make taskes a Lil easier, and my all time favorite that all mmj medicine does; gives everyone a different outlook or perception of Any mood, or problem you maybe having with anything. Mmj of all strains causes one or more then one to have a total different outlook on a situation then one may have before smoking, an that&#39;s one of the better qualities all mmj has when used in flower form. For example, say your upset and u just keep feeding on the anger an feeding on it because it&#39;s giving u an euphoria of a negative kind, one ,two puffs of flowers an poof the anger is gone and one has a brand new outlook on what was angering them...... All mmj meds no matter what strain from dirt seedy Mexican to the Kindest of the Kind mmj.... It all changes ones perspective for the better when in a sober angry frustrated mood....
