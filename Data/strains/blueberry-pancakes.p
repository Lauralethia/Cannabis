Vthis is an excellent strain for sleep, didn&#39;t get the same super happy and hungry effect as other indicas  I&#39;ve tried for sleep. was just really mellow and polite feeling. I was ready for bed I&#39;m about 15 minutes, the stuff is potent though so be careful.

VInstant favorite! The scent of this strain is amazing!!! Went on a trip to Seattle and the budtender recommended this gem! I sat with my face nose deep in the bag for 10 min just inhaling that glorious aroma!!! Almost didnt want to smoke it, Almost! The high was just as sweet and amazing as the smell! Went back to that dispensary 2 more times that trip just for this strain. Definite 5 stars!!!

VBlueberry Pancaked supplied by ReUp. Beautiful shimmery nugs, a really nice example of this strain. Smells amazing. Very sweet, much like blueberry muffins or pancakes. Lots of crystals on the piece I got. Fuzzy Stoney high. I can feel my tension easing and my body relaxing. I feel chill and less irritated. Very go with flow. I also struggle with generalized anxiety and this does help me feel a little less on edge. I would buy this strain again.

VJust lit up bowl number two in a row of her. She hits, initially, a little harsher than I pictured she would (almost like a sour diesel pull from a pipe) but if you&#39;re not a fan of that, nevermind because she finishes smooth, rich and flavorful on the exhale. Immediate flavors noted were vblueberry, vanilla, buttery/doughy, earthy sour but that could just be because I&#39;m lazy and use butane lighters like everyone else. The high comes on slow and gradual, stop what you&#39;re doing for a moment and you&#39;ll be like, &quot;damn, where the fuck...how the fuck, how long was i just doing that for...!?&quot;, I promise. All in all, if you can pick her up for the right price it will be totally worth it, I scored a half OZ bag from Northwest Cannabis Connection in WA by Sasquatch at 25% overall for $100, even. Side note: remember, though she is a hybrid, she is indica dominate; so, probably not the best choice before being overly active. 4/5 only because I&#39;m picky, to a novice she&#39;ll open doors in your brain that you didn&#39;t even know were there!

VCalming, mellow indica that actually does taste like blueberry pancakes when vaping. The bag smelled sweet too, but with a skunky, earthy undertone. Blueberry Pancakes and Blue Cheese are the most delicious tasting strains I&#39;ve tried. BP has a good body and head buzz, but nothing particularly strong or remarkable about the high.

VThe buds I bought of BP were more dry and didn&#39;t hold a lot of flavor. The high is good for those wanting an indica that doesn&#39;t have a heavy body buzz so you can relax or work on some minor tasks. Not my newest favorite, but still glad I tried it.

VIf stomach remedy is what you&#39;re looking for then blueberry pancakes is a must try! I suffer from severe Crohns disease and have been battling a flare the last couple of weeks so I was on the hunt for something to take the edge off the stomach pain and nausea. That&#39;s when I stumbled across this little gem and found some relief! The high wasn&#39;t nothing to write home about but don&#39;t think I&#39;m knocking it. This strain is definitely a good balanced hybrid that you can feel in both mind and body without leaning too much either way. Not a heavy locker or put you to sleep bud making it an all day smoker though in the later part of the day after a couple medicating sessions the body effects do tend to creep in more than the mind. Great for soothing nausea and stomach cramping, even somewhat assisted in the pain suffered from chronic acid reflux which was an unexpected plus. As far as tastes goes I didn&#39;t get to experience the true blueberry pancake taste I&#39;ve heard about that&#39;s common to this strain but definitely got a sweet buttery flavor woven through a subtle earthiness. If you suffer from Crohns, celiac, IBS or ulcerative colitis I definitely recommend giving this one a go!

VOne of my new favorite strains for the vape pen. It has a great, light taste. The anxiety relief is immediate and it doesn&#39;t make you overwhelmingly tired. In fact, it puts me in such a good mood I feel slightly more creative and motivated to do activities... such as, write this review. If you&#39;re in Spokane, WA I recommend getting your hands on a Harmony vape pen cartridge in B. Pancakes from Satori North. If you buy on Wednesday or Saturday it&#39;s only $28 for a 3/4 gram.
