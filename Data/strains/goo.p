VDelicious! I got a bunch of this cheap from the dispensary as it was shake, and great quality at that! Very yummy brambleberry flavor by vaping in a silver surfer, the high is a wonderful skin tingle and buzz, nice eye droop, and the weight of the week is lifted.

VThe aroma is of very sour pineapples.. the smoke is similar but without any trace of sweetness (&quot;sour-piney&quot;; not to be confused with grass). very candy-ish, reminded me of a sour pheno pineapple thai i had last year. mostly clear/milky trichs - i was excited at the sight. I bought a half gram nug, broke it half, and rolled in a joint. So I guess you can say it was ~0.25g. And when i smoke my herb, i smoke it like a cigarette; therefore, my tokes are not bong tokes or anything ridiculous people are doing these days. Not creeper, but very abrupt: 1 toke in now starting very clearheaded (minor headache vanishes). 3 tokes later, a warmth in place of the vanished headache. perceived sense of 3d plane is skewed, but NOT visual hallucinations. more like.. you&#39;re not as mindful of the 3d plane around you; &quot;weed dizziness&quot;. at the end (~ 5tokes in), this perception of gravity/placement on this 3d plane becomes more noticeable. you&#39;ll be staggering at this point in the onset.  7 min later, creative and uplifting thinking occur. i say this because i feel i was in the mode of logical processing. i woke up with nightmares about work, and kept thinking i had to be at work sometime in the day. allow me to explain without further ado why i feel this was a particularly uplifting, giddy, creative, scatterbrain strain. i was thinking of something perverse my stepdad wouldnt do (like, smoke weed), do it, how he would be. This is strange, because there was no process that would&#39;ve gave me a hint of how he would be.  he&#39;s always too stuck in his ways to do that. so, at this, i saw him looking up around at the ceilings, sitting in the shade, blue sky, birds chirping and all, smiling all high on life (or this stuff, IF he tried it).  and seeing his face, made me chuckle to myself.  \u000a\u000a15 min in now, scatterbrained and having trouble writing this report. actually, i am typing (this moment) through memory (it&#39;s not easy for me to do with most smoke reports! i still like to try tho :D knowledge in this fascinates me). \u000a\u000a45 min in, heaviness from head lifts, clarity returns. inspiration stays. music still sounds great.  feel good. not exactly grinning now, but in awe of... currently the riddle by five for fighting.  seems to take emotions from the music!  oh man, love it.  only wish the ditsy-schoolgirl mode would&#39;ve lasted longer... because... who doesn&#39;t want to be a ditsy schoolgirl?? fuck that!\u000a\u000astarted to wear off 1.5hrs in, but i&#39;ve had some tolerance lately. \u000a\u000amaybe what for? depression.  anxiety.  migraines. being a loving person

VGot this from a local dispensary while looking for a sativas that wouldn&#39;t completely haze out and help keep focused and energetic. I suggested to try out this strain to help with my chronic migraines as well as the effects I was looking for.\u000a\u000aUsed an Arizer Extreme Q and vaped this strain at 197c. Had a great fruity, pineapple taste true to its name and some slight earthy tones. Started to take effect after about 15 minutes. Organized my thoughts and I was still able to function and get rid of my pain. Great daytime strain that gives you a little pop of energy, pain relief, and focus. One of my go to sativas when in stock.

VGoo is a great medication to get you to sleep.  It was and still is one of my favorites.  It is an Indica that lives up to its strain.  You can function on Goo but I wouldn&#39;t want to go to work on it.  Taste is wonderful both in and out.  If you need something to help sleep, or just unwind with a good movie or some music, this is for you.

VGoo seems like a good description. I tried it in my small pipe and it instantly clogged the pipe. Then I tried it in a joint and had trouble keeping it lit. \u000a\u000aI settled with mixing it with xxx og in a joint and that \u000adid the trick. Together they make a nice late evening smoke. The high CBD helps with arthritis and kills any anxiety and the xxx og gives more of a buzz, helps more with pain and sleep. \u000a\u000aI can&#39;t say much for the taste. It&#39;s possible the trouble keeping it lit had something to do with the way it was cured.

VSticky, Skunky, Dank large nugs with strong fruity sweet lemonene terps and distinctive pineapple flavor.  This strain is reportedly from a C-99 pineapple pheno female crossed with a &quot;Skunk 1 X Hindu kush&quot; male.  My stash is beyond typical &quot;frosting&quot; and &quot;snow&quot; and seems consistently splattered with gooey pools of oozing ice. This Sativa Dominant Strain is reportedly rather high in CBD and my neurological pain and spasm issues respond well to it., especially unusual for many Sativa strains I&#39;ve used.  I am generally best medicated with strong Indica dominant varieties but this one gets 2 thumbs up as one of my Favorite Strong Sativa Dominant varieties.  It edged out some real fine strong dank SOUR D and a sweet hit of an Indica Dominant strain called &quot;Kilowatt&quot; I compared it against for effect on my sticking finger joints and back pains.  The winner for fine body effect was still the super sweet dank MANGO KUSH I have that makes my toes tingle like no other.....Golden Pineapple is a winner for BHO too, better effect and flavor than several other &quot;Pineapple&quot; varieties I have had in whole herb and concentrate.....I like it as well if not better than strong Pineapple Kush even (but PK is one of my all time beloved strains too!)

VGoo seems like a good description. I tried it in my small pipe and it instantly clogged the pipe. Then I tried it in a joint and had trouble keeping it lit. \u000a\u000aI settled with mixing it with xxx og in a joint and that \u000adid the trick. Together they make a nice late evening smoke. The high CBD helps with arthritis and kills any anxiety and the xxx og gives more of a buzz, helps more with pain and sleep. \u000a\u000aI can&#39;t say much for the taste. It&#39;s possible the trouble keeping it lit had something to do with the way it was cured.

VThis is my absolute favorite strain for cooking! It&#39;s a wonderful Indica for medical usage (for me, that means treating anxiety, insomnia, and minor pain relief.) The flavor profile is sweet, berry, and woody, so I like to make cannaoil (with coconut butter) and bake a dessert with berries, or add the oil to a berry and spinach smoothie if I&#39;m feeling healthy! The berry/sweet flavors are so nice for smoking, too. You really can&#39;t go wrong with this strain - but don&#39;t expect any of the euphoric, energetic effects you&#39;ll get from a sativa. It&#39;s a heavy body-mind Indica, no doubt.

VUnderappreciated gem. Snagged a Purple Thai leaning phenotype. Not ur typical afghan/ hashplant, its alot more berry/earthy with a back end of skunk. In flower it smells like blueberry pancakes, but cures out to a sour almost grapey/ fermented wine smell. Resin production is thick and concentrates made from it taste incredible. Great for chilling out at the end of a long day.

VThe Goo I have looks better than anything I see in the photos section, it is delicious. Not to mention the sedating effects are helping a ton, I&#39;ll be looking for heavy Indica&#39;s more often to relieve inflamed nerves. Earthy berry describes its taste perfectly.

VSmooth smoke with a sweet taste that hints at blueberry, but settles on a nutty fruit flavor it&#39;s hard to put a finger on.  Very mild, low to medium THC percentage flower that brings on a light weight &amp; very relaxed buzz.  Depending on reaction to this strain it could be used for so many different things with its versatile nature.  Pain relief being number one followed by lowering anxiety with a fierce case of munchies easing into &quot;jello&quot; muscle and smiles mode.  Type of indica that relaxes, but does not knock out, only aids in process.  Slightly partial to this strain because it&#39;s also the nickname for my godson =)

VI love the smell of this strain! It&#39;s so sweet smelling and just delicious. The smoke is smooth and kinda hashy and sweet. The high is very relaxing and comforting. Just a good body and mental buzz with little to no couch lock for me. I love my indicas though! And this Goo is exceptional!
