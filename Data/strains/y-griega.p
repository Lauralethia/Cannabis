VIt has a very powerful cerebral buzz. It mantains you very active, creative, productive and helps you to beat social anxiety. I do not recomend this strain for begginers, &#39;cause its high content of THC May develop anxiety attack. My first time with this strain, I was like 2 hours high, really happy and active, I totally recomend it for social events with regular smokers

VThis plant is stinking up my grow room in a good way. The buds are very sugary. Crystals everywhere. The stems grow long and bud sites are everywhere. It&#39;s drinking about a gallon a day and it&#39;s most happy with lots of light and lots of nutrients. Current using Advance Nutrients. Would highly recommend this beautiful medicine.

VI was initially intrigued by this strain when I came across it because Amnesia has always been one of my favorites. It does not disappoint. Sativa strains typically make me go into panic meltdown mode and I stay away from them, Y Griega is somehow uplifting and energizing, but keeps me cool calm and relaxed so I can actually enjoy it!

My head hums along focused and clear, while my body buzzes with energy.  Love the time distortion I&#39;ve been experiencing.  Makes for very pleasant weekends!\u000a\u000aThis pot has significantly improved the quality of my life.

VI&#39;ve had this in my medicine cabinet for about a month now.  I don&#39;t go to it everyday as I mix in some other sativa heavy hybrids for daytime variety, but it is my go to for when I want the most energetic, motivating, pleasant &quot;start my day right&quot; kind of high.  Sends me off at exhale and lets me down in an exceptionally pleasant way whenever I feel like I&#39;m done.  Very soft landing.  Serious time distortion, seems to extend time so love it for weekends!  Able to keep a focused head for social time.  In fact makes my interactions more enjoyable all around.  Keeps me relaxed and stress free, life&#39;s little bumps aren&#39;t very big.   And the energy and focus I get only makes me want to deal with them,  win- win, stoned to the gills and productive!   Tend to smile and chuckle a lot and marvel at how good I feel.   Along with all it&#39;s mental health benefits it also helps with my orthopedic aches which allows me to take advantage of the energy.  All in all, one of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  This pot has significantly improved the quality of my life.
