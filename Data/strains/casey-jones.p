VBest. Strain. Ever. Go for creativity, partying and playing. Energetic and fun. One stain you can smoke all night. Can also create anxiety for me. If you smoke this one and you&#39;re a novice or moderate smoker, have some pepper corns to chew on ready to take the edge off. It makes me a little foggy the next day, which means this is usually a weekend strain for me, or light workday the day after. For me, Jack Herer is a close second to Casey Jones and Cinex. Casey Jones is great for music, but wouldn&#39;t recommend being in public with a Casey buzz. Better for evenings with a few close friends, playing music and getting creative and doing art. Also, a good one for making love. Also, allows for nice sleep at the end of the buzz.

VWow! Just frigging WOW! Casey is some powerful stuff. Not for the weak. That&#39;s for sure. Not only is this strong, it alleviates a lot of stress, pain, and helps out on joint pain. Incredible buzz that&#39;ll punch you square in the balls, and will have you begging for another. This is a winner. Especially when it&#39;s moist and sticky.

VCasey Jones can certainly be used as a &#39;get things done&#39; strain- but I prefer it for its dreamy and gentle properties. A bowl will completely relax you, but put a pep in your step that could have you ticking off your to-do list like there&#39;s no tomorrow. This isn&#39;t a sativa that will give you crushing anxiety- something I am prone to when smoking. Instead, this is a magical, giggly strain just as enjoyable smoked lazing around in bed with a romantic partner, going out for a jog, or working on a creative project. \u000a\u000aCasey Jones is powerful, sweet and citrusy in the bag, then smelling and tasting like fresh popcorn when burned. This evokes the child-like awe of going to the cinema that I still experience every time I go see a movie. In large enough quantities (not difficult to achieve because of CJ&#39;s potency), smoking this beautiful strain will enamour and mesmerise you, just like your favourite movie. Your thought processes and perceptions will be deeply changed and enriched, as tension and stress leave your body and mind. :)

VThe bud is a nice mellow green with red hairs all over. It&#39;s soft to the touch, and a little sticky. The smell is slightly sweet, floral, and piny. The flavor, however, is extremely sweet; saccharin sweet, even.\u000a\u000aThe high on this creeps in somewhat slowly, and hits kind of hard once it arrives in full swing. It&#39;s a very loose, giggly, happy, uplifting head high, with a mildly tingly body high. Overall, this stuff just screams &quot;good times.&quot; Absolutely a wonderfull strain for depression or stress relief.

VLOOKS: Well first thing I noticed before cracking jar. was the Mass of crystal, and red hairs.\u000a\u000aSMELL: Kinda citrusy, makes you wonder what it tastes like.\u000a\u000aTASTE: Like i said almost mandarin, with a strong skunky flavor.\u000a\u000aEFFECTS: Its about 80% sativa so its a real jumpy weed, for those of you who like speedy weeds, you will love this. Great for during the. Almost instant uplift and energizing high make you want to take on the day, Definitely not for anxiety attacks, or at night. Use this one to get Motivated!

Some sativas put your mind and body on the go but Casey Jones had my mind opened up, absorbing everything - all my senses were happily working together on a higher level than normal.  I felt like my brain was sucking it all in on my morning walk.  This could be a perfect wake and bake bud.

VCasey Jones hits you like a freight train, then takes you smoothly down the rails,with the occassional hill and valley.  This strain causes great mental creativity on otherwise humdrum issues.  It provokes inventive thoughts and would be great to use before an otherwise boring meeting at work.  But DON&#39;T open your mouth when you have an epiphany because by the time you attempt to form the words and share you idea, you brain has GONE ON to another epiphany....\u000a\u000aI vaped 1/4 of gram of bud, and was up all night cleaning my house, and still energized the next day.\u000a\u000aWill definitely repeat this, and would consider growiing this strain.

Vthe casy jones has no special taste or smell to distinguish it but the effects are great. slightly loopy silly spacey high that smacks you in the head immediately and gets stronger over the next 5 minutes lasting about 3 or 4 hours before leaving.

VThis review is on Casey Jones shatter by Rocky Road, Vail, C.O. \u000a\u000aCasey Jones is a strain I chose to start my morning with, It&#39;s kind of like washing cold water over your face.  It&#39;s a sweet, earthy tasting smoke, I&#39;m sure the flower version has a stronger citrus profile but it didn&#39;t really carry over into the wax.   The high is very heady, but not the kind of sativa that made me want to be on my feet. In fact, I was able to sit and game for hours on this strain.  I can see where if you over did it this might be a little racy or cause some anxiety, and it does cause a bit of sleepiness afterward.  Good strain, worth trying. 8/10

VI thought the casey jones was pretty good, it wasn&#39;t as good as most people say it was, this is coming from a heavy smoker though, for the lighter smoker you&#39;d really like this, its a good strong sativa with an indica under lying. Smelled really strong and almost fruity, very nice smell.  I can&#39;t taste anything right now due that I&#39;m sick, but the buzz lasted a good hour and a half but ive also had only 3 hours of sleep today too.\u000a\u000aAll in all it was pretty good, nice looking buds, smelled good, the smoke is fairly smooth, hidden coughs here and there.

VI love this strain and believe it&#39;s highly under rated.\u000a\u000aCJ creates a lovely sense of euphoria when smoked, along with a easier, less stressful approach to life. Life happens and CJ is a spirit lifter for life.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve also had the oil version. The Open Vape version has the welcoming flavor of honey sweetness. Its flavor is not reminiscent of CJ in either green or dried flower but it is a tasty treat with pleasant  effect.\u000a\u000aFor better or worse, I can&#39;t say I experience a lot of forgetfulness on this. I simply feel really good in both my head and body as this flower allows me to enjoy my daily activities much more than normal.\u000a\u000aHighly recommended - give it a try for daytime use; house work, or other mundane musts.

It&#39;s by far the happiest strain I&#39;ve experienced so far, I would say that Casey is a far cousin of Molly, if you know what I mean.

VThis is one beautiful strain. My sample does not smell like citrus instead it smells like a diesel truck ran over a skunk. The nuggets are light green with bright orange hairs and a hard coating of trichomes. The high is soaring and made everything outside look more vibrant and slightly psychedelic. Two puffs and I was set for the next couple of hours.  Casey Jones is a Trainwreck x Sour Diesel so you know it has fantastic genetics. My medicince is extremely potent and smells through my nug jar. Bloom did a great job with this one.

VThis review is on Casey Jones shatter by Rocky Road, Vail, C.O. \u000a\u000aCasey Jones is a strain I chose to start my morning with, It&#39;s kind of like washing cold water over your face.  It&#39;s a sweet, earthy tasting smoke, I&#39;m sure the flower version has a stronger citrus profile but it didn&#39;t really carry over into the wax.   The high is very heady, but not the kind of sativa that made me want to be on my feet. In fact, I was able to sit and game for hours on this strain.  I can see where if you over did it this might be a little racy or cause some anxiety, and it does cause a bit of sleepiness afterward.  Good strain, worth trying. 8/10

VI&#39;m torn because I definitely believe it deserves a 3.5 but it wasn&#39;t that potent so I&#39;d have to pick 3 instead of 4. The high is pretty good but it&#39;s not that type of strain that immediately hits you and leaves you thinking &quot;whoa, what just happened?&quot;  Definitely recommend if you want a sativa to have a chill high with.

VGot some of this for 420 as I didn&#39;t want something that was going to knock me out rather something that would uplift and energise me so I could stay sociable all day. Well it did that but maybe too much, for the first time in years I felt that wave of anxiety you sometimes get from strong sativas. I would rate this five stars for taste, smell and potency as this is a top notch strain but taking one star off just for the potential for anxiety as if you aren&#39;t careful you can find your mind racing uncomfortably. So to clarify I definitely would recommend this strain but just go easy to start with until you know what kind of beast you are riding on here! Enjoy!

VI had seen this strain at several dispensaries but had never rolled the dice.  I hate to sound like a derp, but even though I research strains I&#39;m interested in trying...sometimes I will choose one just because the name sounds interesting i.e. Blue God, Strawberry Cough...Grape Ape etc.  Casey Jones just sounded boring.  I probably never would have bought this but a friend surprised me with some along with some Blue God and Strawberry Cough.  We blazed through the God and Cough and finally several weeks later rolled a blunt of Casey Jones and the wife and I lit her up.\u000a  I quickly realized my mistake judging this strain just on name alone...double derp!  The pulls were smooth and tasty, very old-school taste in that it reminded me of the first times I ever lit up.  The wife loved the fact it didn&#39;t sear her lungs or make her cough.  Then the high hit us and it was everything we like.  Slightly focused but not insanely so and big shit-eating grins on our faces.  We were laughing and cutting up about everything.  I grabbed my stash and we took a real good look at her.  Thick, dense buds covered in fine red hairs with a slight frosty coating.  She was a bit sticky but not Gorilla Glue sticky.  Just a great looking bud.\u000aThe high was a 7 on the intense scale.  It started out giggly but then morphed into more of a body high...which probably explained a heightened state of arousal for both of us. The high lasted for just a bit over an hour and then it just started slowly ebbing.  Only drawback was a case of cotton mouth but we  countered that with lots and lots of H2O.  \u000aI&#39;ve learned a valuable lesson and hopefully have lowered my derp status when it comes to strain selection.  If you get a chance, the Mrs and I would definitely recommend picking up some Casey Jones for you own stash.  We&#39;ll be restocking soon.

VAlleviates all my day to day anxieties, focus issues, negative and depressing thoughts followed by a lack of motivation to clean, take care of my daily responsibilities, stay organized, keep a job, or the willingness to try and follow through with many things in life. This strain gives me the drive, I&#39;m motivated, happier, but still calm and relaxed.  Feeling capable of finishing all the undone, unwanted, everyday life tasks and the long term goals  I almost daily push off, avoid, bitch and stress out about.  Its the perfect strain.  I actually felt the need to look this strain up and learn more about it as I will always want more of this. Never had anything better. This strain lasts for a few hours on just a small amount. Didn&#39;t find the need to want more right away. As I normally do. Was content. End resulting in an amazing feeling of accomplishment.

VTried this strain at the famous &quot;1e Hulp&quot; coffeehouse in Amsterdam (as it is a house specialty there) and was VERY IMPRESSED. The high hits you like a train wreck, and lasts a good long while. Good presence of body high for a sativa dominant. Has a sweet, piney smell to it and is easy on the lungs. One of the best strains I tried in the Netherlands.

VI just had some that was very clean chem/kush smelling and sticky to the touch. The buds were light green and covered in gooey crystals. The high was very clear headed and focused,good for daytime. The taste was very flavorful with a slight earthyness from the trainwreck but very strong taste of chemdawg or diesel. The high was very enjoyable and provided for a fun day of activites. This strain makes a bad day more enjoyable, is good for making conversation, and will help increase your appetite.

VI&#39;m not that crazy about Sativas as my use is later in the day and to treat insomnia. But the bud tender recommended and I bought a qtr to try.  Wow, this is really good stuff and I highly recommend it.  It was a mellow yet energetic, nice ride on the train.  Hit after about 5 minutes and stayed for several nice hours.  Will make some canna-caps with it and looking forward to those results.  Will post in a few days on how it came out.  I have found canna-caps and vaping the same product produce different results.

Vthis one is the king of sativas. all you need is a few bong rips and you&#39;ll be launched into hyperspace.  it&#39;s extremely intense for the first hour. It gives me what I like to call old school video game vision at the start. basically everything looks illuminated and it takes a second for your vision to catch up with you when you turn your head.  As it slowly levels out your rocketed down the tracks into cerebral heaven. I often find myself so lost in thought that I just sit staring at the wall, not realizing that I&#39;m even doing it until what seems like hours later.  the come down crashes super hard into munchie land.  it can at times give you a little paranoia though. and cotton mouth with this one is a bitch.

VI&#39;m torn because I definitely believe it deserves a 3.5 but it wasn&#39;t that potent so I&#39;d have to pick 3 instead of 4. The high is pretty good but it&#39;s not that type of strain that immediately hits you and leaves you thinking &quot;whoa, what just happened?&quot;  Definitely recommend if you want a sativa to have a chill high with.

VOl&#39; Casey came in a brownie and left me a wreck for sure but in a good way if you&#39;re looking for your bones to melt.  Even though I only ate half, I think it was a bit much for me.  Working on getting the dosage right, but me &#39;n&#39; Casey will be bff.  Sometimes your bones just have to melt for fun.

VI had a bunch of this for a while, earlier this year. It wasn&#39;t cured super well, and still a tiny bit wet, but over time it dried out and became a decent blend.  The smell is strong, which I enjoy, and it usually gets the sale on smell alone. Tastes robust to me as well, the high is euphoric but you quickly come down which is ok i guess.

Vi&#39;m usually not someone who finds that certain strains are better or worse for certain activities (i can find a way to make anything work for anything), but this strain is different.  specifically, this is now my go-to yoga strain!  the level of concentration it gives, the way it lets me go deeeeep into the postures, and the way it soothes sore muscles on the day after i went so deep into those postures make it an indispensable part of my yoga practice.  cannot recommend more highly for that, and probably lots of other things as well.

VRight on the edge here between rating this strain a seven or an eight. It&#39;s a nice strain, just not particularly useful for nausea or pain, which is why I medicate. I had heard a lot about this strain and wanted to try it for a good daytime med. the sample I&#39;m reviewing came from ReLeaf in PDX. They have a wide selection of items. Well worth the trip. The buds are small, of medium density and are dark green with dark brown hairs. Although not the frostiest bud I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s still coated in crystals. Definitely a hybrid in its structure. The smell in not very strong, almost undetectable, which is unusual for a diesel cross. The buds really want to stay together during grinding. Vaping at 380 produced a medium vapor, making me cough on occasion. The taste does have an overwhelming diesel flavor. A little harsh. The effects are definitely sativa. It takes about ten minutes to come on with a spacey, happy feeling. This is an introspective strain, which would be good for socializing with intimates or just enjoying nature. I would think this would be good for depression and stress. Didn&#39;t do anything for my nausea or pain, so it&#39;s not likely to be a regular for me but it was still worth the experience. -si

I have a very nice happy high, my body is tingling with energy and I&#39;m jumping around like a small kid. I was smoking outside and I met my neighbour and I got a little paranoid. The high let me function normally and have a &#39;non&#39;-high conversation with me, the paranoia left as soon as we split or ways. \u000aOverall has a great great taste and a smooth hit. \u000aI&#39;m feeling extremely well and I recommend this strain to everyone. \u000a

VQuite possibly the greatest strain of marijuana ever. I have been smoking for a little over 5 months and this was the first real, intense high I had felt. It felt like an acid trip, you feel as what you really are, a small speck in the universe. I felt like I was just floating through space and about to die. Not in any kind of pain but that simply my life was ending. Game over. My friend then began touching my hair but it felt like she was rubbing my brain and I started freaking out and yelling.  Also, expect hallucinations. After we smoked, we ordered a pizza and listened to music while we waited. &quot;Saw Her Again&quot; was playing and I began tripping out. The table we were sitting at began to glow and display patterns in an almost holographic manner. After we ate the pizzas, I looked over at my friend&#39;s near empty box and saw these perfect, golden crusts. I then proceeded to yell at her, demanding she give me her crusts, but when I looked again, they were gone. I felt high for the next roughly 36 hours (yes, into the next day). Mind you, this was simply a dub that was shared amongst 5 people. Highly recommend.\u000a\u000atl;dr\u000a-hallucinations, ego death

I was also very talkative, so it&#39;s great for parties. Definitely good for during the day because if you smoke a good amount you get a little jittery and you don&#39;t want to sit still. Overall a very enjoyable, and different high. It hits you pretty fast as well! The bud itself was super stinky and smells quite skunky, but it&#39;s sweet. I also recall having some weird visuals

Body high allowed me to eat a good size dinner, yay me! Head high allowed me to relax &amp; enjoy my evening with family/friends. Was still pretty stoned when I fell asleep round midnight or so.
