VThis review is on Snoop&#39;s Dream by Pioneer Nuggets, WA.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed this strain.  As far as flavor goes it reminded me of DJ&#39;s BlueB.  Every bud I received was large, dense, and really pretty. As far as noticeable effects this strain wasn&#39;t overly powerful but left me very calm, and focused, relaxed but not tired.  Its effects resemble BlueD and Master Kush very well.  Clearly indica dominant but seemed to lightly stimulate my mind as well.  What you would expect from a 60/40 indica, but it never had me going &#39;wow I&#39;m stoned!&#39;.  Which is why I gave this a 9/10.

VCannabiotix in Las Vegas has produced the pinnacle of cannabis evolution. After my first try of this I was telling myself that this is could be the best strain I have ever smoked. An ounce and a half later I can confirm that statement. Snoop&#39;s Master Kush, as it is sold in the Vegas dispensaries, is THE go to strain for anything that ails me. Sold as an indica dominant, it has a much more balanced effect for me, with no feelings of couchlock. Waves of euphoria rush over my body, erasing any stress or pain that the workday causes. Also great for a day of trout fishing or a walk in the park. Flavors of intense blueberry and that OG gas. Cannabiotix is by far the best medicinal grower in Nevada at the moment, and I have never been disappointed in anything I&#39;ve had from them but this shit right here??? The. Best. Ever.

VSnoop&#39;s Dream is a cross between Blue Dream and Master Kush. The appearance is that of Master Kush, but with a frostier look and blueberry aroma. These dense nuggets produce a smoothe smoke that begins mellow, but soon intensifies with a euphoric,pain killing high.

VStoned...Yup. Snoop&#39;s Dream&#39;s genetics are a powerhouse that come together to make one of my favorite flames of all time.  Blue Dream lends this strain it&#39;s entrancing visuals and cerebral stimulation, while the deep, comfortable body high is fondly reminiscent of the heaviness of Master Kush.  Not a strain to be relied upon for productivity, the mental component of this smoke was distracting (it certainly made writing this review difficult.)  The body high was similar to that desired in most indicas, mainly couch-lock and the munchies.  I love Snoop Dogg, but in my opinion, this strain is best enjoyed with a lava lamp and Dark Side of the Moon. For those looking to use cannabis medicinally, this strain may be useful for relieving pain, stress and anxiety, as well as stimulating appetite and improving depressed moods.

VMaster Kush &amp; Blue Dream are both favorites of mine but smoke too much mk &amp; I&#39;m out, smoke too much BD &amp; I feel like I drank way too much coffee ... this strain takes on all the positive effects of both strains (happy, relaxed, uplifted, pain free, stress free, ect) &amp; leaves any possible negatives behind. I do not get jittery, I get super relaxed &amp; happy but it doesn&#39;t couch lock me either. I can go about doing whatever I was doing before, just MUCH happier lol ;) I will forever LOVE this strain.

VI came across a version called Snoops Blue Dream.\u000a\u000aExceptionally frosty, which takes away from noticing all the light orange hairs that sporadically sprout out of the buds here and there.\u000a\u000aBeing a 60/40 with a more prominent Blue Dream aspect, Snoops Blue Dream has a stronger blueberry smell, especially once you crack a bud in half and put your nose in there.\u000a\u000aWith this particular batch, the Blueberry side definitely shines through. Although there is a greater earthy taste than when I smelled it. This surely must be the Master Kush side making sure you don\u2019t forget about it.\u000a\u000aThis batch has a more sativa like heady, motivated high. But I noticed if you let yourself zone out, it will let you lose quite a bit of time.

Its quite creative and helpful for focus if you&#39;re interested in whatever you&#39;re focusing on. I wouldn&#39;t recommend to an insomnia patient, because I was still up until 3 am.

V(Master Kush x Blue Dream) \u000a&quot;Love it or hate it, hip hop and marijuana have gone hand-in-hand for a long time. When one of the kings of modern hip-hop has a strain named after him, expectations will naturally be high (no pun intended). Snoop\u2019s Dream is a genetic smorgasbord of strains claimed to be favorites of Snoop, featuring a strong indica body high with an interesting pine twist on a very sweet flavor.\u000a\u000aBlueberry is the dominant characteristic of this strain, with the dank, pine flavor of Kush coming through on the exhale. This might be a good strain to help those trying to pull away from straight fruit/sweet strains. Snoop\u2019s Dream has an extremely encompassing body high, seemingly weighing one down. This makes this a great strain for one needing to wind down or one suffering from chronic body pain. The mental effects are spacey and psychedelic, lending to tracers and the blurring of colors in ones vision. Not for the novice, this strain may be able to break through many tolerance barriers long-term medicators deal with.\u000a\u000aWe recommend this strain for fans of berry flavors with a twist, patients who like a knock-out body high, and patients who may have developed a strong tolerance to marijuana.

VYou know you\u2019ve got a goodie on your hands when you stick your nose in a plastic baggy and say, immediately, without rehearsal, \u201cWhoo! That\u2019s yummy.\u201d Snoop\u2019s Dream smells the way a clown car would smell if all the greats jumped in together. I\u2019m talkin Blue Cookies, Strawberry Cough, Grandaddy\u2026 Imagine the sweetest sativas and the most incredible indicas. Some weeds are advertised as smelling sweet when really they just smell like, well, weed. But this baby \u2014 she\u2019s got berry written all over her beautiful trichome-covered body.  \u000a\u000aThe nugs I got were nice and tender; I could actually FEEL the crystal residue on my fingers after breaking one up. Smoke went down smooth and came up just as sweet. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, one toke in and I decided I didn&#39;t want this reviewing process to become TOO much like work, so fuck it! If you&#39;re lucky enough come across this rare strain in the wild, do yourselves a favour and check it out. \u000a\u000aYou won&#39;t be sorry.

VAwesome strain ... as I right this me and my wife have smoked about 2 grams of snoop dream and it is like the best part of being drunk but without all the regret in the morning it has an awesome aroma and is a pretty decent smoke .... the buds look like there dipped in sugar because of how frosty they are you\u2019ll be surprised at how much it fills up the bottom of your grinder... so all in all probably my favorite strain so far an awesome euphoric and giggley high with a just right body buzz without the munchies or paranoia

This is where you forget about your body, until you notice you feel tingly and fluid. It hit both of us at the same time causing spontaneous laughing. I recommend this for everyone, and anyone who wants to impress an amateur. Snoop definitely didn&#39;t disappoint!!!

VWorld-class. Smells like a diesel truck cracked open in the middle of an Oregon blueberry field after taking out several generations of skunks.\u000a\u000aTastes like fermented blueberries. Hits hard in a good way. Immediate, long-lasting effects. A comfortable indica stoniness combined with the euphoria and creativity of a sativa. This would be good for art, but only if you&#39;re okay with long pauses and brick-wall mental breaks.\u000a\u000aWhat it&#39;s better for is enhancing experiences. Human connection and sensory appreciation. The psychedelic qualities almost resemble micro-doses of mushrooms or LSD. It&#39;s a whirlwind of euphoria, prismatic color saturation, relaxation, pain relief and expanded thought patterns. In my experience, this is a rare quality that I&#39;ve only seen in a handful of strains.\u000a\u000aFrom first impression to experienced use, I&#39;ve been nothing but thrilled with this strain. It helps that its parents are two of my personal favorites (as well as Snoop&#39;s), Blue Dream and OG Kush. You cannot go wrong here. I don&#39;t care who you are.

VPicked up this strain today, was a Friday deal. Unfortunately the taste grown by this farm was horrific. I mean like pencil shavings and assy plastic. Just bad bad bad. The effects however as a marked sativa dominant hybrid were pretty intense. The high was great and euphoric but that taste is hard to come by. Might have to get a second opinion and try a different grower.

VThis medications helps in a lot of different symptoms email for additional information look at my review on leafly.com. This medication has a slight bump to it at the begging but it smooth&#39;s out very quick into a nice mello feeling that you can kick back and relax and watch a movie and be fine or just take a nap for a few minutes if you want to. This has also a sweet taste with a hint of some berry I think maybe blueberry. but it also has a bit of an earthy taste to kind of like pine I think to. It is a nice medication for pain and stress. Whether it actually effects the cancer in anyway, Like stop it , etc, etc . It helps with a lot of cancer side effects as well as treatment side effects this is a great medication to relax so to classify it. I would have to put it as a medicine to use for a night time medication. Night Time Meication:0) oh also my guess for the level to be at around 18%-20%. New user especially should take caution in how much they use right at first keep it down a bit then go for the nice big juicy doses.:0) It&#39;s a Great medications.

VDefinitely a top notch strain.  This strain gives me an upbeat euphoric mood that just makes whatever I&#39;m doing a lot more fun.  Keeps an almost constant grin on my face for an hour after I take a few vape hits.  Also a good strain for interesting conversations.  This is one of the strains that my wife and I try not to run out of.

VI didn&#39;t give Snoop&#39;s Dream a second glance as a shopper. I figured anything with the name &#39;Snoop&#39; was in a weight class of legendary heft, so I stuck to the ethereal weights. \u000a\u000aToday, it&#39;s my go to; my benchmark.  Lovely neighbor shared a pipe of Snd with me and that was it- &quot;I only smoke Sativa&quot; stick up my ass removed. My first experience was instant body happy- like slamming a martini after a hard day at the office- warming, comforting, freeing the inhibitions, loosening the joints, unhinging the mandible. Then all frowns turned upside down- happy head played along in perfect harmony. \u000a\u000aWith these powers combined I WAS Captain Planet. \u000a\u000aThe mojo gets working. Humor, wit, sensuality, awareness, openness, communication, synergism, tolerance. Meanwhile your body feels relaxed yet responsive.

VThis is a strong combinations of two of my favorite strains Blue Dream and Master Kush!\u000aThe Bud Structure. These very lime green looking nugs are small and some medium sized are long and a little phat. Like a tapered cheeto These have a very squishy feel these are fresh the cost of. these nugs at 25% were 15$ a gram.\u000aThe Taste &amp; Smell: Very lime citrus, and sweet eucalyptus blueberry tones with light flavors of pine and lime.\u000aThe Toke: The vapor that comes into my lungs and out are very thin it&#39;s not as thick as Kush or OG&#39;s it&#39;s good because it&#39;s heavy or on par with strong og&#39;s like Grand OG and Wifi OG, or perhaps Deadhead OG. It&#39;s a little woody and cheese still need water, works well if you have a non-alcoholic beverage like a soda or tea, water works to cleanse the pallet though can be boring to some to just drink water your choice.\u000aThe Effect: I feel very relaxed and just dazed, though I can still work. there&#39;s a lot of light streams helps me with my scotopia don&#39;t need sunglasses indoors is liberating! I feel very aroused as if I could cuddle forever. This strain is ideal for those who suffer from insomnia I constantly stay up 24 hours every other day this has helped me keep a working schedule and maintain relationships. Glaucoma, AdHD, Scotopia, Cachexia/ Anorexia, Stress and Depression Helps makes you feel at ease and sleepy.

VSo I smoked a .5g pre roll of Snoop\u2019s Dream and I feel as if I do believe this is how Snoop feels in his dreams. It\u2019s like you are there with him laying in fluffy clouds, and Snoop has like, welcomed you into his home and said \u201ccome in in and get cozy!\u201d But only kinda low key creepy but the good kind I guess &#129335;&#127995;\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u000a\u000aI am tingly af and I feel like I\u2019m melting into my chair at the same time.

VThe packaging says &quot;Refined for ultimate flavor and mind-numbing potency&quot; and it certainly delivers. The smell is a sweet-pine with hints of citrus, which is intoxicating and makes you close your eyes to savor it. It tastes of a very piney and earthy mix but with a distinctive flowery sweetness to it. Shortly after taking a dab, pressure from the back of my eye was relieved, then a cool pain relieving wave washed over my head. As time went on my shoulders relaxed and the rest of my body gradually loosened up. Although this relaxation didn&#39;t come with any sleepiness, but more focus than anything else. This allowed me to get some work done while being very pleasantly medicated. Snoops Dream is perfect for anyone looking to get pain relief (especially headaches) without a sedating effect, particularly students.

VI picked up an eighth of this, grown by Doc Croc. Harvested on 9/18/16, it was consumed on 12/18/16.\u000a\u000aThe buds on this are big, lightly packed, and airy. They&#39;re covered in crystals and orange hairs, and they break down very well. The aroma is sweet, blueberry, and citrus, as is the flavor.\u000a\u000aSnoop&#39;s Dream hits hard and fast, as befits its legendary namesake. You want to take it slow if it&#39;s your first time hitting this one. The high is euphoric, bright, and energetic. It was enough to knock off the last layer of pessimism that was keeping me from really getting in the holiday season.

Take a few big rips at night and easy sleep.

It&#39;s a super happy, laid back chill with a bit of a body high as well, despite the low CBD percentage.  If you come across this strain take a chance, it&#39;s totally worth it!

VI imagine Snoop Dog would dig this. Tasted of pine woods with some light fruity sweetness and a bit of smoke from a campfire. Maybe Snoop could go glamping with it? Within minutes of these thoughts my eyelids were heavy, my body was weak, and I felt like my bed was the best hip-hop club in the world. I&#39;d call that club, &quot;Electric Blanket&quot;. Sleep score of 81%. Strain 15 of 100.

VNot a bad strain. I am someone who prefers an indica dominant hybrid because sativa tends to make me paranoid. Despite this being 60% indica it makes me a little paranoid and that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking to stay away from. The body effects are great and the rest of the head effects are nice.

Energetic.\u000a5. Focused high.\u000a6. Chatty\u000a7. This is a good pot for Moms because it doesn&#39;t knock you out.  I&#39;m not a Mom, but it feels right to say this.

VI picked up some Snoop Master Kush which I think is the same as &quot;Snoop Dream&quot;, at the new Blum in Reno. Buds were light and airy and the smoke was smooth in my Hammer Bubbler. Taste was ok, but really nothing special. The strain can be a day or night, as my sample definitely leans towards the Indica side, but with some heavy Sativa influence. Body and Head High are intense with this one. Being a Indica smoker, I enjoy this strain, and nice sleep follows you within 30 minutes of consumption!!  I like a hit or 2 of Snoop  as a chaser, after dabbing a bit of concentrate:)
