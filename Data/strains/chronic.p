VThere&#39;s a reason that this is the word that they use for really amazing pot. I got some really fine quality buds and they smell like heaven is just around the corner, just out of sight, and then the deep, thick smoke tastes surprisingly lovely with no burn. I&#39;m in heaven. I am straining at the bit to get stuff done, and yet, my body is relaxed and pain-free. Three hits over 5 hours has kept me really happy and busy, although sitting and listening to music is sweet, too. this is going into my regular rotation.

VBest strain i&#39;ve had by far. It hits you quick and doesn&#39;t last that long but has great power for the short high it provides. The buds are very nice looking being a deep green with small orange hairs and coated in white resin. it has effects i&#39;ve never seen before by putting you in a very mellow talkative and giggly state before hunger hits you like a train. After the hunger stage you&#39;ll mellow out and if im comfy i usually just pass out right there. Good daytime strain as you can be productive during the high and since it doesn&#39;t last long you&#39;ll be fine to do things after as well. Also a great late afternoon/nighttime strain as you can relax and sleep like a baby on this chronic

VI thought this strain was amazing! Got it from a buddy that does a full organic soil med grow. He really outdid himself with this batch. In the description i read here on Leafly it talks about proper curing or the scent will be lost. Let me tell you. A couple minutes in my jar I opened and gave a whiff and let out a &quot;ughhhhhh&quot; Sweetest smelling bud ever. Taste description was spot on as well. The best part though was the high. Very balanced seemed a little more on the sativa side though. Great for my anxiety and for headaches. Great morning smoke that I will def be getting some clones of. The plants he had growing in his tent when I picked up my eigth were growing like a straight bush with no topping or fiming to speak of. Can&#39;t wait to grow some myself.

VThe high is great but the throat burning is very off putting. Like I have to mentally prepare myself for putting lava in my throats and I&#39;m not smoking out of blunts or joints either. I pack my roor with ice and super cold water but it only helps so much. All in all super relaxed high not to couch locked not too active. Enough energy to make a sandwich but not to cook food you know?

I never really get anxiety from bud anymore but this one really screwed with me. It got the job done, was very earthy, woody, slightly pungent. Looks like a textbook hybrid... I consider the batch i got High Mids, def not a &quot;go to&quot; strain in my book.

VThe buds are the length of my thumb, and bigger around, and it&#39;s cured nice and sticky, and smokes smooooooth. I love the smell, and the high. What more is there? It&#39;s cheaper than many more I&#39;ve bought and had less satisfaction. I had never heard of Pat&#39;s Pot before, but I asked the bud tender for a great sativa hybrid, with a good body buzz, and she totally delivered. I&#39;m on a road trip next week for more. This is going in a jar for long term, because I am impressed. Dry mouth is the only side effect, and lemonade tasted soooo good with this. I like to stock up on great bud, and be able to compare it to new faves. I think this one is sticking around.

VChronic, is a term used for good around here. Also chron whatever it is, and has always made me paranoid, anxious or akward. Im guessing it&#39;s weed grown only for extremely high thc levels and yields. You can smoke a roach and get retardedly high.  I just don&#39;t like it. Poor people that cant afford hard drugs with no taste will often be smoking this. That or kids who pau $5 for .5 gram. Worst strain i can&#39;t avoid. I hate it.
