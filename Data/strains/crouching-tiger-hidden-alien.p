VVery strong strain. Buds are very dense, appearance isn&#39;t very nice, but smokes like a champ. Felt effects after on hit. Only use when going to stay home all day and relax, and sleep. Good for relieving stress too.

VThis is a strain that is very much Indica, especially from SGOW. The nose on the strain is pungent, almost like a sour yeastie bread. The flavor is pleasant and the effects are immediate.

VCrouching Tiger Hidden Alien, more like &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Gem.&quot; CTHA is a great strain with a name worthy of how strange the high feels. I have been looking forward to trying this strain for 3 years and it has finally fallen into my lap(insert evil laugh).\u000a        CTHA has an aroma that reminds me of dark chocolate or cacao. I really enjoy the strong flowery and herbal tastes I get from this strain, they are very notable with subtle hints of earth. Vaporizing this strain was a real pleasure.\u000a        I have been riding the effects of this strain for four hours, bowl one was vaped around 9pm at 360 degrees. I felt a significant head high with a background body high for a while then they evened out and I was pretty evenly stoned. The second bowl was vaped around 10:30pm at 390 degrees and the body high is definitely not in the background, it is at the forefront of the experience. \u000a      I would recommend this to non indica stoners because it is not a tiring indica, more like a mild relaxer. I have had to big bowls and feel very alert, yet calm. CTHA is an excellent chill pill for an anxious person. So glad I found Crouching Tiger Hidden Alien, such a pleasure to consume.\u000a    P.S. The THC is average from the two numbers given to my as a range from the dispensary.
