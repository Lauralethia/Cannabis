VNot too bad. There&#39;s definitely something different about it that sets it apart from other strain. Nothing like Ive ever really tasted before. It has an almost minty/frost taste to it and tastes quite earthy. Its definitely earned its title.

VGood strain! Definitely feel it in your head physically and mentally. Only complaint is that it gave me a bit of a headache. A good one for euphoria but not so much pain relief.

VI would definitely recommend this strain for writers block. Being a musician I definately hit writers block from time to time with work schedule etc. For body pain relief though it doesnt do too much for me in that sense so that&#39;s why i&#39;m giving it a four, maybe it depends on what form you smoke it in. It is creeper as well. I rolled a ring finger width and got 3 1/4 through and am feeling pretty good, intense cereberal high with a hint of calmness. Pretty baked while writing this just kinda smoked me mid paragraph there. but all in all I love this strain. Not for amateur smokers. actually back to 5 stars body pain is gone.

VReally cool strain. The high is strong but smooth and pleasant. I smoke around 50g/month and this weed is one of the few that still get me high. I don&#39;t recommend this strain for beginners since you can feel a bit paranoid or dizzy.\u000aOtherwise, the taste is fresh and a bit fruity.  It&#39;s definitely a good weed to smoke after work or while chilling with friends !\u000aEvanzyker&#39;s hint: If sativa strains already make you anxious, avoid this strain. Else, try it with friends, it&#39;s not so good alone.

VThis has probably been one of my least favorite strains in terms of harshness and bad taste of the smoke. \u000aThe buds I got were starting to get a little dry to me so this could be why it was unenjoyable.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve been smoking daily and this one is the only strain that makes me cough and leaves me with a sore/dry throat.\u000awhen inhaling it, the smoke is so harsh along with a bad chemical/pine/diesel taste that lingers.  \u000a\u000aI do feel tingly and happy with this but I&#39;m going to start mixing it with another strain to counteract the harshness. \u000a\u000aIf I had the choice to get this again, I&#39;d most likely pick something else.

VI am very pleased to be back from the hospital after a bad seizure, but I recover quicker than most due to my huge circle of friends that grow the kindest strains and each crop to come off I get a good sample package all ready to vapourize.  Such is my arrival and in the mailbox a familiar box appeared.  \u000a\u000aIce Wreck is a kind and very tasted blend of Ice x Trainwreck that I find to have the very family taste of Trainwreck that I first had 15 years back from a Georgia relative who had gifted me with the very first taste of her.\u000a\u000aI have a penchant for earthy strains like this with pleasant citrus overtones and with Ice parents being a quad cross of all of my favorited strains Afghani, Shiva, Skunk, and White Widow.  I am very closed now to introduce this ripper to my garden, forthwith !

VPretty gnarly strain. It literally put me on my ass. I have been smoking for almost ten years( being a regular smoker for 7 ) and I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to newbs. Lots of getting stuck in my head. I give it four stars because the taste is not bad and it&#39;s the best sleep I have had in a while. Cheers &#128164;.

VI&#39;m a quarter a day for the last 20 years, I use it for bipolar, ptsd, and anxiety disorder. This stuff was very very weak. Maybe it just isn&#39;t a good batch but this is from where I get the best stuff so not sure. My tolerance is higher than almost anyone&#39;s, so there&#39;s that too but I found little to no relief for my particular conditions.

VThis is a really great strain, but if you have bad anxiety you may want to think twice about it. It made me very happy and giggly. It felt like it opened up my mind whilst still allowing my to relax.. Unfortunately it also made my anxiety 10x worse. My fianc&#233; had no negative side effects, whilst I had the worst anxiety attack of my life because he changed the shower water temperature on me. It didn&#39;t happen right away but took about 7 days to hit that level.

Vi dont like to be high in my head. And this stran is very comfortable, although i smoked half a medium sized hand rolled joint. my body is completly relaxed. i have a pinched nerve in my neck and there is little pain right now. I just want to be watching TV. And the head high  ( for me ) is functional.

VThis strain reminds me of smoking by a campfire. As my first courier delivery I was not disappointed in the quality! Wonderful body high is almost immediate. Pains start to melt away, even the stubborn sciatica. At the beginning of the joint there was a lot of coughing but seems to be pretty smooth overall. It\u2019s winter outside, but the cold doesn\u2019t bother me after about half of this half-gram joint! Up there with my favourite hybrids!!

VIce Wreck, by Crop King Seeds is a cross between Trainwreck and Ice, making an exceptional knockout strain for any time of the day.\u000a\u000aIce Wreck is a perfect 50/50 hybrid, providing full on body effects with the accompanying head high.\u000a\u000aThis strain tastes great in a vaporizer and smells great as well.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain to any patients with chronic pain or amnesia, but will impress anyone who gives it a try!

VIm currently glued to the couch as i sit here not even wanting to go to the fridge for food...and reviewing during the high.\u000a\u000a  I smoked a medium filled zig zag (didnt weigh it). Im feeling good but still lucid enough to write about it.   The taste is citrusy and woodsy.  This bud is stanky so if you dont want your environment smelling like that put it in a jar.
