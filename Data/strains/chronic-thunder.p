VBest strain of 2015 IMO. One of the very strongest, at ~34% when first sampled. Despite the potency, it is a well-balanced strain. Taste/smell are neither unpleasant nor anything to write home about. \u000a\u000aAfter I sampled this strain I immediately bought the rest of the Benson dispensary&#39;s 2 ounce supply. This bud is better than it looks, and has a slightly pungent/chemical undertone. I will say that it is the best all-around medical strain I&#39;ve tried. The ultimate jack-of-all-trades. G.I. issues, stress, depression, nausea, insomnia, pain; say goodbye.\u000a\u000aOne of my top 5 (at least top 10) desert island grows. Feels Indica dominant, and a great after work smoke, but won&#39;t put you out on weekends like say Hash Plant or Afghani. I don&#39;t recommend smoking more than a small toke if you need to appear sober within 4 hours. Solid A. There are better lookers, and smoother smokers, but this is the closest thing to a grand slam I&#39;ve jammed. \u000a\u000aThere are better strains for depression, energy, and creativity, but nothing better for nausea, muscle pain, or G.I. distress. \u000a\u000aLet Chronic Thundertheighs take your pain away...today!

VHANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE INDICA!!! This strain is a very hard hitter for me.. I pick it up every time my local dispensary has it in.. It does the job 10 fold... I highly recommend this strain but be aware it hits hard... Not to sure it most feel the effects the way I do.. But I love it... \u000a

VThis is my favorite indica. I have had many, and nothing compares to the way this thing hits you. It&#39;s something you take when you want to feel\u000agood before you&#39;re knocked out. Though the effects are powerful and give you a great high, my favorite part about this strain is that it doesn&#39;t taste like your typical indica. It&#39;s spicy, stinky, and stays on your tongue... definitely one of the most unique tastes out there. Try this at night; you won&#39;t regret it!

V10 star rating from me. CT is my favorite strain. I&#39;ve tried many others for my conditions and nothing works quite as well for all of them. CT is a well rounded strain as it helps me with anxiety, depression, pain, and best of all - sleep! I had insomnia for 16 months then finally after staying chronic thunder I sleep through the night and feel relief! highly recommended. I make Cannabis oil out of it and add it to my chamomile at night for added effects.

VI love ATF so I knew I was gonna like this strain and I got ready because I read the reviews. Netflix binge planned some tasty snacks and fuuuuuuuuck me running did this bud kick my ass! I took two good rip outta my bong and I am sure I cannot tell you one detail about anything that was on the tv and I cleared my pantry out. Like a human garbage disposal I felt so bad but I wasn\u2019t stopping that\u2019s for sure. I took a couple little naps and woke up feeling very refreshed and amazing smoked a little sativa and went out and had a great night! I\u2019m just hear to say thank Chronic Thunder for providing me an amazing high and leading me down the path of a stellar night!

VIt was a nice color purple accented buds, and it worked &quot;Ok&quot; for my back pain, it was great for appetite and great fir sleep but the effects and high wore off very quickly and the batch Intried was very dry and bottom of the jar. So I&#39;d like to try the new stuff. My only issue is the short legs of the high and it looked prettier than it smoked so for once a 4/5 for this strain.

VThank you all for your feedback which gave me willngness to give it a go.   usually like to know the THC/CBD % and I/S%, since I do not like THC over 10%.  The THC must be low, based on my physical sensations I experience in the back of my head, like a pressure band, which with this strain is very slight.  I really like the body buzz experience and the relaxation that comes with it.  This would be great in a concentrate form (shatter).  If Barney&#39;s Farms is paying attention please get more of this strain down to Long Beach, CA area.

VGrew this out about a year ago, been smoking it now and then since. From a grow side of things I would recommend this to anyone looking for a plant that is extremely easy to grow and get a nice yield from, but that is all I can really say positive about it. I would NOT recommend this strain to anyone intending to smoke it frequently. Very flat lethargic \u000ahigh. No euphoria or creativity, just an overwhelming lack of motivation.
