VHeavy stuff.  A bowl shared with my babe left me totally relaxed and couchlocked, he was off in the kitchen rummaging for munchies.  Great auditory supplementation, perfect for lazy days listening to music or watching a good movie.  Decent head change accompanies the body high.  Will cause a bit of a headache if you&#39;re greedy though!

VMy new favorite. Burkle is awesomeness. With pre 98 bubba x grandaddy purple you can&#39;t go wrong. Very happy relaxing high that will put your ass to sleep. The smell and taste are amazing and the high is second to none. Very good pain relief as well. It helped my crohn&#39;s and back pain immensely. Made me sleep like a baby.

VI would have never guessed this was indica because it keeps me so awake and focused. The first time I used this strain, I cleaned my entire house. And that says a lot because I&#39;m extremely lazy.
