VBeautiful strain. GSC plus WW made a baby out of this world. The taste is great. High is definitely worth talking about. Best way to describe it for me would be laying in the country, under the star filled sky, with no worries. You can count on this strain to numb your mind, without the sleepiness.

VStarts out very in your head, like a true sativa (others have said it starts like it&#39;s parent, white widow, but i haven&#39;t tried that so i don&#39;t have that reference point). After a while the indica high begins to set in, making for a very relaxing somewhat sedative body high. For me, I was awake and giggly. My boyfriend however knocked out after a while of the body high. It made me feel, like most indica/high myrcene strains, it gives me a laggy feeling. So I feel my body doing something but it takes time for my brain to catch up and feel it. It&#39;s weird to explain but it happens to me a lot. Not quite couch lock, but a definite sloth-like effect. \u000aCons: dry mouth, slow motion effect, nausea

VSo I picked up a bug run batch of white cookies from dab society that was on sale. Best oil I have got to date, giving a great profile of the strain. The oil has a very strong sweet odor with some very tell-tales white widow smells. My oil was definitely leaning toward the GSC phenotype. The taste from this oil was remarkably clean, with a sweet vanilla sugar cookie taste leading to a very pungent, hazy finish. No harshness, no residual solvents. The high was sedating, however I can&#39;t tell if this was the strain or the 1/4 gram of terpy goodness that I couldn&#39;t stop dabbing. With the sedating effects, and uplifting feeling and bubbly mood made an impression on me. Would highly recommend based on my experience.

VWhite cookies is a great strain for pain relief and depression. I picked up a gram by dab society and didn&#39;t regret it. The smell has a sweet sugar cookie impression that finishes with a hazy, white widow note. Couldn&#39;t have been more impressed with the first terpy, sweet dab I took. After about 1/4 of my gram was gone I could really feel the uplifting and sedating effects (like... really). Overall would recommend, especially those looking for a great premium extract.

VBecause the dispensary was out of White Widow I was directed by the B.T. to Wco. I smoked it immediately, due to pain, upon returning home and found it to be tasty and at first much like WW though 20 minutes or so in it morphed into a relaxing body high following into a munchies fest. It was decent and long lasting but not as good for pain as WW or many other strains I have used. Would I get it again? Probably not if WW was available. I am convinced that the brain wave to marry up two of the more popular strains was a waste of time and... well... an unfortunate mistake!
