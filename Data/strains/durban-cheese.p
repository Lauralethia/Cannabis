VI\u2019m a heavy smoker and I use Durban Cheese for my morning wake and bake or a mid day pick me up. It doesn\u2019t hit me heavy like some other hybrid strains. True to its name which pays homage to its lineage. You get the relaxing effects of the Cheese with the euphoria of the Durban Poison. I prefer each plant by themselves, but Durban Cheese is good for cooking or folding laundry.

VThis bud is light green and airy in appearance. Has a really nice lemon citrus smell with an undertone if smokey cheese. Flowers are sparse in growing structure, giving it a soft feel to the touch and a nondusty crumble. Smoked in a bowl, Durban Cheese has a pleasant earthy taste with a natural lemon finish. Don\u2019t expect to get big high unless it\u2019s your wake and bake option. Ideal for cleaning laundry, walking the dog and conversations. Takes the edge off without leaving you silly.

VFor me, this strain is more of a strictly medical and not so much enjoyment strain. \u000a\u000aI have smoked this several times when I was just trying to chill and enjoy the day and it didn&#39;t really blow my mind. It didn&#39;t calm me down and wasn&#39;t ridiculously uplifting so I looked at it as a waste. \u000a\u000aHOWEVER. Now that I&#39;m laid up in bed, my uterus is waging war on my body (consider yourselves lucky men), I&#39;m nauseous and feeling like crap, Durban Cheese has definitely proven itself. \u000a\u000aI stuck this in the vape and had a few draws and my pain and nausea almost instantly subsided, I&#39;m even ready for some food now. Thanks Durban Cheese!

VWhere do I even start... This strain has provided me with the most powerful and effective pain relief of almost any strain I&#39;ve ever used. It was not what I was expecting yet it was everything I wanted, needed and more... After one puff I had approximately 25% reduction in migraine... Halfway through the joint I felt almost brand new again after two full days of struggling with this awful headache. If you can get your hands on some of this beautiful medicine from BC you would be so happy to have it in times of extreme pain. Did I mention the terpene combination is divine...? If you can get your hands on some you will be very happy that you did!

VI don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been happier than when on this strain. As soon as I realized the bud actually smelled like cheese I didn&#39;t stop laughing for a good hour and a half, which pissed off my friends. I did smoke a very large quantity compared to them, which would explain the more extreme high, but no regrets, this was an amazing experience. Didn&#39;t get anxious once during the high and had no bad thoughts.
