VLemon D. brings on a nice strong floaty buzz that lasts a couple of hours. It is great for relieving pain and depression. The effects are not overwhelming but strong enough to always remind you that you&#39;re well medicated.

VThis may be one of the best strains I&#39;ve ever smoked. The effects took about 15 minutes to kick in but after that it lasted for several hysterically laugh filled hours. It causes a little bit of the munchies but it&#39;s mostly dry eyes and mouth. It&#39;s definitely great to get your mind off things and relieve stress.

VOne of my favorite strains for when i work...and play. that cant be said for a lot of strains. I blaze through assignments, extremely focused, energetic. This could win over some tobacco fans. \u000a\u000aWhen listening to music its more pleasurable, colors pop when gaming. Just a really solid strain that i think helps define Sativa.

VLemon Diesel really surprised me with its strong sativa attributes.  It&#39;s not an instant high as with other strains but after 5 minutes it kicks in with a long lasting focused type of high to a mellow high to balance  out the intense sativa.  I noticed that with just a little weed in a bong or glass pipe goes a long way. The smoke is thick and concentrated.  Sweet lemon sticks to your tongue with other subtle citrus flavors.

V4.5/5\u000aGot this in a big batch. Didn&#39;t think much until i took my LED light to it and saw all the beautiful colors. Purples, lime and orange all around these round nugget-like buds. Lemon pledge smell to the buds but when ground up give the distinct smell of haze and hash, or &quot;Diesel&quot;. I find this strain is a Reverse creeper, Immediate head pressure and couch-lock after a bowl, but give it 30 minutes and you&#39;ll have the energy to get things done! I do not recommend it for pain (I found myself having to do a CBD dab every so often today since i usually try one strain the whole day for a review) but daytime use for anxiety or ADHD is what this strain seems to reign supreme for.

VNew favorite sativa! way higher thc content (28.7%) than the description here, and my supplier did call it lemon sour diesel, so I&#39;m thinking that it is probably a different strain with a similar name... it reminds me of a lemon haze, but has that sour diesel look and undertone in the smell/taste... Amazingly fast hitting sativa &#39;cup of coffee&#39; feeling, beautiful buds, great taste... highly recommended for anyone looking for an energy boost... novice smokers take caution.

VI really enjoy this strain and would definitely buy it again. Lets start with flavor: The diesel definitely overpowers the citrus in my book . I definitely get a diesel taste followed by a &quot;dirty&quot; diesel/earthy aftertaste and not much sweet/citrus flavor. Not bad at all even though it may sound that way, just not lemon in my opinion. \u000a\u000aThe fragrance of the bud is definitely fruity- I&#39;m smelling fruit punch infused with citrus (Orange? Tangerine?) Yes, there is a citrus note in there, but it doesn&#39;t come across as lemon to me. \u000a\u000aThe smoke is smooth and easy on the inhale and exhale. Of course, this also has a lot to do with the way it was grown. Lots of nutes and no flushing will create a harsher smoke. My stash was grown organically with as few nutes as possible. Which leads us to the next category . . . \u000a\u000aGrowing was a breeze, so I was told. Plants were healthy, branches were thick and the buds were very big and sticky. It required very little nutes or care and took to SCROG extremely well. The leaf to calyx ratio was decent. The outdoor grow was not bothered with mold and the mites were easy to eradicate. What mite doesn&#39;t love weed? It&#39;s the only thing mites and I have in common!\u000a\u000aMy experiences smoking lemon diesel flowers have been nothing but pleasurable. Lovely mix of cerebral and body high without couch lock or paranoia. I can function well enough after smoking this with one exception: The other day I gathered up the kief and smoked it from my water pipe. I wasn&#39;t expecting the resulting high: VERY pleasurable cerebral and body effects that left me damn near couch locked for about two hours while listening to classic rock. Oh man, what a great and unexpected experience that was! Seriously, get yourself some Lemon D kief and pop it in your bong or water pipe. You won&#39;t regret it.

Still very pleasant. Body high what I needed to get my day started; even if I was slowed down a bit. Maybe getting sick as well. :-( Sweet lemony/skunk taste; very nice.

(More beautiful than other buds) I highly recommend listening to music and watching some awesome videos while high on Lemon Diesel. It&#39;s both a mental and a physical buzz. The buzz length is almost 3h 30, which is amazing. When I took Lemon Diesel for the first time, I just didn&#39;t feel pain at all. I ended up with little injuries the next day. So don\u2019t put yourself in dangerous situations! Try it now, it\u2019s worth it.

VI have mixed feelings on this strain. It is super strong, probably the strongest stuff I&#39;ve smoked to date - no joke, one or two decent rips lasts me a solid two and a half to three hours. That being said, this isn&#39;t a strain meant for treating anxiety, because I smoked this while stressed and it cranked my anxiety up to eleven. It&#39;s fun if you&#39;re already in a good mood, but go for a different strain to relieve anxiety.

VNot very strong at all by itself. Smoke a full bowl and felt nothing, HOWEVER if you live on the West Coast, go pick up some Charlie Sheen. It&#39;s an Indica. Smoke a bowl of it after smoking a bowl of the Lemon Diesel and you will feel incredibly relaxed, memories of your childhood will flood your emotions. Smells are much stronger. Very good mixed together, I would bet. So, if you have some Lemon D, get some Charlie S when it&#39;s available and you&#39;re in for a very good night. Not good for insomnia, though unless you want dreams all night.

VWhile I\u2019ve had a good time with this strain during the day (a fun wake n bake to go all out with!), I mostly prefer it at night after I am home from work or in for the night. I always enjoy its very relaxing, yet not overwhelmingly sedating effects. I tell ya, it gives me an extra level of a light, slightly energetic curiosity when it comes to watching movies and TV or reading books\u2014for me these are great ways to unwind from a hectic, never-sat-down-all-day type of day.\u000a\u000aOne night, I had maybe a little too much fun (oops...after an undocumented number of hits past \u201csuper-stoned\u201d)...I began pretending I was a scholarly philosopher with all the secrets to a happy life. It drove me to write down notes about making some positive changes to my everyday life. Tbh I really wished I had a feather pen to dip in some ink, whilst sitting by a lantern at a desk...but really I was just sitting on the couch...lmao...\u000a\u000aReading those notes sober is funny at times, but does make me realIze the high version of me has it exactly right: stress over petty things, paired with self-doubt and anxiousness over the way I am, is recipe for unhappiness and isn\u2019t the way I want to live life.\u000a\u000aAnother bonus is that I get a great night\u2019s sleep after my curiosity settles, and I can peacefully drift off! Always wake up without feeling groggy or gross, which is nice.\u000a\u000aSmoking Lemon Diesel helps me let the little worries go, and at the same time drives me be proactive and realistic about my life.

VFantastic strain for all times. I first brought 2 grams of Lemon Diesel about a week ago and was skeptical due to the very boring nature of strains where I live.  First thing I noticed was the oddly &#39;gassy&#39; smell which seems to blend in the cosmic heavens with a sweet lemon aroma. Mad. The buds themselves were nicely dense with dark green almost purple short leafeage and were very sticky to the touch, only experiencing this with the all too common cheese strains. The bud ground up nicely to a dark green sticky mass. The effects of this strain I can only liken to that of a cup of tea; perfect for all and any time. The first highs with this strain seemed to provide a very mellow, euphoric body sensation almost made for lying down and watching documentaries. The cerebral high was very &#39;hazy&#39; with the ability to lose oneself to the rabbit hole of the mind thus almost needing something to distract the inevitable deep introspective thinking (which we all need once in a while).The glorious sativa effects which come too rarely around here are also very noticeable, getting up at 1am and spending 15 minutes preparing noodles from many cookbook is the sign of a active sativa out in the streets working 9 til 5. A few days later after a day of heavy stoning  (Blue Cheese was on the menu for this smoke up) I decided to roll what was left of my Lemon Diesel. Smoking this at 2am just before bed provided one of the most intense body highs I have come across yet and to date one of the most fantastic beddy Js I&#39;ve smoked. It felt as if I was on a merry-go-round but lying flat at the same time with a wave of a massage like pressure flowing through my body. Simultaneously I genuinely grew paranoid of a black hole being in the my room and enveloping the side of my body in to it...Nonetheless, Lemon Dieasel is now one of my personal favourites due to its lack of day/night time knowledge and providing a nice mix of sativa and indica effects whilst still managing not to be too intense (other than black hole feelings on the verge of sleep). 10/10 would buy again and can&#39;t imagine this strain of it was grown well. Legalise the ting!

Vi&#39;m from an older school of smoking when it was more common to find a, &quot;creeper,&quot; alas, it&#39;s here in this lovely hybrid. i did take it slow since i did read that in other reviews, and the high is very comfortable. i feel lucid yet relaxed. i could spend hours talking or watching something to an endeavor. well rounded, but heavier smokers might want to skip as it seems the strength is less that a lot of common strains. oh, beautiful bud structure too. enjoy this well rounded and subtle flavored treat.

VEasily one of my favorite strains. It feels almost psychedelic. Immediately, I became more aware and appreciative of my surroundings- the way the light danced off of the glass, the intricate cracks in the paint, the hidden spiderweb in the corner of the awning.  Similar to green crack but much more clear headed and energetic. Yet, very mellow and great for my anxiety. Nearly zero body high. Great strain for creativity. Found myself lost in a book for an hour longer than I intended.

VNot very strong at all by itself. Smoke a full bowl and felt nothing, HOWEVER if you live on the West Coast, go pick up some Charlie Sheen. It&#39;s an Indica. Smoke a bowl of it after smoking a bowl of the Lemon Diesel and you will feel incredibly relaxed, memories of your childhood will flood your emotions. Smells are much stronger. Very good mixed together, I would bet. So, if you have some Lemon D, get some Charlie S when it&#39;s available and you&#39;re in for a very good night. Not good for insomnia, though unless you want dreams all night.

VPhysical sensations like being too hot or cold outside become interesting instead of unpleasant. Pretty uplifting and sometimes smiley and makes things more fun. I have slightly less procrastination than when sober but can convince myself to get shit done on this strain. Easy to direct your mind to fixate but it was difficult to read a book. I read verrryyyy slowly. No dyslexia like on other strains, though. Comedown is sometimes rough. My impatient inner child comes out and it&#39;s often not pretty... that wears off quickly but it was really unexpected the first few times I had this.

VSmoked this hoping it would really energize me so I could get things done but I have a bit of a cold so I&#39;m just ok. This pre-roll burned evenly but it did a weird thing where the paper only burned on one side so it turned into a little trough of ash lol. Unfortunately I can&#39;t really taste it cuz of the cold but I managed to do a little meditation and yoga before I gave up on chores and just looked for articles online to send to my racist grandparents. This strain is supposed to be pretty good at beating depression so I&#39;d be interested in smoking a bowl of this instead of this joint but it&#39;s not bad! Paranoia level: 1/10.

Imedz, specifically. this cut came from a grower who is obviously more concerned about quality vs. quantity. the looks, the smell, the high were all superb. i give this cut of this strain a solid 10/10. it kind of doesn&#39;t smell like weed, but more like a pungent sweet lemon peel/zest with sugary piney overtones and a subtle hint of skunk. the taste is exactly how it smells, and will go fabulous in a joint. i get really excited when i smoke this, it definitely triggers something. this cut of lemon diesel has me feeling things iv&#39;e never felt when smoking cannabis. i got a sort of butterflies in the stomach giddy childish excitement that flared as i started to peak, and i was intently focused on editing my shot of the strain found in the image gallery (you&#39;ll know it when you see it) definitely good for depression, anxiety, and social problems, a go-getter if you will. a potent strain for sure. i took a sample hit (75mg/.075g)  since i had work soon, and prefer to work when im not blazed. a buzz is alright, but i like to stay focused, so a simple little hitter will keep me grounded with my head straight and clear. this cut was super clean, really amazing quality of high, it has a crispness to it that sets it apart from other strains as well as some physical attributes, like the &#39;butterflies&#39;. smoking this cut was definitely an experience, rather than just another medicating session. it was something new to be admired. \u000a\u000aanyway, the cut i picked up is super solid, this grower is champ at what he does, super clean, 100% organic, smelly, tasty, the high was perfection. maybe not this strain, but this cut of this strain is def in my top 10, maybe top 5. \u000a\u000aLOOKS 10/10 (grower doesnt touch the buds with his hands... trim job is perfection) \u000aSMELL 10/10 best smelling batch iv&#39;e ever smelled. has that &#39;the power of pine sol, baby&#39; effect.\u000aBUZZ 10/10\u000aBUZZ LENGTH: 2-3 hours\u000a\u000a10/10

VLemon Diesel isnt as pungent as other strains. The taste is definitely one of citrus. I smoked this in a joint and found it very smooth. The buzz was a bit of a creeper fortunetly.  At first I found it weak, but with 15 mins had a rather nice buzz. It must be noted that I&#39;m a heavy cannabis consumer. I found this strain had a nice head buzz you could feel within a few minutes that also increased for the first 10-15 mins. All in all a good strain for a buzz. If you&#39;re a heavy consumer don&#39;t expect this lemon to knock your socks off. It will however provide an enjoyable feeling. Stay lifted friends.

Vnumber 1 strain for adrenaline style or outdoor activities.  i am a much better and more fluid rider on my mtn bike, snowboard or skis.  its such a clear high that you forgot you are high.  very good for wrapping your head around learning a new trick or hitting bigger jumps.  i feel enhanced in every way and my stamina and pain tolerance is sky high.  i no longer drink coffee thanks to this strain.  good for yoga or stretching and music sounds great.  very audible strain as i notice every little sound in my surroundings.  very dry and red eyes is the only down side and who cares with such a perfect energizing smoke.  amazing punchy lemon flavor and a small trace of fuel and something else that i describe as burnt cedar.  love this strain!

VThis review is on Lemon Diesel live resin by Dirty Arm Farm out of Oregon. \u000a\u000aThere&#39;s a few things I could complain about with the company but I wont I&#39;ll just review the strain it&#39;s self.  The concentrated version of this strain was pretty great!  Of course it was mad flavorful like lemon candy, not so much diesely but yeah wonderful.  The high surprised me though and was my favorite thing about this product.  My experience was extremely balanced.  Dabs often knock me out or give me anxiety if they&#39;re too indica or sativa dominant but I had none of those side effects.  I could rip large dabs of this and function pretty well, it relaxed me so well without causing any lethargy.  Did wonders for my mood as well.  Anyway made for a great concentrate.  9/10

Vi&#39;m from an older school of smoking when it was more common to find a, &quot;creeper,&quot; alas, it&#39;s here in this lovely hybrid. i did take it slow since i did read that in other reviews, and the high is very comfortable. i feel lucid yet relaxed. i could spend hours talking or watching something to an endeavor. well rounded, but heavier smokers might want to skip as it seems the strength is less that a lot of common strains. oh, beautiful bud structure too. enjoy this well rounded and subtle flavored treat.

VDisclaimer up front, I am just smoking again for the first time since high school (30 years).  So I have virtually no tolerance built up.\u000a\u000aThe effects of this can be be felt nearly immediately when smoking and then build to a peak at about 20 to 30 minutes.  The high can be pretty intense if you get enough of it, for me it could leave me on the edge of being functional and made me super aroused.  The effects would linger for several hours with occasional flashes of a buzz the next day.  That part was a little concerning as I was at work and being altered at all is a bad thing for me while working.  So I had to be careful when I lit up so if the effects lingered longer than expected I wouldn&#39;t get in a bad situation.\u000a\u000aThe smoke was a bit harsh on the throat, and it would leave me a little bit anxious.  Had it been smoother I would give it a fifth star.\u000a\u000aI definitely will keep some of this around cause over all, it is a pretty fun ride

Vi tried this strain yesterday and it was my first time smoking weed in 2 years when i only started trying it to begin with.\u000a \u000aThe bud had a very pungent lemon and diesel smell but when i smoked it from a bong the experience was so much different from what i tried previously and not long after i got so high that my eyes went bright red and felt very heavy.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed it but i smoked (0.2g - 0.3g) for my first time in a homemade bong and it was really relaxing and the effects were so strong on me that i began to see tracers and mild visual effects so i would suggest that anyone trying this for the first time should only start with a modest amount unless you are comfortable with the effects since i found it to be really harsh on the throat but there is no doubt that this is a high quality strain and for the most-part it was an enjoyable high but it was a lot to handle for a near first time experience.

VThis strain left me so happy!! A fresh feeling from smoking it in a sesh with two of my friends. Helped ease my bad mood for sure. I would recommend this strain for anyone who is going through rough times, or just a hard day. Cannabis Re-Leaf in Salem OR has it on special looks like for $4 per gram.

VJust finished my first blaze with a Lemon strain, and it is a interesting high. I loved the sour, citrus taste. I ate an orange and the citrus taste was thru the roof! Did some light stretching, this would be a great yoga smoke. I&#39;m guessing this hybrid is sativa dominant. Helped a little with pain, I was very attentive. \u000a

VA nicely balanced hybrid. The buds are dense and bright lime green with dark orange calyxes. The cut I had was really solid. The smell is skunky and piney. The taste was citrusy and a little fuely. The flavors were mild and smooth. Great strain for those who like a nice old school flavor. The effects were almost immediate and pretty damn intense. There was an initial rush to the head that made the back of my head buzz a bit, and then relaxed my neck and shoulders. It settled into a nice euphoria. Really good for tension and stress relief.

VThis strain is great for getting things done. As soon as I hit my bong I got a rush of energy and was feeling very happy about life. I always start off slow when trying new strains because I don&#39;t like the paranoia that you can sometimes get. I didn&#39;t experience any sort of paranoia or anxiety but I can see how it can kick in if you over do it. I may have gotten slight dry eyes and cotton mouth but I don&#39;t really remember so keep water on hand just in case. I highly recommend this strain for anyone with depression or needing a motivation boost

VGotta say I am smiling pretty huge as I type here hahaha. Great strain for anxiety. I have generalized anxiety and also smoke for muscle spasms and neither are effecting me at the present time. Smells like the name sour lemon sexiness. Smells like Super lemon Haze had a baby with NYC sour diesel though neither of the strains are involved here. Tastes like an earthy diesel fuel with a hint of lemons on the inhale and sage on the exhale. Slow coming onset brings both head and body cloud wrap and euphoria abounds. For sure a great addition to any garden or nug jar.

VDestroys depression. Good choice if you are going through some rough times. Made edibles and the lemon flavor is noticible through the chocolate which is kinda neat. Must have some anti-inflammatory properties because the tinnitus from my Menieres disease is less noticible the the following day.

VReally impressed with Lemon Diesel. Highly creative strain, euphoric, some energy, but with a decent body high. If you smoke too much, there is a haze type effect. Love brainstorming on this, but need to keep pen and paper close by or the thoughts will fleet quickly. However, not a great &quot;working&quot; creative strain for something like writing (although great for ideas). Difficult to focus on the task at hand without creative juices taking over...at least for me. I work better on Jack Herer, but more ideas come more on Lemon Diesel. Also, a good strain for music.

Seems like you can hear ever bug moving in the woods and everything looks like heaven. A real uplifting high and it&#39;s good for people with anxiety issues since you are always in control of your thoughts and actions still. I also have adhd and it helped me with that too. Lastly I could eat really well right after smoking.

It doesnt have a really strong lemon taste but its there with an earthy taste as well. Very relaxing strong high and im a daily shatter and distilate smoker. Definetly a must try even if you love indicas only try it. Strong head high nice body high definetly medicated. If you have anxiety or pain i wouldnt smoke any other strain it truly is that medicinal.

Vi tried this strain yesterday and it was my first time smoking weed in 2 years when i only started trying it to begin with.\u000a \u000aThe bud had a very pungent lemon and diesel smell but when i smoked it from a bong the experience was so much different from what i tried previously and not long after i got so high that my eyes went bright red and felt very heavy.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed it but i smoked (0.2g - 0.3g) for my first time in a homemade bong and it was really relaxing and the effects were so strong on me that i began to see tracers and mild visual effects so i would suggest that anyone trying this for the first time should only start with a modest amount unless you are comfortable with the effects since i found it to be really harsh on the throat but there is no doubt that this is a high quality strain and for the most-part it was an enjoyable high but it was a lot to handle for a near first time experience.

Very calm, relaxing high, best for evening use as you are guaranteed heavy eyelids about 30 minutes after smoking. Great sleep after, I use for insomnia.

VThis strain is great for getting things done. As soon as I hit my bong I got a rush of energy and was feeling very happy about life. I always start off slow when trying new strains because I don&#39;t like the paranoia that you can sometimes get. I didn&#39;t experience any sort of paranoia or anxiety but I can see how it can kick in if you over do it. I may have gotten slight dry eyes and cotton mouth but I don&#39;t really remember so keep water on hand just in case. I highly recommend this strain for anyone with depression or needing a motivation boost

VJust finished my first blaze with a Lemon strain, and it is a interesting high. I loved the sour, citrus taste. I ate an orange and the citrus taste was thru the roof! Did some light stretching, this would be a great yoga smoke. I&#39;m guessing this hybrid is sativa dominant. Helped a little with pain, I was very attentive. \u000a

VDisclaimer up front, I am just smoking again for the first time since high school (30 years).  So I have virtually no tolerance built up.\u000a\u000aThe effects of this can be be felt nearly immediately when smoking and then build to a peak at about 20 to 30 minutes.  The high can be pretty intense if you get enough of it, for me it could leave me on the edge of being functional and made me super aroused.  The effects would linger for several hours with occasional flashes of a buzz the next day.  That part was a little concerning as I was at work and being altered at all is a bad thing for me while working.  So I had to be careful when I lit up so if the effects lingered longer than expected I wouldn&#39;t get in a bad situation.\u000a\u000aThe smoke was a bit harsh on the throat, and it would leave me a little bit anxious.  Had it been smoother I would give it a fifth star.\u000a\u000aI definitely will keep some of this around cause over all, it is a pretty fun ride

VVery FUN strain. Very good but definitely have had better. Takes like 5-10 mins for effects to kick in. Very easy to talk to people you wouldn&#39;t want to run into after smoking. Pros were that it was dry sticking and not harsh on the lungs even smoking a blunt. Happy hungry sleepy. Smells FANTASTIC. Cons were that after sharing a fat blunt with three people the effects wore off after about an hour. Burned pretty quickly. I would buy it again but not my first choice. Overall enjoyable experience and would recommend smoking with a bunch of buds before going out.

VThis stuff is good... but it&#39;s sativa dominant. If you suffer from anxiety start slow... small amounts. I like it but I had to use a lot less than I normal do. Good for a &quot;binge clean your house day&quot;. It&#39;s non stop go go go. Smells like lemons. Literally. I couldn&#39;t believe it when I opened the bag lol. Citrus. Lemon. Just weird compared to the skunk we are used to. Definately one of my morning day off kind of highs.

VA nicely balanced hybrid. The buds are dense and bright lime green with dark orange calyxes. The cut I had was really solid. The smell is skunky and piney. The taste was citrusy and a little fuely. The flavors were mild and smooth. Great strain for those who like a nice old school flavor. The effects were almost immediate and pretty damn intense. There was an initial rush to the head that made the back of my head buzz a bit, and then relaxed my neck and shoulders. It settled into a nice euphoria. Really good for tension and stress relief.

I would recommend this strain for anyone who is going through rough times, or just a hard day. Cannabis Re-Leaf in Salem OR has it on special looks like for $4 per gram.

VVery potent strain, if smoked right. I don&#39;t know if it is the combination of cannibinoids or what, but my friends and I seperately noticed that you have to hold in the smoke longer to get an effective high. If you fail to do so, it may seem very weak, however, if you hold it in longer than normal, it is actually a rather strong strain, even relatively speaking.\u000a\u000aDominantly sativa, gives a cerebral high, however at higher doses it does begin to place weight on the body and cause you to want to relax, and, if you are already tired, sleep.

VGrabbed a 8th from my usual connection. Good looking buds and had the &quot;potential&quot; to be potent in scent but was only midly lemony with pine undertones. Smooth hits though. I had a pretty killer headache before smoking and after a few bowls in a few hours, I can&#39;t really recall my headache anymore. Got a nice mindset going. I&#39;m a bigger fan of indica heavy strains usually however so this won&#39;t be on my top lists.

Vgot high all at once, it took a while to hit me but then all came at once.. a really scary down point is that I kept seeing really strange sites like people stood there and felt paranoid that if I moved they would come and get me, also felt like everyone else wasn&#39;t high and they were judging me but it turned out they were still really high too. \u000a\u000aso all in all its a good strain but just a terrifying experience

VKind of an average smoke. Super clean though for daytime use.

VThe Lemon Diesel was decent, but not really my cup of tea with all the other offerings out there these days. Just didn&#39;t quite do it for my shoulder pain and insomnia as well as other strains I&#39;ve tried and I found it sat there while I finished off multiple other strains. Lemon on the smell on taste - didn&#39;t really catch the diesel influence. Pretty average hybrid effect. Probably wouldn&#39;t grab it again, some people would probably enjoy though.

VI&#39;ve had two seperate batches of Lemon Diesel, and I&#39;ve been disappointed with both. Doesn&#39;t smell like lemon or diesel. Tastes like peppery lemon. But it&#39;s weak.
