VNew favorite for sure! Immediate rush of energy and happiness - you want to do ALL the things and giggle while doing them. After about 30 minutes, it mellows down into a happy high with strong creativity and perception. One of the best I&#39;ve found for depression and tiredness; I was having some serious fatigue starting a new nerve medication and this pulled me right out of it. Gives me mild-moderate munchies but not too hard to resist. I went back to buy another gram the next day. Highly recommended!!

VGot to be in a certain mood when I review... anything. I have to find permission to write first, to express myself. Sounds easy, right? Just write! No, it&#39;s not that easy. It why my reviews are so streaky in the timing. Long periods of silence smattered with moments of surfacing into the social sphere. I think most would call it depression. I do not. I call the felling by its name- sadness. And when it sweeps over me, it takes almost everything with it.. or feels like it does. Even writing for a time.\u000a \u000aWhy is this related to a pot review? Sure, good question. Here goes... I read other reviews and I see that many people use pot to combat, abate, take the edge off, of feeling bad in one way or another. I see the word anxiety a lot. I understand what the term describes. Although, I do not use the term anxiety any longer, though i used to. Anxiety to my mind now is named fear. A thing that troubles you. An apprehension or hesitation towards something... for a reason. Etymology is helpful here: Anxiety as a term, changed in 1904. Thanks &#39;Fraud&#39;. At this point in time It became a word to describe a pathology(science is all the rage, conquered the atom, so psychology invented out of thin air) other words, something that IS wrong inherent to a system, AND, for discernible factors. Freud had to invent factors to make psychology credible as a science. Thus, external factorization, categorization and judgment. Your broke and just needed to be fixed of what is wrong with you as to better fit the bell curve. \u000a \u000aThe difference between the two usages is profound in its ability to asphyxiate a human being. In one world, you&#39;re scared to death, sad all the time, heavy in spirit, and listless maybe for days or weeks, or maybe even life passes you by...And.. there is nothing wrong with you. It&#39;s ok to be that way, even if it feels really bad. Your sense of feeling is rooted in causation. It has a source, unlike a pathology, which ultimately says thats its just a wrong way to be, and digs no further. Here&#39;s a pill, a lobotomy, or some ECT and at least you&#39;re behaving for everyone, not making them nervous(scared).\u000a \u000aMaybe you&#39;ve survived rape or incest, being beaten and humiliated as a child. Maybe a loved one lost. Bullied at school. Bully at school. Parents are overly controlling and punitive. Maybe they abuse you profoundly. War veterans suffer.. And the myriad of others things.. &#39;that get us down&#39;. That make us feel really really sad or angry or alone or wrong or helpless or weird or too tall or too ugly or too old or too shameful... or too monstrous or too too too... and too means too much! \u000aBut hey! By who&#39;s standard!! And let us not forget that that standard for judgement which determines our right and wrong.. is coming from the outside. And that&#39;s a bad idea for a free feeling human. \u000a \u000aThat&#39;s what it means to accept and surrender to the terms.. depression and anxiety. No choice but try to cure or fix yourself when there&#39;s nothing wrong in the first place. Guess what. I feel exactly how I should considering the events of my life. And it happens I feel intensely. \u000a \u000aIts serve me not, this depression and this anxiety. Both terms assert a wrongness upon a person, whereas naming the feelings(non-pathologically) for what they really are(feelings), and for how people really experience and \u2018feel\u2019 them, we then say\u2026.sadness and fear! For in doing so, I begin the process of casting off the cloak of shame and wrongness.\u000aThats is all that needs to be known. \u000aTo say I have anxiety and depression is to say I have &#39;mood disorders&#39;. I do not. \u000aThere is nothing wrong with how i feel. Even though I mostly feel sad, lonely and angry. \u000a \u000aI don&#39;t suffer from depression. I suffer from growing up with a mother and a father who hated and hurt me. I&#39;m hurt. And I always will be. I&#39;ll always feel it. I always have. There is no need to get rid of that pain. No need to move beyond. The opposite in fact... all I must do is stand still in the center of it. And it\u2019s awful. And it feels like the most horrifying thing in the world. A being unhinged and deranged. That\u2019s what it is to be a person who has experienced trauma to some degree or another.  \u000a \u000aAnd pot for me, the sensation of being &#39;high&#39;, its physiological effects, literally feels like company alongside me during many periods of this harrowing journey. Being \u2018high\u2019. It feels soft and gracious. Merciful. It feels like the love they took, that i never got. Pot helps wake and shake up that part of me that only felt liked it died. And that feels nice. And there nothing wrong with wanting to feel good. Especially if you feel bad. And remember\u2026 feeling bad, even really really bad, is OK.\u000a \u000aYeah, the J1 was pretty damn good. I got to write a big balling OccamsPhazer special. \u000a\u000aP.S. Pot doesn&#39;t make me who I am. I was born with all gifts intact. \u000a \u000aEnjoy my friends;)

VThis strain is perfect for people that want the kick of a Sativa but the body high of an Indica. This delivers a great amount of energy without being too overwhelming. If you&#39;re looking to be productive, but you also want to partake and feel nice, then this is the strain for you. Approved for Wake-N-Bakes, chores around the house, and walking the dog...or cat. The only drawback to this strain is that it tends to leave you with that &quot;I need a nap&quot; feeling a little while after partaking. Cheers!

VJ1 is a cross of Jack Herer x Skunk1.  It has a smell and flavor that is absolutely divine.  The bud is supremely trimmed and just the right amount of moisture was retained during the curing process.\u000a\u000aThe effect is gradual and extremely pleasant in its onset.  Euphoria and happiness is the most overwhelming effect of this strain.  The energy of a cup of coffee is delivered to the user without the racy, anxiety feeling of having just consumed caffeine.\u000a\u000aJ1 is a supreme Sativa-Dominant Hybrid.

VFifty year old weed virgin here. I gave this strain five stars for strength of effect. The effect? Not what I was looking for, but quite an experience. I roll in Raw classic slims. I took probably seven or eight good hits and headed off to the shower. First I got some forehead pressure and then face. Then my scalp felt funny and my body started feeling light and a little wobbly. About the time I got dressed and into the car to head to my PT things went strange. My mind tended to want to bend what I w&#224; seeing to the at plane of the windshield. Out of the corner of my eye my hands looked flat and huge. I found I had to keep my eyes moving left to right fairly rapidly to get normal vision. At one point it felt and looked like it would take years or that I may never get to a stoplight I could see four blocks down. Not a good driving strain, not for me, not at that quantity. At the PT office I was a little concerned I would look off and people would notice. Not paranoid, mind you. PT went well so it did relax my body adequately. &#192;nd I had no problems getting to sleep so no squirrel cage action in my mind. However my sleep was not restful. All in all an interesting experience and I wouldn&#39;t mind trying J1 under more. relaxed circumstance where I could go slower. Its &#224;n easy smoke, no harshness at all. Lovely spice on exhale. Bring your space helmet for a trippy experience!

VThis stuff has just smashed me like a train! I love it, but I&#39;ll tell you what: I only took 3 hits off a Dynavap M and this has laid me OUT! \u000a\u000aI am by myself, giggling away, I have eaten anything that could not run away from me, I am so &quot;in my head&quot; that I can&#39;t even follow the story-line in my soap opera (yes, really). I keep fading in and out, and I can&#39;t remember what just happened!! I have not been this stoned, this way, for 30 years! This is what it was like in the good old days when I first smoked pot as a teenager. Actually, you know what? I just realised. This J1 makes me feel like I did when I was smoking hash in Brighton in 1986! :)\u000a\u000aI could definitely not hold a conversation with anyone right now and I can not, could not, do not want to, go out. This would see me experience some really bad paranoia, which I hate, but to which am susceptible.  Anyone who met me would know I am baked! \u000a\u000aThis is hilarious! I only got a gram, to try, but will go and get some more of this stuff tomorrow! I love it! This is the highest THC / lowest CBD ration I have used, and now I know I definitely can&#39;t do more than one hit if I want to be functional, which I am most certainly not, right now. That&#39;s fine with me. I can enjoy very small quantities, so my gram lasts longer.

Vj-1 is j-wooooooow! When I opened this medicine of the gods I was wigged away to a pine Forest with a citrus Grove inside of it. I wanted to get lifted like John legend. I floated to a happy stress free painless happy place. \u000a\u000aI was about to work, focus and be productive. good for the daytime use.

VMakes you feel happy, and just great. No couch lock or munchies. I feel very focused on J1. Music is fantastic. The high only last a little over an hour for me though. The taste was not my cup of tea but otherwise, one of the best flowers I&#39;ve ever smoked.

VPerhaps worth noting: review sample was top shelf, a year old, but airtight the entire time. Maybe explains why the high was incredibly slow to come on? The lack of any perceptible effects makes it really easy to smoke past your limit. It does gradually ease in over time. A cozy, reassuringly euphoric blanket wraps warmly around. Like the comforting buzz of beer. Mental state doesn\u2019t stop dissipating into dissociative fuzziness. Music becomes transcendent, it\u2019s quality; pleasurably heightened. Sound is expansive and encompassing. Absolutely astounding diving into the intricacies of each instrument. It\u2019s got strong similarities to LSD\u2019s effect on music. That said, there is a moderate void between you and the experience. It\u2019s got such solid, stable mood elevation that there isn\u2019t the emotional vulnerability that really cuts deep. It\u2019s ok, though. A lovely rainy day strain for picking up spirits. Not much physical effects, it\u2019s all in the head. Surprisingly light of foot. Watching stuff is amusing, but not really what this high is best at. More fun for socializing.

VWell rounded strain for daytime use or wake n bake.  Great for being productive and creative.  Also a good smoke for social situations... *in moderation*  the taste is better than I had expected from the other reviews. but.... that really depends on where you go to find it and what phenotype it is.  The pheno I tried seemed to lean towards skunk... which was a great flavor, I would have rated it higher but I&#39;m more into the heavy Indica&#39;s

VThe scent on this strain is pretty unique. It has a slightly noxious tinge to it, while overall, smelling like pine and fresh cut grass. It&#39;s olive green covered in orange hairs all around, and not all that dense feeling.\u000a\u000aThe high is pretty focused, and definitely more heady than body. This stuff sits right behind the eyes and causes supreme relaxation, without the laziness and loss of functionality that usually comes with it. This is a great de-stressing strain, and probably good for anxiety. It&#39;s a nerve calmer.

VNice head high!! Took maybe 5 or 6 hits from a small pipe and I was ready to play mario kart for hours. Music becomes god. I may have smoked too much since after about 2 hours I found it impossible to listen to a thing my friend was saying because I was too busy focusing on the music. Helped me sleep, for I had a full 9 hours (I usually get 6-7 interrupted). One of the best strains I&#39;ve ever tried! Only downside is I was coughing like a m-f-er.

VI think the only way I would be able to differentiate between J1 and straight up Jack Herer is by the smell of the buds and (highly unlikely) the taste of the smoke. It&#39;s got that pungent, spicy, signature-sativa smell and gives my thought processes a boost of energy. A heavy, head-oriented high that&#39;s euphoric without being overwhelming, if you have a low tolerance to THC I&#39;d take it easy... Beware of panic attacks! This strain is wonderful (just like father figure Jack Herer) and should be picked up if yr looking for &quot;philosophy-lock&quot;.

VMethod: Flower/glass pipe\u000aLook: (top shelf) fairly even distribution of red hairs, lots of trichomes with a dark creamy green color.\u000aSmell: very pungent (this became the deciding factor when it came down to selecting between J-1 and blue dream) a cross between citrus and woodsy/earthy \u000aFlavor: smooth mouthfeel with the smoke, tiny note of peppermint, with a pine-sol cleaner aftertaste... very nice not bad at all.\u000a\u000aHigh:\u000abought 6 grams worth and I\u2019m almost finished with it, so I figured I\u2019ve smoked enough now to write a review on it. J-1 left me with a very nice (but also very foggy) head high. My review of three stars is due to how this strain is put out there. It is touted as a sativa dominant hybrid. This was not the case, at least in my experience. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s one of the few strains that has had adverse effects, it made me very dizzy and gave me some pretty bad anxiety which some strains of sativas get a bad rep for sometimes but this strain also put me in body lock mode. And sometimes sleepy. (Which I don\u2019t mind but I\u2019d rather get an indica for that and don\u2019t want that from a strain that is supposed to be sativa like). \u000a\u000aIt does act a little like a sativa when it comes to creativity, but I would say it doesn\u2019t make for the best productive strain. If it\u2019s to be approached like a sativa then I would approach it like a weekend sativa. Foggy head high, creative, but does not make me productive, no giggles either.\u000a\u000aOverall this strain left me confused, it\u2019s effects weren\u2019t the most consistent, (imo) you can label it hybrid, indica, or sativa and I couldn\u2019t tell you if you were wrong, it\u2019s almost like it goes through phases of each. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not a bad strain if it\u2019s profile fits what you want...\u000aBut for me it didn\u2019t jive too well, and that\u2019s too bad because this comes from a lineage of two really good strains, one of which is my favorite of all. (So far).\u000a\u000aAlso: j-1 caked up my bowl with LOTS of resin very quick. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VExceptional genetics! I&#39;ve been enjoying the strain for a couple of days now and can definitely say that I love everything about it. First off, at first glance it definitely looks like the typical Jack strain; slightly loose packed buds that look quite bulbous.  I was expecting the typical smell to be that of straw and hay like Jack usually does, but was pleasantly surprised by the fruity nose on the jar of J1 presented to me.  \u000a\u000aAfter a few vaporizer sessions now I can definitely say that the effects are quite uplifting and euphoric - and slightly on the energetic side - while still being able to focus and stay clear headed.  Sativas tend to cause my mind to race sometimes but this hybrid allows me to stay Zen while having a rush of enthusiasm to get the job done.  I might also add now that this strain might be better suited for a task at hand rather than an evening relaxation session as it may cause the mind to race if not focused on something. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t want to say that this strain would be better suited for an intermediate to advanced smoker, because although it is a heavy Sativa-hybrid it doesn&#39;t overstimulate or induce anxiety.  Jack Herer usually is a bit overwhelming if you aren&#39;t in the right situation or environment, however the J1 Hybrid that has been created here offers a more enjoyable experience for all around situations. \u000a\u000aUsually Jack has quite a bitter taste, somewhat resembling dried straw or hay, but I believe the Skunk-blend allows this unique complexity ranging from a honey taste to citrus, with just a hint of a floral overtone.  \u000a\u000aHighly recommended!

Jack Herer usually is a bit overwhelming if you aren&#39;t in the right situation or environment, however the J1 Hybrid that has been created here offers a more enjoyable experience for all around situations. \u000a\u000aUsually Jack has quite a bitter taste, somewhat resembling dried straw or hay, but I believe the Skunk-blend allows this unique complexity ranging from a honey taste to citrus, with just a hint of a floral overtone.  \u000a\u000aHighly recommended!

VMethod: Flower/glass pipe\u000aLook: (top shelf) fairly even distribution of red hairs, lots of trichomes with a dark creamy green color.\u000aSmell: very pungent (this became the deciding factor when it came down to selecting between J-1 and blue dream) a cross between citrus and woodsy/earthy \u000aFlavor: smooth mouthfeel with the smoke, tiny note of peppermint, with a pine-sol cleaner aftertaste... very nice not bad at all.\u000a\u000aHigh:\u000abought 6 grams worth and I\u2019m almost finished with it, so I figured I\u2019ve smoked enough now to write a review on it. J-1 left me with a very nice (but also very foggy) head high. My review of three stars is due to how this strain is put out there. It is touted as a sativa dominant hybrid. This was not the case, at least in my experience. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s one of the few strains that has had adverse effects, it made me very dizzy and gave me some pretty bad anxiety which some strains of sativas get a bad rep for sometimes but this strain also put me in body lock mode. And sometimes sleepy. (Which I don\u2019t mind but I\u2019d rather get an indica for that and don\u2019t want that from a strain that is supposed to be sativa like). \u000a\u000aIt does act a little like a sativa when it comes to creativity, but I would say it doesn\u2019t make for the best productive strain. If it\u2019s to be approached like a sativa then I would approach it like a weekend sativa. Foggy head high, creative, but does not make me productive, no giggles either.\u000a\u000aOverall this strain left me confused, it\u2019s effects weren\u2019t the most consistent, (imo) you can label it hybrid, indica, or sativa and I couldn\u2019t tell you if you were wrong, it\u2019s almost like it goes through phases of each. \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s not a bad strain if it\u2019s profile fits what you want...\u000aBut for me it didn\u2019t jive too well, and that\u2019s too bad because this comes from a lineage of two really good strains, one of which is my favorite of all. (So far).\u000a\u000aAlso: j-1 caked up my bowl with LOTS of resin very quick. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VClear headed, focused, upbeat like drinking half a cup of coffee while avoiding any anxious feelings.  Medium density, small light green buds. The buzz is positive &amp; happy with a &quot;no worries&quot; vibe while still being motivated to do things.  The marriage between these two parent strains is phenomenal in effect as they compliment each others more adverse effects.  Skunk #1 softens up any of Jack H&#39;s edgier aspects as it symbiotically adds a bit of spunk to the mellow Skunk.  The taste and smell is where Jack dominates almost completely.  Hard to complain about such a thing with it being such an amazing unique flavor, but so does Skunk #1 in its own right.   After being blessed with trying J1 several times of different varieties of growing it seems the two odors are complimentary of each other. A game that is fun to play is while partaking in cannabis like this is trying to pull apart distinguishing these different characteristics in genetics of plant. The terpenes of each blend so smoothly &amp; with ease it is hard to pull them apart making this flower&#39;s lineage a perfect pairing.  Hats off to the original breeder &amp; in part the universe for making such things possible!!  Personally did not use this one for pain relief so it is possible, but not able to comment on that aspect.  Might be good for weight control because the high was more fast paced with no hunger or munchies at all.  Versatile cannabis that can be used both for recreational &amp; medicinal purpose that for taste alone should be on the list to try......again and again.........

Seeing the \u201ceffect\u201d categories I was pretty excited about this one. I guess I expected much more from a strain that reflected full marks on all \u201ceffects.\u201d For me, this one was just ok...Good, but nothing special.

I overdid it because it the effects were incredible and so I just kept vaping more. Then I knew I had to lay down. I was back to normal in the morning.\u000a\u000aNext time I will stop after 10 minutes and see what that feels like.\u000a\u000aIn the beginning stages I started thinking these awesome thoughts that I wish I had written down.

VSmoke it and discover your best self.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s hard to describe, but it&#39;s the kind of high where you aren&#39;t really excessively anything. You&#39;ll certainly laugh or think or sleep if you want to, but it&#39;s not gonna be your giggliest, most focused, or most relaxing high.\u000a\u000aBut what made this so unique for me was how it took all my personality traits and sharpened them. Basically, it felt like I discovered the smartest, wittiest, kindest, most confident version of myself. Colors were more vibrant, music was more engrossing. \u000a\u000aSimply put, for a few hours, you&#39;ll see what it feels like to be you at your very best.

VMy score for Jack One is less about the quality of the high and more about how it compares to the hype and to other premium-grade strains. After trying it 4-5 times, I&#39;ve concluded J1 produces a very nice, reasonably strong high. But it&#39;s not the first thing I go to when I have other premium options. Right now, I have GSC, GG4, Blue Dream and J1 in my jar, and I&#39;ll go for the GSC or GG4 before the J1, which is on around the same level as Blue Dream for me. It doesn&#39;t creep much; I feel it pretty quickly after I&#39;ve started, and it has a nice, rounded effect - slowly builds up, peaks, and slowly drops down. The high is gone around 3-1/2 - 4 hours after 1 bowl. It&#39;s woodsy and citrucy, very easy at medium burn temps, but it gets harsh when you turn up the heat just a little. I experienced mild-to-moderate munchies - nothing overwhelming, which was nice. I will never say no to J1; It&#39;s good stuff. It&#39;s just not as good as its hype and doesn&#39;t stand out amongst its high-THC peers. I pay $65 for 1/4 of GG4, $70 for 1/4 of GSC and $90 for 1/4 of J1, making it a low-value purchase. I&#39;ll smoke it and enjoy it all day, but I can&#39;t justify a high rating. 3/5

VAs a daily smoker for chronic back pain after a fracture, J-1 just became my go to strain during the daytime hours. More energy than a cup of coffee, takes a ton of pain away, looks as if God himself sprinkled sugar crystals inside an out, I feel like a giant nug that&#39;s about to start rolling on the floor until everything is clean. \u000a\u000aA+, it&#39;s a must try if your collective gets this in Stock and your a heavy smoker.

I got it from The Mint dispensary in Phoenix, and the taste is only comparable to that of a sweaty meat-stick... Everything else I&#39;ve ever purchased from the Mint is A1 but for some reason this J1 is just an F-. still gives a decent uplifting high, just makes me gag between hits on occasion.... would not recommend, but am also not trying to tarnish the Mint with this review, just the strain.

Vacquired @ the Variety Co-op in Orange County.  Everything you want in a sativa.  So good that I actually bought more just to share the awesomeness.  \u000aSuper clear, massive creativity, killer focus, zero anxiety... Dissipates the cloud of stubborn thinking &amp; self doubt...  understand your own creative process.  Good for wrapping your head around difficult concepts.\u000a\u000aHits the same regardless of mood or wakefulness.  This particular batch tested@ 27.98%THC/.06%CBD/.02%CBN, yet doesn&#39;t overwhelm even a super low tolerance user like myself (5-10mg of THC puts me in the clouds)\u000a\u000aGood things will happen with this smoke...  I guarantee it.

A minimum amount of couch lock. Music is incredible, would be a phenomenal  strain before a concert. Taste is a little hard to nail down, I get both pine and citrus notes, I like the taste.

VSo far, this had been my all time favorite.

This is the kind of stuff I can smoke and clean the house after.  Or work on the car, or go for a hike.  I tend to not like to smoke weed just to sink into the couch, so for getting stuff done and added a little pep to your step, this strain will help me feel more accomplished at the end of the day.  As an added bonus, it doesn&#39;t make you feel tweaked at all. No paranoia or anxiety. Just clear, happy, and a little trippy, while keeping your energy high.  This strain is a must try for anyone, new or experienced.  Although I&#39;m sure as a more experienced user, you could appreciate this strain even more compared with others.

VA great daytime med without the jitters that some sativa heavy strains tend to have. The bar graph that describes the effects on this page are correct except for the section about  paranoia. I feel that this strain has little to no paranoia tendencies (a huge plus for me because I have anxiety and feel paranoid enough when unmedicated). The second best quality of J1 is how creative it is! It feels like my brain is gently being massaged with finger paints.

VJust smoked a boing about 30 minutes ago and I am really loving this high. Not to mention the buds were pretty! They were a really light deep green if that makes sense?? The smell was just like the jack herer, real sour, super fresh. The taste was exactly how it smelled even through the minty Dutch. The high is so nice! Super clearheaded buzz, everything looks a little brighter it feels like. Your body feels so nice and relaxed, not to the point where you&#39;ll fall asleep though. You kinda just feel like you&#39;re floating. You feel somewhat energetic. I smoked some alien bubba this morning and when I got home I was so burnt and ready for a nap and I decided to try the J1 and I&#39;m wide awake! I really suggest you try this strain if you come across a good cut of it!!

VA great daytime med without the jitters that some sativa heavy strains tend to have. The bar graph that describes the effects on this page are correct except for the section about  paranoia. I feel that this strain has little to no paranoia tendencies (a huge plus for me because I have anxiety and feel paranoid enough when unmedicated). The second best quality of J1 is how creative it is! It feels like my brain is gently being massaged with finger paints.

VIt only takes a few bong rips of this stuff to get you really high. The second I smelled it I knew it was good shit. once I opened up the mason jar, it made my whole car smell way loud. It has an exceptional taste. The first time I smoked it, I smoked a big bowl in a session. It lasted about 3 hours and got me through cleaning my house. Later on that night, I smoked a lot more (probably about 6 bowls) and I was on my ass. Expect to be super hungry and have tons of thoughts, but at the same time, focused enough to be somewhat productive as long as you don&#39;t smoke an absurd amount. If you do smoke an absurd amount, as with most potent strains, expect to be dysfunctional.

The high hits you with a super sativa potency, with just enough indica to keep you from floating into space. Yield is average to high. Smells like lime candy goodness. Awesome strain for it&#39;s anti-depressant qualities, this stuff really makes you smile. Great for your wake-and-bake or lunchtime sessions. Tested at local dispensary 21+% THC.

At first the lower half of my head felt warm and then the warmth moved to my forehead area and it felt like there weren&#39;t enough receptors and that the high was backed up for a while.  Then I felt paranoid and then giggly and super aware of how I was acting different.  This was from two big rips.  So next time I will do less. But later as it wore off I felt great, relaxed and not paranoid.

VI love this strain. I&#39;ve had great Friday nights out &amp; about under the influence of J1. Laughter comes easier. I can eat. I can study and write appropriately, no interference with study habits. Would like to use more when having to study or complete college homework assignments. Helps depression &amp; anxiety, Things are milder. Things seem moderately manageable in this chaotic world. Dry mouth and dry eyes as expected. My high lasts 1-2 hours, but 2 hours at most. I still love this strain, and would love to find it in a concentrate form.

It might have just been the environment i was in (new people, super sus, driving around). I got really claustrophobic and felt like i blacked out but apparently i was sitting up straight squinting and shaking my head a lot. some excorism sh*t happening over here. lol, it was probably just me but i think i&#39;m going to stay away from J1 and stick wth green crack and GSC

I am focus and still clear head but the pain I&#39;m in goes away so fast.

Gives you a lot of energy throughout the day to power through whatever errands you need to take care of for the day.\u000a\u000aAs far as the ones I got, the taste was kind of bland.  Slight pine and earthy flavor, which was ok but I prefer flower that provides more flavor than this.  I found that I began to use this primarily to mix with other flower as it is so potent.  It helps to add to the flavor and strength.

Whether you smoke or vape it, this strain offers a great cerebral high and giggling is sure to ensue. Only reason I wouldn&#39;t give it 5 stars is because I&#39;m not too fond of the taste, it sort of has a green bell pepper taste to it but it&#39;s bearable.

A minimum amount of couch lock. Music is incredible, would be a phenomenal  strain before a concert. Taste is a little hard to nail down, I get both pine and citrus notes, I like the taste.

VI am an inexperienced smoker. I haven&#39;t had that much experience with many strains and a one hitter is more than enough for me. That being said, this was borderline life changing. at least as far as weed goes. at first I smoked about 2 or 3 hits, and I had a clear head with the drive to do whatever I wanted. Then I finished the last few and it turned my world on it&#39;s side. In a good way I mean. best night&#39;s sleep I&#39;ve had in a long time, and didn&#39;t give me the munchies as bad as I&#39;ve had, though they were definitely there. Definitely my new favorite.

This is the kind of stuff I can smoke and clean the house after.  Or work on the car, or go for a hike.  I tend to not like to smoke weed just to sink into the couch, so for getting stuff done and added a little pep to your step, this strain will help me feel more accomplished at the end of the day.  As an added bonus, it doesn&#39;t make you feel tweaked at all. No paranoia or anxiety. Just clear, happy, and a little trippy, while keeping your energy high.  This strain is a must try for anyone, new or experienced.  Although I&#39;m sure as a more experienced user, you could appreciate this strain even more compared with others.

Vacquired @ the Variety Co-op in Orange County.  Everything you want in a sativa.  So good that I actually bought more just to share the awesomeness.  \u000aSuper clear, massive creativity, killer focus, zero anxiety... Dissipates the cloud of stubborn thinking &amp; self doubt...  understand your own creative process.  Good for wrapping your head around difficult concepts.\u000a\u000aHits the same regardless of mood or wakefulness.  This particular batch tested@ 27.98%THC/.06%CBD/.02%CBN, yet doesn&#39;t overwhelm even a super low tolerance user like myself (5-10mg of THC puts me in the clouds)\u000a\u000aGood things will happen with this smoke...  I guarantee it.

So Smoked a blunt, came in, played dynasty warriors again for the first time in years, killed 9,000 peons my first game &#128064;&#128514;, this strain is amazing, was able to focus but still felt amazingly appreciative of every aspect of the game and my already developed feelings of nostalgia were complimented pleasantly with a nice euphoria.

VThis is the Grey Goose vodka of the cannabis world.  One of the few strains that goes with a tux or suite.  It has a classy-ness about it.  I have some gold crutches I add to my joint only when smoking J1, its a chatty strain, excellent for socializing, Ive never gone to bed alone after smoking J1, its That effective at eliciting charm.  There is no doubt in my mind that it releases serotonin and neuroepiniphrin as it can instantly alleviate the blues with an added increase in energy and endurance.  The high is refined, not sloppy, at high doses memory is affected slightly.  After a half joint, The come up is equivalent to 10mg of Amphetamine, leaning towards the dextro salt-more dopamine release, less adrenaline. Increasing the dose turns it into an antidepressant.  1/4 Gram is about right for a work day dose, 1/2 Gram for any other day.  Mixing 1/4g J1 and 1/4 Gram of Dutch Treat in a joint with Caramel Frappe non nicotine ejuice very lightly brushed along the outside front half of Joint makes for a joint you can land any girl in bed after having her smoke it.  Even non smokers can&#39;t resist the caramel frappe accents. The sounds she makes while smoking it foreshadows the night ahead.

Vyesterday was my first time at a dispensary.I bought a gram of J1 because only a gram left.This morning I tried it with my gf.We are not heavy smokers so it&#39;s not easy for us to go function right now but I can tell we&#39;ve been having fun for last 2 hours.I can absolutely say that it makes me very horny and sex is awesome with it.

VPros:\u000a- Pungent smell (could smell it 20 feet away)\u000a- Tastes incredible\u000a- Nice, calm buzz after 3 vape hits\u000a- Very little anxiety which I get from sativas\u000a- I&#39;ve yawned twice since vaping but I am getting over the flu and my body probably needs more rest anyway\u000a- Helps with muscle pain; have been sore for two days from the gym and this calmed the soreness\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a- Pungent smell (this could be a problem for places where you want to be more discreet)\u000a- Dry mouth (again, I&#39;ve been sick so I&#39;m already dehydrated but this increased my concern for drinking water - probably good)\u000a- Still yawning a little bit which is surprising; even though I slept 14 hours last night, I&#39;m still feeling like I could sleep\u000a\u000aRight now I could see myself using this as a strain to help me cook dinner in the early evening, in the morning on the weekends although I&#39;m sure I could still pay attention in class and work during the week because it&#39;s more of a buzz than a stoned feel, and while relaxing after a solid workout. \u000a\u000aThe ONLY downfall about this strain is the yawning and I&#39;m really hoping that goes away.

VIt only takes a few bong rips of this stuff to get you really high. The second I smelled it I knew it was good shit. once I opened up the mason jar, it made my whole car smell way loud. It has an exceptional taste. The first time I smoked it, I smoked a big bowl in a session. It lasted about 3 hours and got me through cleaning my house. Later on that night, I smoked a lot more (probably about 6 bowls) and I was on my ass. Expect to be super hungry and have tons of thoughts, but at the same time, focused enough to be somewhat productive as long as you don&#39;t smoke an absurd amount. If you do smoke an absurd amount, as with most potent strains, expect to be dysfunctional.

VA great daytime med without the jitters that some sativa heavy strains tend to have. The bar graph that describes the effects on this page are correct except for the section about  paranoia. I feel that this strain has little to no paranoia tendencies (a huge plus for me because I have anxiety and feel paranoid enough when unmedicated). The second best quality of J1 is how creative it is! It feels like my brain is gently being massaged with finger paints.

VWhew ! ! ! J-1 will punch you in the face with a powder lime kool-aid smell that is almost like trainwreck; however, the spicy JackHerer smell comes through just before you think it&#39;s a Humboldt County decoy. Almost non-existant leaves with almost 100% calyx twisting around eachother with a bright green color and dark red hairs.\u000a\u000aVery expressive and aromatic nose, but a very sticky resinous plant too.\u000a\u000aMmm tasty..You can taste the northern light spiciness with a hint of fruity/juicy resin melting away. The smoke tastes a little &quot;grape-like&quot; flavor to it as well, yumm. Very nice smoke, almost as good as Jack Herer, but for some reason someone wanted to BX it with Skunk#1(???) Anywho, a good smoke for after work but early in the evening.

A solid 2 hour high with just a little bit of creep after the first toke.  However, the high ended ended rather quickly after 2 hours, no lingering effects on this one.  Also, didn&#39;t feel dizzy or any headaches.

Everything else I&#39;ve ever purchased from the Mint is A1 but for some reason this J1 is just an F-. still gives a decent uplifting high, just makes me gag between hits on occasion.... would not recommend, but am also not trying to tarnish the Mint with this review, just the strain.

VJ1 smells like bowl of fruity pebbles and smokes a dense milky white that you&#39;ll want to drink up.  A pleasant sativa that falls just outside the elite category of sativas in my opinion because of its lack of potency. there is an immediate uplifting effect and a cerebral experience that is useful to aid most daily activities.  an enjoyable smoke and one of the sweetest smelling strains, so its not too much of a hassle if you find yourself needing to pour another bowl.

I do whatever I can to find a strain and if it&#39;s not around then I get blue dream.

The effect was what you&#39;d expect of a strong Sativa heavy hybrid, heady and bright.  If you suffer from anxiety it might not be for you.

VThere are not many bad things to say about this strain. I feel really uplifted and euphoric, but at the same time, I have really good focus. I also feel minor body waves, just hinting at a nice body stone. If you want to feel turnt, this strain might not be for you. If you&#39;re depressed, anxious, or not-so social, this strain might be the cure. This strain might crack my top-5.

VDefinitely a great choice for sativa lovers. Quick hitting euphoric head high, very uplifting, energizing and buzzy. Great daytime strain. Fair for pain, great for depression.

Vdefinitely one of my favorites. Jack here has always been one of the best in my opinion, the cross with skunk just makes it all better. Great day time smoke!!! But be sure to keep it in something smell proof unless you want the world to smell it

VSelect Cartridge was just ok. It tasted really nice and herbal.  I got a decent body lift about 5 minutes after 3 or 4 pulls.  I also felt some paranoia and a lot of anxiety with this strain.  Not the most unpleasant version, but I wouldn&#39;t buy again.

VYou can&#39;t go wrong by smoking J1 by any method necessary.  If you&#39;re looking for a &quot;couchlock&quot; high, stay away. The only downside that it is expensive(160 bucks for a half oz.) and it may ruin all other strains of mmj for you when they do not match up to the great J1.

VI vaped an hour ago and I&#39;m still pretty lifted. I didn&#39;t have much to do today so i decided to watch a movie. I feel GOOD, relaxed, and i also have the munchies! If you haven&#39;t tried apple slices with peanut butter I recommend trying it as much as i recommend trying this strain!

VLove this strain. The Jack Herer strain is infamous in its own. Couch lock is often an effect of smoking J1. Sweet and earthy flavors combine to make this one of the tastier strains I&#39;ve had. Definitely keeping some of this in my reserve stock.

VThis strain is pretty nuts! If you want to trip out, this is the stuff you want! Marijuana has never made me hallucinate, but this strain did that for me, which was awesome and funny w/ friends. I suffer from panic attacks because of my stressful lifestyle and j1 is the absolute best for it for stress. If you use marijuana to treat stress and/or depression, you NEED to try this one. It&#39;s my new favorite, I love it. Don&#39;t pass up the chance... But I should let you know that one bowl of this leaves me more paranoid than anything..
