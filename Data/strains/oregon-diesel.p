VOregon Diesel is a quiet gem. Beautiful buds (w/ gorgeous purple hues) and a sweet scent as calming as the high - I found her to be a bit of a creeper. With a soothing and refreshing high, it&#39;s  great for anxiety and eventually lends itself to a great night&#39;s sleep. The more I use this strain, the more I appreciate it. Definitely a favorite for treating insomnia.

VIf you&#39;re looking for a heavier indica and can find Oregon Diesel from Oregrown then do not hesitate to pick it up. Smell: 9/10 mostly berry with earthy/sweet tones, Taste: 9/10 again mostly sweet/berry tasting but the diesel is lightly there, Appearance: 9/10 mostly dark forest green with shades of deep purple and then bright violet veins underneath, nugs are dense but fluffy with dark amber hairs. Effects were slightly heady and a little racey to begin giving me slight anxiety, which I didn&#39;t mind since that&#39;s usually telling of a stronger strain for me. However, it quickly flows through your body leaving you feeling heavy and relaxed. Finally you find yourself totally mellowed out and yawning ready for some sleep.

VWOW!! Fruity and really fuel tasting, oddly, good combo!! Almost sour berry smell in the jar and when ground it smells like someone made a smoothie with a can of gas and a frozen berry mix!! The taste is fantastic and smooth. Sweet and sour on inhale and very berry tasting exhale. Very indica in feel, relaxation and stress relief come on quick and stick around. Could be serious couch lock inducing so I would medicate properly! Most definitely recommended!

Batch I got was a little fluffy, but have had some before that was hard as a rock! burns great either way, not the kind I would grind though. Suggest for anyone looking for relaxation, euphoria, pain relief, lack of appetite and of course depression \u270c\ufe0f&#127794;

This weed won&#39;t glue you to the couch; the ratio of this indica dominant hybrid feels like about 60% Indica to 40% Sativa. There is enough Sativa to keep you moving, but you&#39;ll be doing your thing serenely, and without even a hint of any edge. \u000aFocus: amazingly clear which is a rarity for me with cannabis.\u000aCould be a little stonier, but I&#39;m splitting trichomes.

VJust smoked a little bit of this. Good flavor but my particular batch was a little of a harsh hitter, took a second attempt to clear the bong as my lungs hesitated while I cleared it. Almost immediate body - relaxation sensation, coupled with some euphoric Psycho activity, but mainly seems like a good indica that should make your body feel nice and relaxed and put you to sleep. Over all not too bad at all. The stuff I got is gorgeous looking, beautifully caked in crystals with some orange hairs. This is a purple strain, with dots of purple lining the more dark green nug. Very good, would be perfect if maybe I had some boveda and addressed the humidity of my batch.

VA lovely way to end a long day. I had smelled this strain the last time I was in Kind Leaf but had gone for sativa so this was a wait till next time. Today was it, I couldn&#39;t resist that full body aroma of huckleberry. I&#39;m thinking a nice glass of red wine with the accompaniment of Oregon Diesel would be most excellent.

VI&#39;m not usually an indica person because they make me sleepy but this most rp line by effect was euphoria. Definitely a night in sort of strain, but I really enjoyed it.

VI loved how heavy hitting this indica was. It was as tasty as it looks. It had great terps. I thought it was more of relaxed and sleepy high then euphoric. I did feel at ease  and it was perfect way to end the day or right before bed. I wouldn&#39;t describe it as euphoric per say but it I did feel good, it just wasn&#39;t a cerebral euphoria oh, &amp; I did get the munchies, but I&#39;m not complaining! I love this strain

VEverybody will say  hybrid or sativas are the most creative. I beg to differ. I recorded an entire album in one night on this, pushing through the waves of relaxation and just letting the music flow through my body and into the instruments as it pleased. This stuff (from oregrown) looks, smells, and smokes as some of the best I have ever had. Move over black mamba, affie x mendo, and og, Oregon diesel will be my go to for night time medicine! :)

VThis is truly my favorite strain. It makes my body feel so relaxed and nice while still leaving me with a clear, calm mind. I smoke this every night after work to unwind and maybe do a craft or some chores in the house. 10/10

VI rated this strain, &#39;4&#39;-stars because I figured it deserved a little more than a, &#39;3&#39; (about a, &#39;3.6&#39;).\u000a\u000aThese flowers, upon first glance, may not appear green whatsoever. They definitely have hues of orange (from the pistils) that stand out quite radiantly. This is also augmented by the shade of purple that lines the bud followed by a dusting of yellowish trichomes.\u000a\u000aSmell: upon catching a whiff of the jar, the immediate thought that came to mind: Purple Diesel. Definitely some of those linalool (from lavender) components present in this one.\u000a\u000aTaste: earthy. Not inherently earthy, but it is the result of the mixture of the flavors from the parent strains. Relatively smooth: not harsh, no cough.\u000a\u000aEffects: this would be a good Indica for daytime use. My first assessment was, &#39;awake Indica&#39;. Definite utility in pain relief. You can tell it works for the lower back. Aside from that, it leaves you with a sense of sheer well-being that can only be described as clear yet simultaneously relaxing and numbing in larger doses. Smaller and moderate doses can gives variations of effects as this strain essentially has the components to entail both, &#39;Indica&#39; and, &#39;Sativa&#39; characteristics.\u000a\u000aOverall: alright to good. It was refreshing to have a Diesel that maintained a relaxation component to that extent.\u000a\u000aWould I buy it again? ... no specific plans. Maybe if it was the best, &#39;Indica&#39; variety available.\u000a\u000aRecommend to Connoisseurs and Sommeliers? In a specific context pertaining to Indicas that can be utilized in maintaining wakefulness, yes.\u000a\u000aRecommend to first-timers and inexperienced consumers? Yes.
