VI really like Jenny Kush. The name itself seemed a little boring at first glance; but with the good advice from my bud tender at Golden Leaf Wellness, I discovered Jenny Kush is anything but ordinary and plain. \u000a\u000aThe buds were medium-sized, and tough to break apart. The smoke tasted sweet, but not cloying, berry-ish and floral\u2014and it was reminiscent of something notable... perhaps another strain...? A fleeting memory not yet smoked away... an ex&#39;s perfume...? All part of the mystique of Jenny Kush.\u000a\u000aThis was very strong weed. Half a bowl was more than enough. I am presently functional, and a bit loquacious, but I could also stand to watch some TV and lay down. Smoke this any time, in tribute to Jenny Monson.

VA very pleasant and very well balanced hybrid. Amnesia is one of my absolute favorite sativas, so I was super excited to try this strain. The smell is a sweet tropical citrus with a tiny bit of piney aroma. The buds themselves were pretty dense for a sativa dominant hybrid. They were a sugary bright green with light orange calyxes. The taste was citrusy and sweet, and a little earthy. The effects were pleasant and mood softening. Put me in a really great mood and was pretty uplifting. Perfect for stress relief and social situations.

VSmells and tastes heavenly and the buds are big and fluffy and crinkly when you break them a apart. Very satisfying to prepare for a bowl or vape pack. \u000aI like the uplifting effects with usually no paranoia. It&#39;s one of my go to day time strains. \u000aNamed after a cannabis mom and activist it&#39;s a great strain for the canna-mamas out there. I love this one for taking walks by myself (often in the WA rain) and it&#39;s also great for housework and I feel comfortable having had a few hits of it while around my kids. This strain is potent with the THC so I take it slowly.

I&#39;m on a budget, so when i saw some roll your own (pre-ground) for 70 for 7g and at 29% i had to jump on it.  my initial impression wasnt very high (only because pre-ground). that dissipated after my first hit. then it was OMG. taste was nice, and fairly smooth. then it took me like an hour to smoke one small bowl. this. is a great all rounder. it now has made it to the top of my list of favorite buds. highly recomend.

VVery rare strain to find KOBE strain for sure.Jenny kush is very good strain great for party&#39;s and social activities. Great for settling down after a long day clear head indica.Please support the cause and buy this strain when you see her or buy the seeds and support the cause.Last time found this strain was @Swell in Youngstown AZ was very good.
