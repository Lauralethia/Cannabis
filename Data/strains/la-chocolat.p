VThe wife and I hadn&#39;t heard anything about LA Chocolat, so weren&#39;t quite sure about this strain but...hey its chocolate...c&#39;mon! Turns out it is a very good hybrid that is slightly indica dominant (60-40). We found our batch seemed to run the opposite but that&#39;s ok even though we love indicas. All in all...a very good smoke and well worth picking up some if you&#39;re so inclined. Its a sexy looking strain, quite frosty and colorful but the nose is what sold us. It jumps out the jar and dry-humps your nose while Barry White sings in the background. Its been a couple days since we smoked it and I can still remember the aroma as I ground up some for a smoke. The effects were a little creeper but it definitely had some legs and kept us laughing and cutting up quite late into the wee hours. It was a very good mix of euphoria and happiness. The taste was extremely smooth and although I don&#39;t tend to get the &quot;flavors&quot; most people describe...I swore I actually tasted a hint of chocolate after the first draw. Bonus! LA Chocolate is a solid choice if you are looking for something to enliven a social get together...or listen to Barry White :)

VI am a new smoker that tends to have negative reactions to many strains but my budtender suggested this strain for pain relief. I have had bouts of paranoia when smoking in the past and as a result I tend to choose low THC strains and have a low tolerance. I was nervous about this strain but after using it a few times, I am in love. It creates such a relaxing high and works very well for my pain but at the same time it doesn&#39;t melt me into the couch or cause restlessness. It&#39;s the perfect everyday strain- relaxing enough to just sit and enjoy some Netflix but doesn&#39;t cloud the brain too much so you can still be productive if you want. This is definitely an all time favorite and if you haven&#39;t tried it you definitely should.
