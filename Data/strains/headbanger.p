VRooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity! This strain is phenomenal. These days everything seems to be a hybrid and it&#39;s hard to get those pure expressions of sativa energy or indica relaxation, you kind of end up in a purgatory with some hybrids where you&#39;re too monged to do something but you don&#39;t feel completely relaxed either. But THIS to me is a perfect hybrid as I was talking my ass off but also feeling completely euphoric. I said to my girlfriend any more euphoric and I would think I&#39;d taken some ecstasy. I agree completely with the Effects listed here on Leafly. Happy, Euphoric, Uplifted, Talkative but don&#39;t know why people rate Anxiety as high on this one as its a strain I could puff on continuously and just get happier despite how strong it is, and I&#39;m someone who is prone to anxiety from some of the feistier sativa dominant strains. For the first few hours you are in the zone chatting away but later on it really mellows out and lulls you into a blissful slumber.

V***10/10 in all of my essential cannabis categories***\u000a\u000aThis is some ass-kicking herb right here folks.  Not for the lightweights.\u000a\u000aI picked up a gram grown by Saints out of Washington state via Emerald Leaves out of Tacoma.  Great dispensary by the way; the extremely cute mixed girl at the counter recommended this strain to me.  Honestly she was so beautiful I probably would have bought anything she showed me.  Ok back to the herb..\u000a\u000aSaints is a high-end cannabis producer out of Seattle that prides it self on quality, natural product.  You can definitely see the quality in the herb before you crack the jar.  Beautifully frosty, perfectly dried, cured and manicured herb greets you through the glass jar.  The smell is a solid ripe MANGO smell with a touch of cheese.  My eyes roll back in my head just typing this.  $15 a gram... but worth it as you will read .\u000a\u000aThe taste is similar to the smell.  Ripe mango with a smooth creamy finish.  Very smooth and easy on the lungs.  This is one of those strains I end smoking way too much of because the taste lures me onto smoking more and more.\u000a\u000aThe effect is the highlight of this strain.  Very powerful and long lasting.  Clear headed and a little heavy behind the eyes with ZERO paranoia or sativa like anxiety inducing effects.  This is perfect for getting shit done or kicking back.  Conversations flow easily and social situations don&#39;t feel too awkward.  Some body calming effect centered in the chest is noticed as well.  This is a very excellent ideal high, in my opinion.\u000a\u000aIn summary, I love this strain and you will too.  If you like mangoes and enjoy a smooth, powerful high, put this herb in your body somehow.
