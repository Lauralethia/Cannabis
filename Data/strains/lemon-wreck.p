VI took this weed and smoked just a bowl of it and decided it was too diesel flavored for me only a hint of lemon in aftertaste, but I made it into a cookie and man I was floating through school super nice. Decent weed 3.5/5

VLemon wreck\u000a\u000aSmell: skunky/spicy with a lemon diesel undertone. The lemon is distinct, but the skunky/diesel/pungent smell is intoxicatingly strong\u000a\u000aTaste: I have chosen not to give my opinion on taste, because unfortunately the half o I got of this was a bit over dry. I don&#39;t want to give what I&#39;m sure is a very tasty strain a bad taste rating merely due to my over dry experience\u000a\u000aEffects: uplifting, super spacey. This strain definitely works in phases, starts off with a distinctly sativa feeling of an uplifting relax with lots of head room, an then somewhere between the 1-2 hour mark, it makes a wicked shift to a heavy, sleepy, indica feeling. Great for your last &quot;hoo-rah&quot; before bed or after work, rejuvenates the mind before putting you to sleep. \u000a\u000aMedically, great for insomnia, not so good for adhd in my opinion. \u000a\u000aSpiritually, a very compassionate strain, great for building bonds with other people and open-hearted communication. \u000a\u000aRecreationally, better save this for the last bowl of the party, too tiring towards the end. Although, I could see this being the PERFECT strain for couple wanting to have a Stoney date night, perfect &quot;cuddle and watch too much Netflix&quot; strain!\u000a\u000aProbability of munchies: medium-high\u000a

VA nice easy calming high, if short-lived. A little too dry eye for me (train wreck effect?),and its beneficial psychological properties can be found in other strains without the side effects (hot flashes, dry eyes negative; lessens anxiety big time, helps with lack of appetite.

VIf you are looking for a powerful sativa, look no further. It&#39;s not the type of strain that&#39;s going to relax you, it&#39;s going to send you on a borderline psychedelic soul-searching look at yourself. If you are susceptible to paranoia in weed, this strain will most definitely cause it. I brought some to a rave, and while it was super intense along with the k I did, it wasn&#39;t enjoyable. I was super paranoid and that got in the way of me soaking in just how trippy the effects were. It reminded me of why I&#39;m an indica person. Even though the strain wasn&#39;t for me, it was good for what it was which is why I gave it 4 stars. I&#39;d rather have strong weed that doesn&#39;t fit with my personality than weak weed that doesn&#39;t do anything. My final advice: If you are a sativa person, you&#39;ll really dig this stuff. If you have anxiety like me, tread lightly.

VHad this a while back, I remember it tasting very citrus-y. It gave my whole body a near electric shock of stoned. Three hits of this and I was ready to do anything, or nothing haha. It was probably one of my favorite strains because it gave me energy to do things stoned then after the right amount of time, lull me to sleep which is just what I need. Definitely recommend for an all around high.
