VVaporized in a Crafty at 385\u000a\u000aSo I\u2019ve been dealing with neck pain the last 3 days which made 2 of those unable to drive. I was able to drive today so I went to fweedom in MLT and picked up some of this from Lifted, 28%.\u000a\u000aAfter two bowls my neck pain is gone and I\u2019ve been able to move with full mobility. The inflammation has been zapped!! For that alone this strain is worth it.\u000a\u000aHowever it also got rid of my stress, which is a lot (work stuff, divorce, child\u2019s father out of country....big time stuff) I have no stress left in my body and I feel fantastic.\u000a\u000aVery comfortable body feeling, focused yet relaxed and an indent if tingly euphoria that faded into gentle ease and joy. \u000a\u000aHighly recommend. &#128588;&#127995;

If you want a good taste vape it if you can. As for the high....for me it starts off as nice body buzz then gradually moves to the dome piece toward the end it seems like . Makes me love life just a bit more, experienced some euphoria, and just a relaxing feel good feeling. I would love to see how the shatter of this is like. \u270c

It&#39;s a hybrid so I&#39;m noticing 2 hits in currently that I can focus on conversations or tasks easily and when done, switch back to chill vibes and listen to Giraffage like a boss.

Although, if you&#39;re wanting something that will help you sleep, this won&#39;t be it. It has made me much more awake tonight.  It&#39;s just a beautiful and refreshing high, very nice.

VI tried this strain for the first time in a vape cartridge from Liberty Reach. The flavor was a lot more vanilla than orange, which was surprising but not unpleasant. It hit me pretty strongly, first as a sort of tingly rush and then 30 minutes later I was passed out on the couch. Really nice way to end a stressful and busy work day. I would highly recommend this strain, especially if you need to wind down for the night. Rarely does cannabis make me sleepy, but wow! Lights out.

VGreat bud. Euphoric and relaxed, but able to function. Surprisingly not getting the munchies from these, which I appreciate. Just get a little foggy in the brain. Otherwise, great stuff.

Vfirst strain I&#39;ve had in a long time that didn&#39;t give me fuckin cottonmouth, which is a godsend. good body high, significantly less paranoia than I&#39;ve had with other strains. good for depression &amp; anxiety I think.

V       Rolled in a &quot;Peach Swisher Sweets&quot; bring out the Tangerine flavor like no other. As for the blue power in it, taste more like Northern lights or Alaskan Thunderfuck cross. Very very good combination excellent. Tangerine Power is one of my all time favorites, I look for it all the time. Usually expensive but worth it! \u000a\u000a       Almost pure sativa so it&#39;s leafy but extremely frosty. The high is very sativa, makes my heart race and feel very paranoid but it&#39;s flavor makes up for that. If you like sativas you will love it. I like indicas and kushes but the Tangerine is so&#128293;&#128293;&#128293; I can&#39;t quit \u000a

VMy new daily favorite, it is easy enough on you for work and play but also makes stress less a problem as it really improves my mood. I really like the easy hitting flavor as well, not harsh at all and a great pipe weed. And it&#39;s generally a $10 gram, $70 1/4!

VThis strain when i tried it smelled exactly like a tangerine as i had one at time for a comparison and it tasted like orange candies was smooth and the effects of it were awesome and in my own opinion i found a fave though i have to have a variety...nothing less than as close to perfect as can be for me.........

VI thought that this strain was particularly nice. It makes you uplifted, relaxed, and happy. I haven&#39;t experience paranoid, thank goodness. Although, if you&#39;re wanting something that will help you sleep, this won&#39;t be it. It has made me much more awake tonight.  It&#39;s just a beautiful and refreshing high, very nice.

Vwow , I love agent orange and blue power but never expected their spawn to treat me so much better than have , lately.\u000a\u000athe buds are so pretty I hesitated before I tore into the first one, ok only a couple seconds but still.\u000asmells like you&#39;re dreaming.\u000aFirst blast had that agent orange smoothness, the kind you use to oversell a pipe or bong , oooh so smooth.\u000a\u000aThe headkick was complete , ripped so to say but not so much I didn&#39;t want to do things. I  will revisit this one as often as I can

VA slight peppery scent off the fresh bud, very strong standard weed odor with definite hints of orange. The nugs I got are all relatively dense, and trichomes are easily visible on the buds. The flavor is strong, sweet, and tastes like MARIJUANA! great for huge gbong hits. I would give this to a beginner to try, simply from the lighthearted high and delicious flavor. Another great tangerine strain to keep a look out for :)\u000a
