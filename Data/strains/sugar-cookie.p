VSugar cookie is a goldilocks strain. It&#39;s not too sticky but not too dry, not too colorful but not bland, not super pungent but not at all scentless. There is a decent amount of orange hairs and it&#39;s covered in tiny crystals. The sweet, flowery aroma is subtlety reflected in the taste of the bud. Sugar cookie gave me a mellow body high and helped ease my tense muscles. Although not having done much for my headache, this strain was an effective sleep aid.

VJust finished an organic outdoor grow of this strain for meds grew 2 plants both organic harvested one early and pushed the second to 40% Amber.  Both are great smoke with 2-4 weeks cure respectively.  Uplifting and munchies hit now!  Then a calm feeling and either motivating or chill depending on what I seem to need to do, the down side is the end crash is very sedating.  Taste is exactly as described, earthy with pine undertones.  The smell is of pine cleaner and sweet baked smells.

VAfter a long day of company jargon at work, you drive home in bumper to bumper traffic, my gawsh the tense feeling of the day period, you come home to a sweet strain that is perfect for moments like this. After the first puffs of this strain, relaxed is your new best friend. The strong scent and earth taste makes it worth the try. It&#39;s a great 9-5 worker strain. It kills anxiety. Immediate relaxation of the muscles. I enjoyed it and I will continue to keep an eye for it.

Vwow! I got a $35 eighth of what was essentially a top shelf tree at Collective Efforts in Sacramento. this tree is very, very beautiful, a nice light green completely caked in trichomes.  Smokes very well, a nice smooth burn, tastes a lot like pine and is very nice. the nugs are medium sized and very dense. Makes you a little tired but not terrible, I didn&#39;t get couch locked off of a joint.

VWow, no joke. The smell is exactly white cake: bread and sugar with vanilla and a touch of lemon zest.\u000a\u000aMy batch feels like more of a 50/50 hybrid. Subtle body high, enough to release body tension, but also a nice energetic lifting in the head. Kind of like drinking a cup of coffee and getting a hug.\u000a\u000aEdit: after smoking more than usual, this strain seems nearly perfect. Really focused, alert head high that&#39;s very euphoric (I felt very friendly and talkative) and the body high became warm and tingly.\u000a\u000aMinus one star because it seems you have to smoke enough to reach &quot;critical mass&quot; in comparison to something like a Blue Dream where it creeps up on you and I need less to get the desired effect. Especially since it&#39;s sold at a bit of a premium.

VThis beautiful, grapety sweet, purple wonderflower hits you first and foremost with a massive body high. Then slowly creeps in the mind-numbing side of things, turning once normal, possibly productive thoughts into far reaching celestial ideas that are only now considered to be maybe possible... only to remain 90% locked in another space and time thanks to it&#39;s Northern Lights ancestry &#128515; Super excellent for pain and taking your mind to another place to relieve stress and anxiety. 100% recommend!

VA dispensary sold this to me saying it was a sativa, so I was surprised to read on leafly that it was an indica dominant hybrid. Anyway, I got a gram of shatter. It has a pretty mild, slightly sweet taste. Not a lot of terpenes. It&#39;s a pretty relaxing strain. After a long day, it&#39;s a good one to kick back with and watch some TV. I wouldn&#39;t use it as a daytime strain. Not what I was looking for, but a pretty decent find for just hanging around

Also helped out with my lower back pain and headaches. I was on a solid 4 for this one but its a 5 since I wasn&#39;t able to build a tolerance quickly for it. Definitely a go to strain for unwinding from a stressful day.

V.Sugar cookie possesses an aromatic sweetness and is an indica dominant hybrid which allows a person to feel relaxed and at ease. The sweetness in the smell of the strain is the most likely source that could have inspired the name Sugar Cookie. It does not belong to the same family as the Girl Scout Cookie, as many people seem to believe. Its composition and basic structure are entirely different. Actually, the Sugar Cookie is a very famous three ways cross between the Sensei Star, Crystal Gale and Blue Hawaiian. It contains berry, tropical fruit and other similar flavors. Due to the combination of the above mentioned strains it allows the person to experience an amazing high. It makes you calm and lulls you into a deep and sleep. It is a very pleasant mix of Sativa and Indica which can be used to numb pain in certain parts of the body. Due to the fact that it contains a large variety of strains, it is effective and pleasant at the same time. Absolutely fantastic strain

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Fast acting body/pain relief that relaxes, starting with leg tingling then expanding up in the body. Stress relief in the mind with a mild head high, especially behind the eyes, which start to become weighted that could lead to sleep if wanted. Smooth draw and exhale.\u000a\u000aCons: Minor dry mouth &amp; eyes.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Sweet taste with hints of light pine/minty and a hint of berry. Can cause minor munchies and increase your appetite. Sleepiness tends to creep in. Very enjoyable relaxation. Recommended for relaxation and pain relief.

Within a couple hits I felt it in the head and eyes immediately, in a good way. The effects all seemed to be in the head mainly, and didn&#39;t travel much into my body like other strains. I have a very relaxed, stress free feeling but I&#39;m not couch locked, not euphoric, not terribly motivated, but just feel really good.

VMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Fast acting body/pain relief that relaxes, starting with leg tingling then expanding up in the body. Stress relief in the mind with a mild head high, especially behind the eyes, which start to become weighted that could lead to sleep if wanted. Smooth draw and exhale.\u000a\u000aCons: Minor dry mouth &amp; eyes.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Sweet taste with hints of light pine/minty and a hint of berry. Can cause minor munchies and increase your appetite. Sleepiness tends to creep in. Very enjoyable relaxation. Recommended for relaxation and pain relief.

It is very powerful - my lifetime smoker buddy had to cut himself off after two bongs and slept at my house because he was afraid to drive (that never happens).  \u000aMy mood was happy (I&#39;m prescribed MM for bipolar) without racing thoughts.  I could not put down my guitar.  It did not make me as hungry as most strains.  I loved the smell and picked it from a few other top shelf strains.  Perhaps it&#39;s biggest benefit is pain relief.  A few bongs and stretching after my workout and I didn&#39;t feel 50 anymore.  \u000aThe oz went quickly and I hope to pick up more for the summer.  Sugar Cookie is the Oberon of weed.

VGreat flavor profile, think buttered berries! The high was at first cerebral and energetic and then transforms rather quickly to a narcotic high that had me dozing off before hitting the sack. I would recommend this strain for weekends and evenings when things are a little more relaxed. Great for movie watching or catching up on that cool new series!

VSugar Cookie is a relaxing indica-dominant hybrid with an aromatic sweetness that is likely to have influenced this strain\u2019s name. Sugar Cookie is a three-way cross between Crystal Gayle, Blue Hawaiian, and Sensi Star. It delivers a deep, full-body high while creating an almost cerebral body buzz to keep you enjoying your movie/game night. Definitely a strain worth trying!

Vthis strain produces a light fluffy dark green bugs with dark orange almost brown nugs that are large and filled with wlmderfull woodsy smell that brings a lovely sweet inhale and a nice warm exhale with notes of cinnamon and spice. the smoke produced by this strain can be described as a thin light misty white smoke. over all this strain is a nice upbeat and energized high that makes you feel Happy and mellow

VI was surprised to read that there&#39;s no girl scout cookies in the genetics, because the taste, smell, and bud structure seem nearly identical. But apparently not? This is a very relaxing, deep indica that is well suited for patients suffering from insomnia. Calms without sedation.

VI recently came to really enjoy using marijuana.   I tried for a long time to like it and just flat out did not enjoy it.  it made me paranoid and stressed out.  I was doing a little research on the different strains out there and started to understand more about what marijuana really is.  I then realized that I was getting mostly thc dominant strains and how that was having an effect on my enjoyment or lack there of.  I came across an edible that was called Sugar Cookie.  I took it home, popped one into my mouth and waited....  Mentally, I had prepared myself for another anxiety ridden and paranoia filled next few hours.  To my consternation and surprise I suddenly realized how smooth, relaxed and nice I was feeling!  I was incredibly excited because my blood pressure dropped, anxiety disappeared and confidence came rushing back to me in a very tangible way.  I was not feeling super &quot;high&quot; but just completely at ease and ok with the world.  Its amazing how much sugar cookie has done for me and I truly wish it was more readily available. \u000a
