VThis is honestly one of the best strains I have had the privilege of trying. Comes on pretty strong, a very upifting and euphoric feel to it. When used during the day it tends to enhance mood while an evening dose tends to promote relaxation and sleep. This strain has been incredible with my PTSD and Neausea issues. I have not gotten the munchies like this since I was a little kid in high school. Extremely functional strain that does pack quite the punch after a few drags on the Vape Cartridge.  This was a cart of Liquid Live Resin from CY+ in Butler,PA. Was recommended by the budtender for anxiety and depression and she was spot on as usual. The staff at CY+ is excellent and their selection of this strain has been superb. HIGHLY recommended

Vonce again peeps, if this strain that WON the Cannabis Cup isn&#39;t  pleasantly kushy looking with Fire Orange Hairs, super duper laiden with trichomes and smell of Pine and oranges then consider the source you obtained it from. GeeshWA have 16+ years experience and this strain is literally tooo strong for most people! It shouldn&#39;t smell lemony at all, the aftertaste has a very clean aspect to it. It does resemble Kosher Kush after the initial Tangie Sativa kick. Very relaxing on the body and mind...A plus and beyond. Keep in mind all producers are not created equal! This or (24K gold) should leave you with an ear to ear smile.

VHeavy hitter hybrid. Good for pretty much anything with a nice terpy citrusy-pine scent. Very euphoric and relaxing. Like a lot of great hybrids, seems to just amplify whatever your current state is, if you are on the couch you probably aren&#39;t getting up but if you are out and about, you&#39;ll stay motivated and focused. I&#39;d be surprised if anyone has something negative to say about this strain. 4.5/5.

VThis is a review for 24k (kosher tangie) by DNA Genetics at Nature&#39;s AZ Medicines dispensary in Phoenix. I&#39;ll start by the smell. When you take a whiff you get a fruity tangerine smell that only gets stronger when you break the bud up. The buds are decently frosty with alot of crystals and orange hairs. It breaks up nice and easily but will leave your fingers a little sticky but not super sticky. When you fire it up you get a fruity, earthy taste. The high isn&#39;t too intense, but it makes you feel good...happy. If you smoke enough though you&#39;ll be passed out in no time. Great night time smoke.

VI tend to find this in a live sugar from Cresco.  Awesome consistancy, great Tangie flavor that reminds me quite a bit of Super Tangie i was smoking in California.  \u000a\u000aThe concentrate is a good quality, saucy yet very sugary, probably my favorite density for concentrates.\u000a\u000aThe effect is very balanced between the head and chest.  Focused sativa buzz and a pillow to the chest indica blanket high.  I love Tangie strains and will always come as biased to them, but this is a real treat to me.

VNote: This strain was ingested via disposable concentrate cartridge (vape). Company is PA, Cresco. \u000a\u000aI wish everyone in the world could smoke this at least once. It\u2019s definitely not for everyone but something I think everyone should experience. An average kinda /mehk/ flavored initial smoke. Like, not good. Kind of sharp, stinky foot, cheese rind smell. It lingers and it sweetens. And as your mouth waters something happens between you smelling the smoke and tasting the taste and it\u2019s tangerine zest. Sharp, spicy tangerine zest. \u000a\u000aIn a bout of \u2018talking too much\u2019 at the dispensary, I\u2019d mentioned my colitis. The very patient attendant offered this as the staff pick mentioning the one of the educators with Crohn\u2019s works a lot with this. I was sold. And now I\u2019m sold! \u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a nose tingle, but also a deep in the belly jingle feeling. Great for sore fibro joints and aching nerves.

VThe first thing I notice is my stress and anxiety level decreasing not immediately but slowly definitely there. I didn\u2019t notice my headache starting to get less intense I also feel a slight burst of mental energy kind of behind it all. What I really enjoy is the not heavy but slight body relaxation that I am enjoying I did use a small bit of concentrate so this is a low-dose at least for me. At higher doses I know that this would relax the body much more. Definitely happy and full of smiles. This is a nice strain but Creaco Yeltrah Labs but id say not my fave it just doesn\u2019t seem to have exactly the personality but I feel I may need to use a little bit more to medicate properly. Pretty good tasty Terpenes to it. It\u2019s a creeper as others have said so that\u2019s always fun haha. I\u2019d say 4 out of 5 stars is a good strain just not enough indica for me that I was looking for in this moment.

VOne or two hit s of 24K brings the good head, and it produces a pathological grin(for me, anyway) with three. \u000a\u000aTastes great, leaves that sweet &#39;Tangie&#39; after-taste. Potent without unpleasant  intensity.E You will get plenty high from this strain. I&#39;ve never experienced any any anxiety or other unwanted sensation with this strain.\u000a\u000aEspecially effective with  my neuropathic pain, it really loosens me up when the PD flairs up- my favorite hybrid thus far. I&#39;ve used 24K concentrates (shatter, crumble, live resin, vape cartridges) also- try this one, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed. \u000a\u000aNature&#39;s AZ Medicines seem to have an exclusive lock on 24K flower in The Valley. Best $10 g strain ever!

Do not be scared by the Indica-side of this strain - it will not put you on the couch.  It is more of a nice daytime body relaxer and you can be very functional at the same time.

VFavorite strain I&#39;ve smoked in the past couple of weeks. It has  everything my favorite sativas have but gives a relaxed sensation in addition to its euphoric mood lifting effects. Definitely more of a pungent funky smell than citrus, but the citrus is there. Buds were slightly fluffy and powder green with bundles of reddish orange hairs. Flavors were nice as well but tough to put a finger on, perhaps floral. Five stars for the effects and quality smoke.

VThe Kosher strains are all winners so far.  Kosher Tangie has sweet, citrus as well as earthy flavors and taste, but the citrus really comes through.  The effects start slow, then hit hard, and 3 hours later, I was still feeling it to a happy degree.  Slightly more Indica leaning, but the Sativa effects shine through and are there during the entire high. Relaxed, but alert, focused and happy, and allows me to get what I need done.

VWhen it started raining this afternoon I looked outside and noticed that the light had that really magical golden orange glow it sometimes gets when it&#39;s sunny and raining at the same time. There was also a vivid double rainbow. My first thought was &quot;this would be so much more awesome if I was high!&quot; I ran downstairs and smoked some Kosher Tangie because my instincts told me to, and they weren&#39;t wrong. All of the colors stood out with incredible clarity, I had a profound appreciation of the beauty, and an a general feeling of euphoria and joy. I also felt creative and a bit tingly. Very pleasant high with no noticeable negative effects. You have to smoke pretty often to maintain though.#420sweepstakes

VNice taste, very citrus/lemony almost diesel. Low density nuggets with a nice amount of orange hairs. High is decent, not super heavy.

VIf cultivated correctly, this is an outstanding hybrid for indica-people/patients. The balance this strain has is very good, not too much sativa head rushing, yet the calming effect of the kush.\u000ataste is good to very good, again depending on the quality of cultivation.\u000aI can use this flower for all my needs if I need to, even if I prefer a pure indica for the evenings. \u000athe versatility of this flower is it&#39;s strength: morning, afternoon, of in the evening, it&#39;s all good :)

VI got a gram of kosher tangie at Club Pitbull, and it tastes like armpit SMELLS. I do not taste tangerine at all. Effects were unremarkable, and the taste was NOT what was represented.
