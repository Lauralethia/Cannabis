V Kept me focused and going on tasks, all while feeling mellow yet energized. A good smoke, whether after work or for a wake-n-bake, it has no tired feeling or headache while coming down, nor is there any cottonmouth effect. Got me where I wanted to be all while being functional and productive.

VI like it all the way around great taste and really does resemble the smell of the sour candy it takes its name from. Using currently for a stomic ache and doing the job. Not too much of a head rush tho even out the bong nothing to crazy just a good relaxing stain.

VThe high that I got from this strain was great! It made me want to get up and dance to some tunes. When I went to the arcade bar in my town with my friends, I smoked a bowl before going and it made me super focused on the games. I ended up winning a couple of games too because of it haha.\u000aThe only thing I didn&#39;t enjoy was when I was coming down off the high; I would get dizzy and have a headache along with it. I&#39;ve smoked it a few times and it&#39;s been the same. Other than that, it&#39;s a great strain and I&#39;ve recommended it to a few of my friends already.

VThis stuff hits really smooth. I was starting to think it was gonna be some weak stuff, but the high just kinda settles in. Just hanging out on the porch after a decent day and I&#39;m feeling awesome. And I still have half a bowl left.

VJust downright amazing ,I just grew this strain. I am not even a Indica type of person, but I love this strain, though it takes more of its Indica lineage when it comes to the high and effects! It absolutely offers clear-headed thinking and creativity as with sativas, just awesome and it looks beautiful!

VSour patch kiss would be like getting a little passed first base then getting tagged out. SPK should be aka as p-23 then.\u000a\u000aLooks bright tight and frosty. Gives way to name sake paired with the aroma of lightly sweet with citrus, gas, hints of wood, and flowers. Tastes lightly sweet and little skunky. Effects are quick with a short burst of slight euphoria and intense focus. Relaxation fades in as focus fades out a little  after less than 10 mins. Happiness lingers as the relaxation becomes heavier. This was grown by glass monkey and don&#39;t recommend or will get again. I was thinking this was something it&#39;s not. What a tease.
