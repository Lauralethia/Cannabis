Vit&#39;s as dank as it is beautiful.\u000aDefinitely one of my favorite weed smoking experience&#39;s. It&#39;s literally all purple. sells out fast recommend you get it if you have the chance. its only sold in Oregon though I think so it&#39;s pretty rare.

VSo, I bought this strain partly for the fact that it was an indica with a lower thc percentage, a decent amount of cbd, and, well, honestly... it was kind of a novelty, thing. Ive had Black Afghan and i had gotten it for the low thc and indica factors as well, but also, like Sirius Black, the novelty of it being so fully purple as to appear black. its different. cool. exciting. intriguing. major bag appeal and people freak when they see it! sirius blacks color was a bit more unique, like theres this almost redish wine color emanating from the buds, and i tell you what, I went back for more; not because of the novelty of the color, but the effects. it was perfect for me. the cerebral qualities are fantastic. puts me in a very happy positive mood. im more prone to laughter. its a bit euphoric. it is not overly heady/speedy or sedative and couch-locky. it&#39;s like the perfect balance. and for me; i have PTSD, so there are many strains that activate my anxiety, paranoia, negative self-conciousness, and hyper-vigilance. i am VERY picky because of this. it seems like ppl who dont have to worry about that always &quot;Prefer&quot; sativas, whereas ppl like me? its not a choice. we dont &quot;prefer&quot; indicas, we CANT use sativas (more often then not). Anyways, this strain induces NO panic or anxiety- just comfort, relaxation, joy, contentedness, and relief. if you have similar sympoms and/or issues, i HIGHLY recommend this strain. it seems to have everything one could want from cannabis without the negative side effects some of us have to endure, and (BONUS) it works any time of the day. i use it in the afternoon, and im still able to function just fine. some will even benefit and be more comfortable. now, at night, i can either just get comfort; or, i can use alot of it and itll work as a sleep aid, too. but not before a little bit of intense euphoria panic-free. for those of you with a major high tolerance, who can smoke any strain up in the 20%-and-up arena, i maybe wouldnt recommend this for you. all in all? five star flower&#128144;. \u000a: )

VI thought I had reviewed this but to my mild shock I had not. The reason you ask? Because it&#39;s just that good. I&#39;m a med patient that use various products and strains. The first thing you notice is that this isn&#39;t just a lighting trick. This is a brilliant purple. The buds are compact but not small. Out of the bag you get the fragrance. It isn&#39;t a smell boys and girls. I did a corse grind and it opens it up and the smell was enough to make me smile. The smoke was smooth and never harsh on a hand pipe but going to a tube the inhale is like drinking an old bourbon. The exhale had a creamy taste and texture. It arrests the nerve pain in my legs and feet from an old injury. It also just allows you to function and still feel good. Best part is you&#39;re never more than a couple hits from dreamland.

VMeh. It&#39;s dark purple. Super dark purple. That&#39;s cool. It smells sort of like... fermenting oranges... and that&#39;s fine. The effects of smoking it, however, were fairly disappointing. It does relax the body, that&#39;s true, and it is slightly invigorating, but I can think of dozens of strains I&#39;d rather smoke. I&#39;m glad I got to try it, tho. &#128168;

VThis strain is a no-brainer 5 stars for me. Effect is like taking a Xanax or Klonopin tablet. Mellow and pain killing without a lot of sedation. No anxiety/paranoia whatsoever, but uplifting in a sativa kind of way--and this from a guy who is susceptible to it--I usually have to cut even a great indica like granddaddy purple with some high cbd strain to mellow it out. Not with Serius Black. Tastes like grape gum--I&#39;m serius!  This stuff if tough to find even in Oregon where it&#39;s grown, and I&#39;ve even seen lines out the door and 5 gram limits when a dispensary gets a limited amount in. While many strains cause anxiety, this one, for me, eliminates it. Superb.

VGood high! Not too heavy but definitely made me stoned after first fat bowl. Love the color of buds: seriously black with deep purple hues and some brownish green hair with micro crystal everywhere. Solid buds that reminded me of GDP but as colorful as Sapphire Kush. I snapped good pic and uploaded it via Leafly app twice but it didn&#39;t show up in pictures folder. Weird... \u000aMellow high. Relaxed body-high. Munchies. Enjoyable inhale/exhale-I used a big fat glass heavy hitter hookah repurposed it for flower use. No &quot;groggy&quot; headache/dizzy (weed &quot;hungover&quot; feeling) when I woke up the next day. Couldn&#39;t use it as &quot;aphrodisiac&quot; - but a bowl of Bruce Banner OG afterward does it.\u000aMy kind of flower. Bought it for novelty reason when I saw it available at MV Health in Altadena/Pasadena area.

VReally Dark purple(black). I showed this to a couple of friends and they were blown away by how dark this stuff is.\u000aSmell is great, has an orange/citrus smell and the nugs are super dense. I almost wanted to stop smoking because it lasted so long lol. Really nice head and body high, made me appreciate the things I have in my life. if you see this, try it out, you won&#39;t be disappointed.

Like grapes when full budded, but grinder brings out more earthy tones. It also acts more like a sati and dominant hybrid with me.

VI&#39;m not a sophisticated connoisseur, nor an experienced smoker, so take that for what you will. I&#39;m just a medical user who&#39;s had some bad anxiety-related effects from anything with a hint of sativa in it. But SB is smooth as glass. Happy, anxiety-free thoughts dominate, with a solid pain-relieving body high. Looks super cool as well -- it&#39;s metal AF. Definitely a keeper.

VI am generally prone to a good sativa or at least a sat-dom strain. The color purple and the grape aroma and I just had to try Sirius Black. Nothing at all to do with my secret love of the HP series. Not so secret now, I have to say that I was quite taken aback with Sirius Black! I had an energetic head high and a relaxing body high which allowed me to sit. And write. And take a fun photo. Bonus that it&#39;s grown here in Oregon. Sirius!

VAwesome strain. Strong earthy flavor but very smooth. The strain name was not stolen, members of the Oregon Breeders Group have been working on this strain since the 90&#39;s when it was known as serious black, because when people saw it they would say &quot;whoa that is seriously black&quot;. Funny people who&#39;ve been in the game less than a decade think they invented a strain that&#39;s 3 decades old. Even funnier that leafly would leave up a poor review that is bashing a strain based on nothing other than its name.
