VThis is a great daytime strain. Flavor is very mellow and would consider it earthy, slightly woody, but also has a little zest at the very end that seems almost menthol/minty, but this is very very faint and wouldn&#39;t be noticed unless vaping. This strain helps relax me, but doesn&#39;t have much of any pain relief. Can be felt behind the eyes and in the face (love this feeling). Helps with depression, stress, and most of all anxiety. More of a social anxiety bud.

VThis strain overall, is a firm &quot;meh.&quot; \u000a\u000aAlthough purportedly 33% THC, I can only assume the other traits, most notably  CBNs (up, focused) and CBDs (calming, healing) have been weeded out... for lack of an actual scientific term. :) \u000a\u000aGenetically modified to elevate THC levels and remove seemingly ancillary traits?  \u000a\u000aI really am a longtime noob, so my lingo.

VJust tried Dub A a couple of days ago and I have to say this is my new favorite from Shango. I have nothing negative to say about this strain. It helps me with my  anxiety, appetite, insomnia  and chronic pain.. it keeps me calm and with having anxiety, that&#39; it is key to have a strain that helps with all these symptoms.  The smell and texture give gives it a dense bud which I like, a little goes a long way. Definitely recommend this strain.

VThis is one of my all-time favorite strains. The first time I ever tried this, I picked up a pre-roll from NuWu with 32.8% THC. I use mostly for medical.... chronic pain, anxiety, depression, etc.\u000aThe first bowl I smoked, I experienced insane euphoria. All of my anxiety melted away (and I was on the verge of a panic attack) and I was giddy. My husband was laughing at me. I was so happy and joking with my kids while making dinner. While shredding the cheese for dinner, I kept sneaking bites. I swear it was the most amazing cheese ever... in fact everything tasted AMAZING. That day was the happiest I have had in a while. I have since used this one again from a few different dispensaries. It was not exactly the same, but still really great. This is one of my favorite strains.

I also feel alert, yet calm. Not hyper-vigilant, no anxiety, and definitely have pain relief with this one. My mind also feels very clear and focused, but I am quite high; I feel in contro thoughl. After trying well over 30 or so different strains, this, white widow. and gorrilla glue are my top 3. Great job A-dub guys!

Valright, so this strain is great for those who want to completely fuck their lungs and give even the most experienced smoker a fun time. one moment your buddy&#39;s like &quot;bro lemme light you&quot; next you&#39;re on the ground with a mix of tears coming from your eyes and an amazing high. getting the hard throat hit compared to its amazingly high THC content is what makes this strain do wonders to the body. use this strain if you&#39;re looking to have a fun night full of tears and happiness.
