VIt served its purpose. No more no less. When I picked this up I also got some Lemon Haze so following up the Haze with this was meh

VSampling from a local wa state i-502 registered producer, purchased in Des Moines rec shop. Growers did a fantastic  job as far as smoothness. Cure was a little drier than I prefer but overall great quality. No choke on the smoke, smooth as can be with a great earthy spiced tone. Hits you right off the bat like an Indica but quickly mellows out to a body high. Very sociable,body high, typical of quality hybrids. Would highly recommend for a newbie or seasoned vet for a great mood enhancement without much impairment at all. From what I hear it&#39;s a straight forward plant to grow as well. It&#39;s definitely a straight forward high, worth checking out.
