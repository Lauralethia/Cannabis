VDealhaze has changed the way that I look at sativas. Generally I always reach for a heavy indica, but my intuition told me to give it a shot. Wow! Clear headed, focused, and energetic. I went back to the dispensary the next day to pick up more before they sold out.\u000a#harvest#ash+ember

VDelaHaze/Luminarium from MedReleaf received this week. Well done! Good sized, dense nuggets, fresh and aromatic. Lovely Mango notes with some citrus sharpness.  High is positive, coming on smooth in the body and mind fairly quickly. Clear thinking and creative, that settles in to a relaxed state as you come down. Able to complete chores around the house or boat with no problem, though I found I didn&#39;t like traveling too fast while on this. Excellent herb provided by MedReleaf!

VThis strain was enjoyable and is very potent. It smells like delicious flowery mango. The taste was really nice. It definitely has an ascent and my first time overall high lasted for about 4 hours plus. Once you get cruisin it is really nice and happy. It enhanced my surroundings. The colors were enhanced and it was slightly trippy in a good way. Made me very happy.

VDela Haze from Licensed Provider, Emblem, in Canada, is definitely a Top Shelf, Triple A Strain.\u000aThe taste and smell of this queen are delicious. It is a highly potent strain, if your sample phenotype has a high THC level.\u000aThe terpenes in this Meducal Marijuana definitely boost the medicinal properties of this beautiful girl.\u000aFruity smells are released when preparing this yummy mummy for a smoke session.\u000aThe smoke from a joint is nice and thick and has definite diesel and mango flavours.\u000aTry Dela Haze Folks...You will love this Genotype.\u000a10/10\u000a&#128074;CrashT&#129305;

VJust left Haven in Brandywine MD, they always have the BEST strains! Anyway, I have had crohn&#39;s since 17, I&#39;m now 57 and had over 32 surgeries to get me just to a point where I could eat again, but have a very short, really short small bowel left. Also have Scoliosis (bending of Spine) due to high doses of Steroids over 40 years, steroids kill your bones from inside out, when taken for high doses for long periods like I have. Enough of that, fatigue and pain are my major problems and NOTHING, helped! Have been using MM for about 6 months and the fatigue is I would say 60-70 % better with all MM strains tried so far (sativa mostly) have done that. But this strain I get the best of both by far, Great fatigue relief, and my goodness does this help my pain the BEST also. Best of Luck in all your jorney&#39;s!

VI hadn&#39;t felt so hyped up about living in a while.\u000a\u000aDelahaze kicked in VERY late (about 2 hours after ingestion) and shot my creativity into overdrive. I made major breakthroughs with some stuff I wanted to write about; stuff I didn&#39;t know how to do until I had eaten and talked and made love while Delahaze took root in my brain and later compelled me to work, very inspired. I felt infinitely empowered and confident about what I was doing, because my imagination was strong and clear.\u000a\u000aWriting here the morning after. 10h of sleep later. Vivid, chaotic dreams with no recollection (uncool). Slight canna-hangover that may perhaps last another 2h from now; very tolerable.

VDelaHaze came in like a truck: slowly (after 3hs/oral) and HARD.\u000a\u000aCompared to Colombian &#39;Corinto&#39; landrace buds, DelaHaze produced an intensely creative high that didn&#39;t compromise working memory (although my hippocampus was halted due to THC anyway as I can&#39;t recall much too well). \u000a\u000aThis strain is great for sex! \u000aIt is also excellent for feeling inspired and getting creative. I jotted down several ideas throughout the evening. Caution: me and my gf felt slightly anxious around a store clerk. \u000a\u000aI repeat: this is a strain for privacy and creation.

VLet me start by saying that if you&#39;re the type of person who doesn&#39;t like hearing about dudes smokin&#39; pot then you&#39;d better kick it into high gear and scram buddy, because StonedOnPot is back and guess what?...I&#39;ve been smokin&#39; weed.\u000a\u000aAlright let&#39;s get down to brass tax (That expression by the way comes from mid eighteenth century America when the brass tax, a tax on the net brass a man owned, was the strongest current in the US government&#39;s tax revenue stream) it was a Sunday afternoon and I had the day off, I says to myself &quot;I&#39;m no coward, I&#39;m going to try this Delahaze strain that all the kids are talking about probably.&quot; Now it just so happens that I&#39;d recently come into possession of one gram of said pot. Not by choice mind you, no, but by sheer luck. Sometimes you wonder if a higher power is writing your story, sometimes you swear you can hear The Creator saying &quot;Hey StoneOnPot, why don&#39;t you light up that chron-chron and, I don&#39;t know, see what happens.&quot; And then he throws his head back and laughs maniacally. You curse your powerlessness but resist as you might, there&#39;s no escaping the reality that we&#39;re all just puppets on his strings playing out whatever drama most amuses him in the moment. Why, that&#39;s the first story he ever wrote.\u000a\u000aAnyway, rest assured this weed gets you stoned. But I&#39;m only giving it 4 stars. It&#39;s not cocaine.

VStrain: DelaHaze\u000aType: 70% Sativa, 30% Indica\u000aOrigin: Alaska, local anonymous\u000aMedium: N/A\u000aNutes: N/A\u000aGrower: Anonymous \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a7.5/ Appearance: Modest sized nugs with little orange and brown (I&#39;m colorblind) pistils throughout. Good trich coverage with not much leaf.\u000a\u000a7.5 / Smell: The scent isn&#39;t very striking. Mostly your standard marijuana smell. It&#39;s has a great pungent sour aroma after a good grind.\u000a\u000a8.0/ Burn: Good coarse grind burned great and stayed cherried. About 50/50 black/white ash.\u000a\u000a9.0 / Taste: Thick, billowy smoke on inhale, slightly chalky and vaguely fruity taste. Really filled the lungs.\u000a\u000a9.5/ Exhale: Straight up Smarties candy on exhale, with a chalky texture and everything. Definitely getting those fruity, citrus flavors.\u000a\u000a8.5 / High: Great, eye opening morning smoke. Great focus, actually motivated to write-up instead of getting couchlocked by some of these strains. Really makes you very excitable after a couple bowls. An excellent sativa haze high for sure.\u000a\u000a9.0 / Manicure: Good trim, not leafy at all but this strain is also supposed to have a high calyx-to-leaf ratio anyways. Not so dry that it evaporates when lit. Flavors were great and the smoke isn&#39;t harsh at all, so good cure.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(8.4)Overall: DelaHaze is a fun day smoke that I&#39;d love in a jar next to Jack the Ripper and Blue Dream. The potent and focused high might be just the thing to get someone through that next menial task. I know when I go work on my shop later today I&#39;ll be burning some Delahaze at the same time.

Vgot me motivated to clean the house. Not really any body buzz. Main effects are short-lived, only about 1.5 hours. No lethargy afterwards though.

VThis bud didn&#39;t smell the greatest until I ground it up.. Smells nice and lemony.. Taste with a vape is nice and smooth! Excellent daytime strain... left me able to complete many tasks in a short amount of time.

VSmell is amazing, clear citrus notes. Taste is not as sweet as it smells, but still very enjoyably sweet. Clear but hazy mind, keeps you and your brains active and creative. Physical effects go as far as making it a bit more comfortable to sit down than standing up, however you won&#39;t get the motivation to clean your house from this strain. Smoke it with friends and enjoy your hazy brain.

VThis is an amazing Sativa, I have been growing this one for about a year from a dedicated mother plant. She stays short, not much stretch, with decently dense nugs. The dried and cured buds have a fresh flowery aroma, it&#39;s pretty potent. The affect is a sativa up, with out the paranoia. You feel creative and happy then in the come down your ready for a nap

VThis is one hell of a good strong sativa. It is usually around 30% THC. I smoked a friend one bong, and it greened him out. He was fucked up for a good hour before he could even get off the bathroom floor.\u000aI find it to be great for pain relief. Also great for being creative.
