VThis is my absolute favorite strain it is hard hitting, tasty and will put you completely down if over smoked. I do not recommend raven farms la cheese however they don&#39;t maximize it&#39;s potential and it is disappointing. la and confidential are the same strain produced with 2 different names dependant on when you purchased the seeds, and contrary to leafly&#39;s absolutely wrong information this strain is produced by Reserva Provida not DNA Genetics.

VFrom the big crystallized buds, to the pungent smell and taste, I have to say this product is very unique. I took a few hits from my bong and I felt light. Being relatively experienced with smoking, I figured I would toke the whole bowl. Oh dear how I was wrong! About 5 minutes after clearing the bowl, it crept on me. I felt more intense both in front, and behind me.  It was a relaxing, light, and fun indica high mixed with somewhat of a sativa head high.  I would suggest this herb to anyone who needs to calm down after a long day, or help with medical pain. Definitely a good strain, and a favorite of mine!

V3.75/5\u000a\u000aI love L.A Confidential. It&#39;s easily a 5-star cut for me, effects and taste. I&#39;ve also had cuts of Cheese that were tasty and nice too. But the taste of this weed is just a bit too much old brie cheese for me.\u000a\u000aNow this is an excellent cut of bud. Bright purple and reds and a neon coating with crisp, big buds, perfect indica heavy hybrid. And, like it&#39;s background, is great for your main medical reasons i.e Pain, Anxiety, Stomach, And Spine (PASS in my book). But the taste is like Brie in an old Gymsock, and that knocks it down a whole point. At least I got Terp Drops for this emergency!

Did give me wicked munchies, but most Indica&#39;s do that. The buds were beautiful, and the aroma is unbelievable. All of these things make this strain a must try for Indica lovers alike. Helped with my insomnia, slept like a baby. A great strain.

VRecently I got some of this strain from Medicalclub.ca and I must say I was impressed with how relaxed and stress free this strain made me feel....almost euphoric but I wouldn&#39;t go that far....uber relaxed would safice.\u000aFlavour wasn&#39;t the greatest but non the less it was a great flower.

VThis strain is actually what I have been toking as of late and let me just say that it definitely gets the job done. Con cheese is a strain that will leave you feeling happy, relaxed, and insanely Hungary or at least for me and this is comin from a stoner who doesn&#39;t get the munchies that bad. CFC is one of the better strains I have tried as it is the only cheese bud I have ever toked. I would highly recommend this magical green strain to anyone out there but especially for those who have a lack of appetite like myself.

VUsed it twice and had nothing but sadness and anxiety. LA Confidential by itself is beyond incredible; crossing it with Cheese ruins it completely. Sometimes breeders should leave well enough alone.

VHoly Shit! This strain is a lot of fun! For the first time of all the hundreds of times I&#39;ve vaped or smoked weed I feel literally high. Like every cell in my body is puffed up with air. Like I could fly away as a balloon. I am feeling high. \u000aI tend to gravitate to the more grounding and stony highs, or relaxed cerebral effects. Typical Indica effects.  This feels like I would think a sativa feels like (I haven&#39;t tried many), though it&#39;s classified on here as an indica. It is relaxing, indeed.  It&#39;s also to energetic to be an effective insomnia med. It&#39;s WAY more euphoric than I&#39;m used to indicas feeling. Just so many fabulous feelings of well being. I think I finally know what actually euphoria feels like. This could be so helpful for people struggling with depression. \u000a\u000aMostly no anxiety. I did feel some typical pot paranoia when I vaped this on the lowest setting of my pax vaporizer. When I vaped on the third setting, it must have released all it&#39;s linalool then and now I don&#39;t feel anxiety, at all. So refreshing! Such a relief! It&#39;s Christmas eve and I&#39;m just at peace with the world (while intellectually knowing at the same time that it&#39;s very possibly fucked) but I&#39;m at peace with that right now, and later when I&#39;m not high I will pick up my banner of activism again. Everyone needs breaks. This strain is pure self care. I also feel very focused while writing this but also ironically as if I&#39;m in a lucid dream, but I&#39;m awake. Or am I???? I&#39;ll never know till I come back and read this later. Haha. \u000aEnjoy as needed, but use moderation, and tread carefully. I can see this strain as being potentially problematic if used regularly as an excessive escape. Not to self (and other addictive personalities out there) to all others: Enjoy!\u000aI really liked watching Imagine Dragons&#39; &quot;Believer&quot; video on youtube, while high on this strain.

VThis strain helped me out wonderfully with the extremely severe pain of gout. It didn\u2019t eliminate my pain altogether, but it brought it down to a much more tolerable level. The pain I\u2019m feeling now is dull, almost negligible. The high I have is also not very heavy or heady, and though I wish it did make me drowsy, I\u2019m actually feeling very awake and clear-headed.

Did give me wicked munchies, but most Indica&#39;s do that. The buds were beautiful, and the aroma is unbelievable. All of these things make this strain a must try for Indica lovers alike. Helped with my insomnia, slept like a baby. A great strain.
