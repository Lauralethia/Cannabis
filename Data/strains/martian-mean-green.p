VI must say, this strain is pretty potent and dense. First, the high is very mellow and relaxing, and it helps me go to sleep. It also makes me hungry and increases my appetite, which is good for me because I have a bad appetite and am trying to gain weight. Sooo, I&#39;d say this Mean Martian is the shit lol

VI would say 4.5 for this strain. Very good strain, high potency on the sativa side and there are few but very strong indica effects with this strain that I experienced. Would say more or less a good sativa dominant strain with some subtle but strong indica effects. Also, it is a fantastic blunt strain, tastes great and is a fantastic smoke too.
