VCome on who doesn&#39;t love a nice bowl of some good Blueberry before bed or after work or on a lazy weekend or maybe after a stressful situation or whatever other possible reason you can come up with it&#39;s I think the first pot I can remember smoking that actually had a name or one of them. Just picked up some bud from liberty reach which turned out pretty damn nice (respect) especially for 45 an eighth it&#39;s dense green and purple buds that are covered in frosty trichomes I  also picked up some wax that had great flavor and was running at about 75% THC  the high is very relaxing both physically and mentally it&#39;s very euphoric probably more of an end to the day than a beginning atleast for most. Blueberry is a Indica strain I will always feel comfortable buying if it looks good, if you haven&#39;t tried this yet, do.

VI used this original blueberry from Infinite Wellness Center in Lakewood, Co. to break a 5 day bought of mania. It took about 1.5 grams before it broke. I had heartburn for three solid days, it left as well. \u000aI had expected this would make me hungry, it didn&#39;t. The flavor is blueberry, berries.  Pretty soft smoke and doesn&#39;t expand much but even as a long time everyday user it was long lasting. You will reach the point of therapeutic benefit, then another hit of the water pipe every 45 minutes, no joint pain, feel relaxed, no racing thoughts. \u000aThe grower did a fine job and it was well cured and burned evenly.\u000aThank you cannabis.

VI had a hybrid variant of this - Thai Blueberry, c/o Boulder Botanicals - and, oh boy, is it knock-your-socks-off good. One of the most pleasant smelling strains, it also hits you quickly and intensely. The high is very uplifting, almost to the point of making you giggly, but doesn&#39;t suppress your energy as much as more pure indicas I&#39;ve had. It lasts a long time and is great to help boost conversation, creativity and, frankly, make you feel great.

VExcellent medicinally and recreationally! Vaping this Blueberry makes me sooo relaxed and calm it almost feels like how I would imagine having 3 drinks and taking a Vicodin feels. No anxiety. At all! In that sense of feeling -though unlike alcohol not actually BEING- less inhibited by one&#39;s inner criticism, it is like alcohol as well. Don&#39;t worry though, unlike alcohol or narcotics this gal won&#39;t inhibit your conscience or awareness itself, rather it is more the perception of it doing so that makes one feel so at ease and confident. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t recommend using this in the morning unless you have really bad nausea or a headache. By far Blueberry is the best nausea medication for me period. The vaped smell may smell like rotten papaya (Hash Plant has that same kind of smell going on too!), but somehow it calms my stomach down like no other.\u000a\u000aOther than mornings, Blueberry is great for all times of day. Whether for relaxing muscles and de-stressing after work, whether tokin&#39; up with friends to have a good giggly time, or whether easing into bed, Blueberry is definitely one of the most solid indica&#39;s out there. I feel like I&#39;m writing a commercial for this strain or something but it isn&#39;t that, I&#39;ve got real love for this one.

VOverall a great strain, at least for my problems. Though a hybrid, it is very heavy on the Indica. Typical Sativa effects are barely noticeable (at least in this batch); the only thing characteristic of a Sativa here is the lack of couch lock and some definite-head high. This is good, though, as I far prefer Indicas. There is a nice division between the body and head high, with a lovely tingling warmth in my belly and my creative juices flowing in my mind. \u000a\u000aAs for medical issues, this is one of the best strains I&#39;ve ever found for my headaches (cluster headache). I also have trouble with anxiety, which likewise melts away after consumption of this particular weed. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t get Blueberry from the smell or taste, but it&#39;s very pleasant tasting bud. The smell tends to be on the musty side in my experience, but the taste is fresh and bright. It is almost refreshing. \u000a\u000aOnly a few negatives... dry/red eyes and cottonmouth like you wouldn&#39;t believe. Also, horrendous nauseous when too much is consumed, but this is dose-dependent. You can smoke enough to get a great high without feeling sick, but there seems to be a fine line. Every so often I have too much and feel like I&#39;m going to vomit, but it seems to be a pretty rare occurrence and usually passes within 30-40 minutes. Other than that, it&#39;s all good. \u000a\u000aOverall rating: 8/10

VWhat an outstanding anxiety slasher. My body&#39;s anxiety rhythms were already in full bloom when my morning piled up with a long to-do list. This strain one-two tapped that nail of anxiety back flush with the board, and better yet, I&#39;ve got a great grin going. Typical indica effects are mostly present, in a very clean and not-overpowering way. Relaxing with minimal sedation, calm with minimal confusion, almost no couch lock.\u000a\u000aSuggested spiritual practice with this strain: Read a book or a sacred text. Or prayer/meditation.

VI was fortunate enough to judge this strain at the 2000 Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. HIGH TIMES were had by all of us that got to savor the giggly buzz from this bud. BTW if ever you get the chance to visit Amsterdam and don&#39;t want to get ripped at the &quot;tourist&quot; coffeeshops, try Happy People just a 5 minute walk from the train station.

VNow this is flavor. Sweet, smooth and tart, with a strong toasty berry undercurrent. Very nice.\u000a\u000a I&#39;m only an occasional smoker, so my tolerance is low. The THC percentage was about 16.5%, so it&#39;s not a very strong cut, but it was plenty strong enough for me. I&#39;ve smoked two joints so far, and the effects were exactly what I&#39;m looking for.\u000a\u000aIt onset very quickly. After the first puff or two, I could already feel the headchange, which initially was a gentle sativa head high. About 10 minutes later, however, the indica body stone began in my chest, progressing outward over the next half hour to the rest of my body and rapidly becoming the dominant effect, though the head high never completely disappeared. I could feel pleasant waves of ... I dunno ... energy(?) traveling from my head to my feet. Once I got into bed, I lost all desire to move and was massively relaxed, drifting easily into deep sleep.\u000a\u000aVery nice. Will pick up again for sure.

VBlueberry is definitely a strain that I will try again. It&#39;s one of the most powerful indica I ever tried. It really taste wild blueberries and it&#39;s so awesome in the mouth. The body buzz kill most pain and stress in the blink of an eye. My only critique come from the head buzz trip that I find hard to manage with this buds at times. My tip is to reduce the quantity you vaporize at first to see your reaction and the increase the dosage when you know your tolerance level. A beginner and a weekend smoker should approach this strain with caution but will really love it if he or she manage it well in term of quantity.

VI picked this strain of blueberry up at WashingtonHerbal Remedies the other day and wow, is what I have to say. The smell, the look, and the taste was just off the charts. Smelled like a fresh bowl of blueberries, looked like a beautiful picked and grown plant, and the taste was smooth, rich, and flavorful. It&#39;s sticky but not too sticky. It&#39;s not the sticky where it&#39;s like super glue and you can&#39;t get off your fingers. It grinds up nicely for a joint or a blunt and is perfect for packing a bowl and will cherry nicely. It&#39;s a nice level high with just a bit of couch lock. Didn&#39;t get to much of the munchies from this strain. All in all it&#39;s a great strain to smoke with a few friends at night out on a deck with some music going(yes that&#39;s what I did). So again, a nice level high, beautiful bud, great smell and taste, and great for when your with a few friends and just relaxing.

It is good for all over body pain and has a beautiful berry smell and purple inner core of its&#39; nugs. \u000a\u000aAlso, look to M.O.B. to help you see the forest through the trees.

VTrue Blueberry is hard to find; much like my review on Chocolate Chunk, it all depends on how passionate the grower is about bringing out that flavor.  When you do find it, though, it&#39;s one of the best.  I&#39;d happily trade an ounce of Gorilla Glue for an eighth of well grown blueberry.  And that&#39;s REALLY saying something!

VWOW!!! What made me try blueberry was the blue cheese strain. Knowing blueberry was a parent of blue cheese I figured I would like this strain. And I love this strain!!!! At first you don&#39;t feel anything, but wait for it.... And it started from my toes and worked its way through your body. You begin to melt like warm butter on a hot day! Then out of nowhere, you get happy for no apparent reason and nothing matters. Blueberry reminds me of the 80&#39;s when weed was weed and it made you feel loose and happy. It relieved my back pain in 5 minutes and was able to relax.\u000a\u000aUpdate: this is a day time pain reliever. It did not put me asleep and the effects (which are great) last a long time. I did have a hard time sleeping and would never smoke this again at night if I plan on heading to bed. But this is a great pain reliever!

VI want to give this six stars.  I\u2019m a Sativa girl. I don\u2019t usually give two shits about heavy indicas like this , but this is special. Starting with its flavor. It actually tastes like blueberries. The exhale is fucking magic. Everything I ate afterward came with a tinge of blueberry. I feel like I\u2019m in a blueberry right now. Or maybe I am a blueberry. I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m typing this.  I can\u2019t even walk straight after 2 bong rips. Like I said I\u2019m in to sativas and I like an activated, racy high. but the body high from this is incredible. I\u2019m a floating blueberry. Perfect for lulling you into a pleasant coma when you just need your day to be DONE. Someone is either breaking into or out of my house now and I don\u2019t even care my body is like blueberry jelly right now. \u000a\u000aEnjoy in good health. Don\u2019t give to newbies.

VEver since I found this strain, about two years ago, I always stock up.\u000a\u000aClocking in at 25.3 THC, the onset is slow and comfortable, full body buzz, dreamy head high, and oddly enough, focused. \u000a\u000aFor the best taste, I suggest a vape.

VThis is the perfect night time strain for me. It&#39;s a very relaxing high. The second I sparked up some of this Blueberry, I immediately felt the sedating indica effects. Not only is this strain good for sleeping, but if it&#39;s grown well, it has one of the best smells/tastes in the cannabis kingdom. It tasted like fresh blueberry muffins right out of the oven. Hell, this strain was so good that i actually thought i ate blueberry muffins. I would definitely recommend giving Blueberry a try.

VIf grown well, an absolute favorite.  The smell is amazing: Strong blueberry/fruity at first, with that sort of poopy aftersmell coming in just slightly on its heels.  The look is beautiful: Light green, covered in trichrome goodness with orange hairs freckled throughout.  Pulling a nug off and giving it a squeeze, it&#39;s dense and firm, but not particularly sticky.  Throw it in the grinder, it&#39;s dense, but grinds up nicely.  It always seems to grind up to more than you anticipate.  Load up a bowl in a bong, bubbler, or pipe, and you&#39;ll taste the blueberry/fruitiness as soon as you take the hit.  It hits smooth, the blueberry taste lingering in your mouth after the exhale, with little to no coughing.  The high comes on within a minute or two, feeling it in your head before it worked its way down your body.  It leaves you feeling relaxed and at ease, perfect for the evening/nighttime (it&#39;ll put you to sleep if you smoke enough!).  Wouldn&#39;t recommend it for mornings/daytime, unless you don&#39;t have much to do.  It&#39;s not that you can&#39;t necessarily get up and do anything, depending on your motivation level, but rather the high is much more enjoyable when spent relaxing.  The high lasted a good while, around an hour or so.  It works well, for me at least, for pain management, stress/anxiety, and insomnia.  Also good for sex, although it&#39;s no Northern Lights in that regard!  Overall, an excellent bud to fire up at the end of a long day and kick back on the couch and watch a good movie.  You&#39;ll immediately relax and feel the stress melt away.  Also perfect to enjoy nature outside, not for the hiking or physical activity, but for the scenery!  Enjoy!

VStrikingly brightens vision and increases saturation, but eyes want to defocus a tad -which has to be fought. High is mostly in the head and gets rocked with intensity like Fire OG. There\u2019s just enough mood elevation to still have fun with it all, but it comes close to the line. There\u2019s a strong current of edginess in the chest that\u2019s been consistent every time I smoke this strain. It\u2019s manageable for the most part due to the positive vibes balancing out, but it\u2019s stronger than most and adds a surging, unsettled current that can be adventuresome. It is a capable high that you can concentrate and work on while listening to music and feeling good about being so productive. Its capableness is further demonstrated by the fact it was the one strain I smoked while exploring the busy streets of NYC by foot/bike for a few days. It worked fine, no regrets, and monumentally better than nothing - but truthfully, I would have preferred a deeper, more cinematic strain like a kush. It made for some incredible, once-in-a-lifetime memories though, so it\u2019s hard to fault much. Watching movies/shows/etc are memorably impactful. Music is hard to keep up with, but it\u2019s encompassing with a euphoria that\u2019s emotionally moving and elated. Strong energy and uplifting mood makes it great for wake-and-bake, day smoking, and work. Euphoria has largely wiped out the raciness in the chest 5-10 mins into the high. I remember J1 having a similar edgy hurdle that would diminish a few mins in. Just have to ride it out\u2026 Overall, intense, feel-good, energetic, and seems to be turning cozier and more stoned the more it settles in.

VThis is the first non-CBD strain I&#39;ve grown and tried. I only started growing medicine for my anxiety and insomnia about 2 years ago. So far, they&#39;ve all been CBD strains. Before that, I only experimented in my youth and had a lot of mixed reactions to cannabis. Most of the time it would make me panic and paranoid. The CBD strains I grew were very different from how I remembered it. I attributed this to CBD - but I wanted to research more into other regular strains. \u000a\u000aI chose Blueberry from Dutch Passion as my first for this task, as it seems from the CBD strains previous I grew, that Indica is more my kind of thing. I wanted to try a well known, common Indica with good reviews which showed uses for anxiety and insomnia. This all pointed further towards this strain. \u000a\u000aThis was also the first Auto-Flowering plant I&#39;ve ever grown. \u000a\u000aTHE REVIEW:\u000aNow that the introduction and background is out of the way. I am pleased to say that my first venture outside of a product sold as a CBD plant was still enjoyable. I still didn&#39;t get paranoid or panicky, and it was still very good for my medical needs, by helping me get to sleep. \u000a\u000aThe initial vape hit offered very pleasant flavours. Unlike previous citrus varieties I was used to, this one definitely have more berry undertones. It had a slightly juicy vibe to it. \u000a\u000aI have to say, I did notice a slight euphoria that I found stronger in comparison to the milder breeds I am used to. Then again, being a light user and relatively new to it all - I should be considered a lightweight. At first it caught me by surprise and as I became very couchlocked I momentarily got a little worried I wouldn&#39;t be able to handle it. Definitely a little more fluttery feeling compared to the previous CBD strains I used. However, my worries soon melted away and I fell into a pleasant daze that distracted me from any stress or worries I had. It effectively allowed my brain to switch off sufficiently to relax. \u000a\u000aAfter a few more vapes I went to bed - feeling a little unbalanced on the way! I found it mildly cerebral which did concern me at first. I began to have that feeling that I may not fall asleep due to racing thoughts. Another vape hit and my body melted further into bed and my mind eventually distracted in thoughts, drifted off to sleep. \u000a\u000aSUMMARY:\u000aTasty flavours of berry and sweetness. Couchlock heaviness good for insomnia with a surrounding uplifting and mildly cerebral accompanying effect.

VLove this strain because it&#39;s an Indica. The taste to me is more like the cereal &#39;fruity pebbles&#39;. The smell is right ob though. That nostalgic artificial blueberry smell we are familiar with. This is a THC vape oil. But the effects on the mind and body are almost immediate. Calm relaxation and a out of it spacey feeling. Pain fades away very quickly. And all you want to do is lay down on a cloud and float away. Top shelf!

VOne of the best stains out there when it&#39;s top quality, and this flower I ordered from Yerba is tops, ya dig? It is certainly an Indica in effect, but doesn&#39;t bowl you over with sedation. It is a nice, soothing body high along with a gentle cerebral nudge that fades away long before the relaxation does. I prefer to read before bed, this is perfect for that Sci-fi, fantasy, or historical novel you got. You&#39;ll be so perfectly absorbed that before you know it, you&#39;ll be travelling through middle earth, the detailed descriptive words of Tolkien painting every corner of you imagination or you&#39;ll be that union organizer, rallying the miners to not just strike, but to arms! I love good quality blueberry, it&#39;s a treat. If you see it, ask your tender or friend if it is a nice batch. Enjoy comrades.

VMethod of consumption - Flower; Smoking. \u000a\u000a---- \u000aSmell - I will divvy this category up in three pieces; Full flower, grounded up flower, and smoke.\u000a\u000aFull - It was rather pungent. The earthy profile was overpowering that I can only pick up on blueberry tones subtly. Mostly herbal (like tea or pine), spice, and chestnuts.\u000a\u000aGround - The blueberry-like fruity smell immediately filled my nose as soon I worked at it with a grinder. Very true to its name. Sweet and fruity.\u000a\u000aSmoke - The said earthy profile came back in this stage. It was a wonderful mix of blueberry, sweet earth (like cooked chestnuts), and spice. Amazing.\u000a\u000a---- \u000aTaste - Smooth and sweet. I don&#39;t taste blueberry (or general berry flavor) as much as I hoped, but that is okay because I like earthy herbal tea flavors too.\u000a\u000a---- \u000aEffect - This strain is very mellow for me. The body and cerebral high is soft. Euphoric as well. I can only think of having your own white noise going in your head and body as an analogy to how it feels. Stress after a hard day peeled off my neck and back but it was done slowly. (Which is nice because my body could get accustomed to being completely relaxed at the end of &quot;melting&quot;.)\u000a\u000aHowever, this is definitely an indica; It did put me to sleep. I also had a full eight hours of sleep. Perfect for insomniacs.\u000a\u000a\u000a--- \u000aNegatives - Dry mouth at the beginning, but after few more inhalations, it isn&#39;t noticeable. Dry eyes is evident as soon i woke up from my awesome sleep. (Might be just me.)\u000a\u000a --- \u000aMunchies - Medium to high. I ate a bowl of ice cream and some cookies. I was tempted to eat a bowl of oatmeal with peanut butter, but luckily I was full and knackered out (was getting really drowsy after my first cookie).\u000a\u000a--- \u000aExtra - Highly recommendable to all kinds of smoker; Beginners to experts. Great pre-bedtime medication.

VI have written a review on this strain before, but I recently purchased a live resin batter and it is amazing. I detect fruity notes as I dab it through my bong and feel a prevalent tingling body high. I must say this is one of the best strains for insomnia relief, pain relief, and lack of appetite. If it was related to a comic book it would be like absorbing energy of the Blue Lantern Corps, this is truly a peaceful strain.

VVaped double blueberry, nice and kief-y which was to my surprise.  My mouth watered from this bowl full of lush blueberries. Makes for typical indica body relaxation and yet also boasts high THC which resulted in a giddy, mind numbing and tingly experience. Your mind will feel hazy after a sesh of blueberry so it&#39;s better for night time relaxation and expect sleepy headedness.

It does indeed taste like blueberries. \u000aHowever, the effects of Blueberry on it&#39;s own and all of it&#39;s descendants that I&#39;ve tried give me this indescribable anxiety. Also my muscles feel vaguely achey. Every time. I&#39;ve had this with strains I didn&#39;t know were related to Blueberry until I researched them later so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just a negative placebo effect. \u000aI see why many people love it.

VFantastic.  I&#39;ve moved to distillates/vaping recently, so this review is based on the Blueberry distillate offered by Flyte (purchased at LotusLand North Vancouver).  \u000a\u000aInterestingly enough, the flavours of &quot;Blueberry&quot; are still quite prominent even in the distillate/vape format - a nice bonus.  Anyway, this is 2 pulls and sleep for me - exactly what I wanted for night time use.  I like something to relax me in the evenings, not make me feel uselessly stoned or high, no paranoia, no anxiety - I sought deep, relaxing, warm, comforting, peaceful &quot;mellow&quot; from this strain, and it delivered.\u000a\u000aFlavourful, strong/potent, medium duration of effect, creeps steadily within first 20min and keeps you there, very calming and relaxing.  I like the fact it&#39;s not a paranoid high, or jittery/anxious high, or &quot;drunken stupor&quot; high - it&#39;s a quality clean almost dare I say &quot;narcotic&quot; feel to it, and what I mean by that is &quot;very specific and accurate as to what it effects and where&quot;; as opposed to some of the strains out there that just &quot;blanket bake&quot; you entirely - head to toe - for hours - that&#39;s it - done - finished - wasted...  This strain seems precise in its effect - I really like it.\u000a\u000aI used to enjoy GDP as a bedtime nightcap; but I too found it a bit racy or strong in some ways on some nights.  Still a terrific strain for sure, but Blueberry seems more subtle and refined - yet still retaining the potency and heavy effects (for relaxation and sleep).  Really a nice strain.

VSmoked about two bowls now and im an hour in. thats not to bad and i have a very strong buzz in my head. going to consume a tiny bit more @ 11:15.\u000aAfter smoking one and a half more bowls i feel pretty stoned but its not a SUPER heavy high. I still have my wits about me and Breathe Carolina is sounding about 20 times better right now. Good memories to that album, and good weed to compliment it all :]

VI really want to love this strain. The smell and taste are amazing. Especially vaped. It does indeed taste like blueberries. \u000aHowever, the effects of Blueberry on it&#39;s own and all of it&#39;s descendants that I&#39;ve tried give me this indescribable anxiety. Also my muscles feel vaguely achey. Every time. I&#39;ve had this with strains I didn&#39;t know were related to Blueberry until I researched them later so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just a negative placebo effect. \u000aI see why many people love it. It&#39;s not for me.

VVaped double blueberry, nice and kief-y which was to my surprise.  My mouth watered from this bowl full of lush blueberries. Makes for typical indica body relaxation and yet also boasts high THC which resulted in a giddy, mind numbing and tingly experience. Your mind will feel hazy after a sesh of blueberry so it&#39;s better for night time relaxation and expect sleepy headedness.

VWow! This was a strong one... This is a wonderful Indica for Insomnia. Right off the bat, this made me super relaxed with a good giggly, euphoric and uplifting feeling. I felt a great relief of stress, my anxiety and depression seemed to melt away. I also personally use this to help prevent seizures, although there is not really any CBD in this strain.\u000a\u000aThis had a good sweet and fruity clean smell to it, but I used the live sugar concentrate. So the breakdown on percentages of the concentrate that I got goes like this:\u000a\u000aTHC - 5.6%\u000aTHCA - 72.6%\u000aCBD - 0.00%\u000aCBDA - 2.3%\u000a\u000aTotal - 80.5%

VFantastic.  I&#39;ve moved to distillates/vaping recently, so this review is based on the Blueberry distillate offered by Flyte (purchased at LotusLand North Vancouver).  \u000a\u000aInterestingly enough, the flavours of &quot;Blueberry&quot; are still quite prominent even in the distillate/vape format - a nice bonus.  Anyway, this is 2 pulls and sleep for me - exactly what I wanted for night time use.  I like something to relax me in the evenings, not make me feel uselessly stoned or high, no paranoia, no anxiety - I sought deep, relaxing, warm, comforting, peaceful &quot;mellow&quot; from this strain, and it delivered.\u000a\u000aFlavourful, strong/potent, medium duration of effect, creeps steadily within first 20min and keeps you there, very calming and relaxing.  I like the fact it&#39;s not a paranoid high, or jittery/anxious high, or &quot;drunken stupor&quot; high - it&#39;s a quality clean almost dare I say &quot;narcotic&quot; feel to it, and what I mean by that is &quot;very specific and accurate as to what it effects and where&quot;; as opposed to some of the strains out there that just &quot;blanket bake&quot; you entirely - head to toe - for hours - that&#39;s it - done - finished - wasted...  This strain seems precise in its effect - I really like it.\u000a\u000aI used to enjoy GDP as a bedtime nightcap; but I too found it a bit racy or strong in some ways on some nights.  Still a terrific strain for sure, but Blueberry seems more subtle and refined - yet still retaining the potency and heavy effects (for relaxation and sleep).  Really a nice strain.

VBlueberry is relaxed smoothness for the soul. I have Crohns and started using marijuana for it, and I can almost function as a normal human being now. This smoke is smoother than most, but don&#39;t let that fool you. It is strong. I wake up every morning in pain and vomiting. I have my blueberry and let it do it&#39;s work. My only problem then is I am so relaxed and calm that I don&#39;t feel like leaving my cozy smoke shack. The lure of a relaxing bath and music usually win over. Take a relaxing bath, read a book, practice Spanish on your phone app, just relax and enjoy the relaxing, calming,  pain relief wash over you. On a side note I switched from a lemon strain cause the dark heavy smoke gave me a cough so bad I broke my own ribs. If you are tired of chronic coughing but need pain relief,  and anxiety/stress reliever blueberry is the fix. This strain suppresses my appetite it&#39;s an up or downside,  however you want to look at it. If you want to loose weight, it made me lose weight. I have to not smoke sometimes, just so I feel like eating. Worth it for how much it does for my Crohns.

After I grind it up, I find myself only packing 2-3 hitter bowls. For one reason, I don&#39;t want to smoke it fast because I like it so much and the other, it hits hard. Right in the middle of the head upon exhale and gives you a nice long relaxing high. I always pick her up when I see this strain around.

VI am definitely a sativa girl, but I like a nice strong indica to help me shut down and get a good night sleep. My budtender at Medizin in Las Vegas pointed me in this direction and I&#39;m in love.\u000a\u000aThe blueberry smell alone was enough to make my mouth water and it tasted just as good. The high is heavy and numbing and perfect as a nightcap. Yesterday I also tried it on some especially horrific menstrual cramps with good success. I smoked a bowl, took a nap and woke up feeling better. It wasn&#39;t enough to make me swear off Tylenol, but it allowed me to get through the rest of my day without pain blanking out all other thought processes lol.\u000a\u000aThis is my new go-to night time indica.

VTried this from a local medical dispensary when they finally had it available because I&#39;ve always wanted to try that &quot;old-school&quot; Blueberry instead of the newer mixed strains.  Happy to say it exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aIt didn&#39;t take much.  After my second bong hit I could feel the effects rushing in.  After my 6th, I put it down!  I found the high well balanced.  Very intense body effect, but also quite cerebral too.  Love that taste and smell.\u000a\u000aI bought this to help with insomnia, but it took about an hour or two for things to slow down where I felt really relaxed enough to sleep.  Normally I&#39;d slash a star for not being what I expected, but it more than made up for it in other attributes.  I find it does help sleep in lower doses, like just a couple good hits.  Much more and I find the cerebral effects keep the sleep from happening.

V++ Blueberry Kush ++ \u000aRight off the bat, when you see this blueberry you&#39;ll know it! It was covered in crystals all over and the stems looked more frosted than usual. This strain is great for anyone who wants to relax, sit in their favorite chair or watch a movie or be outdoors. It really seems to calm down the effects of ADHD significantly(personal note/experience).\u000a\u000a

Danker than you&#39;d believe.  Smokes smooth.  Not one of the more powerful strains I&#39;ve smoke, but the high was extremely enjoyable.  No negative side effects except for cotton mouth.  The dizziness it caused me whenever I stood up was enjoyable given the state of mind I was in.  Great shit.

VWe grew Dutch Passion Blueberry four times now, and we will grow six more plants in 2018.  We grew DP Blueberry first in 2016 and she finishes in about 55-63 days indoors after the 12/12 flip.  Blueberry has not been difficult to grow, and she is fun to watch grow with the oooohs and aaaahhhhs starting about Week 4 flower.  In our first BB grow, we used a simple 5-gallon bucket with 3 gallons of water and nutes with airstone.  We changed out nutes every week, and we just topped her twice with no other training, and she grew to about 23 inches tall and very rigid and solid beams.  She had nice fat buds and gave us about 43 grams.  Grew her a few more times now and vegged her 18/6 for 4 weeks under LED and then flipped to 12/12.  Used the manifold training technique by Nebua over at Grow Weed Easy and defoliated biggest fan leaves just before the switch to 12/12 and defoliated her big fan leaves again on Day 21 of Flower, cleaned all the pesky shit and small branches from the bottom 1/3rd then let her go.  Frickin solid beast each time.  She stands around 42\u201d- 44\u201d tall with eight monster beams with solid colas of 20&quot;- 31&quot; with nice buds that run up and down the beams. We let all the sidebranching grow out and we are getting about 2.5 - 3 mason jars full after drying (1 plant).  Dried her out for seven days, clipped off buds, and then put into quart mason jars with a small Boveda 62 pack.  Waited about 30 days and tested her out.  Absolutely killer buzz that is much appreciated at the end of the day.  Makes you melt into your chair.  Seeds a little pricey at times, but worth it. Grow out a nice mother and clone.  Aloha!

VTried this from a local medical dispensary when they finally had it available because I&#39;ve always wanted to try that &quot;old-school&quot; Blueberry instead of the newer mixed strains.  Happy to say it exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aIt didn&#39;t take much.  After my second bong hit I could feel the effects rushing in.  After my 6th, I put it down!  I found the high well balanced.  Very intense body effect, but also quite cerebral too.  Love that taste and smell.\u000a\u000aI bought this to help with insomnia, but it took about an hour or two for things to slow down where I felt really relaxed enough to sleep.  Normally I&#39;d slash a star for not being what I expected, but it more than made up for it in other attributes.  I find it does help sleep in lower doses, like just a couple good hits.  Much more and I find the cerebral effects keep the sleep from happening.

VCan&#39;t get much better. This strain smells like blueberries when it&#39;s the real strain and grown right. The buds almost entirely purple with hints of orange hairs. After I grind it up, I find myself only packing 2-3 hitter bowls. For one reason, I don&#39;t want to smoke it fast because I like it so much and the other, it hits hard. Right in the middle of the head upon exhale and gives you a nice long relaxing high. I always pick her up when I see this strain around.

Absolutely killer buzz that is much appreciated at the end of the day.  Makes you melt into your chair.  Seeds a little pricey at times, but worth it. Grow out a nice mother and clone.  Aloha!

VTried this from a local medical dispensary when they finally had it available because I&#39;ve always wanted to try that &quot;old-school&quot; Blueberry instead of the newer mixed strains.  Happy to say it exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aIt didn&#39;t take much.  After my second bong hit I could feel the effects rushing in.  After my 6th, I put it down!  I found the high well balanced.  Very intense body effect, but also quite cerebral too.  Love that taste and smell.\u000a\u000aI bought this to help with insomnia, but it took about an hour or two for things to slow down where I felt really relaxed enough to sleep.  Normally I&#39;d slash a star for not being what I expected, but it more than made up for it in other attributes.  I find it does help sleep in lower doses, like just a couple good hits.  Much more and I find the cerebral effects keep the sleep from happening.

VI am definitely a sativa girl, but I like a nice strong indica to help me shut down and get a good night sleep. My budtender at Medizin in Las Vegas pointed me in this direction and I&#39;m in love.\u000a\u000aThe blueberry smell alone was enough to make my mouth water and it tasted just as good. The high is heavy and numbing and perfect as a nightcap. Yesterday I also tried it on some especially horrific menstrual cramps with good success. I smoked a bowl, took a nap and woke up feeling better. It wasn&#39;t enough to make me swear off Tylenol, but it allowed me to get through the rest of my day without pain blanking out all other thought processes lol.\u000a\u000aThis is my new go-to night time indica.

VFloral and berry aromas from dense little bright green nugs with tints of blue. Bright stubby orange hairs with moderate trich. Smoke is very smooth and tasty with dried flowers on berries. No lung expansion with quick mild cough shortly after smoke. Effect is immediately relaxed, sedated and happy. Happiness fades after 10 minutes and sedation continues and seems to linger until sleeping it off. Don\u2019t recommend for wake and bakes. Great for late nights and treating insomnia.\u000aI don\u2019t get blueberry unless I plan to hibernate.

VWe grew Dutch Passion Blueberry four times now, and we will grow six more plants in 2018.  We grew DP Blueberry first in 2016 and she finishes in about 55-63 days indoors after the 12/12 flip.  Blueberry has not been difficult to grow, and she is fun to watch grow with the oooohs and aaaahhhhs starting about Week 4 flower.  In our first BB grow, we used a simple 5-gallon bucket with 3 gallons of water and nutes with airstone.  We changed out nutes every week, and we just topped her twice with no other training, and she grew to about 23 inches tall and very rigid and solid beams.  She had nice fat buds and gave us about 43 grams.  Grew her a few more times now and vegged her 18/6 for 4 weeks under LED and then flipped to 12/12.  Used the manifold training technique by Nebua over at Grow Weed Easy and defoliated biggest fan leaves just before the switch to 12/12 and defoliated her big fan leaves again on Day 21 of Flower, cleaned all the pesky shit and small branches from the bottom 1/3rd then let her go.  Frickin solid beast each time.  She stands around 42\u201d- 44\u201d tall with eight monster beams with solid colas of 20&quot;- 31&quot; with nice buds that run up and down the beams. We let all the sidebranching grow out and we are getting about 2.5 - 3 mason jars full after drying (1 plant).  Dried her out for seven days, clipped off buds, and then put into quart mason jars with a small Boveda 62 pack.  Waited about 30 days and tested her out.

They come on VERY slowly so be careful. I usually fill my airizer and take 2-5 hits for insomnia but I took 1 small one and am happy with the effects. I see how this one could cause some anxiety but as long as you take it in small amounts and wait a good 10 or even 15 in between doses you&#39;ll be good &#128521;

VBlueberry was one of the earliest strains that I know was what it was labeled, circa. 1984 when I was in Portland, OR.\u000aI was re-introduced to it not long ago and it was an intensely-relaxing high that soon gave way to a gentle euphoria...is good for insomnia or when you know you need to sleep. One of my favorite indica-dominate strains.

VI had waited a long time to be able to try this strain as it is listed as a top tier indica for insomnia. I was disappointed. For me, I didn\u2019t find it sedating whatsoever. Went through 1/8 of it, not once made me feel sleepy. I found it to be pretty cerebral and stimulating. Other than that, this strain smells amazing and tastes amazing! Shame it doesn\u2019t work like an indica..

VI had Blueberry Dream in concentrate form before Blueberry, as the first-ever thing I vaped. Blueberry, I tried as freshly-grown and quick-dried flower without a proper cure-- the tip of the top cola had to come off because there was mold reaching up toward it in the buds below. It might have been an early harvest, but the buds were so dense and sticky that I thought I&#39;d better get it drying before more mold set in.  \u000a\u000aThe early sample of Blueberry was intoxicating and took me back to the first time I really experienced weed: with its daughter Blueberry Dream. It was a very similar high, gentle but swift and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. I&#39;m getting all that again with Blueberry, with no real difference between the two experiences. There is also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aI have read that an early harvest will give you the plant at its more psychoactive. I&#39;m definitely getting hit hard and strong by this lady-- way harder than with Blueberry Dream!-- even though I mauled off plenty of kief going through the bud for mold and ripping it into small bits by hand. Then the method of drying was to sandwich them in tinfoil and heat them at 250 F for twenty minutes, flipping them over at the middle mark. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s completely terrible for getting a sense of what the bud would be like as quality weed that&#39;s been properly dried and cured for months, and I&#39;m still getting my socks knocked off over here. If it gets significantly stronger, it might be able to challenge Candyland for the most powerful effects I&#39;ve ever felt. I&#39;m calm, relaxed, focused if I work at it and that keeps me alert too, dissociated from my physical body enough that it&#39;s almost like watching a movie, but not worried about it. I feel safe, like being held in a really good hug. Loud, sudden noises are a bit more jarring, but don&#39;t scare me-- I&#39;m not anxious. I can sort of maybe tell that I could be, but I consciously push it away firmly, like &quot;no, thank you--&quot; and that works.  \u000a\u000aThe strength and pleasantness of this surprised me. It&#39;s euphoric for the heart that just wants a sea of calm and some renewed faith that things are going to get better, that the future is near and holds both the joy of creation and success. Blueberry Dream is a 4 for me, but Blueberry herself, at least in this plant, is a 5.

VA strain that is always a treat to have, one of my favourites, and definitely my favourite Hybrid. It&#39;s an evening smoke for sure... nice after a long day, makes you enjoy food like never before and you will sleep through and earthquake after a couple of joints ;) Had but one nicely packed spliff last night.. completely fucked with my face. I felt my brain fall through my arse, and the munchies were unreal... everything tasted to damn good!! Made my limbs feel heavy, so if you&#39;re smoking at home... whack on a film, make sure you have adequate munch and moisture NEXT to you and prepare for epic couch lock. You may find yourself with an inexplicable goofy grin upon your face at first.. from then on it&#39;s chink-eye central. The bud itself looks fucking tasty enough to eat and has a wonderful berry scent, even the smoke is purply.. i swear!! Would give it a 10, but had a bit of a headache once it wore off. Buy a fat eighth... and roll a joint ;)

VI was not a fan of blueberry. Although the taste was A+, the indica was so heavy it put me to sleep. I have never experienced such an overpowering urge to sleep in my life. I wouldn\u2019t recommend smoking Blueberry unless you\u2019re looking to treat insomnia or smoking a joint for the taste of it. The strain isn\u2019t all that special, but a solid late, late night smoke

VThis is one of those strains that if you\u2019ve been smoking/vaping for any decent amount of time you have to have tried it at least attempted to obtain it.  If you don\u2019t know about the Luda song Blueberry Yum Yum then you need to go listen to it now even if you don\u2019t like rap; the song describes the amazingness of this strain clearly and concise.\u000a\u000aThe strain I have is from ACC Enterprises out of Pahrump and supporting local Nevada growers is a bonus for me.  I wish the nugs were a little bigger however, this is a kief generator extraordinaire and smells amazing.  The first bag on the volcano fills the room with the smell of berries and tastes amazingly sweet through 2-3 bags around 355-365.  I up the temp to 375 for final bags and that is where you feel a bit more couch locked.  I feel vaping at lower temps creates a more creative and euphoric high rather than let\u2019s sit back and binge watch Netflix.  This strain makes me want to listen to music or play my guitar (badly no bragging here) but it\u2019s still fun.

VBlueberry is one of my favourite strains of all time. It really does have some blueberry smell to it, And it feels like a powerful heavy indica when I vape or smoke it. The high helps my hands and feet feel better, and sometimes they even feel amazing. It makes the whole body feel good and it&#39;s good for chronic pain. I usually vape other high 1:1 or 1:2 CBD strains for medicinal purposes but when I want a good indica which is mostly in the evening I usually go for Blueberry, such a great strain. And in social surroundings my friends and I have often had a blast after sharing a joint of Blueberry, uplifting fun high with lots of laughter, but you will feel tired after the high starts to fade. \u000a\u000aI prefer to vape this one starting somewhere around 180C (356F) because at a low temperature the smell and taste of blueberry is most prominent, much more so than smoking it. To use the whole bowl I bump up the temperature to 190C or 200C (374F to 392F) to get the benefit of the whole herb without wanting the smoke that comes with combustion. \u000a\u000aOne final comment about the smell. It&#39;s the best smelling herb I&#39;ve tried. How much blueberry you smell or taste is subjective and I have friends who don&#39;t smell the blueberry at all, so-to-speak, but I do and I like the effects very much too and believe that many connoisseurs of herb will always keep Blueberry on their top shelf and among their favorites. It&#39;s easy to grow and breed with, too, for people who are breeding new cannabis strains based on Blueberry. Like standing on the shoulders of giants.

VI was quite surprised with this. I&#39;ve been depressed and overly stressed for the passed few weeks and Blueberry helped a lot thinking things through.

VA strain that is always a treat to have, one of my favourites, and definitely my favourite Hybrid. It&#39;s an evening smoke for sure... nice after a long day, makes you enjoy food like never before and you will sleep through and earthquake after a couple of joints ;) Had but one nicely packed spliff last night.. completely fucked with my face. I felt my brain fall through my arse, and the munchies were unreal... everything tasted to damn good!! Made my limbs feel heavy, so if you&#39;re smoking at home... whack on a film, make sure you have adequate munch and moisture NEXT to you and prepare for epic couch lock. You may find yourself with an inexplicable goofy grin upon your face at first.. from then on it&#39;s chink-eye central. The bud itself looks fucking tasty enough to eat and has a wonderful berry scent, even the smoke is purply.. i swear!! Would give it a 10, but had a bit of a headache once it wore off. Buy a fat eighth... and roll a joint ;)

VUnfortunately this is not a strain i would recommend to anyone who smokes regularly. While it did taste good and did help somewhat it had a weak high. The THC and CBD levels are very low so someone who smokes on occasion or has a very low tolerance than this is the bud for you. Very beautiful flower otherwise.

VBlueberry is a potent indica that does not creep on you. It hit me hard after I had only one normal sized bowl off of a pipe. I was greeted with a rush of bliss and relaxation in my body. The body high makes your body feels like it&#39;s melting into the surface your laying on. This strain&#39;s sleepy body high and happy, giddy head high make you couch locked but still social and talkative. Blueberry smells like the name suggests, very sweet and berry like. The bud is very dense and has some dark purple hues. It helped a lot with my sleeping disorder and mild back pain along with anxiety and stress. I can&#39;t recommend this strain enough to people who feel strung out or has high anxiety.

It was a very similar high, gentle but swift and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. I&#39;m getting all that again with Blueberry, with no real difference between the two experiences. There is also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aI have read that an early harvest will give you the plant at its more psychoactive. I&#39;m definitely getting hit hard and strong by this lady-- way harder than with Blueberry Dream!-- even though I mauled off plenty of kief going through the bud for mold and ripping it into small bits by hand. Then the method of drying was to sandwich them in tinfoil and heat them at 250 F for twenty minutes, flipping them over at the middle mark. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s completely terrible for getting a sense of what the bud would be like as quality weed that&#39;s been properly dried and cured for months, and I&#39;m still getting my socks knocked off over here.

VThis is one of those strains that if you\u2019ve been smoking/vaping for any decent amount of time you have to have tried it at least attempted to obtain it.  If you don\u2019t know about the Luda song Blueberry Yum Yum then you need to go listen to it now even if you don\u2019t like rap; the song describes the amazingness of this strain clearly and concise.\u000a\u000aThe strain I have is from ACC Enterprises out of Pahrump and supporting local Nevada growers is a bonus for me.  I wish the nugs were a little bigger however, this is a kief generator extraordinaire and smells amazing.  The first bag on the volcano fills the room with the smell of berries and tastes amazingly sweet through 2-3 bags around 355-365.  I up the temp to 375 for final bags and that is where you feel a bit more couch locked.  I feel vaping at lower temps creates a more creative and euphoric high rather than let\u2019s sit back and binge watch Netflix.  This strain makes me want to listen to music or play my guitar (badly no bragging here) but it\u2019s still fun.

VI had Blueberry Dream in concentrate form before Blueberry, as the first-ever thing I vaped. Blueberry, I tried as freshly-grown and quick-dried flower without a proper cure-- the tip of the top cola had to come off because there was mold reaching up toward it in the buds below. It might have been an early harvest, but the buds were so dense and sticky that I thought I&#39;d better get it drying before more mold set in.  \u000a\u000aThe early sample of Blueberry was intoxicating and took me back to the first time I really experienced weed: with its daughter Blueberry Dream. It was a very similar high, gentle but swift and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. I&#39;m getting all that again with Blueberry, with no real difference between the two experiences. There is also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aI have read that an early harvest will give you the plant at its more psychoactive. I&#39;m definitely getting hit hard and strong by this lady-- way harder than with Blueberry Dream!-- even though I mauled off plenty of kief going through the bud for mold and ripping it into small bits by hand. Then the method of drying was to sandwich them in tinfoil and heat them at 250 F for twenty minutes, flipping them over at the middle mark. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s completely terrible for getting a sense of what the bud would be like as quality weed that&#39;s been properly dried and cured for months, and I&#39;m still getting my socks knocked off over here. If it gets significantly stronger, it might be able to challenge Candyland for the most powerful effects I&#39;ve ever felt.

VBlueberry is one of my favourite strains of all time. It really does have some blueberry smell to it, And it feels like a powerful heavy indica when I vape or smoke it. The high helps my hands and feet feel better, and sometimes they even feel amazing. It makes the whole body feel good and it&#39;s good for chronic pain. I usually vape other high 1:1 or 1:2 CBD strains for medicinal purposes but when I want a good indica which is mostly in the evening I usually go for Blueberry, such a great strain. And in social surroundings my friends and I have often had a blast after sharing a joint of Blueberry, uplifting fun high with lots of laughter, but you will feel tired after the high starts to fade. \u000a\u000aI prefer to vape this one starting somewhere around 180C (356F) because at a low temperature the smell and taste of blueberry is most prominent, much more so than smoking it. To use the whole bowl I bump up the temperature to 190C or 200C (374F to 392F) to get the benefit of the whole herb without wanting the smoke that comes with combustion. \u000a\u000aOne final comment about the smell. It&#39;s the best smelling herb I&#39;ve tried. How much blueberry you smell or taste is subjective and I have friends who don&#39;t smell the blueberry at all, so-to-speak, but I do and I like the effects very much too and believe that many connoisseurs of herb will always keep Blueberry on their top shelf and among their favorites. It&#39;s easy to grow and breed with, too, for people who are breeding new cannabis strains based on Blueberry. Like standing on the shoulders of giants.

VThis is an Indica I will buy again and again. I&#39;ve never complained about legal weed, but I might actually complain if my dispensary stops carrying this lol. First of all its one of the best smelling and tasting strains I&#39;ve tried - wonderful fruity scent to the flower and yummy blueberry flavor on the exhale. The effects after one or two hits are mood-boosting without being racy - more psychadelic and cerebral. The pain relief is immediate, but so is the body-heavy feeling and couch-lock effects, so I didn&#39;t feel like doing much after smoking. I could tell immediately this is a high-THC strain, on par with GSC or Bruce Banner. I wouldn&#39;t reccomend this one for beginners, it gets a little trippy in high doses! ;)

VI was not a fan of blueberry. Although the taste was A+, the indica was so heavy it put me to sleep. I have never experienced such an overpowering urge to sleep in my life. I wouldn\u2019t recommend smoking Blueberry unless you\u2019re looking to treat insomnia or smoking a joint for the taste of it. The strain isn\u2019t all that special, but a solid late, late night smoke

VWas very interested in trying a high CBD strain to help with some of my mental health issues -- mostly anxiety and the tendency to try to drink away my worries. I had emailed Cannabis City to ask if they had any high CBD strains and they replied that they did not at the time. I was very pleasantly surprised a few days later when I received another email from CC alerting me to check the menu for Blueberry Essence. I have both vaped and smoked it and it definitely delivers some THC effect, but also a more steady mindcalm combined with body relaxation. Unique, different, definitely worth trying. I love it and hope to buy more. In fact, I hope CC keeps this one in stock and that other shops realize the value of high CBD strains for certain segments of their customer population.

VBlueberry was one of the earliest strains that I know was what it was labeled, circa. 1984 when I was in Portland, OR.\u000aI was re-introduced to it not long ago and it was an intensely-relaxing high that soon gave way to a gentle euphoria...is good for insomnia or when you know you need to sleep. One of my favorite indica-dominate strains.

VA strain that is always a treat to have, one of my favourites, and definitely my favourite Hybrid. It&#39;s an evening smoke for sure... nice after a long day, makes you enjoy food like never before and you will sleep through and earthquake after a couple of joints ;) Had but one nicely packed spliff last night.. completely fucked with my face. I felt my brain fall through my arse, and the munchies were unreal... everything tasted to damn good!! Made my limbs feel heavy, so if you&#39;re smoking at home... whack on a film, make sure you have adequate munch and moisture NEXT to you and prepare for epic couch lock. You may find yourself with an inexplicable goofy grin upon your face at first.. from then on it&#39;s chink-eye central. The bud itself looks fucking tasty enough to eat and has a wonderful berry scent, even the smoke is purply.. i swear!! Would give it a 10, but had a bit of a headache once it wore off. Buy a fat eighth... and roll a joint ;)

VCurrently on Chemo maintenance treatments... Flavor was delicious and clean. Within minutes I had no more pain, no nausea and no heartburn. Allowed me to enjoy my Saturday with my daughter. Really enjoyed the relaxation and feeling enough clarity and energy to function as a mother. Thank You Blueberry!&#129303;&#128077;&#128077;

VI was quite surprised with this. I&#39;ve been depressed and overly stressed for the passed few weeks and Blueberry helped a lot thinking things through. I wouldn&#39;t use this as a social smoke or at a party. Perfect for taking a moment alone and enjoying just yourself. Also helped me concentrate on reading a book.

VThis is what cannabis is supposed to be like. A beautiful sweet smell emits itslef from the beautiful, trich dusted flowers that you can pinpoint as blueberry after really smelling it for a little while. The effects are wonderful. There is a very slight head high(noticed it much more than platinum kush) and the body high is not too intoxicating/sedating. Its still a functional high while helping with pain, but after a couple of hours, it will definitely help you sleep. This is another one of my favorite strains and its easy to see why after smoking it. This is a true connoisseur strain, and i am elated with this purchase. I can easily, and confidently recommend blueberry to just about everybody i know.

VA strain that is always a treat to have, one of my favourites, and definitely my favourite Hybrid. It&#39;s an evening smoke for sure... nice after a long day, makes you enjoy food like never before and you will sleep through and earthquake after a couple of joints ;) Had but one nicely packed spliff last night.. completely fucked with my face. I felt my brain fall through my arse, and the munchies were unreal... everything tasted to damn good!! Made my limbs feel heavy, so if you&#39;re smoking at home... whack on a film, make sure you have adequate munch and moisture NEXT to you and prepare for epic couch lock. You may find yourself with an inexplicable goofy grin upon your face at first.. from then on it&#39;s chink-eye central. The bud itself looks fucking tasty enough to eat and has a wonderful berry scent, even the smoke is purply.. i swear!! Would give it a 10, but had a bit of a headache once it wore off. Buy a fat eighth... and roll a joint ;)

VI&#39;m currently smoking the BB and how good it is depends on what Pheno u get. I tested 3 different Phenos within the last 6 weeks. The best one was the the strong indica pheno, it hits you fast and heavy, has awesome body waves / vibrations, deep relaxed, absolutely no pain in my back, good smoothie head vibrations, bit warm head, very good mood and because of its power you don&#39;t need that much. I only caught this once, makes me sad the more i think about it -.-\u000a8.5/10 Indica\u000a\u000aThe second is a mostly sativa pheno, not what you expect from a BlueBerry which is originally an heavy weight indica but also not bad, just different. Good Head high, energetic, creativ, wild and interesting thoughts and no truely indica side. Medium good high and a bit longer lasting than most others, about 1.15-30h and a long come down  which was very nice.\u000a7/10 Sativa\u000a\u000aThe third i tested random and also smoking right now, is a mix between both. Good head high, but more a buzz than a high if i&#39;m going to be correct, my back pain is noticable, but at least better than before, no dry mouth which is rarely, relaxed mind, good strain for watching a movie, to game with, to relaxe or to write this review right now :)\u000a7/10 Hybrid\u000a\u000aSo if you can get a BB, buy this stuff, its mostly quiet good, and if you will get the heavy indica pheno you&#39;re gonna be a lucky man, thats for sure\u000a\u000aSmell is by the way nice at all phenos, not like blueberrys, but fruity. Taste is .. like every other pot too, its ok and nothing special (i&#39;ve tested blunt with Activated carbon filters (i&#39;m not english, is this correct?) and vape[Arizer Extreme Q4])\u000a\u000apeace up

VOmg! The Aroma of this flower is AMAZING! If you couldn\u2019t see the herb, and only smell it, it would surely trick your sniffer. \u000aBout to spark up now.  Im in pain and kinda stressed at the moment.\u000a\u000aGive it a few...\u000a\u000aMmmm, yep, tastes like blueberries, very smooth and doesn\u2019t stink up the house. Nice white ash, but we notice it seems to create more smoke. Pain is subsiding nicely. Im beginning to feel my mind relax and my body become less tense. \u000a\u000a(From spark up to about 30 mins after)\u000a\u000aI will buy this again and rave about it to others.\u000a9/10 on my board.

VI had Blueberry Dream in concentrate form before Blueberry, as the first-ever thing I vaped. Blueberry, I tried as freshly-grown and quick-dried flower without a proper cure-- the tip of the top cola had to come off because there was mold reaching up toward it in the buds below. It might have been an early harvest, but the buds were so dense and sticky that I thought I&#39;d better get it drying before more mold set in.  \u000a\u000aThe early sample of Blueberry was intoxicating and took me back to the first time I really experienced weed: with its daughter Blueberry Dream. It was a very similar high, gentle but swift and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. I&#39;m getting all that again with Blueberry, with no real difference between the two experiences. There is also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aI have read that an early harvest will give you the plant at its more psychoactive. I&#39;m definitely getting hit hard and strong by this lady-- way harder than with Blueberry Dream!-- even though I mauled off plenty of kief going through the bud for mold and ripping it into small bits by hand. Then the method of drying was to sandwich them in tinfoil and heat them at 250 F for twenty minutes, flipping them over at the middle mark. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s completely terrible for getting a sense of what the bud would be like as quality weed that&#39;s been properly dried and cured for months, and I&#39;m still getting my socks knocked off over here. If it gets significantly stronger, it might be able to challenge Candyland for the most powerful effects I&#39;ve ever felt. I&#39;m calm, relaxed, focused if I work at it and that keeps me alert too, dissociated from my physical body enough that it&#39;s almost like watching a movie, but not worried about it. I feel safe, like being held in a really good hug. Loud, sudden noises are a bit more jarring, but don&#39;t scare me-- I&#39;m not anxious. I can sort of maybe tell that I could be, but I consciously push it away firmly, like &quot;no, thank you--&quot; and that works.  \u000a\u000aThe strength and pleasantness of this surprised me. It&#39;s euphoric for the heart that just wants a sea of calm and some renewed faith that things are going to get better, that the future is near and holds both the joy of creation and success. Blueberry Dream is a 4 for me, but Blueberry herself, at least in this plant, is a 5.

VPurchased this strain as I&#39;ve found indica strains alleviate symptoms of Crohns disease most effectively without paranoia. I obtained blueberry in liquid live resin cartridge and as live sugar. Both concentrates provided a relaxing effect without the &quot;couch-lock&quot; you typically associate with indica strains like Northern Lights and the like. Does a great job inducing your appetite &#128513;. Thanks for reading!

VThis strain is brilliant. A great flavor that leaves you able to function yet relaxed. Not a exceptionally potent strain but good for a daytime smoke or before taking a nap. The flavor is very berry-ish with a hint of herbal goodness. This medicine will be an unlikely candidate for my nightly smoke, however, it is great during the day. You will feel slight euphoria but nothing extreme. Overall blueberry tastes great, and is a phenomenal daytime smoke.

VI had Blueberry Dream in concentrate form before Blueberry, as the first-ever thing I vaped. Blueberry, I tried as freshly-grown and quick-dried flower without a proper cure-- the tip of the top cola had to come off because there was mold reaching up toward it in the buds below. It might have been an early harvest, but the buds were so dense and sticky that I thought I&#39;d better get it drying before more mold set in.  \u000a\u000aThe early sample of Blueberry was intoxicating and took me back to the first time I really experienced weed: with its daughter Blueberry Dream. It was a very similar high, gentle but swift and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. I&#39;m getting all that again with Blueberry, with no real difference between the two experiences. There is also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aI have read that an early harvest will give you the plant at its more psychoactive. I&#39;m definitely getting hit hard and strong by this lady-- way harder than with Blueberry Dream!-- even though I mauled off plenty of kief going through the bud for mold and ripping it into small bits by hand. Then the method of drying was to sandwich them in tinfoil and heat them at 250 F for twenty minutes, flipping them over at the middle mark. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s completely terrible for getting a sense of what the bud would be like as quality weed that&#39;s been properly dried and cured for months, and I&#39;m still getting my socks knocked off over here. If it gets significantly stronger, it might be able to challenge Candyland for the most powerful effects I&#39;ve ever felt. I&#39;m calm, relaxed, focused if I work at it and that keeps me alert too, dissociated from my physical body enough that it&#39;s almost like watching a movie, but not worried about it. I feel safe, like being held in a really good hug. Loud, sudden noises are a bit more jarring, but don&#39;t scare me-- I&#39;m not anxious. I can sort of maybe tell that I could be, but I consciously push it away firmly, like &quot;no, thank you--&quot; and that works.  \u000a\u000aThe strength and pleasantness of this surprised me. It&#39;s euphoric for the heart that just wants a sea of calm and some renewed faith that things are going to get better, that the future is near and holds both the joy of creation and success. Blueberry Dream is a 4 for me, but Blueberry herself, at least in this plant, is a 5.

Vhands down dopest dope ive ever smoked, long lasting head high that makes your vision wavy and trippy. There is also an extreme body high that is similar to the head high. makes me lazy and couch locked. The smell is unlike any other weed. When my friend told me to smell the weed i had my eyes closed and i took a wiff, and before i even smoked it i fell in love with it. The weed smells like blueberry muffins and is not the kind of weed that should be used for a stealthy operation. You will be able to smell it through 3 bags, make sure you have a smell proof with this stuff. 10/10

Vim not really an indica person, but i have to say this stuff is pretty damn good. its got that berry, sweet smell (almost disgustingly sweet) that i love so much. taste is definitely some berry but on a more herbal or tea side as opposed to super sweet.\u000a\u000afor me its very hard to get any food down. i smoked some just as i started typing this and i am very much hungry now; whereas before just the smell of food was making me feel sick.\u000ai do however feel pretty shakey, and this same effect i got last night after eating, so i can count my e.d out for this. it doesnt actually bother me -- its an incredible body high -- but this strain is definitely best for chillin.\u000aas far as sleepiness goes, id say it works out pretty well considering i usually cant fall asleep until 3 am and last night was out by 1 after smoking a bowl.\u000a\u000aoverall i think its a great indica, and im very picky about those.

Usually I hack up a lunch when smoking higher THC strains but I didn\u2019t cough at all.\u000a\u000aThe high was also fantastic, extremely euphoric with a little pick me up at the beginning to get everything going.  I wasn\u2019t couch locked, there was no spacing out, just a solid high that last a couple hours that didn\u2019t leave you wired afterwards.  3 hours after smoking I was ready for bed and out cold almost immediately.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this strain!

VA great heavy yielding plant and potent to boot. Crazy reddish/purple hues and dark green leafs and pale hairs. Colas had potential to get huge. 3/4oz and 1oz colas weren&#39;t uncommon for this strain. The secret to success is in the cure. The genuine blueberry flavor and aroma didn&#39;t surface until day 25 and matured at day 30 of the cure. I used glass jars and usually cracked em at least once a day but no less than once every 3 days. The curing process is absolutely critical to bring out the full potential of Blueberry.

VWow, just wow...\u000a\u000aPicked this up from Tilray and I am very impressed. The buds look amazing; small, dense and crystal all over them (they almost look white, kind of what I expected White Widow to look like).\u000a\u000aThe smoke was fantastic, very smooth and tasty, not citrusy but sweet.  Usually I hack up a lunch when smoking higher THC strains but I didn\u2019t cough at all.\u000a\u000aThe high was also fantastic, extremely euphoric with a little pick me up at the beginning to get everything going.  I wasn\u2019t couch locked, there was no spacing out, just a solid high that last a couple hours that didn\u2019t leave you wired afterwards.  3 hours after smoking I was ready for bed and out cold almost immediately.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this strain!

VI had Blueberry Dream in concentrate form before Blueberry, as the first-ever thing I vaped. Blueberry, I tried as freshly-grown and quick-dried flower without a proper cure-- the tip of the top cola had to come off because there was mold reaching up toward it in the buds below. It might have been an early harvest, but the buds were so dense and sticky that I thought I&#39;d better get it drying before more mold set in.  \u000a\u000aThe early sample of Blueberry was intoxicating and took me back to the first time I really experienced weed: with its daughter Blueberry Dream. It was a very similar high, gentle but swift and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. I&#39;m getting all that again with Blueberry, with no real difference between the two experiences. There is also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aI have read that an early harvest will give you the plant at its more psychoactive. I&#39;m definitely getting hit hard and strong by this lady-- way harder than with Blueberry Dream!-- even though I mauled off plenty of kief going through the bud for mold and ripping it into small bits by hand. Then the method of drying was to sandwich them in tinfoil and heat them at 250 F for twenty minutes, flipping them over at the middle mark. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s completely terrible for getting a sense of what the bud would be like as quality weed that&#39;s been properly dried and cured for months, and I&#39;m still getting my socks knocked off over here. If it gets significantly stronger, it might be able to challenge Candyland for the most powerful effects I&#39;ve ever felt. I&#39;m calm, relaxed, focused if I work at it and that keeps me alert too, dissociated from my physical body enough that it&#39;s almost like watching a movie, but not worried about it. I feel safe, like being held in a really good hug. Loud, sudden noises are a bit more jarring, but don&#39;t scare me-- I&#39;m not anxious. I can sort of maybe tell that I could be, but I consciously push it away firmly, like &quot;no, thank you--&quot; and that works.  \u000a\u000aThe strength and pleasantness of this surprised me. It&#39;s euphoric for the heart that just wants a sea of calm and some renewed faith that things are going to get better, that the future is near and holds both the joy of creation and success. Blueberry Dream is a 4 for me, but Blueberry herself, at least in this plant, is a 5.

VA strain that is always a treat to have, one of my favourites, and definitely my favourite Hybrid. It&#39;s an evening smoke for sure... nice after a long day, makes you enjoy food like never before and you will sleep through and earthquake after a couple of joints ;) Had but one nicely packed spliff last night.. completely fucked with my face. I felt my brain fall through my arse, and the munchies were unreal... everything tasted to damn good!! Made my limbs feel heavy, so if you&#39;re smoking at home... whack on a film, make sure you have adequate munch and moisture NEXT to you and prepare for epic couch lock. You may find yourself with an inexplicable goofy grin upon your face at first.. from then on it&#39;s chink-eye central. The bud itself looks fucking tasty enough to eat and has a wonderful berry scent, even the smoke is purply.. i swear!! Would give it a 10, but had a bit of a headache once it wore off. Buy a fat eighth... and roll a joint ;)

VTastes like it&#39;s name, Blueberry. Good dark buds actually have blueish tinge and taste is light and sweet. High is relaxing and mildly sedative for that classic Indica couch lock feeling and may induce munchies. Not too sleepy but could see it paired as a nighttime smoke. Overall top shelf strain, 5/5 from me! Try it.

VBlueberry is my favorite strain, but I&#39;ve only had it once before, last Summer.  Needless to say, I was anxious to load my bowl and try this out.  The buds look nice altogether.  They are pretty light and airy buds with bright orange hairs and a dusting of frosty trichromes all over.  The smell is just slightly sweet with a kind of spiciness that gives some &quot;bite&quot; to the aroma.  The smoke is smooth but not particularly flavorful.  Exhaling gives a nice flavor on green hits, but it&#39;s not particularly tasty.  One note is that the buds are pretty dry.  I&#39;m not sure if this is a result of the storage methods or the toll of transit.  Either way, the stuff still smokes nice.\u000a\u000aThe blueberry high is nice.  It really relieves my anxiety and stress.  The head high comes on first and is uplifting.  I was considering going back to bed for a nap, but now I feel more awake yet relaxed.  Although cerebral, there is no hyper giddiness or tension that can come from heavier sativa strains.  The best way to describe it is that I just feel &quot;good&quot;.  My outlook is positive and I&#39;m not worried about anything.  After the initial buzz, the head high settles a bit but the elevated mood is persistent.  Music appreciation is improved.  The body high becomes more apparent once the head comes down a bit.  It&#39;s pretty easy to work at the computer, but occasionally I get distracted by a runaway train of thought.

VJust smoked a chillum full and a bong full that i got from the joint in Seattle. I asked for the tippiest toppiest top shelf indica they had and they showed me the &quot;blueberry&quot;. It was kind of confusing because the jar it was in said dj short blueberry but sign labeled it as blueberry.  It looked pretty dank so I got it. The packaging it came in also said blueberry so I don&#39;t know what was going on there.  Anyway, Now that I&#39;m thoroughly baked off this shit I can review it properly.  It tastes and smells like some high quality stuff.  Just like blueberries in fact.  The effect is heavy but kind of hollow.  I&#39;m really stoned but that&#39;s about it.  Nothing unique or special that is popping out in this particular strain.  For they&#39;re recommended top shelf indica I&#39;m not all that impressed. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m actually smoking this strain anyway so this whole review could be in vain.  I have a gram of dj short blueberry that I got two days ago that I haven&#39;t tried yet.  So I&#39;ll figure this all out.

VI&#39;ve used this strain in a pax, joint, blunt, bong, pipe, etc. and every method is tasty, smooth and gets you stoned as shit, but a very enjoyable and long lasting high. One of my favourite Indica strains so far.\u000a

VI was given the pleasure to try some of this a couple weeks back. The smell was so awesome that I could of left it on my face all day. The taste was even better. Burnt well, and helped very much with the pain. Average time before i thought I needed to take another hit, probably 20-30 minutes.

VI had Blueberry Dream in concentrate form before Blueberry, as the first-ever thing I vaped. Blueberry, I tried as freshly-grown and quick-dried flower without a proper cure-- the tip of the top cola had to come off because there was mold reaching up toward it in the buds below. It might have been an early harvest, but the buds were so dense and sticky that I thought I&#39;d better get it drying before more mold set in.  \u000a\u000aThe early sample of Blueberry was intoxicating and took me back to the first time I really experienced weed: with its daughter Blueberry Dream. It was a very similar high, gentle but swift and deceptively strong. It lifted my head up in a slightly disconnected way that put distance between my stresses and worries and me, while also giving my body a warm, comforting glow. My heart glowed hardest, like I was radiating (and feeling!) pure love for everyone I care about, past and present, friends and family and pets. I&#39;m getting all that again with Blueberry, with no real difference between the two experiences. There is also definite spacing out, where I lose track of bits of time just thinking-- and then I forget for a moment what I was thinking. \u000a\u000aI have read that an early harvest will give you the plant at its more psychoactive. I&#39;m definitely getting hit hard and strong by this lady-- way harder than with Blueberry Dream!-- even though I mauled off plenty of kief going through the bud for mold and ripping it into small bits by hand. Then the method of drying was to sandwich them in tinfoil and heat them at 250 F for twenty minutes, flipping them over at the middle mark. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s completely terrible for getting a sense of what the bud would be like as quality weed that&#39;s been properly dried and cured for months, and I&#39;m still getting my socks knocked off over here. If it gets significantly stronger, it might be able to challenge Candyland for the most powerful effects I&#39;ve ever felt. I&#39;m calm, relaxed, focused if I work at it and that keeps me alert too, dissociated from my physical body enough that it&#39;s almost like watching a movie, but not worried about it. I feel safe, like being held in a really good hug. Loud, sudden noises are a bit more jarring, but don&#39;t scare me-- I&#39;m not anxious. I can sort of maybe tell that I could be, but I consciously push it away firmly, like &quot;no, thank you--&quot; and that works.  \u000a\u000aThe strength and pleasantness of this surprised me. It&#39;s euphoric for the heart that just wants a sea of calm and some renewed faith that things are going to get better, that the future is near and holds both the joy of creation and success. Blueberry Dream is a 4 for me, but Blueberry herself, at least in this plant, is a 5.

VBlueberry from Dutch passion is a great smoke.  They combined the Dj short Blueberry with a higher yielding strain to create a great high yield, high resin and flavor hybrid.  When grown right with careful attention to organic feeding and PH the outcome is colas with blue, red, purple and green.  The taste is blueberry with hints of citrus that the afgani male added, but you can still relate it to the original Oregon blueberry.  Very narcotic if harvested late, but the best high when it is harvested early for a soaring cerebral high and a fresh taste.  Can be very good pain meds but needs to be harvested at the right time to get a narcotic medicinal high.

The flavor is very berry-ish with a hint of herbal goodness. This medicine will be an unlikely candidate for my nightly smoke, however, it is great during the day. You will feel slight euphoria but nothing extreme. Overall blueberry tastes great, and is a phenomenal daytime smoke.

VHow can you rate a &quot;strain&quot; when you get the same strain from different growers in the same city and it&#39;s remarkably different flower?  I earlier did a 4 star (4.5 rating) rating on Blueberry from Cannabiotix.  This review is for the same strain supposedly, but grown by The Facility and it rates a 3.0 at best, a 1.5 star difference on a 5 star scale.  Looking at the buds side by side the Cannabiotix obviously has far more crystals on it and darker blues/lavender colors on the bud.  I don&#39;t know if The Facility is shaking their buds in some machine or by hand to sell what falls off as something else, or is just using an inferior growing method, as I&#39;m just a stoner.  The smell of The Facility grown Blueberry is either strongly chemical or nutrient in nature compared to the excellent sweet berry smell of the Cannabiotix Grown flower.  Maybe The Facility is not flushing their plants before harvest?  I have have no way of knowing.  Anybody can buy some of each and compare.  Tastes and feels like totally different strains.

VI had the pleasure of obtaining this strain from Salem Ma. dispensary. Any strong Indica is my nighttime medicine of choice. GDP and Dakini Kush have done wonders for my insomnia but Blueberry, so far, takes the cake. Very, very good dry smell with strong hints of blueberry. The smoke was fantastic! Very smooth and easy on the lungs and throat but packs a good punch after a few hits on the GravLabs 5&quot; bubbler. After about an hour of watching the Red Sox get their asses kicked against the dreaded Yankees, I was out cold on the couch only to have my wife wake me up for bed. Great purchase and medication!. I also picked up some Captain&#39;s Cake which I&#39;ll try tonight and review in the morning. Cheers

Oh well, can\u2019t teach everyone, lol\u000a\u000aLove this sweet Indica, had it the first time a year ago, and it inspired me to grow it this year. Deep royal purple stems, dark green leaves with the same purple veins, with purple leaves near the top, and covered in dense buds. A gorgeous girl I must admit, and she carries an even more relaxing high. Great strain just before bed, or a nap. But as many have said, Blueberry carries a bite if you smoke too much, lol!

V60/40 Sativa dominant Blueberry from Noble Farms. Wondering if this isn&#39;t my new favorite, go to smoke for all occasions. my body and mind become one. I can still think, do things, be relaxed, do just about anything.  The reason for 4 stars is it just seems to be missing that little something to make it extra special, but otherwise this is currently my favorite go to smoke for all occasions . A nice uplifting smoke, that after a few sessions lulls me to sleep later on. Some indicas give me a real hard time falling asleep at night. Not sure why. So it is important to me that the cannabis I enjoy does not have that effect. not super tasty or super special but a great smoke I will definitely be back for the sativa dominant blueberry variety

VThis is a strain of many wonders! It produces beautiful crystallized nugs, gives off a fragrant enjoyable smell, and tastes of delicious berries!! The high itself is fantastic!! It brings a strong indica sensation, but didn&#39;t feel overcoming with laziness. The high was very &quot;entertaining&quot; and brought much happiness!! Can&#39;t go wrong with such an incredible strain!!

VWhat I had was a salad of Blueberry and Bubba Love mixed together and I am telling you, that is probably one of the best highs I have ever experienced. I will try these strains separately and come back to edit this review later with a more clearly defined review, but I don&#39;t think I ever remembering being so happy in my life. Happy, euphoric, blissful, excited to be alive... this would be a cure for depression, stress, grief, nausea and body pain. Slightly giggly. It is very rare for any strain to have this effect on me. The only down side to it is that you quickly build up a tolerance for these blissful effects. The only down side to it leaves you feeling a little jittery and nervous in the body. Not in a mentally stressful way. It just feels like you accidentally drank too much coffee and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the Blueberry seeing how Blueberry is an Indica. I believe this is the effects of the Bubba Love. I&#39;ll edit this later when I try the two separately. I notice if I use this on my worst days and than I go a while without using it, it can be a good tool for those terrible days, but won&#39;t work for every day use and believe me, if it did I would be using it for every day use. A little hard to work with it outside of the home, but not impossible. Just don&#39;t do a lot of talking. lol. I mean you can, but you are gonna sound like a goofball oh and you WILL want to talk too. With EVERYONE. Landlords. Spouses who are at work. Pet ferrets, who do NOT enjoy slow dancing in the living room. Neighbors who don&#39;t want to be rude, but want to leave, however you don&#39;t notice because you are too high. So yeah. That happened. Also, there is a residual grogginess. So heads up with that. Well worth it. I will hunt this strain, grow this strain and try to improve this strain forever. lol. You can thank me later. ;) OH and if you do decide to try mixing it with Bubba Love, do no more than two parts Blueberry to one part Bubba if you get anxiety. The come down happens quickly minus the residual grogginess that lasts a couple of hours past the euphoria.

VI personally give this batch of Blueberry a 4 1/2 the wonderful appearance w/ highlights of purple, Blue, &amp; Amber hairs. It&#39;s wonderful balance of berries w/ a earthy but pungent overtone. The effects cane on slow at first but perfect for pain relief(esspecially coming out of a seizure), relaxing, yet a wonderful sense of well-being.

Doesn&#39;t take much for a buzz. Amazing tasty stain and very relaxing in the couch feeling. Great for insonmia. Negative cotton mouth and very stinky for sure stay off the hotel elevator with it, take the stairs. Other than that highly recommend if you haven&#39;t tried this strain.

I also slept like a baby for the first time in a good while.\u000a\u000aThis herb has a semi-sweet  taste with a very strong berry earthy aroma. You could see the crystals on the buds it was so delicious and pain diminishing. I recommend it for a good nights sleep.

VThe strain I tried is Noble Farms, listed as a 60/40 sativa-dominant, which I think is a little more unusual for this strain. More brightening and refreshing than I expected without necessarily being energizing. If I had too much I could see it might provoke anxiety, but I didn&#39;t experience any with light, repeated use. The &quot;brightening&quot; aspect made me feel more alert without making me restless. I could sit in my chair and stay focused on the task at-hand. It doesn&#39;t have a wow-factor that some other strains do, but I find that I keep coming back to it.

Amazing berry and sweet smell, makes you want to smoke it immediately. Taste again is amazing and full of soft fruits. Strong indica effects, lots of couch lock, full body high, totally relaxing. I had some lemon drop at the same time and was mixing the two together to get slightly more hybrid effects. Blueberry is an all time classic, will always buy and use this.

VI,m not usually an Indica person but this really blew me away!  What I didn&#39;t like about it is what I don&#39;t like about ALL Indica&#39;s - The crazy head buzz that keeps me up until 3am lol... But man was my body TRULY relaxed... Does exactly what it says on the tin!

VThis Strain is a most have, it should be considered as a staple strain that you keep in your collection so it&#39;s always in reach. Blueberry has great medical qualities to help relieve stress and pain. It&#39;s also a great appetite stimulant. when it comes to relaxing and sleep, this strain has you covered. The last batch I received had just over 30 percent of THC! It came from Craft Deliveries in Berkeley California, and is available at many San Francisco bay area dispensaries.

VA personal favorite of mine. This strain follows the line of other top shelf indica strains it packs a punch in all the right places. Along the lines of GDP and Northern Lights this strain will give you that same indica feeling the head high can be navigated to get to that awesome body relaxation which is great for PTSD pains. I recommend this strain tremendously for PTSD symptoms.

VI got a sativa dominate pheno blueberry, from noble farms. noble is a good grower but they don&#39;t produce a high thc flower. this bag of blueberry came in at about 12%. the high is really a mellow head buzz and some body relaxation. the flowers are fluffy,covered in crystals. they have a nice pine green and purple almost kind of blue color, very nice eye appeal. the smell is really sweet and floral with a slight blueberry smell. real nice. the high does not last long at all. I can smoke a bowl and not quite a hour later im already well into the come down. which is disappointing and is kind of a injustice to how beautiful the flower is for this. the taste matches the smell really sweet and floral tasting smoke. all and all this isn&#39;t the worst flower I&#39;ve smoked but could be much better.

VThis review applies to the premium cartridge of oil that I purchased from Sira.\u000a\u000a\u000aI bought this cartridge primarily to help me with insomnia (mine is caused mainly by anxiety). What I got with this strain was so much more. This strain helped me with insomnia, depression, pain, increased sex drive and also increased sensation (I.e. Made me and another person way more sensitive to touch than we would have been otherwise). \u000a\u000aI&#39;m a person who generally has a low sex drive because of anti-depressants etc so I&#39;m always looking for strains that are good for sex. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve tried a lot of strains but this is amazing. It&#39;s being added to my top 3 favorite strains along with Jack Frost and Flo OG.\u000a\u000aAfter the first inhalation I had a sense of calm and happiness: like everything is right with the world and you&#39;re just enjoying that one moment. Next any pains or tension I had began to melt away as I became more relaxed. After about 20-30 minutes sex drive increased and then it takes me about 40 minutes or so to have the desire to be able to fall asleep really easily if that&#39;s what I want (but it won&#39;t make you sleepy in that you need to go to sleep just makes it more easily accessible).

VMan! This strain truly is exceptional. I&#39;ve had it for myself no longer than a week, and yet still I can undoubtedly say this strain is what every weed smoker has been living for. Blueberry, is an indica, however, never struck me as a heavy one; more of a hybrid feel for me. The euphoric and relaxed high is unmatched by really any strain i&#39;ve had to date. The looks and the taste were good, although the flavour was incredible. A sweet and berry taste felt natural, and just right. The highs on this strain are long and very calming. I would recommend this strain to almost everyone of my friends and you should too. This strain is incredible!

VWell, this strain is quite strong that&#39;s for sure but the high that I got from it was as not what I expected. I could describe it as a typical indica body high with a clear head surprisingly.\u000a\u000aIt starts off quite euphoric and energetic but quickly transitions into relaxation and the need to sit down and close your eyes. The body high is intense though.\u000a\u000aI was unfortunately disappointed by Blueberry.Didnt really enjoy this and probably won&#39;t buy again. Could be because  it was so strong.

VGot the CO2 cartridge at medical marijuana dispensary. The purpose was to help with anxiety and insomnia. I used to be a heavy user and stopped about 10 years ago. I read that this was a good one to start out with. I took one hit at night about an hour before bed. I felt somewhat relaxed in the beginning and about 20 minutes in I started over-thinking things. It escalated quickly and realized I was over-thinking every little thing in my life, and not in a good way. Needless to say, I did not sleep at all that night and I do not think I\u2019ll ever use this strain again. My brother tried it and he said the same thing, he felt way too \u201chead high\u201d and almost started freaking out. (He\u2019s a regular user) maybe I got a bad batch, but just beware with this one. If you have anxiety or tend to be a \u201cthinker\u201d this may not be good for you.

VMy first D J Short&#39;s strain, but far from the last of his strain grown. of his favoured produced strains.  I every breeders new what D J Short knows about breeding since first winning his first Cannabis Cup in 1980 !\u000aAccording to his information he used three strains, Highland Thai.,Purple Thai., and Afghani. Where the Highland Thai was the first generation between a Oaxaca Gold and a Chocolate Thai.   My heart is still with DJ Shorts Blueberry and I really bought that any other breeders will ever come close to this achievement!

VWith so many phenos with blueberry genetics you might think that regular blueberry is lacking. Far from true! This is THE best stuff I&#39;ve found for sleep and relaxation. Relieves my restless legs better than any Rx I&#39;ve tried! Relaxed, sleepy, body-buzz. Will glue you to any comfy surface. As someone with life-long insomnia, this one has been an absolute game-changer.

This has done the trick! I am still stiff and a bit sore but nothing like the pain I was experiencing.  Beat the heck out of acetaminophen and methocarbamol (useless muscle relaxer).  Can happily function now to carry on for the day. Shout out to my favorite store, Cannaco, in Trinidad, CO for recommending this strain.

Two hits for me is about it. I tried more and became dizzy and a little nauseous.

VI purchased 14g of this, grown by WW Agriculture. Harvested on 7/30/16, it was consumed on 1/1/16. There are no notes regarding pesticide use or grow location. It&#39;s budget weed, so while half of the nugs were tightly packed, well trimmed, and covered in sticky orange hairs, the other half were decidedly lacking in any of those traits. Still, for budget weed, this stuff was great. It certainly doesn&#39;t lack for potency, or for flavor, and it wasn&#39;t dry.\u000a\u000aAs for the high itself, I love it. It&#39;s relaxing, rejuvenating, and arousing. Perfect for setting the mood for a romantic evening, or for zoning out in a dimly lit room and listening to Zeppelin.

VTried this from a local medical dispensary when they finally had it available because I&#39;ve always wanted to try that &quot;old-school&quot; Blueberry instead of the newer mixed strains.  Happy to say it exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aIt didn&#39;t take much.  After my second bong hit I could feel the effects rushing in.  After my 6th, I put it down!  I found the high well balanced.  Very intense body effect, but also quite cerebral too.  Love that taste and smell.\u000a\u000aI bought this to help with insomnia, but it took about an hour or two for things to slow down where I felt really relaxed enough to sleep.  Normally I&#39;d slash a star for not being what I expected, but it more than made up for it in other attributes.  I find it does help sleep in lower doses, like just a couple good hits.  Much more and I find the cerebral effects keep the sleep from happening.

I can&#39;t imagine anyone having a bad time because of inhaling Blueberry, but I&#39;m sure there are those that could be disappointed. Still, it has birthed one of my favorite strains: Blue Dream.

VVery great relaxing strain for a rainy day with not much to do. \u000aVery good taste, I can\u2019t really say that it tastes like blueberry but it has a bit of a mild sweet diesel taste. \u000a\u000aAnxiety suffers warning: if you smoke too much of it you can have lingering unpleasant thoughts. But it\u2019s healthy in a way because it brings up repressed emotions. \u000aIf you ask yourself why you feel this way about a certain anxious thought and you\u2019ll feel strong and refreshed.

Vwhoo, okay. I&#39;m writing this two hours in to just three tokes, and I am definitely still feeling it.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m no stranger to the Michigan beer scene, so the flower&#39;s blueberry-hops smell was just really familiar and yummy. But the first hit was unexpectedly harsh. I didn&#39;t get the blueberry flavor until a few in.\u000a\u000aThe high feels heavy, but not couch-lock heavy, you can still function pretty well. It also feels soft. Like being wrapped in cotton wool.\u000a\u000aThis stuff makes you think really deep thoughts, too. \u000a\u000aThe downside is that the dry mouth and munchies are STRONG with this strain.

VThis strain is amazing. Reeks of artificial BlueBerrys and is coated in resin. Has a sweet-hashy taste that lingers with berry. The buds are rock solid also whitch makes it a plus. If you see this strain at your collective, ask for a smell. If it trully smells like BlueBerrys, get your self some. You won&#39;t regret it.

VGot recommended this strain by my budtender and damn this one of my favorite indicas. While not classified as a hybrid, this thing has the focus and euphoria of a Sativa and the pain relief, relaxation and, if you smoke enough, that deep sleep it sets you into. This indica didn&#39;t leave me feeling too in my head but it will leave you feeling mellow and chilled out. This is great for personal use to really chill out and is perfect before hopping in the bathtub.\u000aDo yourself a favor. Get a lush bath bomb, pack/roll up some Blueberry and your body will thank you.

Took the pain right away. Popped on a movie and passed out. I do jiu jitsu everyday and so my body is always sore or I have some sort of injury.

Chronic back pain disappears every time within 15 minutes of taking a hit of this fine strain. Relaxing, soothing, I can&#39;t say enough.. and the taste is just outstanding! By far my favorite. And best of all? No anxiety -- in fact this feels like a natural alternative to Ativan... another drug I can stop taking! :D

The downfall is the preceding days when the strain begins giving me headaches and an oddly certain totally-out-of-it feeling that can persist for days.\u000a\u000aI give this strain one star because the after effects, at least for me, really are that bad.

VBought at a dispensary in Hayward, CA. Light-green in appearance with a lot of calyxes. Kind of light and fluffy. Smells of actual, fresh blueberries, more earthy than sweet or candyish. Blueberry aroma comes through in the taste, but more subtley than the smell. Otherwise is a tad harsh. Exceptionally calming high. Felt happy, euphoric, abd extremely relaxed. No problems sleeping after indulging in this strain. Psychadelic enough to really enjoy some late night TV watching. I think it could be day or nighttime use. I thought it was great as a before bed toke. Excellent stuff for the indica lover.

VAfter a 5 day break from very full smoke schedule, I smoked two swishers of this and was higher than I had ever been. The taste was wonderful, the smoke was very full and satisfying, just from a pure smoker appreciation. Like perhaps the finest marijuana cigar money could buy.\u000a\u000aTime lost measure. Music was at it&#39;s clearest. Touch was at it&#39;s most electrifying, and closing your eyes was guaranteed to give a psychedelic visual trip.\u000a\u000aThis all after, road nausea, stress, fatigue, and even a little anxiety.\u000a\u000aWoke my mind up, then put it down.

VThe blueberry I got from my dealer today had lot&#39;s of tricomes - quite allot for street weed, so I was very happy with the bags I got.  It&#39;s a  great indica dominant strain, the smell and taste of blueberry is awesome. It is at first extremely uplifting, and I got really talkative. It started in the body as a sativa sort of high, then gradually moved into my head/behind my eyes when the indica kicked in. My eyes looked so red and chinese haha. Made listening to music great. The comedown made me feel very sleepy, so blueberry is perfect to smoke a couple of hours before bedtime, as the effects are quite long lasting. Very good bud, I&#39;ve got more of it and I&#39;m going to be smoking another joint tonight so I&#39;m excited.

VI had this strain as an oil, and it definitely has the classic indica effect. It melts my body right into the bed, but it doesn&#39;t have an overwhelming sedating effect. Sleep is definitely easier, but it isn&#39;t a strain that would knock me out. Blueberry also gives a nice case of the munchies pretty early on. If anyone needs a strain for stress, anxiety, insomnia, or appetite. This is a good one to try out. It definitely holds up to its reputation.

VI was a bit disappointed in this one.  It wasn&#39;t a bad high or anything, and I encourage others to try it, because I have high tolerances for things and sometimes the biggest strains just don&#39;t work for me.  It was more that beyond a very mild mood upper, it didn&#39;t do anything else.  No high, no drowsiness, and no real pain relief, either.  Stlll, as I said, I have an odd constitution, and what works for most doesn&#39;t work for me, so don&#39;t let my review sour you on trying this classic strain.

VTrue (DJ Short&#39;s Varieties) Blueberry is probably my all time favorite strain. It&#39;s a great treat for the senses. The taste and smell are a mix of blueberry and sweet earthiness with a bit of &quot;funk.&quot; The effects are very heavily influenced by its Afghani genetics causing intense feelings of well being and relaxation coupled with cerebral invigoration reminiscent of its Thai ancestry. The perfect Indica leaning hybrid.

VHad this for a longer length of time: been times both me and my girlfriend, both heavy smokers, experienced too much from this strain! An absolute top shelf bud- beautiful sparkling tricombs covering a tight, large, bright green bud with big red hairs is a thing of beauty to look at and enjoy. \u000aFull body relaxation is experienced with a heavy increase in happiness. The eye pressure is quickly released but ability to concentrate not impaired. \u000aEuphoria levels are high, feeling more giggly for a normal indica. \u000aThis strain gets you perfectly stoned if that&#39;s the kind of medication you&#39;re interested in

VSmells just like blueberries! =] This is a good strain for me to take a few hours before bed when I need to relax but I&#39;m not completely ready to fall asleep yet. Makes me nice and introspective but not in the way that causes paranoia. Just makes me feel a nice contentment with everything in my life. Not a particularly good strain for focus or productivity, I tend to space out and my thoughts wander a lot.

You feel like going out and do stuff or just work. Very good if you can&#39;t get things done (maybe even studying).\u000a\u000aI will try this again from another shop and re-review it.\u000a\u000aKeep on smoking, peace &amp; love.

VMy first different strain besides two slightly different strains of skunk, blueberry is very satisfying. It has a fruity taste, and works very well as a mix with skunk in a blunt. The taste is the defining factor for this particular strain. That and the fact that is a lot stronger than &quot;standard&quot; weed (skunk). The only downside to this particular strain is that, in my experience, one can get heavy amnesia and short term memory loss, similar to that of the effects of LSD or 2C-I.

Still can maintain some creativity and manage lively conversation but can sleep once you hit the pillow.\u000a\u000aSome moderate forgetfulness the following day but has after effects of a relaxing nature.

Little cerebral head effects, right behind the eyes.\u000a\u000aCons: Dry mouth and minor dry eyes. Normal draw, but occasional harsh exhale, right in the back of the throat.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Berry taste. I enjoy blueberry when its in hybrids, however I was a little disappointed as I set my expectations too high for this strand. It was good for what it was, but I have others I prefer over this one. Can make you sleepy.\u000a\u000aI would recommend if you&#39;re looking for body relaxation with some pain relief.

VBlueberry is dark, earthy, murky, and subtly sweet. Dank berry with a hint of sour lemon aromatics. Front end taste is averagely smoky. On the backend is where you get that berry flavor. Blueberry is a strain for those who like their coffee black. On the medicinal side, it significantly puts you in chill mode and goes directly to the body. \u000a\u000aFor myself, Blueberry eases tightness and muscle soreness. Puts a full relaxation blanket on once it sinks into the CB receptors. Blueberry is more of a night time, end of day, throw on the game or xbox, type of smoke. While big doses will put that ass on couch lock, frequent smaller doses keep a consistent, floating on a cloud feel. I&#39;ve gotten some of best night&#39;s rest off of Blueberry as it puts me right into a deep sleep.  \u000a\u000aSmoking this strain out of a short pipe or joint does it zero justice. The reward is in keeping the smoke cool. And the ultimate is waking up in the morning feeling like your mind and body are fully rested. \u000a\u000a

VI got a pre roll of this and lit up and got about half way through the joint when I noticed I feel like my body is floating above my head.. I stand up and realize I&#39;m going to get the spins from this. See I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the strain or the lack of oxygen in my lungs but every time I smoke too much I get the spins but blueberry is notoriously potent as I&#39;ve come to see and one or two hits is perfect. You get the full effect, you feel slightly head high with a heavy body buzz. The taste is the worst part, to me it tastes like pinesol and the texture of the smoke is unique. But I do recommend this strain to be used in moderation.

Specifically the strawberry Philly did it great great justice.\u000a\u000aNo real negative effects but lots of pacing around so high that you don&#39;t even know what to do with yourself.

Smooth smoke, sweet smell and flavor - after it&#39;s name - High comes on smooth in the head and  gives a nice body rush.  Fantastic strain if you&#39;re having a little trouble in the bedroom.

VI&#39;m not really an Indica fan but strains like Blueberry I can&#39;t say no. Definitely night strain. It hits hard but I was happy, relaxed and focused. Really good for stress and anxiety. The only bad thing is that you have a black hole in your stomach. I didn&#39;t have munchies but when I started eating I didn&#39;t want to stop. Don&#39;t let that stop you from trying Blueberry. It&#39;s still very worth it. The sweet berry smell is a classic. Enjoy !

A fair amount of couch lock, but this was my first new strain in months, so I chalk some of that up to my system adjusting. \u000a\u000aIt did a good job with my back pain, but I wasn&#39;t as mentally sharp and clear as I am with other Indica strains. \u000a\u000aI will continue to test and see how regular use changes my experiences. Good potential here, but so far not as good as Grape Ape or Blackberry

VThis strain is a classic fruity indica. Big, sparkly green and purple buds yield a dense flavorful smoke with notes of apple, clove, black pepper, and of course blueberries. It has a heavy body high that relaxes you into a puddle and leaves you happy and smiling. Great for pain relief, stress induced anxiety, depression, and spasticity.

A strong body high that made everything good to the touch, similar to rolling almost when I had a few hits too many. Time dilation: Id complete a few tasks, have conversation with friends, read, etc., and it felt like a half hour passed, yet after checking the clock only 5-10 minutes ever did. Most people who shared the trench with me had the same experience. \u000a\u000aOverall: definitely enjoyed this one, would highly recommend.

VA classic strain that will never go out of style. Blueberry has been known for years, winning the Cannabis cup in 2000 for best Indica. Her roots go back to the 1970s, thanks DJ. Vintage looking with a mild sour blueberry smell &amp; earthy flavor. She gives your that old school foggy, spacey, supper chilled, stoned feeling.  Ideal for stress &amp; pain management or night time use. A favorite among breeders.

The pain killing happens almost immediately with tense muscles relaxing, stiff joints  loosening, and with a general sense of well being.\u000aI&#39;ve been enjoying some motivational strains like GSC and DP, but sometimes you just want to chill out and body surf the big, blue wave.  If that&#39;s you, then Blueberry bud is the way to fly.

VI&#39;ve had blueberry a couple times and if grown properly it can be an amazing indica strain. But I&#39;ve also had a lot of shitty blueberry back in the day. Lately it&#39;s been great tho. It&#39;s a super indica punch type of bud that is very calming and great for anxiety, insomnia or pain. It&#39;s got a thick resiny coast of ceustals around the bud and , smells like some afghani hash dipped in a vile of blueberry jam.

Good vibes. No paranoia. It can help calm down nausea and worked wonders on my leg pains. My head was kept relatively clear for the high thc content. Perfect strain for the evening.

VHas anyone ever offered you free food? Have you ever thought to yourself that this food that got offered to you is &#39;meh&#39;, but food is food nonetheless. That&#39;s how I felt with Blueberry. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, this strain was very pleasant and superbly smooth through a bong, joint or vape. It had an amazingly strong blueberry scent with a subtle Thai strain  aroma, like chamomile tea with a dash of cocoa. Anyways, the strain wasn&#39;t too overwhelming, but I expected more since the aroma was a selling point for me. It&#39;s a great indica that does the job. It relieves pain, instills drowsiness and calms your mind. Though it lacks in the euphoria department, Blueberry gets you stoned, but not too stoned, most definitely couchlocked, but not enough that you say goodnight to the moon, though it does make gravity feel a lot more intense. I recommend this strain for first time cannabis smokers since it doesn&#39;t get your mind racing and the pain relief and body high is tolerable, I also recommend this for people with muscle and joint pains, and those suffering from insomnia.\u000a\u000aStrain appearance:\u000aLight green leaves with yellowish green gradient\u000a\u000a- If you follow my reviews, so far I&#39;ve been giving praise to the bountiful kief, this time around I was quite disappointed with the crystals, or the lack of crystals that the bugs had\u000a\u000aSmell: \u000aBlueberries, blueberries, floral\u000a\u000aTaste:\u000aBong/Joint: Really smooth sweet and subtly earthy \u000a\u000aVape: Superbly smooth with a sweet taste on the inhale, and a floral earthy taste on the exhale. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m not picky with weed, but this is the first time that I didn&#39;t really enjoy the strain. Although, it was amazingly pleasant to smell and taste, the effects I felt where slightly underwhelming. It still works though, and if I had no other strains to chose from, I don&#39;t mind smoking this again.

VWell I must say this is a cracking strain! When my batch arrived the buds were incredibly dry, and it ground up fantastic. In fact it was showing similar characteristics of what sativa strains do in this process.  Burns immaculately too and doesn&#39;t half make a tantalisingly fruity blunt. One point I would make though is that it is a wickedly strong strain, not so much for making you sleepy, but certainly lethargic, and I did find myself not finishing off in one sitting. If you do manage to motivate yourself though, this strain will make activities very enjoyable. I attended a music festival while using this strain, and I was a bit sceptical at first to use an indica for a long day of beats, but in the end it worked a treat. Proper feel good dank!

VBlueberry has been a favorite strain of mine for years.  Prime examples are super dense and sticky nugs with a massive dusting of crystals. It always has the classic fresh blueberry smell and taste that it is known for.  It gives a truly relaxing high that just melts away stress, anxiety and pain. It can also be a bit of a creeper, with the heavy classic Indica effects kicking in up to 15 min after consumption. I would recommend this strain for pain, anxiety, insomnia, or just a relaxing night at home. It is my go to strain before bed, I always get the best sleep with this strain.

VI really like the sedating properties of this strain, but I find that it makes me far more tired and stupid than Grandaddy Purple does. Blueberry is excellent for unwinding before bed, but I think there are strains out there that have similar characteristics but also additional qualities such as mood elevation. \u000a\u000aSo, if you want a pure relaxing indica, with a heavy focus on the relaxing, Blueberry is a good bet.

V&quot;that blueberry stuff&#39;s good though... GODDAMN that stuff roasts you.&quot; as said by my lovely roommate. For me this makes me a productive human. It helps with anxiety and depression. Didn&#39;t give me dry mouth which is a huge plus for me. But it did made me very hungry lol. It made my roommates eyes feel heavy, but she loved it cause it made her feel silly and giggly.

Vvery nice taste and smell, and very dark purple buds. Smoke wasn&#39;t too harsh coming from a bong and had a small amount of blueberry and pine taste on the tongue.\u000a\u000aAs far as high, starts out with a very strong body high, i almost dropped my phone because my arms were so relaxed, then felt it in my neck and shoulders which is quite nice. After about 20 minutes i started to experience a strong euphoria, and cranked up some playlists with good music. And then finally i got a strong buzzing warping sensation in my head, while still being totally clear headed and functional. \u000a\u000aThis one will definitely be on my top shelf, great strain for sure. I think sativa sensitive people like myself would really appreciate it.

VWell, this strain is quite strong that&#39;s for sure but the high that I got from it was as not what I expected. I could describe it as a typical indica body high with a clear head surprisingly.\u000a\u000aIt starts off quite euphoric and energetic but quickly transitions into relaxation and the need to sit down and close your eyes. The body high is intense though.\u000a\u000aI was unfortunately disappointed by Blueberry.Didnt really enjoy this and probably won&#39;t buy again. Could be because  it was so strong. Good for those looking for pain relief or just want to pass out.

VGot recommended this strain by my budtender and damn this one of my favorite indicas. While not classified as a hybrid, this thing has the focus and euphoria of a Sativa and the pain relief, relaxation and, if you smoke enough, that deep sleep it sets you into. This indica didn&#39;t leave me feeling too in my head but it will leave you feeling mellow and chilled out. This is great for personal use to really chill out and is perfect before hopping in the bathtub.\u000aDo yourself a favor. Get a lush bath bomb, pack/roll up some Blueberry and your body will thank you.

This strain could be considered one of the most gentle highs for the body. I can&#39;t imagine anyone having a bad time because of inhaling Blueberry, but I&#39;m sure there are those that could be disappointed. Still, it has birthed one of my favorite strains: Blue Dream.

I felt it right away, hits hard, and lasts a very long time. Its heavy Indica genes make themselves very obvious in this strain, extremely relaxing. Use this medicine if you want to feel all your troubles, worries, stressors, and pain melt away. Have your munchies near by, you WILL be couch locked.

VI have the Brass Knuckles 1gram vape cart. It is insanely good. The exhale is the slightest hit of a blueberry muffin - just enough not overpowered in any way. Blueberry muffin made of weed. Thats the flavor. It is straight to my top 10. Its heavy too. It is a little psychedelic and it sort of divides sound and vision for me. If I hit this after a week or so break for a tolerance reset Id be on the moon.\u000a\u000aThis is def end of day unless you are a psycho like me and like to be heavily stoned at work. Sometimes. I intend to try the flower but I bet it will taste nowhere near as good as the Brass Knuckles vape but I will see. Overall for me flower never tastes as good as concentrate no matter how top shelf.\u000a\u000aOverall - awesome for the experienced at night.

VHow can you rate a &quot;strain&quot; when you get the same strain from different growers in the same city and it&#39;s remarkably different flower?  I earlier did a 4 star (4.5 rating) rating on Blueberry from Cannabiotix.  This review is for the same strain supposedly, but grown by The Facility and it rates a 3.0 at best, a 1.5 star difference on a 5 star scale.  Looking at the buds side by side the Cannabiotix obviously has far more crystals on it and darker blues/lavender colors on the bud.  I don&#39;t know if The Facility is shaking their buds in some machine or by hand to sell what falls off as something else, or is just using an inferior growing method, as I&#39;m just a stoner.  The smell of The Facility grown Blueberry is either strongly chemical or nutrient in nature compared to the excellent sweet berry smell of the Cannabiotix Grown flower.  Maybe The Facility is not flushing their plants before harvest?  I have have no way of knowing.  Anybody can buy some of each and compare.  Tastes and feels like totally different strains.

I\u2019m ready to eat dinner. Very smooth dab as well. Eyes have gotten heavy (keep in mind it\u2019s been only 2 minutes since the dab) great indica relaxes mind and body.

VBlueberry sat me down and I stayed down. It starts almost immediately with an insanely heavy body stone that won&#39;t let up. I actually felt like I was some how attached to the couch. Very few strains have made me that comatose. Enjoyable if you have nothing that needs to be done. It also made me a slight bit dizzy, which has never happened before.

VCresco labs has produced a crop of classic blueberry that reminds me of the same strain from back in the day. The flower is beautiful, fragrant, and strong. The effect is deeply relaxing with a very strong couch lock effect. Between the potency and nostalgia factor this strain is fantastic. The flavor is is very clearly blueberry with a mild sweet finish.

But the first hit was unexpectedly harsh. I didn&#39;t get the blueberry flavor until a few in.\u000a\u000aThe high feels heavy, but not couch-lock heavy, you can still function pretty well. It also feels soft. Like being wrapped in cotton wool.\u000a\u000aThis stuff makes you think really deep thoughts, too. \u000a\u000aThe downside is that the dry mouth and munchies are STRONG with this strain.

VTried this from a local medical dispensary when they finally had it available because I&#39;ve always wanted to try that &quot;old-school&quot; Blueberry instead of the newer mixed strains.  Happy to say it exceeded my expectations.\u000a\u000aIt didn&#39;t take much.  After my second bong hit I could feel the effects rushing in.  After my 6th, I put it down!  I found the high well balanced.  Very intense body effect, but also quite cerebral too.  Love that taste and smell.\u000a\u000aI bought this to help with insomnia, but it took about an hour or two for things to slow down where I felt really relaxed enough to sleep.  Normally I&#39;d slash a star for not being what I expected, but it more than made up for it in other attributes.  I find it does help sleep in lower doses, like just a couple good hits.  Much more and I find the cerebral effects keep the sleep from happening.

VI purchased 14g of this, grown by WW Agriculture. Harvested on 7/30/16, it was consumed on 1/1/16. There are no notes regarding pesticide use or grow location. It&#39;s budget weed, so while half of the nugs were tightly packed, well trimmed, and covered in sticky orange hairs, the other half were decidedly lacking in any of those traits. Still, for budget weed, this stuff was great. It certainly doesn&#39;t lack for potency, or for flavor, and it wasn&#39;t dry.\u000a\u000aAs for the high itself, I love it. It&#39;s relaxing, rejuvenating, and arousing. Perfect for setting the mood for a romantic evening, or for zoning out in a dimly lit room and listening to Zeppelin.

VGot the CO2 cartridge at medical marijuana dispensary. The purpose was to help with anxiety and insomnia. I used to be a heavy user and stopped about 10 years ago. I read that this was a good one to start out with. I took one hit at night about an hour before bed. I felt somewhat relaxed in the beginning and about 20 minutes in I started over-thinking things. It escalated quickly and realized I was over-thinking every little thing in my life, and not in a good way. Needless to say, I did not sleep at all that night and I do not think I\u2019ll ever use this strain again. My brother tried it and he said the same thing, he felt way too \u201chead high\u201d and almost started freaking out. (He\u2019s a regular user) maybe I got a bad batch, but just beware with this one. If you have anxiety or tend to be a \u201cthinker\u201d this may not be good for you.

VThis review applies to the premium cartridge of oil that I purchased from Sira.\u000a\u000a\u000aI bought this cartridge primarily to help me with insomnia (mine is caused mainly by anxiety). What I got with this strain was so much more. This strain helped me with insomnia, depression, pain, increased sex drive and also increased sensation (I.e. Made me and another person way more sensitive to touch than we would have been otherwise). \u000a\u000aI&#39;m a person who generally has a low sex drive because of anti-depressants etc so I&#39;m always looking for strains that are good for sex. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve tried a lot of strains but this is amazing. It&#39;s being added to my top 3 favorite strains along with Jack Frost and Flo OG.\u000a\u000aAfter the first inhalation I had a sense of calm and happiness: like everything is right with the world and you&#39;re just enjoying that one moment. Next any pains or tension I had began to melt away as I became more relaxed. After about 20-30 minutes sex drive increased and then it takes me about 40 minutes or so to have the desire to be able to fall asleep really easily if that&#39;s what I want (but it won&#39;t make you sleepy in that you need to go to sleep just makes it more easily accessible).

A &#39;go to&#39; for modern cross breeding, blues brings a tasty, true to name kick to the table in premium style that hits in best friend fashion. Leaves you wanting more as the high wears off sooner so can easily spend you up! Good day time smoke.

VI purchased this medicine from a nearby dispensary that I visited for the very first time yesterday. It did not disappoint. In fact I did not have to take any nerve medications before going to bed. I also slept like a baby for the first time in a good while.\u000a\u000aThis herb has a semi-sweet  taste with a very strong berry earthy aroma. You could see the crystals on the buds it was so delicious and pain diminishing. I recommend it for a good nights sleep.

VRelaxing, sedating strain. Definitely a creeper, so take a wait and see before overdoing it. Taste is fresh blueberries, smell is the same but even more on point with blueberryness. Nice way to end (or start) the day. But maybe not best for midday. Some cerebral effects as well, has a sativa note I haven&#39;t seen in indicas.

Very euphoric and sativa like in some ways. I can tell I&#39;m going to sleep very good tonight. 9.5/10 I say this only because the dry eyes are very bad and my anxiety is fluttering still. Prefer Lavender over this if using to quell anxiety, but Blueberry is on my top list for sure.

The smoke smooth as silk and had only a slight earthy undertone followed by the after taste of a berry flavor.  The scent of the smoke is sweet and strong.  The effects are calming, relaxing, but not total couch lock.  Great for a night cap, after workout, end of the work day, basically when you have the time to sit or just relax with your mind at ease.  Definitely worth your time and hard earned money to try at LEAST a little bit.

VTook a couple big blasts and watched a movie and had an awesome time! Very relaxing and therapeutic. After munching out I decided to see what this strain could do (like an idiot) and went outside and smoked a big one to myself. Be careful with this one. Although it&#39;s nice and easy going in moderation, it&#39;s a killer if you smoke too much. Way too high. Use lightly.

Vthis my overall favourite indica taste. the flower smells amazing ver strong sweet berry diesel smell. make you want to live in the bag. buds are very dense and make nice crack noise when breaking it up. i recommend dry hitting your joint before lighting it just to taste this beauty. after light it taste very smooth. exhale nice blueberry muffin taste. for many years this has been my fav. some other strains are stronger but overall is the best with taste.

So it&#39;s best to rest your eyes and enjoy the experience because you aren&#39;t going anywhere! This strain allows my mind to just drift off until I fall asleep and listening to music makes the experience even better! \u000aIt is obviously best used when you have time to sleep\u000aMedically this strain is top notch! This was the first batch of Blueberry I have tried from Compassionate Sciences in NJ. IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!!!

VOld standby with a great reputation and wonderful effects. LOvely taste and aroma with very pleasant aftertaste. Deep and heavily calming high with leanings toward serious couch-lock when a little overdone. A few hits will make you feel light headed and with a pleasant glow a few more and you will start to notice perception changes and a few more will give you a case of wicked munchies with a long lasting euphoria and detachment from whatever ails you. Also great for people who are suffering from persistent pain or unable to eat well.\u000a\u000aExcellent strain for those who have authorization for home cultivation as it makes for a great Screen Of Green plant which stays short but produces well and within a reasonable amount of time can provide ample medicine with easy growing practices.\u000a\u000aHighly recommended.

VNothing too special...kind of a blah spacey feeling. Depends on what you are looking for too though. I was looking for a day time up but with a  little body. This is more of just kind of spacey. Not that great for daytime office, tried grapefruit and found that to be a better fit. This would be ok for late afternoon or if you don&#39;t work during the day. Not my favorite and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d get it again in most cases. Not bad, but not really good for any of my needs. If someone wants mild appetite stimulation and a little euphoria or help forgetting things bugging them this is good for that though.

VAfter a sleepless night due to horrific muscle spasm under my scapula that ran up the side of my neck, I decided to try this VS GSC for pain in hopes my neck and shoulder would relax.  This has done the trick! I am still stiff and a bit sore but nothing like the pain I was experiencing.  Beat the heck out of acetaminophen and methocarbamol (useless muscle relaxer).  Can happily function now to carry on for the day. Shout out to my favorite store, Cannaco, in Trinidad, CO for recommending this strain.

VMy first D J Short&#39;s strain, but far from the last of his strain grown. of his favoured produced strains.  I every breeders new what D J Short knows about breeding since first winning his first Cannabis Cup in 1980 !\u000aAccording to his information he used three strains, Highland Thai.,Purple Thai., and Afghani. Where the Highland Thai was the first generation between a Oaxaca Gold and a Chocolate Thai.   My heart is still with DJ Shorts Blueberry and I really bought that any other breeders will ever come close to this achievement!

The one that makes you go sh*t, I knew I meant it when I said I&#39;d never stop smoking weed! The one that gives you old school munchies.

VMan! This strain truly is exceptional. I&#39;ve had it for myself no longer than a week, and yet still I can undoubtedly say this strain is what every weed smoker has been living for. Blueberry, is an indica, however, never struck me as a heavy one; more of a hybrid feel for me. The euphoric and relaxed high is unmatched by really any strain i&#39;ve had to date. The looks and the taste were good, although the flavour was incredible. A sweet and berry taste felt natural, and just right. The highs on this strain are long and very calming. I would recommend this strain to almost everyone of my friends and you should too. This strain is incredible!

VI got a sativa dominate pheno blueberry, from noble farms. noble is a good grower but they don&#39;t produce a high thc flower. this bag of blueberry came in at about 12%. the high is really a mellow head buzz and some body relaxation. the flowers are fluffy,covered in crystals. they have a nice pine green and purple almost kind of blue color, very nice eye appeal. the smell is really sweet and floral with a slight blueberry smell. real nice. the high does not last long at all. I can smoke a bowl and not quite a hour later im already well into the come down. which is disappointing and is kind of a injustice to how beautiful the flower is for this. the taste matches the smell really sweet and floral tasting smoke. all and all this isn&#39;t the worst flower I&#39;ve smoked but could be much better.

VThis Strain is a most have, it should be considered as a staple strain that you keep in your collection so it&#39;s always in reach. Blueberry has great medical qualities to help relieve stress and pain. It&#39;s also a great appetite stimulant. when it comes to relaxing and sleep, this strain has you covered. The last batch I received had just over 30 percent of THC! It came from Craft Deliveries in Berkeley California, and is available at many San Francisco bay area dispensaries.

Amazing berry and sweet smell, makes you want to smoke it immediately. Taste again is amazing and full of soft fruits. Strong indica effects, lots of couch lock, full body high, totally relaxing. I had some lemon drop at the same time and was mixing the two together to get slightly more hybrid effects. Blueberry is an all time classic, will always buy and use this.

VThe strain I tried is Noble Farms, listed as a 60/40 sativa-dominant, which I think is a little more unusual for this strain. More brightening and refreshing than I expected without necessarily being energizing. If I had too much I could see it might provoke anxiety, but I didn&#39;t experience any with light, repeated use. The &quot;brightening&quot; aspect made me feel more alert without making me restless. I could sit in my chair and stay focused on the task at-hand. It doesn&#39;t have a wow-factor that some other strains do, but I find that I keep coming back to it.

Doesn&#39;t take much for a buzz. Amazing tasty stain and very relaxing in the couch feeling. Great for insonmia. Negative cotton mouth and very stinky for sure stay off the hotel elevator with it, take the stairs. Other than that highly recommend if you haven&#39;t tried this strain.

VWhat I had was a salad of Blueberry and Bubba Love mixed together and I am telling you, that is probably one of the best highs I have ever experienced. I will try these strains separately and come back to edit this review later with a more clearly defined review, but I don&#39;t think I ever remembering being so happy in my life. Happy, euphoric, blissful, excited to be alive... this would be a cure for depression, stress, grief, nausea and body pain. Slightly giggly. It is very rare for any strain to have this effect on me. The only down side to it is that you quickly build up a tolerance for these blissful effects. The only down side to it leaves you feeling a little jittery and nervous in the body. Not in a mentally stressful way. It just feels like you accidentally drank too much coffee and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the Blueberry seeing how Blueberry is an Indica. I believe this is the effects of the Bubba Love. I&#39;ll edit this later when I try the two separately. I notice if I use this on my worst days and than I go a while without using it, it can be a good tool for those terrible days, but won&#39;t work for every day use and believe me, if it did I would be using it for every day use. A little hard to work with it outside of the home, but not impossible. Just don&#39;t do a lot of talking. lol. I mean you can, but you are gonna sound like a goofball oh and you WILL want to talk too. With EVERYONE. Landlords. Spouses who are at work. Pet ferrets, who do NOT enjoy slow dancing in the living room. Neighbors who don&#39;t want to be rude, but want to leave, however you don&#39;t notice because you are too high. So yeah. That happened. Also, there is a residual grogginess. So heads up with that. Well worth it. I will hunt this strain, grow this strain and try to improve this strain forever. lol. You can thank me later. ;) OH and if you do decide to try mixing it with Bubba Love, do no more than two parts Blueberry to one part Bubba if you get anxiety. The come down happens quickly minus the residual grogginess that lasts a couple of hours past the euphoria.

V60/40 Sativa dominant Blueberry from Noble Farms. Wondering if this isn&#39;t my new favorite, go to smoke for all occasions. my body and mind become one. I can still think, do things, be relaxed, do just about anything.  The reason for 4 stars is it just seems to be missing that little something to make it extra special, but otherwise this is currently my favorite go to smoke for all occasions . A nice uplifting smoke, that after a few sessions lulls me to sleep later on. Some indicas give me a real hard time falling asleep at night. Not sure why. So it is important to me that the cannabis I enjoy does not have that effect. not super tasty or super special but a great smoke I will definitely be back for the sativa dominant blueberry variety

VA great evening strain. Nice bright green colour with lots of orange hairs, nice sweet smell to it too. The high is very euphoric on top of that a nice sedating body buzz but I still was able to function fine. The only downside is the dry mouth and you get really tired as it wears off so it&#39;s a good evening strain.. It really helped my ptsd and anxiety.

VI had the pleasure of obtaining this strain from Salem Ma. dispensary. Any strong Indica is my nighttime medicine of choice. GDP and Dakini Kush have done wonders for my insomnia but Blueberry, so far, takes the cake. Very, very good dry smell with strong hints of blueberry. The smoke was fantastic! Very smooth and easy on the lungs and throat but packs a good punch after a few hits on the GravLabs 5&quot; bubbler. After about an hour of watching the Red Sox get their asses kicked against the dreaded Yankees, I was out cold on the couch only to have my wife wake me up for bed. Great purchase and medication!. I also picked up some Captain&#39;s Cake which I&#39;ll try tonight and review in the morning. Cheers

VFirst off, gotta love all the reviews were people are saying about hybrids and sativa versions like it\u2019s the same thing. Oh well, can\u2019t teach everyone, lol\u000a\u000aLove this sweet Indica, had it the first time a year ago, and it inspired me to grow it this year. Deep royal purple stems, dark green leaves with the same purple veins, with purple leaves near the top, and covered in dense buds. A gorgeous girl I must admit, and she carries an even more relaxing high. Great strain just before bed, or a nap. But as many have said, Blueberry carries a bite if you smoke too much, lol!

VOh boy..... Fresh pick up, open up to nice berry like blueberryish smell engulfs your nostrils but granted I can tell this cut wasn&#39;t cured to fullest potential but still good nevertheless.\u000a\u000aI load up vape and have it and the flavor is spot on, berrish taste  (not a real word) just smooth and very pleasant and now on to the effects, this hoe is a creeper and a very eurporic almost &quot;narcotic&quot; relaxing type of mood high. Very stoney but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s super potent but the high is more than intensity you know? just chill. If you&#39;re a fan of Afgani&#39;s, lineage you understand the hype and and I can see how some people wouldn&#39;t enjoy this because they feel like it&#39;s missing a &quot;punch&quot;. Pick this shit up if it&#39;s grown well. lasts long as well. Also if you get anxious at times his is God send for at least me... TOP 10 For me personally.

VO my, this batch of Blueberry must be Indica-dominant. Which is superb cuz that&#39;s what I prefer. Usually Indica-dominants are waay better @ addressing the medical reasons I smoke marijuana. Def a sleeper! Did not stay awake long after medicating last night. Pain gone; nausea minimal. Dizzy but whatever. Smell is best to date, very fresh green/blueberry smell. Nutty, creamy taste upon smoke (don&#39;t know how that works :-). Hits ya like a ton of bricks. Maybe strongest head buzz to date. I could see Blueberry inducing my anxiety/paranoia if I smoked too much. But after a bowl, NO ANXIETY PARANOIA (a must for me). Body high dang near perfect. Def recommended strain for any kind of medical ailment such as migraines or nausea.

VFirst thing I noticed that was different about this particular strain was the smell. It was not a bad smell but it filled my truck instantly as soon as I opened the small container of it. I packed a bowl of this for me and a friend and was one of the best experiences I&#39;ve ever had high. I experienced cotton mouth pretty badly but that is to be expected, the flavor of the strain is amazing. Blueberry is the perfect name. I thought I had just eaten a bowl of blueberries hours after smoking. I experienced a crazy high that mellowed me out but kept me awake. Easily the best strain I&#39;ve ever used, personally. I very highly recommend trying it even though it can be expensive.

VThe aroma is potent and calming in itself, and it&#39;s a great tasting smoke. My gripe with Blueberry is that it tricks my brain into thinking that I&#39;m a couch! I always fight the urge to veg on the couch (unless it&#39;s night time or football sunday) but it&#39;ll definitely give you issues when trying to form coherent thoughts in the first hour, or when trying to comprehend things. And yes, very good for people with sleep issues, or folks in pain. An uber-relaxant. Just a bit too strong of an indica for me. Doesn&#39;t give me much of a creative drive, except when it comes to food! I decided to dip my french fries in blueberry yogurt...YUM! Appetite stimulant. Stay away if you are an active smoker (like myself). 2.5 stars.

VThis Blueberry strain from Cinc-o-Dos was all right.  It didnt have a blueberry smell to or even a strong unquick smell that doest even smell like blueberrys like some blueberry strains do.  So it was lackin the smell factor but the high was still top notch.. It was one of those strains that didnt really look that great but still packs a huge punch.  I have had other blueberry strains that smell great and some that smell funky.  You really dont know what your gonna get when it comes to blueberry.  I was hoping for a better one from Cinco O Dos since there Snoop Dream smells so good. but the THC level of this Blueberry was 25.75% and a CBD of .19%

VComing from Purple Thai, Thai &amp; Afghani, Blueberry is one of the indica&#39;s that truly gives that term it&#39;s definition. An indicia it is. Just the slightest bit too harsh when used in glass for my preference, but an excellent insomnia handler. If relaxation of the body is what you are seeking you should definitely get some Blueberry

VLet me start by saying, id like to try this strain again, grown by someone else. I&#39;m interested in its effects, it left me somewhat confused. This Indica, left me paranoid and &quot;twitchy&quot;, much like a pure sativa. The buds looked gorgeous, but were &quot;airy&quot; and light. The smoke was strong and harsh on the chest. Black ash in my bowl, left me wondering if this plant was flushed properly. On the upside, this plant will get you very, very high! Its great for my back-pain and reduced sciatic nerve compression, by acting as a powerful anti-inflammatory.

VQuite shocked to find out this is an Indica -- I thought this was a hybrid!  It feels very euphoric indeed and had me feeling quite happy and productive.  \u000a\u000aThe flowers were quite exotic looking:  The bright green buds covered in juicy crystals were complemented quite nicely by a contrast of orange pistils and trichomes.  \u000a\u000aThe description of the strain leaves me a bit curious.  Did the grower produce a hybrid Blueberry strain, like &quot;Blueberry Haze&quot; and forget to include the &quot;Haze&quot; part?  I feel like this isn&#39;t quite as Indica as I&#39;d like, but whatever this truly is...I do quite enjoy it.

V(This review is strictly for the batch I recieved) \u000a\u000aI purchased this from Ganja Gourmet in Denver, Colorado and I think I got a bad batch or something completely different. It did not taste like blueberry  at all. Infact, it had more of a peppery aftertaste. It gave me a sleepy high with slight paranoia because of the strength.   I did, however, get a little aroused so that&#39;s a plus. I really was looking forward to trying Blueberry but this batch was not it. Definitely will try to get my hands on a legit stash and rate again.

Surely enough following the purchase, I found on Leafly that it was great for what I was looking for as well as pain of course. Conveniently I had a headache by the time I got home and after smoking a few joints no pain relief occured whatsoever, had to resort to ibuprofen instead &#128078; Regardless I was in a good mood, free of negative thoughts and slightly relaxed but the pain made it hard to relax further.

VPicked up this strain from Tilray in a 15g pack, first impressions were that it made me lazy and hungry. But if you&#39;re like me and want to avoid the &quot;munchies&quot; this strain is great if you&#39;re Into exploring nature and being outside which will calm the munchies. I recommend going for a hike in the mountains and smoking at the top of the trail. Overall great relaxing strain with a happy buzz!

VAs I cracked open the bag and the sweet berry aroma hit my nostrils, I knew Blueberry lived up to its name. One of the best smelling cannabis strains on Earth in my opinion, Blueberry is an Indica which also seems to carry some Sativa-like effects. Upon first smoke I noticed a deeply relaxed feeling and a mild wave of euphoria, but was not glued to the couch. Don&#39;t get me wrong, sitting on my ass was still incredibly comfortable, but Blueberry still leaves me fairly awake. It&#39;s fairly potent as well, with one blunt leaving my buddy and I strongly buzzed yet still functional. Not a terrible daytime strain in lower doses and excellent for putting you out at night with a little more. Highly recommended smoke for indica enthusiasts as well as the sativa-lover looking for something a little different.

VBlueberry is an average-priced strain here in Holland. It is priced at 8 euro&#39;s per gram at my local coffeeshop. The guys there told me the strain has around 15% THC. This strain is a indica-dominant hybrid, about 80% indica. \u000a \u000aI have smoked Blueberry through a bong and in joints. Its a very mellow, relaxed smoke. Blueberry has a real nutty and fruity taste/smell and it gives a real chilled out body high. \u000a\u000aWould advise this as an afternoon-evening smoke, it might give you a bit too much body high for the morning.

VI&#39;ve battled severe anxiety, depression and insomnia fire several years and many strains are hit or miss but Blueberry is definitely a hit! I&#39;ve been sleeping 7 hour nights like nothing and I feel great even the day after! I also have chronic knee pain and couldn&#39;t feel a damn thing after smoking this stuff! beautiful pain killing effects! general feelings of ease and comfort throughout. The only cons for me are severe cotton mouth and the very occasional paranoia fit when I smoke too much. But that&#39;s less the weed and more my actual anxiety anyways haha. anyways, highly highly recommend. one of my favorite strands of all time!

VHas been a long time favorite of mine! The taste is blueberry vanilla muffins , at least this seed ...now clones lol. With almost every pheno and blueberry cut I&#39;ve tried it&#39;s like this. Ya smoke and smoke and smoke the joint ok. And when your hitting it you definitely can taste the terps! While all that is happening your like yeah I&#39;m smoking a doob nothing major just the best taste ever lol but when you are done and your thinking about rolling up another one ,you get fucking smashed! It&#39;s a creeper y&#39;all! I&#39;ve screwed up and got halfway through the 2nd one to promptly eat and sleep. Anyway find a good looking cut at your dispensary, don&#39;t grab just any blueberry . Use your eyes and nose to determine if it&#39;s worth your time. With so many new strains don&#39;t pick up a weak looking buds just because the name! Enjoy your medication!

VHonestly one of the best experiences I&#39;ve ever had. Roommate picked some up for my birthday, shared a bowl with about 1/2 g between the two of us. High didn&#39;t kick in fully until after we cashed the bowl about 10-15 minutes later, but as soon as we stood up it hit me like a brick wall, very similar to how edibles feel. The high was phenomenal, a great sense of happiness and almost euphoria, plus a nice energy boost. Couldn&#39;t stop moving my arms because it felt so cool haha.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the high took a turn for the worst when a fire alarm went off in a nearby building and several people shouted and screamed outside and inside it. The high went from happy to intense paranoia within seconds, I was jumping at shadows and almost unable to walk I was shivering so bad. Definitely try to avoid stressful situations if possible, because it definitely alters the high. Or, you can do what we did and wait for said event to calm down, and then go back out and toke up again ;)\u000a\u000aAll in all, this strain was a phenomenal experience. I plan on getting some more to save for special occasions!

V3 tokes was mild. It was kind of a creeper. It did have some nice body sensations, but was just ok for pain management. Had 3 more tokes later, and felt a bit more.    5 tokes. First 3 So tasty! Next 2 not  bad. This amount came on much more quickly. Next time, 5 tokes before bath.  Similar experience. Nice. Last 2 at bedtime made for sweet visuals while I listened to music and fell asleep. This dose much better for pain.\u000a   \u000a After a sativa weekend, had 2 tokes before supper and 4 before bath. Very nice. Loved music. A few days of tuna and back to this.  3 tokes was quite nice. Finished the batch with a big bowl. 2 before supper and 4 or so before bath (with a ml of tincture too) I was very high, fell asleep on the couch I don\u2019t know when, woke and went to bed at 3:30 am...

VI have tried blueberry at several different dispensers, and I am usually satisfied. However, I must let you know that my wonderful caregivers have it down to a science. Karmaceuticals produces the best medicine in the whole Denver area. No matter what they always have something for me and it is always top notch medication. I recommend that everyone go give them a shot and I promise you will return again. Karmaceuticals won me over my first visit in their store. Go get some Karma and see what the big picture is all about!
