VGot a quarter oz that was tested at 26% THC and .43%CBD. Smells very fruity and tastes like earth berry. Very nice relaxing high with giggles. Definitely feel some eye pressure though, probably smoking some stems lol. Great strain, definitely worth it^^

VSmoked a g from a bong and it was absolutely amazing! Felt like I was in a dream. Made me very hungry, eyes were very red and my mouth was very dry. but it tasted sweet. helped with my Scoliosis backpain as well and kept me very chill.

VVery nice strain I got from a buddy that works for Dope Magazine in Portland, OR. Very nice, happy high. Take a hit, before inhale swish the smoke in your mouth, then inhale fast and short then almost immediately exhale. When done, you can definitely taste the flower flavor, I&#39;d say rose or lily, but DANKKK. When &quot;regularly&quot; smoked, taste is earthy, maybe some diesel? Overall, I&#39;m high. Beautiful strain I would buy again.

VAs a stand alone, Ultraviolet OG is a great strain - a juicy, flavourful, purple indica. There&#39;s certainly nothing wrong with that! But it is outclassed by many of the top shelf kush strains that are just better at all the things that make UVOG what it is. If you like the dankness but don&#39;t want to be smashed over the head with a brick, like GDP, UVOG may be the strain for you.

VI like this strain but not as an Indica. \u000a\u000aI had an extremely stressful morning on top of being sick so I dropped by my local shop to grab something that would help me rest and recuperate. After vaping it with my volcano I did feel a relief of some symptoms. Mostly uplifted but not at all sleepy or as deeply relaxed as I wanted.

VI might have got some bad batch. It&#39;s burning fast for me and the effects seem to be short.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s great to study on though. It&#39;s also nice to fall asleep with. I would describe the high like having full control but like your mind is opening. You definitely relax a lot with it and get pretty introspective.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve been smoking with a small bong. The experience really is not bad. It still can burn a little but I have had some good tastes from it.\u000a\u000aNot one of my favourites but it is okay.

VThere&#39;s nothing I dislike about this heavy-handed indica!  It hits hard if you overmedicate tho&#128514;!  Not as strong for pain, but it puts my ass to sleep! No better pain relief than sleep.  Love the taste, also. This good smoke.
