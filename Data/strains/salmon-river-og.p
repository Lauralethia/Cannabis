VOne if my new favorite indica&#39;s, the taste is very complex but familiar. The buzz is very strong and sticks around for a few hours.\u000aI have the #3 phenotype. \u000aThe flavor comes thru even more so with a vape cartridge.\u000aGlad I gave this strain a chance, the name was off putting I was afraid it&#39;d be salmon like.

VSmelling like berries, cocoa, coffee and hints of lemon; patients have been raving about Salmon River OG. It has a sweet berry flavor and undertones of lemon and cocoa that they enjoy. Patients say this flower works best for chronic pain, muscle spasm, and insomnia.

VI like it pretty good. The phenotype I had was a chocolate taste, and chocolate smell, coffee, hashish smell to it.It had strong indica effect.  Almost making want to go right to sleep. Which is why I smoke anyway. So for me great., but most strains I can use in the day and what not. This one cochlocks me and put&#39;s me to sleep. Real nice to sleep. Insomnia people go with this strain or Grand Daddy Purple, Gorilla Glue, Bubba Kush.

VI really like this strain for my anxiety/ptsd. It brings me down and uplifts my mood at the same time. The only things I can complain about with his strain is that the dry mouth is really bad and it does put me in the couch if I smoke too much.

VIt&#39;s a pretty typical Indica. Has a very earthy taste (like beets) and a nice aroma. This strain made me feel very relaxed and a little sleepy.

VSalmon River OG is one of the best strains I&#39;ve used. It&#39;s great for anxiety and pain and really just a good &#39;get out of work and slow down my brain&#39; strain. Holistic Farms is the grower here in PA who grows this particular strain and I get as much as I can every time I can.

VVery nice buzz, but as an indica, I would have hoped for something relaxing and sleepy. Instead it keeps me up and around past my bedtime feeling alert and creative. I am going to move it into my morning offerings.

VThe name of the strain is a bit off-putting in my opinion (suggesting a fishy flavour, gross), but putting that aside, I was surprised how stoned it got me, considering that I really prefer more THC.  Nice weed.
