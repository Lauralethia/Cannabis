VI bought this strain because of it&#39;s said vibe that it adds creativity. I was super happy to see it in a store here in Eugene, Oregon, this mysterious weed, with a mysterious background. When I seen it was available I had to try it. It smokes great, heavy and a bit dank. The quality I received was top shelf. I did not have a sudden burst of creativity, but I was occupied by music (Tom Petty, &amp; Genesis) and it made the music sound good. I have probably smoked thirty different strands in the last 3 months, and this ranks around the best. If you can find it, don&#39;t pass it up.

Lots of head bobbing and such. Nice giggly happy high that isn&#39;t super energized or focused like ATF. Evokes the strangest sensations of prancing around in lavender fields. Tastes exactly how you would imagine a flowery meadow to be in weed form, mixed with some nice citrusy notes and that slight hint of honey from a bee&#39;s nest. Absolutely dank.

VEver hit the Stoner Trifecta: prefect day, perfect music and perfect weed? May 13, 2018, Midlake&#39;s &#39;Trials of Van Occupanther&#39;, Lodi Dodi. I have no idea how to pronounce Lodi Dodi -- loady-doh&#39;dee? -- but I sure the fuck know what happens when you smoke it: you float away like you&#39;re sporting little cherub wings flap-flap-flapping away, lifting your ample and stoned ass off that second-hand Ikea sofa you bought for $12 off Craigslist and totally overlooked the bloodstains and used syringe buried between the cushions (Hep-C&#39;s a bitch, ain&#39;t it?) and deposited you bodily in Lodi-Dodi Land where everything is soft and beautiful and smells vaguely like Highland Park 18. And while you&#39;re enjoying that perma-grin, your cortex feels like that guy who tied 9,000 helium weather balloons to a lawn chair and earned the undying love of the FAA and probably would have been shot down a F-15 if he tried that stunt today. He&#39;d be dead and being dead sucks because you can&#39;t enjoy the heady high of Lodi Dodi or the magical tunes of Midlake. Moral? Don&#39;t be dead.

VClassic high!  A little dab will do you, and many other cleches apply; from my 40+ years as an occasional to regular smoker, I\u2019d have to say this is one to say yes to.  Nicely balanced with creative thoughts and relaxed tingly body. Motivated with a peaceful easy feeling, eases pain and helps increase optimism levels.

VWith a citrus/pine aroma, Lodi Dodi (for this review, grown by Pioneer Nuggets) provides a great euphoric high, that uplifts and even energizes. Best to smoke before your favorite at home hobbies. Lodi Dodi may hit harsh, but after a few sessions you&#39;ll find your comfort zone.

VHad higher expectations I think. Somewhat calming and relaxing for me, not very energetic or euphoric which I was expecting and hoping for. Just so-so for me, thought it would do wonders for my depression, anxiety, and ADD but sadly somewhat disappointing.

VMost unique strain I have personally experienced so far. Doesn&#39;t necessarily make me energized per se, but I do feel a much stronger sense of appreciation for music with Lodi Dodi. Lots of head bobbing and such. Nice giggly happy high that isn&#39;t super energized or focused like ATF. Evokes the strangest sensations of prancing around in lavender fields. Tastes exactly how you would imagine a flowery meadow to be in weed form, mixed with some nice citrusy notes and that slight hint of honey from a bee&#39;s nest. Absolutely dank.

VI think maybe I had too high expectations. Just didn&#39;t seem special in anyway and didn&#39;t really care for the taste maybe I&#39;ll try it again someday just to see if the stuff I got wasn&#39;t very good. But as of right now,  just boring nothing to look forward to which is truly sad.
