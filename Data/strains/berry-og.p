VLove this strain. I&#39;m a fan of anything with blueberry in it, and OG kush is the best of the best for daytime smoking. It&#39;s like blue dream&#39;s indicate dominant cousin.

Vfour and a half Stars should have been the rating as I&#39;m pretty fond of this one. the blueberry brings out a great deal of relaxation and calm while the OG Kush helps to counteract the Indica feeling. not a good choice before bed but great for the rest of the day

VOMG!!!! Think I am in LOVE...... went to Diego Pellicer for the first time today, &amp; was blown away by that place! They recommended Apple Berry by Lucid; ( I normally am straight indica, or a hybrid that is mainly indica) &amp; this is the BEST tasting strain I have ever had &amp; it makes me Instantly relaxed, and happy. That was only after two hits from my vape! It usually takes quite a bit to make me feel this way- but this will for sure be one of my fav statins!

VThis was a go to when I couldn&#39;t get sleepy one night for bed.  I fell asleep earlier from some fire bud and still needed to sleep for the next day, so after a gram cone of this I was couch locked and heavy ready for bed.  I was also hungry as hell but went to bed without because I was too stoned to fix food! LOL  Great strain to have on hand when you need the heavy indica stone to bring the mind back to bed. I got this from @wellspring collective on Broadway here in Denver and its listed as O.G. Berry, so I hope this is the same thing.  Still its great no matter what its name.
