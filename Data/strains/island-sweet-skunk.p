VThe Island Sweet Skunk I am smoking right now is from a new local pot shop in Colorado.  It produces a very heady, uplifting and hazy high.\u000a\u000aAlthough it&#39;s not widely known as a bud with pronounced flavors, the Island Sweet Skunk strain can actually be very flavorful!  If you have a well grown batch, you can taste a very pronounced sweetness to the bud that contains faint notes of vanilla, nutmeg, and sometimes butter.  As you exhale, these notes fade into notes of honey and almost a molasses taste.  Along with the vanilla, I sometimes taste the indistinct flavor of Fall which I think is actually a hint of red apple.\u000a\u000aThis Colorado grown Island Sweet Skunk almost gives you the feeling that you are floating a few inches above the ground, or the chair you&#39;re sitting in, while at the same time, you are surrounded by a very light fog.  This fog is almost completely invisible, except for the opaque feeling of a smoke-like substance layered between you and the existential items within your view.  Physically, there is a strong tingling sensation behind my eyes in addition to other areas of my face like my cheeks.\u000a\u000aKeep smoking,\u000a-The Weedman

VThis strain completely wrecked me. I was not expecting to get hit this hard. Supposedly has 19.6% thc content, and I believe it. Very strong CEVs and huge bursts of creativity. I was grinning like a maniac too and felt fantastic. Absolutely terrific.\u000a\u000aIf possible, vaporize at 180C, then 200C. Then do whatever you normally do with vaporized bud.\u000a\u000aIt does smoke very well too, of course.

VSweet Island Skunk BLEW ME AWAY! First of all. This is the kind of bud that smells through the jar! I pick this up just to smell it every chance I get.. It&#39;s very sweet and mango smelling with a hint of skunk. The best smelling bud i&#39;ve ever had. The taste doesn&#39;t translate through as strongly as I would have hoped but it&#39;s still some very good tasting bud. The high is very clear and enjoyable. Lasts for about 2 hours. This is the strain I would strongly recommend to someone who is trying smoking for the first time. Medicinally I would say it&#39;s good for Depression, Fatigue, and Stress.  4/5

VDid anyone mention aroused? Or is it just me-again? Mmm. Sativa. Yes. Motivated,  abso fucking lootley. However, not in a go make widgets in the factory sense, but a very creative sing at the top of your lungs, notice a cute boy checking out your ass, giggling about it, dreaming of a weiner dog farm, kicking in a rusty wooden saloon door with a cup of tea in your hand type of motivation. But yes, she&#39;s all they say she is. Especially in large amounts. Go balls to the wall, and be prepared for the ride. Definitely ready for contact sports. Energetic, but relaxed. It&#39;s great for that. Whatever type you&#39;re into. I give it a resounding: fuck yes. Oh and if anyone cared to stick around for this part: an excellent medicine to boot! Great pain relief and medicinal benefits. You can feel it. At least I can. So take my word for it: this is good for you, and a good time!  Two sour gummy worms with one girl stoned. As they say....or something like that. Right?

VI grabbed a gram of Sweet Island Skunk live resin from this dispo in southern CO. \u000a\u000aThe taste and smell can accurately be described as a citrus explosion.  It didn&#39;t give me a terp % but it had to have been through the roof.  The effects were perfect for exploring Mesa Verde National Park.  We were alert, energized, and upbeat as hell, eager to answer questions and be social.  Never did we get sluggish on this strain.  The duration was a plus as well lasting 2 strong hours.  All in all a blast and perfect daytime med. 10/10

VMigraine pain mild; nausea 7 when I medicated round 1730 or so. Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. No anxiety/paranoia (absolute must for me). Body high allowed me to kick @$$ cleanin. Twas so needed; it was great! Head high energetic, social &amp; focused (yay focus!). High lasted 3 + hours which was very nice for a Sativa dominant. Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea/fatigue! Love me good worker buds! :-))

VIsland Sweet Skunk and Sweet Island Skunk are two different strains. They&#39;ve been mixed up here. ISS is a Sativa and SIS is a Hybrid. If you&#39;re looking for ISS and someone passes SIS off on you as it being the same as ISS, you will be very disappointed. I love ISS and have grown it for awhile now. I once made the same mistake

VAn excellent sativa, especially for daytime use. Very uplifting and clear headed effects with a mild euphoria. Initial smell reveals a tropical fruity scent, followed closely by subtle skunky undertones. The taste mirrors the scent profile, starting  with a strong fruity flavour finishing with a slight skunk aftertaste. A great choice for anyone who is looking for a functional daytime medication.

Van off-shoot of Skunk #1, ISS is a good solid sativa; nice semi-sweet flowery taste; great for a day-time high to relieve stress &amp; anxiety and still keep you going..a review from Naggles at the Berkley Patients Care Collective:  \u000a\u000aFor this week&#39;s review, I get a chance to look at one of my very favorite skunk strains: Island Sweet Skunk. A sativa heavy hybrid, Island Sweet Skunk is most often considered a phenotype of Skunk #1 or a close relative. They certainly share similarities in appearance, displaying the same shade of light green. The bud structure on the Island Sweet Skunk is a bit more airy, tending more towards the sativa side. This difference helps indicate that it will be a more mental and uplifting experience. Although the buds are not quite as dense as you would see in an indica heavy hybrid, the sample I\u2019ve been provided has a golden sheen to it from its generous coating of resin.\u000a\u000aNow I\u2019d be lying to you if I said I waited until this point to crack open a bag and sample the smell. In fact, before even glancing at the front of the bag I have a nose full of skunky perfume. A truly complex scent greets me: a savory and sweet juxtaposition that gives me the impression that my nostrils want to fight one another. These warring sensations serve to entice rather than repulse like it\u2019s animal namesake.\u000a\u000aFor this review I decided to try something new: sampling from a bong. The airy bud structure, coupled with previous knowledge of course, makes me think that rolling this particular strain would be less pleasant. Often, sativa-heavy hybrids will end up far too springy, making it difficult for me to form it into the desired shape. Just for ease of consumption, I\u2019ve decided to use my water pipe. The hit is smooth and strong, with a citrusy kick. The onset of the high is very rapid, happening just as I finished my first bowl. The strength of this particular sample left me reeling, but it quickly settled into the energetic and uplifting high I had been expecting. All in all, I am pleased by [the functional-high] the experience [had].

VThis strain provides an expecptional experience for the user.  From beginners to the well experience this bus will satisfy you.  On first appearance it&#39;s a beautiful looking flower then you smell it and it becomes even more beautiful.  Nice skunky citrus tones with piney fuels.  The high is energetic and sativa leaning.  You can be productive while smoking this herb and it will not burn you out.  This herb will satisfy those who are used to kush or heavy indica it has that sedative and euphoric effect as well towards the latter part of the high.  I really enjoy this strain it&#39;s up there in my top 10 and i don&#39;t think any other strain or new one could take it out of that place.  Island Sweet Skunk is a masterpiece of genetic breeding in cannabis!

VI bought this strain because it was recommended to me for daytime use. Based on that testimony, I was expecting a straightforward sativa with uplifting and creative effects. What I found was that a full bowl of ISS actually had a heck of a kick. Straight from the vaporizer it was a strong, heady buzz with long-lasting and powerful cerebral effects. When I attached the vaporizer to a bong I found that I got a little too high, experiencing some dizzyness and anxiety. I would not recommend this strain for first time users. I am prone to anxiety, and although I have no problem with this strain, I see the potential for it to be uncomfortable for someone who is not confident in their ability to handle anxiety. I would absolutely recommend this strain for daytime use of experienced of adventurous users who want something energizing, uplifting and fun.

VThis was one of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked in a while. The smell of the Sweet Island is very strong and sweet/citric. This strain got me high after a few seconds, almost immediately. Very fun to smoke with friends. Energy was flowing all over my body after 10 minutes of having smoked it. My friend said he was so high that when he closed his eyes he saw the Berlin Wall. I&#39;d smoke this again if I could. 9/10.

VThis is my first time ever trying Sweet Island Skunk, and it just so happens to be the featured strain. :) The buds themselves smell exactly like the name. Strong tropical skunk with a hint of sweetness. The taste is just as pleasant as the smell. From the very first hit it came on strong and left me with a pleasant head high which become stronger very quickly. Very friendly good mood bud, but a good amount of it can put you to sleep. My final rating would have to be a 8.5/10.

VTwo years ago, I bought an unknown strain grown in Hawaii that was spectacular. I&#39;ve been hanging on to my last single bud of it ever since. After trying every Hawaiian strain out there, I think I can definitively say Island Sweet Skunk is it. High energy, euphoric creativity, and child-like wonder await you first-time user. For me, this is the ultimate attitude adjuster that will put you in a mood of deep appreciation for life and nature. As it tapers off, you will feel a little tired, especially if you used it early in the evening, However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this as nightcap bud. FYI, I&#39;d give this a 5 out of 10 for munchies. Purchased from Yavapai Herbal.

VWell, ok i am kind of a rookie when it comes to all these measurements I am a recent patient prescribed for depression, anxiety and adhd. I just received my first prescription today from tilray. My bag says 5.1 thc and 7.6 cbd. I am not a regular smoker but I had a very positive and uplifting experience. I found it dry but have some cure packs  to make it perfect for me how I like it. I own a bong so i ground up a small bowl enough for one giant lungful and was delighted by the taste. It was a real tropical almost outer worldly grapefruit flavor. It took a few to kick in  but was not expecting to get much of it as usually have the dank crown royal from crop king seeds which runs about 28% thc and 2.5 cbd. I partake about once a week for recreation or sometimes even once a month. Has not been my &quot;thing&quot; since I discovered cocaine, destroyed my life and got better and clean for a long time. Now the reason I ordered it this strain in particular was it is supposed to help with anxiety. For me it did not have this effect lol. It made me feel like I had a few cups of coffee and spent a few hours yammering at myself how nice it was lol. 4 hr time warp for me lol. It is in my opinion an excellent sativa uplifting wholesome do good things strain. Thats how I felt. Now like I said I am not a chronic these days but was back in high school and years after that. I just love the experience I had and it brought back so many memories and good feelings. No real burn out either just general good feeling :):) Relaxed after my deep thoughts and busy rush cleared my thinking. I also ordered warlock which is 10% cbd on my bag cant wait to try that lol. I am experimenting to find whats best but in general gave me an energy buzz and minor anxiety at first just like boon here is are your thoughts lol. Anyway love it hope this helps

VIsland Sweet Skunk is definitely one of the more unique strains I&#39;ve had the pleasure to smoke. The sativa genetics are clearly visible just glancing at these nugs, with spindly stems and loose, fluffy buds. The pleasant aroma almost reminded me of Kahlua with a smattering of tropical fruitiness. Absolutely delectable. On smoking, I was pleased to be hit with a wave of sativa buzziness and became giddy and talkative. The paranoia I often get from sativas was absent in this one as well. One of the happiest and most positive strains I&#39;ve smoked. A very versatile strain as it was suitable for day and nighttime use for me. Wonderful stuff.

Definite skunky taste, earthy &amp; has a tropical scent mixed in. \u000aThe buzz is great for wake n baking, gives you energy without making you feel too jittery. I love skunk phenotypes. Also gives me deep relaxation from head to toe. Last about 2 hours. This strain didn&#39;t trigger any anxiety or paranoia, it&#39;s an energizing yet relaxing strain. I love to be social on this strain, and I love going outside to walk my dog on Island Sweet Skunk. \u000a

VSURPRISING is about one the first words that come to mind after trying this strain. Great taste with a surprising kick to it. Yet still felt up to whatever lay ahead in the morning to come.  while some might place it in an AM class, i think it&#39;s more than up to the task of taking on your evening as well making this an added bonus for the more frugal fans out there. Helped with depression ADD/ADHD muscle spasms. \u000aI am still new to the idea of using pot for pain but with this strain I can honestly say if it was the medical properties of hemp or just the warm cozy buzzie part we love but I didn&#39;t seam to notice much as the buzz side takes over and one is left dreamin of south west islands,tall cool drinks and tales \u000aonly a pirate dare tell.\u000aI noticed bonuses of bronchial and dilation of the blood, which may explain the clearness in vision

Smells skunky but fruity, very odd smell, very flaky bud when I picked it up.\u000aCaused some pretty bad paranoia for me, a big downside, kinda ruins the high for me.\u000aBottom line is it&#39;ll make you feel pretty buzzed, pretty nice, but wont get close to fucking you up.

VI just picked up 7 grams of Local\u2019s Island Sweet Skunk at Oz. in Fremont.  They have a nice display of information by strain that is very user friendly.  The staff was kind and knowledgeable.  Definitely a place I will buy from again.  As for the weed, the package was a glass jar with bamboo top that seals up nice.  The buds were medium sized and tight.  They had that classic Island Sweet Skunk aroma and taste.  So smooth it makes for a great daily smoke.  Nice head high that allows you to get into your favorite binge TV show or get busy and get your chores done without dragging you down.  Highly recommended, very unique and pungent taste!

VThis strain is uplifting yet it can be very calming for ptsd when you&#39;re stuck in a ptsd induced panic attack (at least for me). The medical marijuana concentrate I have has a cbd rating higher than some indica strains but I can not remember the percentages. For concentrate: Taste is good, sweet and only light skunk notes on the exhale and when enjoying the aromatics of the vaped concentrate. Small doses are recommended for newbies as it can cause worsening panic attacks if you take too much. Yes this review seems to contradict itself, but different times of day give me different effects. Very much suggest this strain for overall daily use. will have to explore this strain more in a few months once Pennsylvania has full flower now that full flower has been approved by the medical marijuana advisory board for Pennsylvania. Here&#39;s to the future

VThis strain is uplifting yet it can be very calming for ptsd when you&#39;re stuck in a ptsd induced panic attack (at least for me). The medical marijuana concentrate I have has a cbd rating higher than some indica strains but I can not remember the percentages. For concentrate: Taste is good, sweet and only light skunk notes on the exhale and when enjoying the aromatics of the vaped concentrate. Small doses are recommended for newbies as it can cause worsening panic attacks if you take too much. Yes this review seems to contradict itself, but different times of day give me different effects. Very much suggest this strain for overall daily use. will have to explore this strain more in a few months once Pennsylvania has full flower now that full flower has been approved by the medical marijuana advisory board for Pennsylvania. Here&#39;s to the future

So either have a group of friends over and have a chill smoke session or be prepared to talk to yourself for about 45 minutes lol.

VThis is a great strain. It&#39;s uplifting, euporic, creative and makes colors more vibrant. The first couple of times I smoked this, I had it had a bit of a psychedelic effect. \u000a\u000aIt does a great job of getting rid of migraines for me. The only time it has caused a headache was when I smoked part of a joint that was laced with Jack Herer oil. Jack is also good for migraines, so I don&#39;t know what was up with that. Maybe it was too much at once. I tried it on three separate occasions and had the same result. When getting rid of a migraine, I find it&#39;s best to go slow and sneak up on it. The oil was probably too much.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this strain. It&#39;s one of my favorites.

Those medical uses, one reason I chose to try this strain, are generally less common in sativas and I thought it had a very pleasant effect. It will keep you from pain/stress without leaving you stoned all day. If you smoke recreationally, it&#39;s still an enjoyable daytime strain for doing active things or even cleaning.

It will keep you from pain/stress without leaving you stoned all day. If you smoke recreationally, it&#39;s still an enjoyable daytime strain for doing active things or even cleaning.

VOutstanding. Suffer from severe chronic pain, stress, etc... First time vaping this, I was totally pain free in about a minute!! Now that I&#39;ve been using it more regularly my body is adjusting to it, which is good, and the effects are still the same. Pain gone almost instantly and stress seems to melt away.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend to those that are new to this form of medication and still learning. I had almost given up on MMJ helping me until I tried this and now have a renewed hope and positive outlook towards getting off the Pharma pills that I&#39;ve been taking for years.

VMy all time favorite sativa in the US hands down and that\u2019s saying a lot. I\u2019ve had Chicago, Seattle/Washing Weed, and both South and North Cali. Pain relief is great for a sativa I\u2019d even call it surprising. It\u2019s a heavy and hard hit but it\u2019s worth each punch to the chest. This high will come on nicely whether you vape or flower or wax. It\u2019s not subtle and it\u2019s for a hearty wake and bake session and for those with higher tolerances even we should not forget and vape 15 plus hits and realize ISS plays like an indica. Creativity and some clear headedness can come through after an hour or so of straight and gradual imbibing of the plant. Magic green. Namaste

VThis strain is uplifting yet it can be very calming for ptsd when you&#39;re stuck in a ptsd induced panic attack (at least for me). The medical marijuana concentrate I have has a cbd rating higher than some indica strains but I can not remember the percentages. For concentrate: Taste is good, sweet and only light skunk notes on the exhale and when enjoying the aromatics of the vaped concentrate. Small doses are recommended for newbies as it can cause worsening panic attacks if you take too much. Yes this review seems to contradict itself, but different times of day give me different effects. Very much suggest this strain for overall daily use. will have to explore this strain more in a few months once Pennsylvania has full flower now that full flower has been approved by the medical marijuana advisory board for Pennsylvania. Here&#39;s to the future

I took a small hit of this out of my bubbler, and quickly felt the effects. I am moving around and feeling more relaxed and happy. I smoke regularly and recreationally, this however is the first time I smoke with the only intente of decreasing my anxiety. And it works wonderfully.

I missed that, I realized.  It may be the bag/batch that I bought just wasn&#39;t grown or produced well.  I like a good energizing strain.  But, I gotta have some pain relief with it.  This didn&#39;t do it for me.  Still a nice, tasty smoke with a good head buzz if you like sweet skunky weed like I do.

VThe true Throwback ISS is a large orange haired, light green donkey dick nug having, pungent skunky/sweet plant sent from above. A personal favorite and also one of the greatest positive, head high and cerebral trippy strains you can get. If the nugs aren&#39;t big, airy, bright orange and light green and smell like a sweet skunk, turn the other cheek and wait until you get a true Island Sweet Skunk cut. Highly recommended for a killer day time smoke.

VThe taste was not horrible, but I didn&#39;t exactly savor it. But the name Island Sweet Skunk does it justice because it tastes just like that. The effects we&#39;re fairly full but focused in the head. I did some stupid things smoking this. Like just absent minded shit. Was my first pre-roll from Phoenix Botanical, and I like it but I&#39;m not in love. If you can get past the taste, and have a lower tolerance level than me, it&#39;d be great for  you. I&#39;m heading in to try something else today. :)

VWOW! This is a great tasting strain. Heavy lemon/citrus taste and it sure is sweet! I&#39;d even say, &quot;hurt your teeth sweet&quot; for a cannabis strain.... LOL... This strain provides a great sativa effect as well. Great euphoric feeling and definitely helps jump start the creative thinking process. This strain is great if you like a sativa, but do not like the &quot;anxious&quot; feeling often accompanies a strong sativa strain. It also helps with the appetite as well, really great if you want to get something accomplished after dinner time. I purchased a 500 mg cart of liquid live resin from CY dispensary in Butler, PA. Prices in PA are starting to normalize to the national average recreational price. I would say this particular strain will become a regular and I will definitely try other concentrate forms. Kudos to Cresco Yeltrah, this is a killer strain!

VPerfect daytime strain. ISS has been great for relieving social anxiety and day time depression feelings for me. Sounds pretty cliche but the strain really does feel like a nice island breeze on a cloudy day. Light, easy high that leaves the user functional and happy. It could assist those who need help eating during the day as well. A big thank you to the Vietnam Vets who brought this back!

VWOW! This is a great tasting strain. Heavy lemon/citrus taste and it sure is sweet! I&#39;d even say, &quot;hurt your teeth sweet&quot; for a cannabis strain.... LOL... This strain provides a great sativa effect as well. Great euphoric feeling and definitely helps jump start the creative thinking process. This strain is great if you like a sativa, but do not like the &quot;anxious&quot; feeling often accompanies a strong sativa strain. It also helps with the appetite as well, really great if you want to get something accomplished after dinner time. I purchased a 500 mg cart of liquid live resin from CY dispensary in Butler, PA. Prices in PA are starting to normalize to the national average recreational price. I would say this particular strain will become a regular and I will definitely try other concentrate forms. Kudos to Cresco Yeltrah, this is a killer strain!

VI first tried an indoor strain from Harborside but this time was a sun-grown strain from Lakeside Remedy. The nugs are darker, drier, and more compressed than the green, fluffier nugs I had before. I was in love with this strain from Harborside but this one from Lakeside didn&#39;t get me as high, didn&#39;t smell as good, and didn&#39;t give me that euphoric perma-grin which I loved so much in the past. I guess this was my fort time learning about indoor vs sun-grown. While the sun-grown was about $15 cheaper, I will pay the extra in the future to get indoor bud.

VThis is my second rating, but I feel like I&#39;ve gotten to know the strain a little better. This is week number two now of smoking on this, and it definitely gives you the nice cerebral back of the neck, behind the eye high! And the grapefruit taste is really nice! But I feel like that&#39;s all this herb does for me, is just make me feel really lifted lol. Doesn&#39;t really give you the munchies, and didn&#39;t hang around for tooo long, but the &quot;buzzy, ready to go&quot; high is nice! Kinda mixed emotions I guess you could say lol love the strain, just maybe not for me.

VAppropriately named. Huge aroma - skunky and buttery but with an unmistakable sour fruit/soapy note. The smell will linger for quite some time, especially if burned instead of vaporized, making this one off-limits for those trying to be discrete. Has one of the most pleasant odors of any strain I&#39;ve come across and always gets comments. The flavor is sweet and sour, overall very clean. The buds are moderately airy but still look nice when properly manicured. Color is usually a light, limey green with characteristic long, orange hairs. The buzz on this one is tricky. A small amount leads to increased energy and focus but too much can make one seriously paranoid/anxious. Definitely a daytime smoke. Would not recommend for newbies or the anxiety-prone.

Decent not great on pain but a solid strain to build on cause it&#39;s not that heavy and won&#39;t put you down. Very relaxing and no anxiety. Oh and ISS kept my headaches in check the whole time. I personally did not feel the kind of get up and go that I would have liked so I mix in some Cinex or Super lemon Haze and that always jump starts me. All in all I would recommend this strain.

VAn overall nice sativa. The batch of the ISS i got were small, compact buds that were a lighter green on the buds with amber trichomes and light orange hairs. The smell was pungent, filled my nostrils with a sort of spicy sweet fruit with a hashy, skunky funky musk to it. Tastes were earthy, with mostly the musky skunkiness on the inhale with sweet undertones on the exhale. The high was super stoney, but not a couch lock or laziness whatsoever. A great active strain, looking forward to the next time i come across it

VHands down the best thing I have ever used for sleep in my life. I would agree with every descriptive word used previously for ISS. But for myself personally I find with a few tokes this gives me the most restful 8/9 hours of sleep I have had in my life. I&#39;ve tried nearly every sleeping aid from mild OTC to you are pretty much in a coma sedatives. This is by far the most amazing thing that I have ever used. And works wonders for relieving my nighttime chronic headaches. I have been suffering for 8 months in constant pain. This allows me to sleep through the night. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I always refer to it as ISS- also short for the international space station. Because the euphoria and spacey high is very intense with this. It is also when I find I am highly creative and artistic which is nice to let out before bed at the end of the day. Also, yes as the name suggests it&#39;s pretty darn skunky, however I find it has a nice earthy flavour. It&#39;s almost like having a coffee or tea before bed. I blast off to the ISS with some ISS before bed every night! Happy toking from the bat girl cave! \u270c\ufe0f

VRevolution Lab&#39;s ISS terp tank is 500 ml in an oil cartridge. The flavor is sweet with tropical fruit notes that remind me of mango, pineapple, and other yellow fruit. It is a strong sativa that has an uplifting and energizing effect. It stimulates appetite and does not cause drowsiness. This is an excellent choice for morning and daytime medication. Overall, a very good value for a light amber oil that is flavorful and mild on the throat. I typically avoid sativa because some strains can aggravate my anxiety. ISS was very smooth and did not make me feel jittery at all.

VAppropriately named. Huge aroma - skunky and buttery but with an unmistakable sour fruit/soapy note. The smell will linger for quite some time, especially if burned instead of vaporized, making this one off-limits for those trying to be discrete. Has one of the most pleasant odors of any strain I&#39;ve come across and always gets comments. The flavor is sweet and sour, overall very clean. The buds are moderately airy but still look nice when properly manicured. Color is usually a light, limey green with characteristic long, orange hairs. The buzz on this one is tricky. A small amount leads to increased energy and focus but too much can make one seriously paranoid/anxious. Definitely a daytime smoke. Would not recommend for newbies or the anxiety-prone.

VWOW! This is a great tasting strain. Heavy lemon/citrus taste and it sure is sweet! I&#39;d even say, &quot;hurt your teeth sweet&quot; for a cannabis strain.... LOL... This strain provides a great sativa effect as well. Great euphoric feeling and definitely helps jump start the creative thinking process. This strain is great if you like a sativa, but do not like the &quot;anxious&quot; feeling often accompanies a strong sativa strain. It also helps with the appetite as well, really great if you want to get something accomplished after dinner time. I purchased a 500 mg cart of liquid live resin from CY dispensary in Butler, PA. Prices in PA are starting to normalize to the national average recreational price. I would say this particular strain will become a regular and I will definitely try other concentrate forms. Kudos to Cresco Yeltrah, this is a killer strain!

VI had been looking for this strain for quite some time and when I went in to the last dispensary in Detroit, I found it! Having read about it, I knew I couldn&#39;t pass this up, boy was I glad I didn&#39;t. Very tasty, good on the inhale and somewhat fruity on the exhale, thanks Firehouse for the excellent bud!! Should have bought more, wasn&#39;t sure of potency, WOW!! Go here for some excellent medication for pain.

VThe taste was not horrible, but I didn&#39;t exactly savor it. But the name Island Sweet Skunk does it justice because it tastes just like that. The effects we&#39;re fairly full but focused in the head. I did some stupid things smoking this. Like just absent minded shit. Was my first pre-roll from Phoenix Botanical, and I like it but I&#39;m not in love. If you can get past the taste, and have a lower tolerance level than me, it&#39;d be great for  you. I&#39;m heading in to try something else today. :)

Smoke is oily hot, I can feel the thc absorbing in my lungs lol. All in all pleasant. The stone creeps on you, super pleasant and clear.

The immediate affects of pain relief as well as euphoric sense of well being make a huge difference in his quality of life right now.  It tastes amazing, slightly sweet with a great earthy aftertaste, and is very smooth when smoked. We will be trying this strain again soon.

VThis is my second rating, but I feel like I&#39;ve gotten to know the strain a little better. This is week number two now of smoking on this, and it definitely gives you the nice cerebral back of the neck, behind the eye high! And the grapefruit taste is really nice! But I feel like that&#39;s all this herb does for me, is just make me feel really lifted lol. Doesn&#39;t really give you the munchies, and didn&#39;t hang around for tooo long, but the &quot;buzzy, ready to go&quot; high is nice! Kinda mixed emotions I guess you could say lol love the strain, just maybe not for me.

VThe true Throwback ISS is a large orange haired, light green donkey dick nug having, pungent skunky/sweet plant sent from above. A personal favorite and also one of the greatest positive, head high and cerebral trippy strains you can get. If the nugs aren&#39;t big, airy, bright orange and light green and smell like a sweet skunk, turn the other cheek and wait until you get a true Island Sweet Skunk cut. Highly recommended for a killer day time smoke.

VI don&#39;t know if I would say that it helps me focus but it does definitely energize me without spacing me out too bad.  It gave me an energetic head high but not much of a body high.  I missed that, I realized.  It may be the bag/batch that I bought just wasn&#39;t grown or produced well.  I like a good energizing strain.  But, I gotta have some pain relief with it.  This didn&#39;t do it for me.  Still a nice, tasty smoke with a good head buzz if you like sweet skunky weed like I do.

VThis is excellent stuff.  It was exactly what I expected.\u000a\u000aI was able to drive (1hr both ways) beautifully - never confused or paranoid, and listening to music and singing the whole way.\u000a\u000aGood for driving, surfing/relaxed but being interactive conversation if anyone is around.\u000a\u000aIt did not make me hungry (like GSC) so you don&#39;t have that side affect too much.

VReally nice smell, overall i do like this strain but as compared to Jamaican that I had last time, I have noticed slightly more paranoia and anxiety with this strain. I also didn&#39;t get as much of the fun giddy effects as some other strains. A couple times from this strain I noticed blurred vision but eye drops helped. Definitely got sleepy/couch potatoy from this strain...

VThe first thing I noticed about this strain ( and i think you will too) is the intense smell-for me, this stuff made the entire upstairs of my house smell like pot; so be warned. If smell isn&#39;t your worry; than you&#39;re gonna have a blast with this strain- it&#39;s incredibly uplifting and energetic and i just wanted to go out and explore the world when i smoked it. I was more creative than ever before and it&#39;s on my top 5 favorite strains. It smells heavy of a pungent skunky smell for me

VThis was my second venture into Sativa&#39;s. Not sure why but this did not hit me very much. I found it lacking in strength and duration almost like I had taken nothing. I tried again during a migraine it did ease my head ache but for some reason it has a masking feeling with me. I barely felt anything. So I have a hard time being negative cause it worked on a headache but at the same time was 0 for anything else.

Vision slips to fractional images independent from audio cues. Enjoy and truly, let go and relax.

VI first tried an indoor strain from Harborside but this time was a sun-grown strain from Lakeside Remedy. The nugs are darker, drier, and more compressed than the green, fluffier nugs I had before. I was in love with this strain from Harborside but this one from Lakeside didn&#39;t get me as high, didn&#39;t smell as good, and didn&#39;t give me that euphoric perma-grin which I loved so much in the past. I guess this was my fort time learning about indoor vs sun-grown. While the sun-grown was about $15 cheaper, I will pay the extra in the future to get indoor bud.

VHands down my favorite strain.  This was the first concentrate I bought after getting my medical card in Illinois. The guy told me this would kill my fatigue from Crohn&#39;s, and I genuinely laughed. I had never felt energetic from cannabis until this strain.  The live resin from Cresco is so crumbly and tasty that I wish it was less potent, so I could smoke more.  One dab of this has me cleaning my entire house and the rest of the state in 4 hours.  I also like to pair it with a mild indica like Monster Cookies.  The combination of being super efficient and totally relaxed is perfect for grinding at night.

VWas the only sativa at the dispensary the one day. Only picked up a gram in case I didn&#39;t like. Kinda glad I did, although it&#39;s wasn&#39;t a terrible smoke, and was actually quite tasty.\u000a\u000aIt definitely lacked the energized and focused sativa effects I was looking for. Left me a bit couch locked, sluggish and foggy. Any pain I had was gone and it was one of the longer lasting strains I tried however. \u000a\u000aI found it more akin to a indica dominant hybrid. I was wanting something with effects more similar to Sour Tangie or Jack Herer. Not a bad strain but probably one I won&#39;t pickup again.

VPretty nice bud. The first thing I noticed is that it is and active strain. I got sort of restless if I was sitting in one spot too long. In some cases it heightened anxiety but not bad to the point of giving up on it. The taste was pretty sweet and fruity. Lasted a good while and was great for socializing or being outside. Quite decent indeed.

VBeing a huge Indica fan, I typically don&#39;t use Sativa&#39;s, but this strain made me open up to a whole new world of pain relief, and a very functional high.\u000a\u000aWeighing in at 19%, it&#39;s overtaken by the high quantity of CBD, so you won&#39;t get that disconnected high, but a lot of the benefits. I can see this being a Med strain. Having blown knees and lower back, after a couple draws off the water pipe, the pain actually goes away! Seriously! I haven&#39;t felt this good since before the war!\u000a\u000aUnlike some Sativa&#39;s, this strain didn&#39;t trip my triggers for PTSD, and it actually relaxed me enough that my hypervigilance subsided! Though there&#39;s a small chance of paranoia that&#39;s common for strong Sativa&#39;s, I felt no paranoia, even after several bowls.

VIn many ways a 5 star strain for me, ISS brings to me an intensity and clarity that I rarely find. It brings me a euphoric experience that doesn&#39;t prevent me from being productive. Its quite magical. But ISS also comes with the high cost of a heavy head. It makes my head feel twice as heavy. Its weird... but not a buzz kill either.

VCAUTION DO NOT MIX WITH ALCOHOL.\u000aI really enjoyed this strain. Its not very consistent when it comes to effect from nug to nug. Some i found were quite a bit more potent than others. The smell of the flower is a think mix of scents that is hard to dial it down. The taste lacks hard. Its a smooth smoke with a almost nonexistent taste. The one thing I did notice is that when smoked while consuming alcohol with this strain brings it to a new level. The mix will send you to the moon and back before you even finish you dose. Enjoy but mix with caution.

VIsland Sweet Skunk [exclusive &amp; smoked w/pipe]\u000a\u000aAs a beginner trying 5 other popular sativas, Island Sweet Skunk just stayed my #1 favorite sativa. It is the only sativa strain that has given me euphoria and kept me positive for most of my day. It was very profounding. 3-4 hits and Im feeling well, 5-7 and I&#39;m feeling on top of the world at work. Oh yeah, I worked better and had a better attitude at work! This strain generates self love and people love I swear, you would want to compliment everyone you meet. And it also motivates you and gives you a lot of self confidence and just an overall happiness and excitement in life euphoria! I hope this strain grows more popular!

VMellow and smooth.  Didn&#39;t hit hard, rolled on smooth. Very clear and relaxed feeling. Got 3 hours sleep due to my work the night before and was super tired. Came home, smoked a bowl and felt awake and less fatigued with a happy chill feeling, somewhat euphoric.  Went to movies and came back, smoked a little more and laid down to watch tv and possibly nap. I crashed and slept 4 hours, totally out. great nap. Seems like a great strain that caters to your mood.

VDull buzz. I think I got SIS (hybrid) instead of ISS. Bought thru delivery, delivered as &quot;SIS&quot; on label. I had confusion when I researched prior to purchase because there are some reviewers who wrote that ISS (Island Sweet Skunk) is different from SIS (Sweet Island Skunk) - w/ISS being the sativa &amp; SIS being a hybrid w/more indica qualities. The same goes for an internet search outside leafly.com, although most reviewers say they are known as the same name and there is no difference. My delivery service said SIS (which I bought) is the same as ISS, but I DISAGREE. The &quot;SIS&quot;, Sweet Island Skunk, in no way compared to the rave reviews and my expectations of what people are calling &quot;ISS&quot;, Island Sweet Skunk, and the buds in my order were small and not as trichome-ie as the pictures of the longer, bigger buds of ISS -Island Sweet Skunk. The &quot;SIS&quot; that I got left a dull, functional buzz, but there was no creativity or energy as associated with what I feel is the real ISS, and how it is rated as such on leafly, etc. There was no &#39;get-up-and go&#39; feeling and my brain never clicked into awesome thinking mode. Confused? So was I, as the SIS will make you forget what you got up from your chair to do, and you&#39;ll walk in circles until you remember, but  other than that, all you feel is dull. No fun, no smiling, no happy, no thoughts. That&#39;s not what I smoke for.  I smoke to get up and go, forget my pain, and work. Or in other cases, sit and write, or do an art project, which is why I like the creativity of the sativas. I am a long-time smoker and while I&#39;m new at the medical level, I&#39;m not new at the smokers level, and after smoking the &quot;SIS&quot; I felt it would have been one of private party pick-ups from years ago that I would have said &#39;man that shit sucks.&#39; So medi-smokers beware: my thoughts are if you see this as &quot;SIS&quot; (Sweet Island Skunk), it&#39;s the hybrid, lower end of the true strain, ISS, Island Sweet Skunk. My delivery service has always provided top shelf, &quot;A&quot; grade meds, so the issue isn&#39;t with them switching something out on me. My issue is with someone messing up somewhere and making my delivery service believe they received the true ISS instead of of the indica dominant strain, SIS. I never complained to them. Just smoked it and waited until this dose ran out, but I do wonder if anyone else complained that SIS just didn&#39;t live up to the hype of ISS. Personally, for fear of getting SIS again, I won&#39;t buy this strain, which is unfortunate because I&#39;d like to be able to try the real ISS and know that I&#39;m actually getting the ISS and not SIS. Maybe I&#39;m wrong and there is no difference, in which case go for the ISS or the SIS if you want to take the chance. I didn&#39;t believe the people who flouted the idea that there were 2 strains, but after smoking it myself, I believe that to be true. Unfortunately, I won&#39;t take the chance again.
