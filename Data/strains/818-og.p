VI love this strain! Both flower and shatter, the awesome bud tender turned me on to it. This flower takes all my pain away and it makes my mind tingle&#128525; It remains on my shopping list when my store has it.

VDefinitely one of my favorite strains so far. You get lost in this high. Extremely uplifting. Very giggly when you aren&#39;t lost.

VSuper relaxing and long lasting....this is one of those strains you watch a semi rated comedy and laugh your ass off anyway.  You will feel sluggish is smoked a lot but still well worth it.

VCouch LOCK.. I am a picky man and this Firebrand 818 OG is powerful. You will have severe rubber neck and that means.. even with an epic tolerance this will leave you amazed. Left this review because I went back 2 days later to buy more and this flower is worth leaving a review.

VI can\u2019t stop buying this strain. I get along really well with the terpenes. I\u2019ve been smoking for over 10 years and 818 is my go-to sleep aid strain. Knocks me OUT. Really helps with anxiety and pain. Panic attack stopper!

VAbsolute 10/10. EXTREMELY potent, incredibly euphoric, fantastic body-feel, very relaxing, and a highly effective painkiller for my post-surgical aches &amp; bowel pain. Probably my favorite indica I\u2019ve smoked so far.

VOne of my favorites, next to L.S.D..  Thi bud never seems to fail or live up to its name.  This is one of those strains (or so it seems), that if it hasn&#39;t been flushed (burn grey/black), had mold, was harvested to early = racy, it never seems to matter, popcorn\u200b shrimp size buds to big apple size buds, it always seems to smoke the same.  This must be one of those strains that just stays the same no matter what.  If you&#39;re a producer you know that you can&#39;t forget to water, see the plants looking dropping, dried up, throw some nuts and water and -poof, all better.  This has got to be one of those.
