VI sought this out due to all the outstanding positive reviews, but found it an uncomfortable high like being paranoid is uncomfortable and unpleasant. It was a bit stronger than I expected, and that was from only 2 or 3 pipe hits. I went to make a pie a bit later and really screwed up some very simple production stuff, like pouring dry ingredients or sugar, salt, cinnamon and corn starch right onto the berries instead of mixing them all together first. Duh.  Sort of made me feel dopey and stupid, not creative. I&#39;m disappointed, as I always research well after looking at menus, there are so many new strains out there, or new to me at least.

VLemon Jack was suggested to me as a great strain to help with depression, motivation, and productivity. Holy Freakin Crap! The first time I smoked it I raked all of the leaves in the yard. The second time I smoked it I vacuumed my bedroom, cleaned the laundry room, and cleaned the entire kitchen. This is totally my go to strain for getting shit done. I love it! The come down isn&#39;t too bad either. The only problem is Lj is hard to find.\u000aFor novice smokers trying this I would definitely recommend taking a hit or two and then waiting about twenty minutes before having any more. This strain, though good, can cause a bit of paranoia and anxiety if overdone.

VLemon Jack is a great strain if you&#39;re looking for a creative energetic buzz. I feel literally no sign of fatigue when I smoke Lemon Jack, and it just completely energizes my mind. My focus gets really intense and it&#39;s one of the few strains I can smoke before doing work. However, the comedown is really intense and I usually just knock out as soon as it happens, so beware. Oh, also I get insane cottonmouth when I smoke this, so have some water or something.

VFirst vision becomes extra bright and clear! Lots of that Jack clarity upfront. Mind seems similarly clear. While there is a tad mood elevation/euphoria, it\u2019s overwhelmed by the speediness of the high. A bit difficult and racy in the chest - also, not uncommon of Jacks. Powering through it, but man...no thanks. After the edginess subsides, your attention\u2019s freed to take note of just how much your vision\u2019s affected - almost to an interfering degree (very trippy stuff)! Head space is awake but partially disabled lol. It\u2019s fun, the energy\u2019s good. What an unfortunate swing in polar opposite experiences. I wish the beginning wasn\u2019t such an awful barrier to experiencing the psychedelic latter part of the high, but as such - I can\u2019t recommend.

VLemon Jack is a great strain to consume if you want the stimulation without the psychoactivity.  It does have a bit of a body kick to it, as both Jack Herer and Skunk varieties do, however, it is quite a bit more of a shaky-too-many-cups-of-coffee buzz than it is a euphoric one. That being said, it is certainly energizing, but I personally prefer mood elevating properties in my cannabis

Its very steep take-off right from the first hit can knock your socks off and take you for a ride to the moon before the smoke clears.\u000aI have a large knitted scarf I put on when a high gets too racy and intense...this definitely took me there.

VA variation of Jack Herer,  gives it a lemon twist, nicer tasting than the typical floor cleaner green tea  menthol of straight JH, and I find the Lemon Jack is a bit more edgy energetic than JH. I could see Lemon Jack producing a bit of anxiety in larger doses unless you go out and run around with it.Its ok for wake and bake,and the come down isn&#39;t as  strong as Sour D.For Jack Herer versions, I only need Premium Jack. One odd note, making tinctures with most Jack Herer versions  have produced some of the most awful tasting tinctures Ive ever made. Only straight JH, Premium Jack,and Lemon Jack have  tasted ok. Others I made,like Black Jack, Critical Jack,  have been so rotten tasting in tincture I had to throw them away.  JH pheno types are strange like that.

The flowers I picked up today (The Green Room Society on Mount Pleasant) were a little dry and broken for my preference (They are aware of this issue: the bud tender even commented on how he&#39;s been begging for Boveda packs) , but otherwise the quality of the product was impeccable.

VLemon Jack feels like your mind, body, and spirit is getting plugged into a charging port. The weed effects the body in a relaxing yet electric way, and my mind feels very sharp when I smoke this. Personally, for next time I may combine lemon jack with another Sativa-dominant Hybrid. The lemon jack is very stimulating to the mind and it would be good to have a Hybrid combined with it if you don&#39;t want your mind to feel too active. Lemon jack will also make daily chores a lot more fun.

VThis was my first time trying this strain. I&#39;ve tried Jack Herer and Lemon by themselves but when they&#39;re combined... BAM! I found myself extremely focused, focused enough to get on my hands and knees to clean ALLL DAY. This strain makes you extremely focused yet calm. The only downside was I was expecting to to taste more lemony but it tastes more like a reeeeally strong lemon scented Lysol wipe. Verrrry chemically tasting. Still enjoyable! Got a good high after only 2 hits, I find myself not even having to finish my bowl. Good for if you&#39;re a baller on a budget and looking for something to get you there quick. Like this strain, probably would purchase a few times from now.

VMeh, I am not a fan, vaping flower in my G Pen. Leafly&#39; description of it is spot on, peppery and spicy flavor definitely comes through. I do not feel anxious with it, but i definitely feel the Sativa head high and relaxed. I bought this flower with some Strawberry Cough, and unfortunately for this strain, the SC beats this strain by miles for me. Maybe I should not buy flower I like with new flowers i have not tried before. I also am not a Jack Herrer fan, so that may add to my unimpressed review of this strain.

VI&#39;d give a 4.5 but site won&#39;t allow.  It&#39;s an excellent strain if you are into a balanced hybrid that is &quot;big&quot; in both departments.  The smell is similar to Grapefruit strain, or any of the big citrus bombs. Citrus jet fuel, a very distinct and dignified aroma.  \u000a\u000aLittle anxiety, and I am prone to anxiety occasionally and with certain strains. A little dry mouth but not a big deal.\u000a\u000aThe effects are very balanced, a certain AK-47 type head rush and &quot;race&quot; feeling, but also you can feel the kush lineage with the relaxing and stoney body buzz.  Again worth a shot if you are into strains that are balanced and also very potent.

VUsed method of vaporizing shatter, the description given on Leafly is spot on, chemical lemon, chemical and peppery going in, lemon profile on the exhale. The high felt as if my head was a slot machine in perfect order from a previous jackpot and then bam! someone pulled the lever and did not stop spinning for the longest sativa like time, during the first half hour experienced a bit of couch lock followed by paranoia which I personally enjoy as it lets me know I\u2019m high. The focus part of it doesn\u2019t come in for at least 1 hour in my experience as I had trouble putting my thoughts in order due to its potency. Excellent strain. Potent. Unique. Hybrid like qualities in the beginning and sativa dominant for hours.

VA variation of Jack Herer,  gives it a lemon twist, nicer tasting than the typical floor cleaner green tea  menthol of straight JH, and I find the Lemon Jack is a bit more edgy energetic than JH. I could see Lemon Jack producing a bit of anxiety in larger doses unless you go out and run around with it.Its ok for wake and bake,and the come down isn&#39;t as  strong as Sour D.For Jack Herer versions, I only need Premium Jack. One odd note, making tinctures with most Jack Herer versions  have produced some of the most awful tasting tinctures Ive ever made. Only straight JH, Premium Jack,and Lemon Jack have  tasted ok. Others I made,like Black Jack, Critical Jack,  have been so rotten tasting in tincture I had to throw them away.  JH pheno types are strange like that.

VHad this Lemon Jack in a vape pen (not a concentrate pen) and it nearly melted my brain. This strain has the potential of being an extremely potent sativa that is best left to those of strong mental will. Its very steep take-off right from the first hit can knock your socks off and take you for a ride to the moon before the smoke clears.\u000aI have a large knitted scarf I put on when a high gets too racy and intense...this definitely took me there. Respect the Jack!

VThis is the strain I use when I need to get work done around the house. Seriously. It doesn&#39;t make me feel super high, it just makes me 500% less lazy. \u000a\u000aUsually, whenever I need to do boring chores, I have to bargain with myself to get anything done. I&#39;ll tell myself if I clean the kitchen, then I&#39;ll let myself take a 2 hour nap (which usually turns into a 3-4 hour nap). \u000a\u000aWhen I use Lemon Jack, I turn into a responsible adult and I just start cleaning and cooking and doing whatever else needs to get done and then three hours later, I&#39;m like &quot;Holy shit, I&#39;ve been doing chores for 3 hours without once stopping to waste time on my phone.&quot;\u000a\u000aHowever, I should be clear that every single time I&#39;ve used Lemon Jack, I used it hoping to get stuff done (because I&#39;d read on Leafly that it is a good strain for being productive). So it&#39;s possible, it&#39;s just the power of suggestion at work.
