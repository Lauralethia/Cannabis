VThe smell is quite strong and not too pleasant in my opinion. However, this strain works very well for daily mid level pain relief (I have sickle cell anemia and osteoarthritis )   It puts mid in a good functional mood, so I can carry on a daily routine and be around my family, without being a couch potato. \u000a

VVery amazing strain in my opinion. I underestimated it. But once my brother had me try it, pretty quick results. Amazing body high like never before. Moving wasn&#39;t an option for me, I crashes. Great for if you&#39;re having stress, or pain. Melts it all away.

VI picked up an 1/8 of this stuff for $60 (overpriced but my friend told me it was not to be missed) and it was very frosty and smelled skunky. I had high hopes for this strain but I had some very bad experiences with this strain. the third time smoking it I had the worst panic attack of my life, it really fucked me up for a couple of days. and I had a couple mini panic attacks 2 more times when I smoked this. when I didn&#39;t have panic attacks it was a very nice sedating high, with warm tingly body sensations with a less intense head high. id pass this strain up again unless it was extremely cheap.

VNothing too crazy going on with midnight. I have a higher tolerance and usually stick to indicas but this was a pleasant surprise. The bud has a really great bag or jar appeal, tannish green nugs coated with a layer of sand colored trichomes and dark orange hairs, it is quite a sight. But as noted with the leafly review, this is a higher CBD strain so it caps the THC levels, thus making it less of a fun strain and making it more of a medical strain. I deal with anxiety and depression and I would suggest this to anyone dealing with those. I was able to make dinner, watch a movie and play with my puppy all at the same time so your mind is definitely in the present. The taste was kind of stale though so maybe have your favorite drink nearby. 3/5. Not bad but probably wouldn&#39;t purchase again.

VEnjoyable smoke, I rarely smoke anything other then skins so the flavor in Raw unfiltered papers was great. Certainly an earthier strain. The high is good and again enjoyable but I felt more couch lock then wanting to get up and go which I had anticipated. For someone with a bad back and knees, the pain relief was the highlight of the bud. Super comfortable feel.

VSo the first time I ever smoked a large amount of weed for my tolerance level was the 3rd time I&#39;d smoked any weed (small hits twice in the day prior) and this strain was the one I smoked and it was interesting to say the least. I know some of these effects are due to the exceedingly high dose for no tolerance, but most were only felt in this strain. So about 5 minutes after I smoke I start getting a couple of snacks (some chips and shit) and then I just stopped, put all my snacks away, and went to my room for the night. So I&#39;m in my room now after quickly doing all the things I needed to and about ready to set up my tangled as hell bed when I walk up to it, stop in front of it, and just fall onto the bed and pass out for about 15 minutes while feeling every cell in my body as though it were some kind of art piece by Picasso, and thinking about nothing but the universe and the existance of it. Then I just kinda woke up, chilled while heavily buzzed (like vibrating feeling buzzed) and then did my bed and went to sleep. Haven&#39;t been able to try it since, but I&#39;d definitely do it again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time alone

The effects came on fast, but were so stealthy I didn&#39;t even realize I was high until someone spoke to me. It&#39;s wonderful for aches and pains...I just felt so very comfortable and relaxed, without a heavily drugged/stupid feeling. I was actually able to have conversations. Food was great, but I didn&#39;t have as much of the intense hunger I usually experience with concentrates. Definitely recommend!

VPhysically, the flower has a beautiful lilac/purple/green color with some buds having a slightly more purple hue. Very strong aroma, very earthy. Flavor is deep and earthy with a floral aftertaste.\u000a\u000aThis bud is ideal for relieving pain and sharp anxiety. Full body stone with a *very* clear head. That being said, it doesn&#39;t possess much of the free association/creative element which I have come to expect from sativa-dominant hybrids.

VIts mellow. First hit left me in an uplifting and happy mood plenty of laughter. Gives you a euphoric head high and mellow body high. Second hit the feelings intensify. Third hit just maintained it. Lasts about 2 hours the come down isn&#39;t bad at all leaves you a little sleepy, but not exhausted

VI picked this up on a recommendation from a fellow migraneur. I did not like smoking it. The taste is bleh, it grated my anxiety, driving me into near attack levels. The smell is also bleh.\u000a\u000aThe taste and smell to me have almost a synthetic quality. I store my stuff in glass, so it&#39;s not like a plastic baggie wore off on it.\u000a\u000aFor me, it was a big fat no for smoking... I would not recommend to anyone with anxiety issues on its own.\u000a\u000aHowever, when thrown in with something to to calm that anxiety aspect (I tossed some of my favorite heavy indicas in, just enough to fine the anxiety down) to make cannabutter, it&#39;s done all right as an anti-inflammatory.\u000a\u000aBut I won&#39;t buy it again. The cannabis still has to be well hidden because of the taste.

Vit&#39;s a good strain but for someone that hasn&#39;t smoked in 3 years and rolling a spliff with less Tobacco completely killed me. my heart was beating super fast. not kidding about the dry mouth though. after re-rolling with more tobacco I was fine.

VIt&#39;s really interesting reading reviews on this strain. It affects everyone differently. My experience has been great. I was high but my head was nice and clear, not foggy. I haven&#39;t had a strain give me the giggles in a long time but this one sure did.  Very uplifting. Purchased from MedReleaf.

VThis was a great toke.  Easy on the throat and cough factor. Flavors are accurate on here. the effects of the toke is every mellow and relaxing while not too relaxing, not the motivational type at all but that&#39;s not a bad thing sometimes.

VExtremely pungent smelly small buds that in the bag don&#39;t have a strong scent but after grinded up emit a strong stinky smell that can hurt the nose. Packed into the bong it creates a strong thick smoke that fills your lungs quickly. This bud quickly skips your head high and heads straight to your legs and slowly rises back up the body. Creating total relaxation while at the same time keeping you awake and not sleepy. A perfect example of a hybrid.
