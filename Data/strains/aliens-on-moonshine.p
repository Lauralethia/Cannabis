Vthis strain smelled sweet with heavy lemon and diesel to me. I had Cascade Gnome. The smoke was fairly smooth, and the flavor was all lemon on the intake, and diesel afterward. The high was light from the THC, and the CBD was relaxing and yet creative. I could see this being a great post-stressful day I-need-a-minute-smoke.

VHave it in a cartridge, my favorite CBD strain currently, just the right ratio of thc to cbd, and you get that nice indica body buzz, perfect for any time :)

Vprobably my favorite out of all of my preferred strains. I feel like I can get a lot done and enjoy every minute of it. Definitely makes me uplifted and that feeling just gets me going for some reason. Very low negative effects such as cottonmouth. amazing strain if you have a lot going on and you still want to take the edge off.

VAs someone who doesn&#39;t want to get floored all of the time, this is a rad strain. It&#39;s relaxing and slowly helps to diminish the stress throughout the day. My mood was noticeably better as well.\u000aThe head buzz, although slight, was there. I recommend this to anyone who needs a little lift and has stuff to do.

VThis is a great CBD strain for newbies who don\u2019t mind a little psychoactive effect, however there is definitely enough there for a seasoned person to still enjoy this strain.\u000aI get mine in vape cart format from from Spokane Green Leaf, produced by SPP. \u000aI prefer vaping flower, but cartridges are nice for low key use. \u000aThe cartridge seems to be glass with a metal mouthpiece and the oil is very light and clear.\u000aIf I vape a small amount I feel reasonably clear headed and functiona, but if you\u2019re a lightweight and have somewhere to be, like work, I would vape slow and wait a minute as this can creep a bit. If it\u2019s night time and I have muscle and nerve pain, I can vape more and get marked body effects with low-key cerebral effects.\u000aNo racing heart,no paranoia and no anxiety. Dry mouth on occasion, that\u2019s about it.

VI really like this strain, for the reasons others have mentioned: nice chill feeling, not incapacitating, relaxed, happy, and the Cascade Gnome is tasty and tight-budded- though they were generous with the stems the last time I got some. I like help with depression, help with enjoying getting some things done, but not going SuperScrub. I agree with others, it isn&#39;t strong enough for the head high I want for recreation, but it&#39;s great for a &quot;school night&quot; attitude adjustment. .
