VThis strain is bomb! Super dense sticky nugs, great for rolling blunts. The smell is definitely really distinct. Super dank indica, nice and relaxing but it won&#39;t knock you out. No dry eyes at all, and only a little cottonmouth. Definite pain relieving effects, had really sore muscles when I smoked this and was able to work out later that day with no problems. Recommended for people trying to just kick back and chilllll

VJager is a very potent indica. It&#39;s one of those strains that you really can&#39;t go anywhere because of how indica heavy it is. It had me very relaxed, chilled out, and just spacey as hell. \u000a\u000aI got a little bit dizzy and nauseous at a few moments during the night, but I didn&#39;t get sick and it didn&#39;t last long, so that may be something to watch for.\u000a\u000aThis strain I feel was bred for insomnia, because you knock the fuck out the minute your head hits the pillow. \u000a\u000aThis is a wonderful Indica strain, and I will probably smoke it again. But probably not with friends because of just how Indica heavy it is.

VVisually striking purple and brown buds. The powerfully heady fragrance by itself is nearly intoxicating.  I found the taste was like freshly cut grass with some citrus and pine. After a few vapes, I pretty much got lost while sitting still. Effects lasted well over 4 hours as sobriety gently returned. Overall feeling was even-keeled, imaginative, and talkative. While playing darts, I hit the bulls eye more frequently and with tighter grouping. Rubik&#39;s cube, not so much -- kept losing track of my steps. No sense of anxiety or paranoia with this. Very nice Indica.  \u000a\u000aNote: Seems to be also listed as Jager or Yaeger in some places.

VGot a gram joint of &quot;Jaeger OG&quot; from The Herbery and I gotta say, this is an intense experience. Smothered my nose with the smell of diesel and licorice with some cheese as well. Tokes pretty smooth until about half way down of course, OG for sure with the earthy, cheesy, gassy flavor, also a little sweetness. High is a quit hitter and definitely noticeable with the slight eye laziness and euphoria. Start getting real relaxed and not wanting to even move my thumbs typing this anymore. About 15 minutes later started getting a little drowsy and hungry. Very comfortable and happy, music is real pleasant and South Park streams on YouTube are funnier than ever&#128516; Love this strain, definitely recommend for pain, stress/depression/anxiety, insomnia, lack of appetite.

Vgorgeous good sized buds. deep green with a touch of purple. tons of opaque trichomes with about 15% tinted amber. i opened the bag, and it smelled JUST like the alcohol i love to hate. the flavor was different than the smell, a bit piney and acidic, this is the dank fer sure. i pulled three or so bong loads, and got ready to run some errands. holy tap dancing christ! this was one of the most total and complete buzzes EVER! my head felt crystal clear, if a bit light, and my body got so relaxed it felt like i was floating on my back in a pool of cozy, warm water. this herb has a more of a therapeutic and narcotic high than possibly anything iv&#39;e had in the last 31 years.

VAs usual with most purple strains this one is a great sleep aid. Not great for forming cognitive thought or words into sentences, leaves you a little foggy.

VThe budtender said, with a dreamy look in his eye, as he took a sniff from the jar of bud, that the aroma of this strain resembled that of wafting dark roast coffee as it fills the room. That was spot on.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s an interesting Indica in that I feel some nice energy. My body feels like a wet noodle in a good way. I could perhaps doze for an hour but then my eyes would pop open and I would be ready for (limited amounts of) action. \u000a\u000aI feel the smile lift at my cheeks and realize I&#39;m a little giggly/a little chatty. It&#39;s great for a Netflix and Chill MST3K style and it&#39;s splendid out of a vape. I also think I could work after medicating, provided that it was a self-directed sort of work. I will be purchasing this again possibly with some frequency.

It really helped with my depression and made me feel very sensitive to sensory stimulation\u2014music was INCREDIBLE while smoking Jaeger. I remember smoking it before going to the club, and it was such a fun night. There isn\u2019t a feeling of sedation with this strain. I had two strains at the time, and I wouldn\u2019t smoke Jaeger unless I didn\u2019t have anything else, because it kind of made my mind go wild in a really amazing way. 10/10 recommend.

VJaeger is a very solid strain of the Indica family. As another reviewer has pointed out Jaeger does originally come from Southern Oregon near the Grants Pass/Williams area. I very distinctly remember in 2011 when I was living down there growing for someone, and our neighbors had some Jaeger plants and no one else had ever heard of it, and the next year it was very popular and clones were all over the market. From what I was told by our clone source Jaeger is actually Purple Hindu Kush, but for some unknown reason people began to pass it around as Jaeger. Both PHK and JR are amazing strains regardless. \u000a\u000aI found a great dispensary in my area (Salem, Or), and they sell both strains. I have been purchasing the PHK recently, but today I decided to try their Jaeger because it is half the price. I am sitting in my car right now with a nugget of both strains, and I cannot tell them apart by any means whatsoever, other than the fact that they were obviously grown by two different farms and with different methods, but the look, the smell, and every characteristic of the strains themselves are identical. \u000a\u000aAs far as the effect is concerned Jaeger is a very solid strain. It has a great buzz to it. It has an energetic vibe that some Indica strains lack, and therefore it will not put you in that haze of laziness like some Indica strains will. Long lasting effects, probably a solid hour of being really noticeably stoned from just one small bowl (around .3g), and a much longer lasting body high. It gives a great body high for sure, and being a person who deals with a severe level of pain on a daily basis I would say that this stuff is honestly quite amazing for pain relief, and it still has a good head high effect to it as well. \u000a\u000aIf you ever have the opportunity to partake in this lovely strain then take it! You will be glad you did. :)\u000a\u000aPeace\u000a\u000aHappy tokin&#39;!

Vit&#39;s so much better than waking up not remembering what happened the night before. And there&#39;s even a hint of licorice in the smoke. The purple leaves within the bud doesnt mean it has a grape flavor at all. Definitely taste trac3s of back to like Northern Lights ancestry in this strain. Blow the smoke and it doesnt linger too long either except in taste. Nice body high with a little cottonmouth &amp; munchies. Good night.

The euphoric feelings were not too strong, but instead had a great mellowing effect on my mood. You will get the munchies with this one for sure. Some mild feelings in my head, generally between my eyebrows on my forehead. The aroma was rather pleasant, smelling more like grape than licorice for me, but it wasn&#39;t overpoweringly skunky. Great strain!

Vit&#39;s so much better than waking up not remembering what happened the night before. And there&#39;s even a hint of licorice in the smoke. The purple leaves within the bud doesnt mean it has a grape flavor at all. Definitely taste trac3s of back to like Northern Lights ancestry in this strain. Blow the smoke and it doesnt linger too long either except in taste. Nice body high with a little cottonmouth &amp; munchies. Good night.

At first kinda thought I wasn&#39;t smoking anything that special...then it creeped on me and I was high as fuck.  Really enjoy the high, a bit heady which is what I ultimately seek.

It seems mostly like an indica, but has a distinct cerebral effect too. \u000a\u000aMost of what I&#39;ve seen has been small, hard, really dark buds that probably aren&#39;t what the typical head is looking for, but this is a very potent strain, if maybe for a particular individual.

Oh god no. No. Too strong (not in a good way) like a dead skunk. Hurts my throat too. \u000a\u000aHowever, I mixed it with some Blueberry Widow that I had, and WOW! Great head high that faded to a body high, pretty good couch lock, almost zero dry mouth (but wicked munchies, especially for something salty) It really helps relax me before bed.

Vwas really impressed by this strain from happy hill farms in washington.  beautiful rich color, nice density, and an awesome bittersweet grape licorice aroma.  similar high to God, God&#39;s Gift, and blue knight.  excellent indica

VGreat strain overall, nice purple sticky hairy orange buds that where rock hard with that lemony licorice smell with some pine mixed in. Maybe some blueberry diesel type taste can&#39;t really put a finger on her but it&#39;s some of the best looking bud I&#39;ve gotten in a minute, great stone though, i feel the cut i got was a hybrid though because i couldn&#39;t really sleep on it. But great physical relief would recommend it, really nice good classic stone I guess you could say you are kinda up for whatever. Kinda chilled out, great for anxiety relief an stress.\u000a

VI have medically diagnosed tourette&#39;s syndrome, general anxiety, OCD, ADHD, and seven bulging discs in my spine. This strain is the perfect cure for everything at once! \u000a\u000aIf you have any of these disorders/medical issues or know someone who does, this is practically the pill-free cure. \u000a\u000aRecreationally, it&#39;s a great indica leaving a very pleasant and euphoric body high. It seems highly potent and is perfect for a chill relaxing day!\u000a\u000aP. S. - I&#39;ve also purchased the same strain under the name &quot;Jager&quot;.

V5 STARS! one of my favorite strains hands down. the taste and smell alone will modivate you to pack that extra bowl. the high is awesome, its not too stoney but it provides significant relaxation and pain relief. great tasting/smelling/looking strain. always good even if its not done right, but if its done right your joint smoke will smell like a joint filled with wax, im serious this stuff is so terpy. see for yourself  and pick up a gram, or two, or 12.

VGreat strain with a very earthy taste in my opinion. Loved the bud, got it from my favorite shop in eastern Oregon rolled into a 1g pre roll. I\u2019ve mostly been smoking concentrates lately so the smoke was a little irritating on the lungs. Ended up splitting it into two smoke sessions.

VI sampled medicinal AAA over the course of a week. It was colorful, flavorful, and unusually sticky- really delightful smell as well. A good choice for an indica if you need a mild mood lift but also hope to get a good night&#39;s sleep (I&#39;m an insomniac). Also effectively managed mild physical aches and pains. Not a great daytime strain, but a mellow choice for a relaxing evening. Negative sides included slight dizziness and a minor headache after a large dose. I am susceptible to those sides, however, and some indica strains leave my head spinning; I was pleased that was not the case with this one.

VPTSD sufferer here! For whatever reason, this strain put my amygdala on red alert.  It may have to do with the Blue Dream parentage (Blue Dream historically makes me paranoid af).  HORRIBLE dry mouth.  The body high was really intense and nice but didn&#39;t override the very, very intense anxiety and paranoia.

VI must say, this strain is amazing. Smoked a bowl of this last night for the 1st time after the gym for a lil post gym smoke session and from the smell, taste, and effects, this strain is amazing. My girl and I both couldn&#39;t stop laughing and bullshitting. Memory slipped a lil but it was all good. And sleeping on it was deep and amazing. Haven&#39;t slept like that in a while. Definitely going to try it today to test the functionality of the high  side of the high errands. This strain is definitely on my top 5

Vupdate* This strain has exploded onto the scene recently. All over NJ, but i do belive this is a knockoff version. The batches i have been getting have a strait pine diesel smell, no sweetness to it at all. Although just about everything else seems in line with the description. Maybe they sold a lesser pheno instead of the A-one, still high quality bud.

VI did not like this strain at all. The taste was almost metallic. This will sound ridiculous but the taste reminded me of how a janitor mop bucket water with cleanser in it smells. The other thing I didn&#39;t like was it gave me intense sinus pressure &amp; a headache. I waited a day &amp; wanted to give it a good second chance, so I tried again. Same thing. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever gotten a headache from weed &amp; I&#39;ve been an on &amp; off smoker for over 40 years.

VI&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s all strains of Jagermeister or just the one I got, but mine crackled when lit, was stronger than it should have been (I only took one small hit from a pipe) and it made me feel itchy, uncomfortable, and paranoid within a few seconds of smoking it.\u000a\u000aThis is not a pleasant feeling. I know the worst of this will be over within 30-60 minutes, but I also know that it&#39;ll linger until I wake up tomorrow, and even then I may feel strange/cloudy/groggy and possibly a bit strange.

VIn Oregon we called this Purple Hindu and it was an elite cross that hit so jravyy, a true indica.  Seems like AZ has a non Kush version.  I picked up some for 20/8th and it&#39;s nice smoke but nothing like the real deal.  Straight licorice reggie. Not even gassy like seeded Durban from Africa. \u000a\u000aSo it seems like a lot of the good smoke I know has non-elite versions going around.  It took me years to figure it out but all the good weed back home is crossed to elites: Skunk or OG, or Kush or Haze, (or has been stabilized to its soil for many years.) All the cheap Impostors must have come from seed, or grown by novices who don&#39;t know strains.
