VFresh, she is tasty and fruity. Don&#39;t let her dry out though, the perfume fades. Wonderful high, but the buds for me were fast burning, so a bowl went up quickly. Seriously not dense at all so your product seems to run out faster than other strains. Great for off time when you need to unwind and disconnect. Excellent strain for depression and fatigue.

VFirst, what im calling 4 stars would probably be 5 for most ppl, given the frequency of 5 star ratings on this app. If I could give it 4.5 I would; this strain convinced me to give MariCann a second chance.\u000a\u000aBeautiful smell, taste and nice looking buds w big crystals that stick to the green.\u000a\u000aThis is a great choice getting stuff done and feeling good while doing it.

VRight off the bat this strain is one of the mot beautiful strains I have ever seen. Its got good amounts of greens, purples, and orange hairs that are all coated in a TON of crystals. The smell is strong but not excessive and the strain smells extremely sweet like berries. The effects are that you become very focused, your head gets clear, and your mood is elevated. This is most definitely a strain you can function on. It also tastes great, very sweet and smooth. Definitely one of my top strains, if you have the chance, pick some up! 9/10

Vsmoked this with a water pipe. Such wonderful flavour and aroma. Exhaling out of the nose reveals the sweet strawberry and the mouth a cream. Almost reminded me of strawberry cream biscuits.\u000aThe come on is fairly fast with a very heady high that lasts a while. Relaxing and energizing.\u000aNo paranoia, a bit of a cough when you get a big toke in.\u000aUsed it with a vape pen but didn&#39;t give the wonderful flavours.

VThis is the second time I&#39;ve picked this strain up.  The aroma upon opening was sweet strawberries, grasses and mint. Vaping in the g-pen opens up the flavors, and brings on an uplifting, energetic and social buzz.  \u000aSmoking in a pipe brings on the same effects, although the enjoyable tastes were harder to find.

VMy favorite pick me up. A nice smoke, doesn&#39;t make you choke or cough. Tastes like berries and when you smoke it the smell in the room is awesome. I like this strain a lot and use it medically for my PTSD. It works really good for handling flashbacks. I haven&#39;t had any paranoia or anxiety from it.
