VAlso know as the CBD OX. Was a nice indica cbd strain. Very similar effects from the Nordle strain. Even though Nordle is on the rise right now I&#39;d still recommend getting your hands on this. Very relaxed worry free high. &#128077;&#127996;

VI grew this and it was my favorite indicate before I grew black domina. She yields low and not a plant for a beginner. Great smoke though.

VThis strain is amazing. The taste is great. It gave me a great euphoric feeling, but did not couch lock me. After a couple bowls, I still felt clear headed and was able to enjoy the high.

VThis is the first high CBD strain I&#39;ve really messed with so take the following with a grain of salt. The concentrate has become my new morning routine and leaves me feeling great throughout the morning but without the head high. Nausea and head-ache problems literally gone before the vape left my mouth, but I can still function 110%. Nice chocolate taste with a bit of medicine-y background. A little bit of an acquired taste to be honest.
