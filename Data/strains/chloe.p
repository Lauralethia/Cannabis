VOn a day to day basis I have to deal with the symptoms of ptsd. I can be fine one day, and one trigger can put me into a ridiculous depression. Well that was today. My local dispensary just happened to have this in new today so I grabbed a 1/4. The entire time rolling I could not stop focusing on how depressed I felt. Less than half way through the joint I found complete peace. 10 minutes was the difference between feeling helpless to feeling completely hopeful again. \u000a\u000aFirst thing I noticed was the earthy sweet taste. Very uplifting, happy high. This is a strain that really does it all. I don&#39;t rate much weed more than a four.

VVery solid smoke. It is not my favorite Sativa but it is a very good strain from Medizin. The only downside is this will give you an extreme case of the munchies.

VJust a solid strain all the way around. The buds I got were so dense and heavy with resin I get happy just thinking about it. The high was euphoric and uplifting then melted right into a great body buzz. Chloe is my mistress now.

VBefore I really got my med card which was a couple weeks before it got legal, this strain for awhile I would stay away from mostly because how high it got me. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had that sort of feeling. I definitely recommend this strain, and a must try if you have never had the pleasure before.

VThis is a top shelf sativa. Super uplifting and happy feels with a lot of thinking and creativity going on. Great for smoking during the day or when trying to get something done. It\u2019s a little pricey but if you can pick it up on a day they are doing a sale then it\u2019s a must have.

VThis is a very unique strain. I pick up from swc. Medizin is doung the right  thing. Im good with strain crossing myself.. im thinking this mystery strain is somewhere in the neighborhood of platinum og x gorilla glue #4. It deffinatly has gg qualitys to it as well as an og smell. Very good med.
