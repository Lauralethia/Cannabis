VVery strong head high gave me the muchies like a motherfucker lol, i did experience some nausea which faded quickly. Although it was dominantly a head high my body did feel quite relaxed; i felt completely unmotivated to move unless it was to the kitchen, also dreams i had were quite wild and creative. i would definitely recommend it to smoke, its a beautiful strain.

VGreat Tasting and even better feeling Hybrid strain! Starts as a sativa with ocular depressurization and near instant, light waves of euphoria. fades to a nice, giggly stone, great social high or for nausea. The flavor of this bud was like raspberries and sharp Colby Jack cheese. the smell reminds one of an old Michigander Cheese Hause up in Traverse.

VLeafly, your rating system sucks! this strain has more value than 5 choices. This is by far my favorite of all time. I have to be careful because Hybrids and Sativas can give me terrible paranoia at times. This strain... wow... if I had cultivation rights, this would be one I&#39;d be turning without question as a staple. The effect the UK Cheese has on me is relaxing, pain relieving, tastes good... just never seems to last long enough, even though it lasts a few hours.

VPicked up an eighth of this strain a couple of days ago, slapped some peanut butter and the (grinded) weed on a couple of crackers, put in the oven and heat it. It took about an hour and a half for me to actually realize the effects - I was washing the dishes when it hit me; it was amazing! It just made me feel like running around but I wasn&#39;t aloud out so I laid down on my bad and rocked out to some amazing reggae. I have some pretty bad insomnia and 2 hours after I was hit by the buzz this bought along, I dozed off - this should really help my sleep schedule. I&#39;m sure if I was aloud to go outside for a walk I would&#39;ve stayed up for a lot longer but it was still awesome. This is really potent so if you have to do something that requires a lot of concentration/attention, this is NOT for you. You&#39;ll get so easily distracted, I mean I tried to watch a tv show but I just lazied up (: also, you feel really cool when you try and get out the high - stiffen your muscles and your brain. If you have the chance, you should DEFINITELY try it!

VAn almost perfect strain. I got a gram of this a couple of days ago and I love it. The particular nug I currently have is deliciously sticky and gloriously pungent. Ask any smoker what the finest UK Cheese smells like and they&#39;ll tell you the same - fresh berries and cheddar cheese. An beautiful combination.\u000aUK Cheese is a potent smoke with a skunky background peppered with that cheesy, berry goodness.  With that 50/50 balance of indica and sativa, UK Cheese is the perfect balance for that body/head high.

VSourced this dank at its UK origin. All I have to say is that it will blow your mind. The high is heavy and will leave you feeling like a piece of gum stuck to a sofa.

VU.K. Cheese is a perfect example of a hybrid cannabis plant. This indica dominant crossbreed is widely grown in the UK, hence the name. Dense lite, green nuggets. Expect these buds to be packed with crystals. Cheese has a very strong odorous musk-like, musty, cheddar cheese smell. Some might say cheese doesn&#39;t smell like cheese at all. I noticed the similar cheese type aroma after eating some Ben&amp;Jerry&#39;s cheesecake brownie ice cream. The taste and smoke are strong but not to pungent, with spicy skunk-like undertones. The Cheese high creates a feeling of great euphoria which comes on nice and smooth. The high opens the mind while relaxing the body and will last a long time. Very strong clear, yet stoney high.\u000aMild body stone. Pain free. No cloudy thinking. Clear, calm, and happy!  Great for relaxing, going outdoors, or getting some work done around the house. I recommend this strain for a wake n bake for sure. I gave this strain a overall 10 rating , because everytime i pick up a batch i&#39;m never disappointed. Don&#39;t let the name fool you. Try out some UK Cheese!\u000a

VUK Cheese is a great example of a hybrid strain that works for me in a functional, yet very stoney way.  Blue Cheese was one of the first I tried in the recreational market.  It was a smoother experience as far as the Cheese tasting element with a similar high.  Still holding the offspring of UK in high regard especially where taste is concerned the original takes the cake in regards to the buzz.\u000a\u000aThis strain tastes much more of a sweet fruit blended with a sharper more tangy cheese flavor.  This sharpness carried over into the buzz which was a more alert &amp; daytime friendly.  Do not mistake that statement for saying this flower is a lightweight because it is not at all.  In moderation an effective pain reliever, mood enhancer with strong euphoria, and in low doses perfect for a novice user.\u000a\u000aIn higher doses it gives one of my favorite effects which I compare with many good clean sativa buzz&#39;s.  An immediate take off into an animated gregarious high that inspires to get stuff done.  After reaching a peak about 45 minutes in the flight starts to descend landing in sedation mode.  Within an hour the plane is in the bunker getting refueled &amp; all passengers are on the way to a good healing rest.\u000a\u000aThe buds were dense and sticky.  Not my favorite as for type of terpenes that came through in taste &amp; smell, yet unique.  Enjoy all the Cheese strains that have graced my palate so feel honored to try the original mother of them all.  Did not disappoint at all so hopefully we cross paths again soon because if affordable I would partake again and again.......

VI am honestly glad I came across this one because I was beginning to think that all weed is just great and we need to stop judging it because it&#39;s all placebo...\u000a\u000aI do not recommend U.K. Cheese for the experienced user. There is literally nothing to remark about this strain. It makes you feel high in a very nondescript way. It does nothing for physical pain. It puts you in a cheerful mood, but like... it is surface level. It is like life turns into an episode of full house for an hour or so.\u000a\u000aIf you want an effect for any medical final purpose, move on. If you want to giggle with friends and stroke egos and puppies for a hot minute because you feel funny, spend your money.

VNever thought I&#39;d ever be able to use the expression &quot;I fell asleep before my head hit the pillow&quot; until now. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m not a particularly heavy smoker, usually get through an 8th in 2-3 days but this lasted me 6 full days of smoking. The stone length is beyond belief and felt myself cutting down on the number of joints a day dramatically from 6-7 down to 3. It is a very heavy stone which brings a feeling of content to your current being, have had a lot of life pressures recently and this gives you a slight break from the stress of everyday life. Not a sufferer of any physical pain myself at the moment, so unable to comment on that, but I can say my muscles felt much more relaxed therefore making the sickening battle of falling asleep a whole lot easier. Not a fan of the taste but that is nothing but a personal opinion as I usually go for fruity or sour strains. Would recommend this strain  as a night time strain to everyone from novice smoker to pot heads as I think everyone needs a bit of a break from the noise from time to time.

VNever thought I&#39;d ever be able to use the expression &quot;I fell asleep before my head hit the pillow&quot; until now. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m not a particularly heavy smoker, usually get through an 8th in 2-3 days but this lasted me 6 full days of smoking. The stone length is beyond belief and felt myself cutting down on the number of joints a day dramatically from 6-7 down to 3. It is a very heavy stone which brings a feeling of content to your current being, have had a lot of life pressures recently and this gives you a slight break from the stress of everyday life. Not a sufferer of any physical pain myself at the moment, so unable to comment on that, but I can say my muscles felt much more relaxed therefore making the sickening battle of falling asleep a whole lot easier. Not a fan of the taste but that is nothing but a personal opinion as I usually go for fruity or sour strains. Would recommend this strain  as a night time strain to everyone from novice smoker to pot heads as I think everyone needs a bit of a break from the noise from time to time.

VUK Cheese is a great example of a hybrid strain that works for me in a functional, yet very stoney way.  Blue Cheese was one of the first I tried in the recreational market.  It was a smoother experience as far as the Cheese tasting element with a similar high.  Still holding the offspring of UK in high regard especially where taste is concerned the original takes the cake in regards to the buzz.\u000a\u000aThis strain tastes much more of a sweet fruit blended with a sharper more tangy cheese flavor.  This sharpness carried over into the buzz which was a more alert &amp; daytime friendly.  Do not mistake that statement for saying this flower is a lightweight because it is not at all.  In moderation an effective pain reliever, mood enhancer with strong euphoria, and in low doses perfect for a novice user.\u000a\u000aIn higher doses it gives one of my favorite effects which I compare with many good clean sativa buzz&#39;s.  An immediate take off into an animated gregarious high that inspires to get stuff done.  After reaching a peak about 45 minutes in the flight starts to descend landing in sedation mode.  Within an hour the plane is in the bunker getting refueled &amp; all passengers are on the way to a good healing rest.\u000a\u000aThe buds were dense and sticky.  Not my favorite as for type of terpenes that came through in taste &amp; smell, yet unique.  Enjoy all the Cheese strains that have graced my palate so feel honored to try the original mother of them all.  Did not disappoint at all so hopefully we cross paths again soon because if affordable I would partake again and again.......

VThis is the United kingdoms ultimate strain, orginal cheese, from the phenotype of skunk#1, exodus cheese is its name here, but in fact it&#39;s gone the strain  isn&#39;t avaliable much anymore some cheese &#39;s still have an hint of the orginal flavour but as far as I know this was a clone only strain, so over the years it&#39;s been mixed so much with different strains that the orginal has now been left a hybrid somewere with blue cheese, big Buddha cheese unfortunately many people now days haven&#39;t tried exodus cheese because it&#39;s my favourite of all time the flavour is spicy with a earthy pungent aroma that leaves a sour cheese taste on your taste buds, exodus to me was dark scruffy looking bud it&#39;s all commercial bud now big hard buds that tbh don&#39;t really cut it for me bring back exodus :) peace and pot

VThis goes down as a &quot; more you explore, the more you learn&quot; experience. I did not intend to pick this up but I decided to try at $10 a gram strain with a Euro birthplace. According to the lab it checks in a 19%Thc. A single shot through the water and things seemed right, with lots of flavor. Later in the evening I was tired and could not draft a check and felt &quot;uneasy&quot;. Only to further my point on a personal level saliva no for me, thank you. For the money it&#39;s fantastic, would I get again nope.

There is literally nothing to remark about this strain. It makes you feel high in a very nondescript way. It does nothing for physical pain. It puts you in a cheerful mood, but like... it is surface level. It is like life turns into an episode of full house for an hour or so.\u000a\u000aIf you want an effect for any medical final purpose, move on. If you want to giggle with friends and stroke egos and puppies for a hot minute because you feel funny, spend your money.

Now let&#39;s talk about Smoking it smooth tasty relaxing and good for either Smoking alone or with friends &#128526;&#128513;&#128077;&#128077;. I wouldn&#39;t say this is a  full on pain reliever or sleep inducer , i give it 6 outta 10 . The magic lies in the after effect of Smoking, this mother F****er opened up my Appetite like none other. MUNCHIES , if u suffer from loss of Appetite like me, Do urself a favor, try it. \u000ai saved bout a gram of this to see if it developed any more color or aroma, Well now i know y its called CHEESE, HOLY SHIT ,it really smells like Cheese &#128562;

VThis training is very different from a lot of the others it tastes more pungent then some other strains. Sometimes this strain I would say if you have a very high tolerance to use vaporizer. If you smoke or vaporize with dabs, this strain will make you either focused or since I have the reverse the facts very spacey and philosopher like. For its medicinal effects I&#39;m really highly suggesting this for depression PTSD if you have a little bit of pain from anorexia if you have anorexia this is great for you and it only gives you a slight dry mouth. It has a very pungent flavor and it&#39;s very distinct from all the rest I highly recommend you to try this!

VThey were not kidding when they named that strain \u201ccheese\u201d. It really does smell and taste like cheese.\u000a\u000aOverall a good strain, but I don\u2019t find it exceptional. Not as potent as other strains I tried, and the high really creeps on you. \u000a\u000aIt does make me sleepy, which I like. The sativa helps reduce the anxiety-inducing effect I get from the indica. For me, it\u2019s a good bedtime strain. \u000a\u000aIt does cause some eye strain, and muscle twitching, but I found it often the case with indica or hybrid strains. \u000a\u000aNo munchies, but a strong case of cottonmouth.

I have chronic back pain from an injury and this strain really gets the job done when it comes to treating it. The high is really nice.

VThis strain is very good for relieving stress, soothing your mind, and just making you feel sooo damn happy. Unlike the stereotypical laughing highs (I&#39;m not saying that there isn&#39;t an increase of laughter) the happiness experienced with this strain is felt more internally as if you were at peace with everything. During my experience with the strain I smoked it on a rooftop looking at the city (New York City) and it was an incredible experience. I will note that I felt quite hungry after around half an hour passed even though I ate a hefty dinner before hand. I was still able to function properly around friends and have normal conversations with them without seeming too out of sorts. Finally once the indica effects kicked in I came home and did my daily routine, brushing teeth etc.,,, and I later down in bed and swept away to an incredibly restful sleep with vivid dreams. Very highly recommended strain for those seeking to be stoned in an active nightlife or out with friends.

Vthis is a pungent earthy smoke collaborated with a long lasting head high- this smoke is a heavy headbuzz which creates a relaxing atmosphere, but it will tire you out quick - it&#39;s a rich creamy smoke with pungent cheesy earthy tones followed by a earthy aftertaste- the taste is mediocre, but the head buzz and sleep are quite amazing - it&#39;s a good strain to get to sleep or relax - a little.head heavy , 4 stars on this one- not a bad smoke at all - just be ready to really fall asleep

Vthis stain WAS one of the best bud I have smoked, half the order was 1 bud.. with very little stock. This is a good strain for people with arthritis. It comes on fast then you feel your whole body relax. The high seemed to last longer so I smoked less and the pot lasts longer, for medical reasons the THC level should be very high. I cant quite understand where the get up and go comes from and the hurting areas seem to stay relaxed. Its so easy to smoke and powders up in your fingers like hash..

VI absolutely LOVE the calming relaxation the cheese hits me with. it is perfect for just laying on your back and listening to your favorite mellow music! however, it is a 30-45 minute experience, there&#39;s equal effect with longer lasting highs in other strains.

VUK Cheese was ok. I thought it would have relieved my mental pain, but I realized it was more for physical pain. It just wasn&#39;t the type of medicine for me. If I was ballin&#39; and I twisted my ankle then I&#39;m sure I would give it a better rating. But I do not involve myself in any physical activities. I&#39;m very lazy like many around me who smoke. But overall, no spasms or seizures. If you have physical problems I know someone who has ankle problems and biked for miles after a sudden injury. He left physically hurt and came back from his trip just fine. So it&#39;s all on your condition.

Pleasant, a little heady,  and euphoric.  Was drawn completely in to the sound and images of RELAX TV. Next afternoon, finished the bowl- 4+T , as there wasn&#39;t much left in the bowl.  It&#39;s building up  moderately quickly.  Once again, in my head but body tingles and pain is taken care of.

VI normally wouldn&#39;t have been super attracted to this strain, but was given a leftover gram by a visiting friend. I first loved the taste - something I typically don&#39;t notice unless it&#39;s something that especially stands out. Very noticeable happy, euphoric high that mellowed out at the tail end. It does lose points for the cotton mouth and dry eyes, which were bad enough that I was forced to take out my contacts. I&#39;d recommend this regardless!

VA nice smelling bud, really fragrant when its fresh! This definitely isn&#39;t like the bud I normally get. First time I smoked this strain I was outdoors at night. It made everything very interesting and I had quite a spiritual experience! I was euphoric for quite a while and it made me feel quite stimulated in small doses, but after smoking more the sedative effects started to take over. An amazing combination of a body high and a head high. I will definitely be getting my hands on the strain again thats for sure.

VJust started smoking, and let me tell you...this shit had me diving in a pool of thoughts. \u000aDefinitely a strong body high. Had me like a wobbly drunk. I&#39;m 6&#39;0 ft 250, this shit made me feel like I was half of those stats. When I lied on the couch my brain felt like it was smearing away and my body was being controlled by a magnet. I could feel all the blood rushing through me. \u000aDefinitely made me talkative (only becuz I had a really good idea).\u000aDownside? The high didn&#39;t last that long tbh. But for my 1st time high, not disappointed.

VA solid 3.5,I&#39;m wrighting this right now because I just smoked some U.K. Cheese, a little goes a long way but every time I smoke I think I forget that I got high because when I&#39;m sober I think it&#39;s a terrible strain but right now it&#39;s in my top 5, I&#39;m so confused &#128514;&#128514; but everything is relaxing, I was laying on my cold metal grinder and didn&#39;t even realize because it was so comfortable, it&#39;s a very nice body high with a mellow head high, personally I hate the taste of it but I left some lemon skin in a bag over night with an 1/8th and it tasted a lot better, the nugs (or at least what I got) are really small and dense almost like popcorn chicken but I&#39;d recommend using a scale because the bugs are extremely dense and you might take more than you think, once you grind them though they puff up, overall you might want to look for a different strain but if you need to just relax and relive pain but still want to be able to function, get this strain.

Vthis stain WAS one of the best bud I have smoked, half the order was 1 bud.. with very little stock. This is a good strain for people with arthritis. It comes on fast then you feel your whole body relax. The high seemed to last longer so I smoked less and the pot lasts longer, for medical reasons the THC level should be very high. I cant quite understand where the get up and go comes from and the hurting areas seem to stay relaxed. Its so easy to smoke and powders up in your fingers like hash.. BMW has got to be the best companies in the world.

I wouldn&#39;t say this is a  full on pain reliever or sleep inducer , i give it 6 outta 10 . The magic lies in the after effect of Smoking, this mother F****er opened up my Appetite like none other. MUNCHIES , if u suffer from loss of Appetite like me, Do urself a favor, try it. \u000ai saved bout a gram of this to see if it developed any more color or aroma, Well now i know y its called CHEESE, HOLY SHIT ,it really smells like Cheese &#128562;

Not as potent as other strains I tried, and the high really creeps on you. \u000a\u000aIt does make me sleepy, which I like. The sativa helps reduce the anxiety-inducing effect I get from the indica. For me, it\u2019s a good bedtime strain. \u000a\u000aIt does cause some eye strain, and muscle twitching, but I found it often the case with indica or hybrid strains. \u000a\u000aNo munchies, but a strong case of cottonmouth.

VI was very impressed with this strain. We just stocked it at my dispensary and want to grab some more tonight!  Just finished smoking and it has a pretty rapid onset for me.

Vthis is a pungent earthy smoke collaborated with a long lasting head high- this smoke is a heavy headbuzz which creates a relaxing atmosphere, but it will tire you out quick - it&#39;s a rich creamy smoke with pungent cheesy earthy tones followed by a earthy aftertaste- the taste is mediocre, but the head buzz and sleep are quite amazing - it&#39;s a good strain to get to sleep or relax - a little.head heavy , 4 stars on this one- not a bad smoke at all - just be ready to really fall asleep

VThis strain is very good for relieving stress, soothing your mind, and just making you feel sooo damn happy. Unlike the stereotypical laughing highs (I&#39;m not saying that there isn&#39;t an increase of laughter) the happiness experienced with this strain is felt more internally as if you were at peace with everything. During my experience with the strain I smoked it on a rooftop looking at the city (New York City) and it was an incredible experience. I will note that I felt quite hungry after around half an hour passed even though I ate a hefty dinner before hand. I was still able to function properly around friends and have normal conversations with them without seeming too out of sorts. Finally once the indica effects kicked in I came home and did my daily routine, brushing teeth etc.,,, and I later down in bed and swept away to an incredibly restful sleep with vivid dreams. Very highly recommended strain for those seeking to be stoned in an active nightlife or out with friends.

VThis training is very different from a lot of the others it tastes more pungent then some other strains. Sometimes this strain I would say if you have a very high tolerance to use vaporizer. If you smoke or vaporize with dabs, this strain will make you either focused or since I have the reverse the facts very spacey and philosopher like. For its medicinal effects I&#39;m really highly suggesting this for depression PTSD if you have a little bit of pain from anorexia if you have anorexia this is great for you and it only gives you a slight dry mouth. It has a very pungent flavor and it&#39;s very distinct from all the rest I highly recommend you to try this!

VOverall skunky flavour and aroma.  Doesn&#39;t seem too cheesy to me, in comparison to Head Cheese for example.  That being said, the flavour and aroma are very pleasant.  The effects are balanced, which is to be expected with a good hybrid.  Good pain relief from the indica side, but it&#39;s nicely balanced by the energizing effects of its sativa side.  I&#39;d say where I got these kind buds from, but here in Toronto we need to keep it on the downlow, just like back in the day, eh?  Good luck finding your medicine, brothers and sisters!

Vso I finished a crop of this only to be left dissatisfied. everything about this cheese is different to what I said last time. not as pungent. lacked a wow factor when opening the jar. the high is as cheese should be. head followed by body. relaxed. she had a nutty undertone when grinded which I&#39;ve never smelled before. \u000anot what a UK cheese should be considering we invented it. I&#39;ve smoked cheese and most impostors of cheese and nothing comes close to how it used to be. was but not a cheese fan anymore

No couch lock - you aren&#39;t going to gel out. Study, exercise, house work, I get a lot done on the cheese. Cooking (ghee) isn&#39;t giggly coming on and doesn&#39;t motivate as much, but the peak lasts 3-1/2 hours or more. Smoked or eaten, UK Cheese cheers me up long after I use it; just a great physical sense of well being, calm &amp; relaxed. Just remembering how I felt brings back the good vibe.

VWhat is not to love about this bomb strain of Mary Jane?!?? She looked good from the get, and when I saw her shiny gleam of thc in the light I just knew she was the one!! Let me tell you not only about her dense beautifully vibrant green buds covered by plush orange hairs, but her potent stank that matches her mouth watering taste! I can&#39;t emphasize the amazing taste enough! UK Cheese&#39;s Leafly Bio Description of it&#39;s high&#39;s effects are pretty spot on, and of course will vary per individual. If you don&#39;t smoke often, just know that you don&#39;t need more than 1 or 2 good puffs to feel the benefits that this strain has to offer. I myself smoke frequently throughout the day every day, and 1 or 2 puffs of UK Cheese gets me feeling the effects almost immediately. Mary Jane at her finest for sure!

VEvery strain that has cheese in it&#39;s name is my instant favorite. You could say I&#39;m a cheese head. I loved the smell and taste. At the first puff you feel it behind the eyes. This strain goes beyond relaxation. It can lessen and prevent anxiety (but keep the dose small or moderate). It doesn&#39;t mess up with your head : your attention or memory. It&#39;s ok to be used in a social setting but you&#39;ll be listening more than talking. At the end of the high, you&#39;ll feel deeply relaxed.

I just heat up a little speck and put it on my tongue. Sure enough, in five minutes I was feeling it strong. Euphoria, excitement, giggles. I was hoping it would make me a sleepy but it didn&#39;t. \u000a\u000aI like Aphgooey if I want to chill out or sleep and I like Cheese if I want to erase emotional pain or increase my creativity and self confidence.

VGot hold of a small bag of standard cheese. Had the usual potent sweet cheesy aroma.  I&#39;d say the particular bud that I got had been well grown, as it was quite dry, especially for a homegrown strain.  I had been stressed just before I hit this strain, but a few toots of this instantly chilled me out. In recent times I&#39;ve tried to avoid home grown &#39;low grade strains&#39; in favour of more chronic strains.  But the nostalgia created took me back to times long ago when this was the usual choice when it was difficult to obtain anything but cheese. A very earthy and cheesy taste, I&#39;m glad I got hold of some of this once again. A very happy high indeed from what I consider a well balanced hybrid and always a pleasure to smoke.
