VI gotta begin by stating that this strain is more indica than sativa,IMHO. \u000aThe aroma of sweet berries mixed with coffee and dankness= A good nights sleep,at least for me. Tbis packs a punch on the 1st pull. waves of warm relaxation and in my case a noticeable change in mindframe (racing thoughts and constant wheels churning subsided). also great for muscle aches and joints. This has given me great restful nights of sleep that I&#39;ve been longing for. \u000aThis is for high tolerance smokers but novices just start off slow. Enjoy

Vdefinitely the sweetest smelling strain I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of indulging in. very sweet taste and pungent aroma. the high is incredible and knocks you straight on your ass. a more uplifting high. very enjoyable. not for the beginner smoker as after 3 or 4 puffs put me on my ass

VWe just burned one. Beautiful looking bud. The aroma is fruity and rich. The taste was smooth. It left a really wild berry taste in the back of my mouth. The buzz is awesome. Nice feel but able to function. No lethargic feelings but the munchies just hit hard. \u000a\u000aHighly recommend. Top 5 strain.

VIt&#39;s a virtual pile of blueberries. Like blueberries from concentrate. A little like Blue Dream, but quite different.. there&#39;s definitely some haze there... The high is pretty sativa, nothing too crazy - kind of like a less &quot;up&quot; XJ-13. For taste alone this one gets four stars, but there&#39;s good energy in this strain. Worth a pickup, for sure.

Vscary.....high. too much. the sativa effects and paranoid thought basis outweigh enjoyment.\u000anot for novice smoker. very high psychoactive feel that outweigh the body buzz
