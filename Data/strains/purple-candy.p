VTo me, this is what Indicas are all about.  Total relaxation with a soothing head to toe tingle, and the complete distortion of time as it passes.  Definitely gives couch lock, but also didn&#39;t knock me out (which is great for me, I like to enjoy my high and not just sleep through it).  It doesn&#39;t hurt that this bud smells and looks amazing, and vapes beautifully.  Candy indeed!

VI switched to Purple Candy because from White Rhino which I did not enjoy. Purple has a higher CBD ratio which I wanted. I have nasty insomnia and I&#39;ve been trying a few types to help me sleep.\u000aBecause I&#39;ve just started smoking weed again, I&#39;ve been taking pretty small doses. In my water bong, I smoked about the size of a pea. Nothing crazy, just wanted to test it out. The first thing I noticed was the candy like smell, definitely a grape aroma and flavour. In a normal joint, I can never taste the differences between pot, but the cooling effect of the bong allows flavours to come through. I&#39;m sure thats not news to many of you but it&#39;s a fun discovery for me.\u000aAnyway, I instantly knew I found my permanent replacement for White Rhino, which I found almost frustrating. The buzz was very relaxing, fuzzy and very warm. Just after it kicked in, I got a call from work and had to go over some technical details. Normally I would have run screaming away from the phone while high, but I didn&#39;t have any paranoia, just good vibes, and I was able to solve their problem, too!\u000aThe small pea sized hit lasted about 1.5 hours and when I came down, I felt perfectly normal, no grogginess, or heaviness. Just really couldn&#39;t wait until I could smoke some again later that night. I took a few hits throughout the evening, again just small tokes and by the time I went to bed I was very relaxed, in a good mental state and I slept really well. \u000aI&#39;d call Operation Purple Candy a success!

VBuds were very dark green with purple highlights. Sweet smelling, blackberries, also had an earthy smell to start. Nice sweet flavor when smoked, really enjoyable. Very strong indica effects, didn&#39;t really experience any sativa effects. Deeply relaxing, perfect for night use if you struggle to sleep, or a Sunday afternoon on the sofa. Epic munchies. Not sure I would pick it up again. I did enjoy it but I just prefer other indicas with a similar profile such as blueberry. Also, gave me a slight headache.

VNice dark green bud with hints of purple and that candy crystal coating. The taste is like the most unhealthy, sugar filled grape juice you&#39;ve ever had. Doesn&#39;t come on strong but will last and leave you passed out if you get to comfortable. Expect pure mind drifting bliss as the couch lock sets in and your eye lids get heavy. Highly recommended for those with insomnia.

VThe frosty purple weed appeared as if it were out of your local rappers biggest hit about purp. The delicate grape tinged weed odor eluded to the heavy purebred indica affects that came with smoking. True to the name, purple candy tasted as if it were some sort of lightly flavored grape jolly rancher. Intense couch lock, sedation, and very red eyes were some of the very indica effects that this weed has. This weed is good for CHILLIN. Great for a night you just want to stay in eat doritos, play video games, and watch Netflix.

VAmazing how it calms my insides. Its giving me a appetite. Buds are nice dense sticky. I find it very powerful.  Since starting cannabis for medical I do not need pain pills nor a nerve pill. Im getting my appetite back. Need to learn more about hybrids. Sativa adds to my hyperness. So maybe a mix will be ok. Just learning. Blessings

VSweet like candy and extremely potent, purple candy is perfect for night-time medicating. This strain delivers full body relaxation and will often induce sleep when used in higher doses. A truly incredible tasting strain that coats the mouth with a sweet candy like flavour, finishing with both grape and berry undertones. The smell is also very sweet, but an earthy grape scent is strongly evident upon closer examination. Highly recommend this strain to anyone searching for a solid night-time medication.

VI switched to Purple Candy because from White Rhino which I did not enjoy. Purple has a higher CBD ratio which I wanted. I have nasty insomnia and I&#39;ve been trying a few types to help me sleep.\u000aBecause I&#39;ve just started smoking weed again, I&#39;ve been taking pretty small doses. In my water bong, I smoked about the size of a pea. Nothing crazy, just wanted to test it out. The first thing I noticed was the candy like smell, definitely a grape aroma and flavour. In a normal joint, I can never taste the differences between pot, but the cooling effect of the bong allows flavours to come through. I&#39;m sure thats not news to many of you but it&#39;s a fun discovery for me.\u000aAnyway, I instantly knew I found my permanent replacement for White Rhino, which I found almost frustrating. The buzz was very relaxing, fuzzy and very warm. Just after it kicked in, I got a call from work and had to go over some technical details. Normally I would have run screaming away from the phone while high, but I didn&#39;t have any paranoia, just good vibes, and I was able to solve their problem, too!\u000aThe small pea sized hit lasted about 1.5 hours and when I came down, I felt perfectly normal, no grogginess, or heaviness. Just really couldn&#39;t wait until I could smoke some again later that night. I took a few hits throughout the evening, again just small tokes and by the time I went to bed I was very relaxed, in a good mental state and I slept really well. \u000aI&#39;d call Operation Purple Candy a success!

VI discovered Purple Candy quite randomly, as a joint of it was gifted to me as a first purchase bonus from the Toronto Healing Center dispensary. I am SO HAPPY that I decided to put a bit into my one-hitter to see how it smoked!\u000a\u000aThis has become my go-to strain for bedtime to help combat my anxiety-related insomnia. Two hits of this, and I am being pulled into a deep body chill, and my eyelids being pulled down no matter how I might fight it, with my brain slowed waaaaaaay down. It&#39;s nearly impossible for me not to be asleep within 30 minutes of smoking Purple Candy.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve had other strains that have helped relax me, so that falling asleep was easier - or even if I didn&#39;t fall asleep right away, I didn&#39;t stress about it. But Purple Candy puts me out like a light!\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t want to use this recreationally, as I&#39;d just end up snoozing. But this has been an amazing medicinal strain for me. I went back to the dispensary and bought a bunch more so that I wouldn&#39;t run out anytime soon.\u000a\u000aWatch out for the hang-over effect the next morning, though! I loaded my pipe bedside so that if I woke up in the middle of the night, I could take a quick toke and get back to sleep...and the next morning I felt so sluggish and it was really hard to shake that deep body stone off. So I&#39;ll just stick to smoking a larger amount before bed, so that it has the whole night to wear off. When smoking just before a full night&#39;s sleep, I haven&#39;t had any sluggish issues upon waking.

VPicked up one of my these vape pens not expecting too much from it, boy was I wrong. Such a smooth taste and great buzz to go along with it. These pens are so discrete you could smoke it anywhere with out no one being the wiser. My next order I am going to order one of each and always keep one handy.

VI LOVE this strain.Nuggs were a nice medium density with green and purple coloring and sugary trichomes all over the place. I\u2019m a fan of Kush\u2019s so this definitely hit the spot.\u000a I picked up a gram of this at Nectar in SE Portland and I absolutely love it. It gives a nice, chill paranoia-free high. It\u2019s and Indica so it\u2019s more relaxing but without the couch lock and fuzzy headed ness of other strains. I watched movies, visited with friends and sketched on this strain. For sleep I like mixing this with Romulan. I highly recommend this. All the benefits of an Indica with none of the CL\u2019d drawbacks. Didn\u2019t have that intense munchie crave like some strains do, but it\u2019s cannabis so you\u2019re still going to happily accept snacks&#128521;

VSmell: Sweet \u000aTaste: sweet\u000aSmoke: Very Smooth \u000a\u000aReview \u000aThis is and always has been one of my favourite indicas. I&#39;ve been dealing with a herniated disc for months now and this is an incredible strain for pain relief. From the sweet taste and aromatics, to the how well it smokes this is a strain is amazing. The high is very body heavy and calming, so ideally i use it when i need to stretches as well as its a great bedtime bowl. smoking it i found it was very smooth and didn&#39;t give me that lung wrench or need to cough so for people with herniated discs this is huge because coughing can often trigger sciatic pains. Only thing about this strain i could call a downside is it does make your eyes heavy at the start but often fades pretty quickly. definitely recommend for anyone who likes to stretch while high or those looking to get high but don&#39;t want a bad cough.

But outside this stuff is wonderfully beautiful. as for taste it&#39;s sweet as well as smooth . now the effects well. this stuff is really relaxing and definitely don&#39;t want to go drive anywhere.so make sure you have your beverage something to munch on before you make it home ,cause you won&#39;t be feeling like going anywhere or doing anything that requires energy. so melt in your couch and watch a really good movie o r whatever you like to do to veg.

VI switched to Purple Candy because from White Rhino which I did not enjoy. Purple has a higher CBD ratio which I wanted. I have nasty insomnia and I&#39;ve been trying a few types to help me sleep.\u000aBecause I&#39;ve just started smoking weed again, I&#39;ve been taking pretty small doses. In my water bong, I smoked about the size of a pea. Nothing crazy, just wanted to test it out. The first thing I noticed was the candy like smell, definitely a grape aroma and flavour. In a normal joint, I can never taste the differences between pot, but the cooling effect of the bong allows flavours to come through. I&#39;m sure thats not news to many of you but it&#39;s a fun discovery for me.\u000aAnyway, I instantly knew I found my permanent replacement for White Rhino, which I found almost frustrating. The buzz was very relaxing, fuzzy and very warm. Just after it kicked in, I got a call from work and had to go over some technical details. Normally I would have run screaming away from the phone while high, but I didn&#39;t have any paranoia, just good vibes, and I was able to solve their problem, too!\u000aThe small pea sized hit lasted about 1.5 hours and when I came down, I felt perfectly normal, no grogginess, or heaviness. Just really couldn&#39;t wait until I could smoke some again later that night. I took a few hits throughout the evening, again just small tokes and by the time I went to bed I was very relaxed, in a good mental state and I slept really well. \u000aI&#39;d call Operation Purple Candy a success!

VThis was great! The strong couch lock effects was externally pleasant, I haven&#39;t felt this relaxed in a long time. The fruity smell and taste were also a great feature. Highly recommend for evening sedation.

VThe buds are nicely shaped with orange hairs and smell delicious when chopped up! They are not quite sticky like it says in the description! Half a king size jay shared with one other high as chronic! Very strong yet light Indica with a sweeter type taste to it, which we both cannot pinpoint to exactly what! We cannot stop saying &quot;we like that stuff...it&#39;s a nice green...nice taste!&quot;

VSome of the best Canadian weed you will find, I guarantee. One of my new favorites. Very classic indica buzz, a little tingly in fact. Awesome medicine for those looking to a strain that will aid with sleep or pain relief. And generally a great strain to smoke after a long and stressful day. \u000a\u000aAAAA, 5 bong rips out of 5.

VInstantly became one of my girlfriend and I&#39;s favorites. Wonderful when smoked or vaped. Really sweet taste, delightful high -- especially when you want to engulf yourself in a movie/video game/cartoon. Whether you relax or go out for a walk with this stuff, it&#39;ll feel great.

VPurple candy is another ok day time Indica, although there is some burn out. This strain works wonders for my appetite and nausea. But I&#39;ve been mixing this with super kush and wow do they ever complement each other well. Extreme uphoria, love it!

VOne of my favorite. Smell and taste sweety, like sugar and also a bit earthy. Some says it smells like grapes, but it really reminds me something like candies. Great buzz, really physical, get your couch ready with some food close to you. Too much hit the bong may leave you hit your bed pretty soon.

VPurple Candy is super delicious.  It has a berry and grape flavour that is exremely evident on exhale.  This strain was able to assist me with relaxation and provided a full body buzz that cleared my mind and assisted with my focus.  I did not experience the sativa side effects that some have noted, but I did enjoy the taste, smell and effects of this strain.   Also, this strain really assisted with my headache and body pain.  This strain does not assist me with insomnia, i need something a little stronger for night time, but I use this strain in the evenings when I am just relaxing and watching tv.   I would reccomend trying this, especially if you enjoy sweet tasting bud like I do.
