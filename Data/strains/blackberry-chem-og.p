VTried this strain several times. It made both me and my girlfriend extremely anxious and jittery. Not pleasant at all.

VSmoking the Green Line/ Fire Line Blackberry Chem OG. Agreed with iBob... virtually no odor, which I&#39;m fine with... The high is nice, very mind numbing. I took two hits about a half hour before leaving the house, and I forgot where I was going several times on the way. This is the kind of strain that will have you staring at a blank piece of paper for 20 minutes, you know? That&#39;s not a criticism. It&#39;s indica leaning, relaxing and numbing, but not sleepy. \u000a\u000aThis isn&#39;t my favorite strain but it&#39;s totally decent, and I&#39;d recommend giving it a try if you&#39;re interested.
