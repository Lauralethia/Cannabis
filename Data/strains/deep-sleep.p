VExcellent sleep aid. Allowed me to chill, relax on my way to getting a few zzz&#39;s. Normally don&#39;t sleep more than 2 hrs before waking up, this stretched my sleep time to 5 hrs before asking up. Nice earthy smell, taste.

VI love this strain and am thankful as hell I found it. I\u2019ve never run across it in any other place I\u2019ve been, and I\u2019ve been to most. I have industrial grade insomnia and PTSD/Anxiety and took a handful of sleeping pills for over a decade. Deep Sleep did just that. My whole body sank into a heavy, relaxed mode, I laid my head on my pillow and drifted off...drifted off! A decade of insomnia, Ambien and PM\u2019s killing me slowly, along with the anxiety and panic...and I drifted off. Deep sleep is amazing and is changing my life, peeps.

VAnother great OG hybrid. This one is usually Bubba dominant in smell and coloration but structure wise it has the pointed spear like calyxes from Larry. Chocolate, coffee and hashlike sweetness, not too much fuel going on but there are traces. Smooth smoke and a nice numbing sensation followed by relaxation and well, eventually sleep.

VDeep Sleep is a piney smelling indica with a hint of funk. Tastes as delicious as anything related to Bubba should! For you conventional stoners, it won&#39;t put you to sleep. It&#39;s quite relaxing but doesn&#39;t leave you drooling. This means for me that I stay functional. Personally, this strain is more of an anxiety relief and &#39;quick chill&#39; option. I recommend it for beginners looking for something easy on the mind and groovy on the body.

VAmazing cross of 2 of my top 5 strains, Larry OG and Pre-98 Bubba kush, acquired from AZ Natural Selections of North Scottsdale for 40$ a gram due to their 120$ 3G of wax special that they have fairly often. This is some top shelf medicine that I would have easily paid 50 or 60$ for a gram of this. The mix of  the heavy OG  that the Larry outputs and the Earthy Pungent phenotype acquired from the pre-98 make this strain extremely effective while being an absolute dessert for anyone who loves OG&#39;s or earthy indica strains. The shatter is a little sappy but i can constitute that to it being a heavy og indica dominant strain. Great for pain relief and relaxation, maybe not a good idea before you have to do something important.

VI wouldn&#39;t call this strain Deep Sleep. It&#39;s Strong, euphoric and delivers a strong body high. It didn&#39;t put me to sleep, but sure did makes me relaxed. If you do use this for sleep, make sure you&#39;re in bed and ready to crash before smoking it. That&#39;s because 30 minutes later you&#39;ll be getting up and doing late night eating binge.

VThe Deep Sleep I had received was from Stone Age Farmacy, Gardena Ca.\u000a\u000aThe bud was dense and beautiful. Trichomes would be all over my finger tips after grabbing it to break down. \u000aHowever, this select bud was sprayed with sugar water to make it weigh more. When I sparked it the whole time all I taste was wet plant. *Also, I got less than a gram in reality. 5 minutes after smoking I started to feel my eyes get heavy and the back of my neck wasn&#39;t in so much pain.\u000a\u000aOverall, it&#39;s probably a great strain but the shop that grew mine was average for a $20 gram donation.

VI didn&#39;t know what it was when I smoked it and I was expecting sativa not indica- not the fault of the strain but rather of mine- I&#39;ve definitely got an intense body numbing sensation and tbh I feel like I can&#39;t move lol. I definitely want to sleep lmao. \u000a\u000aThis isn&#39;t reacting great with my anxiety, if anything I feel more anxious, but I think that&#39;s cause I was expecting brain bot body melting.

VI first tried this strain over a year ago, yet there was no place I could comment or explain my experience in a review as such with new strains just making it on to leafly.\u000a\u000aAnyways this is probably my favorite strain, which crosses 2 other really great god like strains the pre-98 Bubba Kush and Larry OG. As other have said its all in the name and I suffer from bad insomnia brang on by my anxiety disorder most of the time, not being able to shut of my brain. Well this certainly dose the trick, it has a nice piney with slight funk undertones when it comes to aroma and its rock hard nugs looked rolled in thc crystals galore. \u000a\u000aThe first hit within 3 seconds I can feel full body relaxation and I literally feel all my stressors and pain melt away and I like it mostly after a long days hard work. It also inspires me to cook when I get home which translates into relaxation on he couch watching movies which helps my anxiety stay a minimum. This then has me in a deep sleep and off soundly sleeping and actually sleeping until my alarm goes off which is priceless. Its great for pain as well a good knockout indica that will be very much loved from here on out if not even before I discovered this wonderful strain, Thank You,

O-pens are kinda hard but oddly enough the disposable o-pens are nice and come in sativa, hybrid and indica and all 3 were very smooth so they need to make their cartridges thAt way. Dream steam is the best!
