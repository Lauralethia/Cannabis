VThis is awesomeness. It did everything it&#39;s suppose to do. It made us relaxed, talkative, hungry, sleepy, happy... no pain in back. It made the pain tolerable. Our imaginations flowed with thoughts &amp; creative idea&#39;s wow! It lasted a few hours. Definitely would recommend a few puffs is all you need! Enjoy! :)

VI wasn&#39;t sure what to expect from this strain. I purchased it for it&#39;s medical rating on Pain. It&#39;s a 70/30, which isn&#39;t too strong for me, for what I need for sleep. It certainly crushed my chronic back pain, which was at 10 on the pain scale. I will certainly have this on hand, for day time relaxing, and when the pain spikes. There could of been other factors, as why I wasn&#39;t too sleepy, and too high from it. Awesome all around.

VThe flowers were covered in kief and covered everything they touch in kief, more than I&#39;ve seen on any other strain in MA.  Smell was mellow, not very loud at all, and was sweet and earthy like petrichor.  The flavor when burned was harsher than expected, but not unpleasant.\u000aEffects were almost entirely cerebral, providing noticeable mental stimulation and a focused creativity energy, making it perfect for reading and writing.  I didn&#39;t feel overly intoxicated despite the obvious mood-lifting effects, which made me feel \u000a confident during social interactions. Not many body effects, but my arthritis pain is almost totally gone, and my muscles are certainly more relaxed.  \u000a\u000aPatriot Care sucks, but I love this weed.

V2 Extreme 2 Cream\u000a\u000aMethod of Consumption: Volcano Vaporizer \u000a\u000aPros: Uplifting relaxation and pain relief. Causes munchies and great for helping with an appetite. \u000a\u000aCons: Dry Mouth. As with the Pros: Will make you hungry, so keep this in mind.\u000a\u000aDraw/Taste: Smooth Draw &amp; Exhale.

VThis was my first time hearing about this strain and all I wanted to know afterwards was, &quot;where was this the past 2yrs of my smoking life?&quot; It was a heavy hitter from just two pulls! I suffer from sleep anxiety, insomnia and this help my brain stop spinning prior to sleep and allowed me to sleep deeply foe about 5.5hrs which is rare. This is definitely a nighttime strain for me. Whenever it&#39;s available I&#39;ll have it in my possession.
