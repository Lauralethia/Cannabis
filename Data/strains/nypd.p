VI would really only give it 3.5 stars if I could. its a good strain to work on if you don&#39;t get those obvious signs of smoking i.e bloodshot eyes. I got mine from main street marijuana in Vancouver Washington. it tested under 20 percent so I think it would be good for sophomore smokers. it&#39;s taste was earthly but pleasant. I smoke mostly to get out of pain and put me in a good mood. this is great for a mood elevator and okay for pain to just take the edge off and make it at least tolerable, for me anyway. I would buy it again\u000a

My go-to store was out of any full Sativas really so I gave this a shot. \u000aOne, it tastes awful. \u000aTwo, it wears off fast, and heads straight into headache land. \u000aWhile the buds are dense and pretty this is just not a strain I will be heading towards again anytime soon.

VTried this NYPD from Rogue Raven farms. It didn&#39;t smell too much like a sativa-lacked that sharpness to it. The buds were nice and sticky which I liked. The effects seemed to lean more towards a balanced hybrid than a sativa but it was definitely one you could &quot;get-up-and-go&quot; on!

VFun! Does have a diesel vibe going. Helpful for focus, energy, workouts, etc. Pretty potent too. I liked it. Having said that, it seems lacking next to Sour D and many other zippy &quot;sativa&quot;-ish strains. I enjoyed it, but probably won&#39;t buy on repeat.

VMaybe it&#39;s the batch I have of it. It looks amazing. But it tastes so much like a orange/tangie/jillybean type strain to me. I&#39;m not a fan of that flavor profile.\u000aI wonder if the dispensary has Tangie Biscotti mislabeled? If not, this isn&#39;t a strain for those that aren&#39;t fans of orange zest flavor.\u000aThe high is mellow and relaxing, slightly cerebral.

VThis is a beautiful strain for: relieving physical and emotional pain, making you goofy, jacking off, snacking, playing video games, listening to music, etc.\u000a\u000aThere isn&#39;t a problem with it otherwise, other than the general cottonmouth that comes with any partaking. However, it&#39;s not much in comparison to other strains like Trainwreck in my opinion, though definitely some top tier shit. Honestly, after about 4 or 5 puffs in I was already feeling extremely relaxed, somewhat sleepy and majorly hearing and sight impaired. I had just flown back home from Minnesota, and I had cut myself up real badly on one of the days there, doing God knows what, something stupid, and the bruises and scrapes from it felt like they&#39;ve never existed.\u000a\u000aThe main effects to me are zoning the fuck out, losing your hearing or sight a little, getting a change in personality/mood, etc.. Listening to Gravel by Bones (SESH till I fucking rest, lmao) is a welcoming experience, it feels almost like an outdoor concert with the fan I have blowing beside me. Playing shit tons of PS4 games with friends, having a wank, thinking, sitting in complete darkness, etc. on NYPD is the best feeling ever after 4 unfortunate weeks of being sober. \u000a\u000aAs for the strain itself, it could be the grower, but I feel more hybrid-heavy towards this one rather than just sativa, because I&#39;m having a feeling similar to King Louis XIII, but not quite as extreme.\u000a\u000aSolid 7.8/10 strain, great for most occasions and nighttime sessions.
