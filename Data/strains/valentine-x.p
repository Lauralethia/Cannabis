VI&#39;m really sensitive to THC and have had some really bad experiences in the past with anxiety and paranoia. This strain is so great for helping with those problems. I feel very relaxed but still alert and focused. Once it starts to fade a bit I get super calm and relaxed and ready to sleep. All in all a great strain if you&#39;re new to smoking or want something with low THC and high CBD.

VI wanted to weigh in on this because I&#39;m sensitive to THC and this strain was perfect for me! I ordered it from a delivery service in SoCal - very pleasant, tingly body buzz and I didn&#39;t feel paranoid or too &quot;in my head&quot; at all.

VFucking love this strain! Was very curious to try it because of its CBD dominant 25:1 and found it very surprising. I didn\u2019t think you will get \u201csmacked\u201d off of it, but you can. It\u2019s a definite body high with a head buzz. Very tingly, and talkative feeling.

VI second everything from TheRavenAZ&#39;s review, as I had a similar experience the second time I bought this strain. \u000aThe first time, buying it from the dispensary I normally use, I loved it!  It gave me calm motivation, helped with seizures, pain and anxiety. \u000a\u000aA few months later, I got some from a different, unknown to me dispensary, since it was the only one in AZ carrying it at the time. \u000aIt was an agonizing 4-6 hours! Even the next day, I felt like I had a hangover. \u000aSo based on my first experience, this could be a good strain...IF it&#39;s from a dispensary that&#39;s not in Arizona.  \u000aI may try it again if the dispensary I trust gets some. \u000aOtherwise, Harle-tsu it is for me!
