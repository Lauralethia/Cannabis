VProbably had too much, basically a whole joint.  My HD tested at 4.6% thca; 14.6% CBD from Moani Farms in Seattle. First experience with HD was virtually nothing on a couple 3 hits so this time I figured I needed to smoke a lot.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m positive I&#39;ve never had this much CBD ever before.  The high with it was OK but not fun. almost like if you&#39;re drunk at a party after having too many drinks and trying hard to sober up.  Not euphoric, no big appetite rush. A little tired, minor bits of paranoia but not heavy.  This much CBD and just a small % of thca for me was a totally different effect I have never experienced.  No big pain relief either but maybe it takes time or repeated use.  \u000a\u000aam wondering what effect one would get from a 0% thca, very high CBD strain like a Charlotte&#39;s Web.  People write that CBD has no effect but that&#39;s not true.  \u000a\u000aI will try it again but just a few hits.

VThis is a perfect low thc good daytime smoke that will get you through meetings, work and interviews. It had a good cbd to thc ratio and if you are like me sometimes you don&#39;t need something so strong to cripple you. This is where this comes in, beautifully smelling but the taste is like dick,  not a nice taste at all. But hey it&#39;s a good beginner weed for daytime function, helped my anxiety and focus but if your looking to get stoned find a higher thc strain, but for the novice this works wonders.

VIf you love Blue Dream but are looking for a great CBD variety, this is it! I can perfectly describe this as funky fresh tropical bud. Grapefruity citrus sour combined with the familiar Berry funk of Blue Dream makes this smell as good as it smokes. Effects were that of a solid sativa, very energetic and motivating but with absolutely zero anxiety or paranoia. H.D. had me feeling uplifted and inspired for a very long duration. The CBD seems to almost stretch the thc&#39;s mood enhancing effect, bringing relief to my bipolar mood symptoms for virtually half the day, if not more. The effects are more or less clear headed with virtually no head buzz noted other than a prominent feeling of well-being and upbeat mood. There is a good deal of energy to be found with Hawaiian Dream, I found myself quite active and productive through the day and not once have I experienced drowsiness or lethargy when smoking just Hawaiian Dream. I will note that upon smoking a larger dose (1.5g blunt) I developed a very slight shiver, being a naturally shaky person this didn&#39;t bug me and it subsided quickly but it might be safe to limit your consumption if you are one prone to jitters, anxiety, and over-excitement. Over all this is a great choice for some one seeking long lasting CBD mood enhancement with a sativa kick.

VThis very high cbd strain with virtually no thc works well on my pain. I like to mix it with something else, Jack Herer in the early day, maybe Grape Ape in the evening. I have not tried it simply on it&#39;s own yet, which I will do soon, so I can really see what the effects are by itself. Moani Naturals puts out a gram of flower and a joint of this (I got the joint then smoke it in a pipe), it was $11 plus tax. Smells great. Will update review after I try it by itself.

VVery focused high.  I had expected something a little stronger and so was slightly disappointed at first.  I smoked some a couple of days later, and the second experience was the true deal.  Hints of Blue Dream in the background -- the sativa influence isn&#39;t overwhelming (I have to watch the sativas, so I was happy about this aspect!)  I was told the Hawaiian strain was Maui, but I&#39;m not sure about that.  I recall some terrific Maui from the mid-eighties.  This was different.  Good, but different.  Nice and mellow all the way around.

I would highly recommend this strain for any sort of chronic pain condition.

VPicked up the CBD-focused Hawaiian Dream from Moani Naturals in the Seattle region. It was tested at 7.5% THC, 10.25% CBD. Even though it&#39;s marketed as a pain relief strain, it still gives a very nice high, even body/head. I don&#39;t have too many physical ailments at the moment, so I can&#39;t really vouch for its pain relief properties, but the body does feel good. If I had to complain, the silly-high feeling doesn&#39;t last more than an hour, but that&#39;s a good thing too if you want to focus or be productive; did some nice reading. Later on, I mixed in a little bit of Dream Beaver from Phat Panda and it was a very pleasant all-over high, great to kick back and play FIFA 16 while listening to classic Ron &amp; Fez clips.

VThis is my second review of this strain. A year ago I praised it for helping me sleep, but the last batch I bought (also from Moana growers) didn&#39;t help my insomnia as much. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s this particular crop, or my insomnia is worse - and the strain isn&#39;t actually suggested for sleeplessness, so I must have just been very sensitive to it before. However, it&#39;s giving me one of the most pleasant, relaxed highs ever, so I&#39;m giving it 5 stars again. It&#39;s perfect for chilling out at home in the evening when you don&#39;t want that dopey stoner feeling, which I dislike. Makes me very chatty and happy. Switched to another strain to help with my insomnia.

VMy first high CBD strain. Really a lot better than the more potent stuff I have tried. But that is just personal and I&#39;m sure that is always changing. The bud itself is really sticky and very aromatic. The high is amazing. I think having such a low dose of THC mixing well with the body effects lead into a really smart relaxed high that is great for people that experience chronic pain or chronic anxiety. This is truly medicine.

VThis is a strain I like to enjoy every once in a while. I don&#39;t get the crazy, bad dry mouth, but it does give you dry mouth. It&#39;s very relaxing. If you get the munchies, you don&#39;t sit and overeat. If you&#39;re someone who likes smoking in the evening, this is a good choice. You feel relaxed, cozy, and peaceful. While you get high, it doesn&#39;t make you feel aggressively high. It does help with feeling pukey for sure. It helped me a lot with the stomach flu. Definitely worth a try.

VWhen smoking, I get a very painful headache about a few mins after. It lasts maybe 5-10 mins but once it disappeared, I felt the good effects of the high. Focused and lighter, not anxious. Vaping doesn&#39;t give headaches so at least there&#39;s that. Overall I like it, definitely good for daytime/productivity.

VI don&#39;t like to get drunk, and I don&#39;t like to be *really* stoned. I just want a nice, relaxing high that soothes my muscle aches and helps me sleep without being &quot;druggy.&quot; And this is it for me. One of my three top favorite strains.
