VMy first review on my first taste of some California bud.\u000a(Note: I smoke a couple times a month)\u000a\u000aFirst time having Humboldt and any California bud was quite an experience. \u000a\u000aIt has a very nice shimmering light green aura to it and glistens in the light.  Has a very nice earthy, refined, smell but not too pungent or overbearing.  \u000aThe high that this strain provides you is a pretty intense head high (this may be because of my low tolerance) along with an initial relaxing and very comfortable body high.  The body high leaves you feeling amazing while still in control.  The head high is a very wild experience as well.  Your thoughts are extremely amplified and vivid to the point where you could dream when you close your eyes for a couple seconds.\u000aThis strain is perfect for any headaches or trouble with sleeping.  \u000aNo dry mouth, eyes (that I could remember ;)) and munchies weren&#39;t a huge deal with this strain either.  Yeah, the Chips Ahoy were some of the best tasting things at the time but it wasn&#39;t to the point where I couldn&#39;t put them down.  \u000a\u000aAll in all, a very refined yet intense high that is very enjoyable.\u000aRecommend you pace yourself when consuming this (for those with lower tolerances.)

VThis is one aromatic strain once it hits the mouth... pungent, woodsy, nutty taste. Like an expensive cologne or somethin&#39;! It eases the from the temples to the pain down my spine. Gone. Has me stuck but could move if really necessary. Have a spruce of energy slowly easing its way in. Euphoria has everything kind of shining. Damn Good Meds right here. Stock up

VWow, this is gonna be popular, about 5 small dabs of this have me in another world, my mind is fucking shattered (haha get it, shattered?) and I&#39;m super relaxed almost to couchlock, but still able to function. It&#39;s like I&#39;m feeling super strong at the same time effects of both sativa and indica. Amazing.
