VGot it from The Stud in east of Amsterdam. Dry and crunchy and have a sweet and calming smell. \u000a\u000aThe strain is strong, but not too heavy. I got in a creative mood, and think this strain is perfect for creative souls. \u000a\u000aNot for consentrating or listening to others( in a lecture and totally not paying attention). EarlierI felt a bit stressed over school, and stuff I hadn&#39;t done yet, but soon got myself to start on stuff I had neglected. \u000a\u000aNo munchies, and taste flavors not so improved (like everything taste better, it didn&#39;t really). It&#39;s a nice weed, that for me at least didn&#39;t give me the worst side effects.

VFirst thing about it; it looks amazing. Purple and green leaves, covered in crystals. Just so you know, I had blue sugar punch not sugar punch. So, it&#39;s sugar punch crossed with blueberry. They didn&#39;t have that particular strain on here but anyway, this strain smells sweet.. literally like sweets haha (with a hint of bluberry). Strong taste of lemons immediately as you smoke it. Sweet again and a taste of blueberry. Makes you a cough a bit if you use half a gram or so a joint (depending on your daily usage). Very nice, strong tasting smoke and a really relaxing but uplifting high. You might get quite drowsy once you get through a joint or two or three... \u000aStill though, for regular smokers they&#39;ll still be quite alert. I still wanted to game after I watched a bit of TV. Makes the eyes a bit slow also.

V100% Sativa dominant ... Awesome awesome strain!!! I call it my &quot;miracle motivational  weed &quot; cause it makes me want to all the stuff I don&#39;t want to do!! Clean ? Laundry ? No problem.. Just have some sugar punch and you&#39;ll actually have a good time. Puts you in a good mood. Also helps with creativity . One of my favorites!

VGreat for a night in by yourself. Nice dreamy effect, especially with some slow or sad music; makes you feel melancholic though. Headache comes when the high wears off. Moderate munchies. \u000a\u000aBody high is pretty heavy when vaped, and you can just fell yourself sinking in the bed when you lie down. Doesn&#39;t leave a nasty taste in your mouth.\u000a\u000aI love this strain!

VExcellent Strain. The buds are really nice and the smoke is clean and smooth. Gives you that clean and focused high which is great for day time smoking.

VJust purchased some from Relief Choices.  Great for daytime use, help for focus, took away my headache and knee pain.  Gave me some giggles, munchies and will be looking forward to experiencing again soon.

VMy first time trying this strain, and my husband and I both really did not like it. It increased my anxiety, made my mind race, and makes us feel kind of depressed, not a good high. The bud quality, potency and all is fine, just not a good fit for us.
