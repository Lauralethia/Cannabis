VReceived this in a sample pack from my dispensary and it was a very standard, typical indica kush. The effects were good, and taste was mellow, but mellow is pretty much the way to describe Sugar Kush. I would buy again if it was on discount, but there is stronger out there.

VPleasant earthy aroma.  Sweet, what you would expect from something called Sugar Kush.  Kicks in fairly quickly, not too much of a creeper.  When pressed into rosen, it shows potential.  The hashplant genetics really come through.  A great strain.

VAs someone who is extremely thc sensitive and tends to get anxiety, this strain doesn\u2019t do that. No anxiety at all. \u000a\u000aThe initial rush starts with a warmth in the chest following a curiosity for my surroundings, lots of talking and relaxation. After an hour or two I\u2019m feeling pretty sleepy, until I smoke more then I feel like talking about ideas again. \u000a\u000aLove it!

VBedtime!  That&#39;s the best way I can describe this strain.\u000aIt smells of the typical kush smell with well frosted buds and a nice smoke. Low on terpenes but still there.  \u000aI find after smoke I am relaxed but it really does make my head feel thick and heavy. I can still think well,but as soon as I close my eyes it&#39;s like someone closed the shutters and blinds on my brain and I&#39;m drifting off quickly to dreamland.

VIt definitely gets you high however, I had a very strange high with this strain. I\u2019ve never had a \u2018bad high\u2019 before and wasn\u2019t sure those existed until I smoked this. I am regularly not paranoid however, this strain made me very paranoid and actually brought me to tears because of it. I kept hearing things that weren\u2019t there, my poor boyfriend had to deal with my tears every half and hour or so. I think it\u2019s a good strain but I don\u2019t know why it made me so paranoid/emotional?

VAppearance- very beautiful, large nugs. Seems to be a very light green color with larger dark green leaves and orange furs. Seems like it would be dense when you look at it, however when you break in open you will notice that it&#39;s quite fluffy making for a beautiful grind.\u000a\u000aSmell- very fruity. Like fruit loops or rainbow pebbles!\u000a\u000aSmoke- tastes almost like a mocha, interestingly enough. Hit very smooth.\u000a\u000aFeeling- ever taken a hit out of a bong and you just really feel it in your chest that it was a good hit? This definitely did that for me as soon as I finished the bowl. Instant droppyness of eyes and sense of relaxation. \u000a\u000aPain- Honestly doesn&#39;t really work for pain.... used this for an ovarian cyst and the medication portion is more sedative and makes you want to fall asleep or be lazy and comfy watching Netflix. Helps distract you from the pain rather than actually treat it and relieve the pain. This strains makes it take longer for you to register things in you mind. Which is good for pain because you won&#39;t really realize you&#39;re hurting but if you ever focus in on your pain it will be excruciating. \u000a\u000aHunger- Hunger hits you like a train. Like I don&#39;t think you could smoke this strain without snacking. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEven as I, an above average stoner who&#39;s been smoking every day for years with an extremely high tolerance, write this article I can feel the strain doing its work. If you don&#39;t feel anything you just need to sit and wait a few minutes because it will have you ripped. I definitely wouldn&#39;t smoke this if you have somewhere to be.\u000a\u000aWARNING: I could see how this strain could potentially cause paranoia. It almost makes you feel like the outside world is not a factor and is very internal and a STRONG mind high. If you start thinking about one thing going wrong in your life it will send you down a wrong path of high that is hard to reverse. \u000a\u000a10/10!!! may have found my new favorite strain \u000a

VFTB on this strain. Real light green, trichomes  glistening all thru out the nuggy(purchased only1grm.) Don&#39;t have the kush smell or taste. Smelled of sweet butter. Taste of sweet tar. Didn&#39;t enjoy the taste. After packing a popper didn&#39;t feel much. So broke it down and put it in a raw paper cone. That was a wrap. Took the whole j to the neck.  Thats what was needed to be done cause a bowl of this sugar kush was just to week for me. Tried it, done with it. On to the next.
