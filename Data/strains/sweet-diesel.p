VEasy to smoke and nice taste without a bad long aftertaste. It&#39;s a creeper though. It took me about 30 mins to really feel the effect off of one bowl. I talked a lot on it, and the body high is where it&#39;s really at. Almost like eating an edible.

VI have this on Select Strains Elite co2 cartridge.  Taste amazing. Leaning towards the sour diesel flavor for sure. \u000a\u000aCurious to those that would know... What&#39;s the difference in Headband, Sour Al and this strain? All three are Sour Diesel x OG Kush strains. I&#39;ve always wondered how you get so many strains from crossing the same two?  Apologies in advance if that sounds like a stupid question.

VI use this strain primarily for treating chronic migraine &amp; ocular (the kind with squiggles in your eyesight for about 20 minutes) migraine headaches. As a 2nd part to the migraines I always get a neck pain that follows for several hours and I feel rundown to the point of becoming a couch potato, vaping Sw makes that neck pain go away, the rundown feeling is much less. I don&#39;t get headaches from using this strain, though I only use what I need.  I like its flavor and prefer this to indicas because it doesn&#39;t make me tired.
