VI bought the clone before trying the flower. I got the flower about a week ago. It was a bit dry, so I re hydrated it with a boveda pack and let out sit for a few days. A nice citrus tone came out with a nice sweet chronic smell at the end. The flavor profile was limonene, myrcene and a hint of caryophyllene. Meaning it had the citrus flavor with some spicy berry on the exhale. It did not have the deep stone I was hoping it would be but still had nice effects. THC 22.6 CBD .46

VI&#39;m fairly new to cannabis, but the local dispensary recommended it. I took it easy, and I really enjoyed it. The smell is wonderful, the buds look beautiful, and the taste is great. What gets me the most is the smooth hit. It hits like a light cigarette, which is great for a beginner like me. The buds I got tested at 15.10% THC. The high took a little while to set in, maybe 20 minutes. It started as a slight head rush, then it turned into a lovely calm happiness. Short high, but definitely worth trying. I have clinically diagnosed anxiety and this really helped, much more than the prescription medications I was given. I deducted one star for the duration of effects and the slightly unpleasant onset. Still, a wonderful smoke. Give it a shot!

VJust got this strain and have been playing around with it for a bit, I have to say it&#39;s a great overall smoke. What you get from blockhead is a very deep high that relaxes you and lets you think calmly. I highly recommend this strain of you have any small pains, it really helped me forget and numb mine. I would do this at a small late party or a late night sesh. The only reason I don&#39;t give a 5 star is that the high is not that long.

VI bought a pre roll a week ago, that was a combination of G13 &amp; BlockHead  CBD 0.13%, CBN 0.01% , CBG 0.42%, THC 20.57%. Three cigarette type puffs later I was quite high (I dab more than smoke), I then took 2 regular hits off it &amp; went back to my camp &amp; became a near vegetable...wow...thank goodness it was night time &amp; I was ready for bed &amp; it was great for pain relief too. I just picked up another 2 days ago...takes me 3-4 evenings to smoke 1 pre roll of this stuff.

VAll - around winner right here. Pretty intense cerebral and physical effects, but definitely more in the body. This strain has an amazing, super sweet but mildly pungent aroma. the effects were everything a veteran wants in a pure power strain. Bottomless stomach, intense laughing fits, and a week long coma are in your future after consuming this strain. And as a plant, she is an extreme yielder, compact grower, and has overall amazing growth structure. it really sucks that this is such a hard strain to find for me these days because its one of my definite favorites.
