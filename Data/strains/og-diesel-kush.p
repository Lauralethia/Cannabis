VThe miggity-mellowist high I&#39;ve ever had the easier if experiencing. Comes on fast but gentle. Very content, peaceful. The high feels a little like melting away or like floating gently in the healing hot springs of Iceland. Very heady but not to be surpassed by the awesome - jaw sagging and knuckle dragging body high.\u000a\u000aI HIGHly recommend this. If you get your hands on it, cherish it.

VTo start, AWESOME WEED! &#39;This is the first strain I have ever tried &quot; a while back.&quot; This hybrid left me holding onto the bench in a park think the world was falling like as if I was the guy on the back end of the Titanic going into the ocean. Major HD vision effect like wallpaper in the background, paranoia like no other, and left me laughing my ass off. Highly recommend this strain.

VFor me, a heavy user, this strain fits into my morning usage.  What I had was a very energetic and clear headed high.  The pain relief, however was off the chart.  After only a half bowl, it felt like I had just rubbed my neck and shoulders with Ben Gay or something. (xep smell mo betah).  Amazing.  Only felt this much pain relief before after some really good Chem Dawg.  This is even better.  Leafly rightly ranks the pain relief factor very high in it&#39;s Medical Effects details.  If you want pain relief with VERY little sedation, this one should work well.

VVery strong strain. Tastes like straight diesel fuel and smells like skunk. However, it takes very little to get you high. I would highly recommend this strain for when you are alone. It makes you fall asleep on the couch or get lost in thought too easily. Never have yet had a bad experience on it though. One of my all time favorites.

VThis may be a &quot;creeper&quot; for some however the effects are consistent with the description. I never knew there where so many Diesel cross breeds and I assume they are all &quot;skunky&quot; this choice certainly is. Worth trying at the least but a really solid selection.

VVery relaxing strain for me. I&#39;ve saw some reviews where it causes couch lock. perhaps for some it isn&#39;t the best strain if you have go to work, but I have ADHD so it works great for me at all times. great ADHD strain.

VThis strain is very subtle. It&#39;s not a &quot;smack you in the face&quot; type of high. It&#39;s very relaxing and mellows you out without getting you stoned. Definitely a good strain for bedtime.
