Va pretty decent strain. Got the shatter from Nature&#39;s Medicines it&#39;s super yummy &amp; the high is very noticeable. \u000a\u000ato the person Matcav or whatever, they aren&#39;t talking about gummy bears you eat. they&#39;re talking about gummy bear the strain...

VI to a dab of sugar wax. It was a good &quot;high&quot;. But it I feel no pain or anxiety relief. Flavor tastes like lemons and gave me a bit if a headache... I&#39;ll give it another day in court, but for now it was mediocre. &#128530;

VThis strain is a rather interesting hybrid. And it\u2019s a heavy creeper for sure. It\u2019s not often that I smoke bud that\u2019s a creeper. The smell didn\u2019t really carry over it as it was super earthy but berry-ish smell to it and the taste is really earthy. It takes a while for the high to build intensity and then once it gets going, it\u2019s like a train. But I\u2019ve found that this is also very euphoric strain that left me very talkative. It\u2019s a good strain.

VRolled a nice blunt into some hemp wrapper. First few hits are strong and powerful! Nice relaxation going on, pain levels and stress levels down! Much happier than i was 10 minutes ago! Def a great powerful strain for daytime even. You can feel the indica relaxing you but the sativa is def doing its job as well! Great hybrid like a girl scout cookie!

VPicked of a pre-roll of this on the suggestion of the shopkeeper while on vacation in Alaska. At first I thought it was just a tiny pre-roll that cost too much and was obviously geared toward gullible tourists. Having no mobile coverage in Alaska, I couldn&#39;t look up anything about the strain and just figured it was yet another tourist trap: Let&#39;s call it something cute and get all those gen x&#39;ers. Three pulls later and I wasn&#39;t impressed. Sometime between that and the fourth, I immediately took back every snarky thought and experienced totally chilled, but still cognitive sensation that I likened to heaven.

VNice earthy and relaxing not the most potent strain I&#39;ve ever had but definitely gets the job done for an Indica dominant hybrid it&#39;s quite nice buds aren&#39;t too big but have a nice scent and good Construction outside of that there&#39;s not much else to say about this strain I would recommend it for anybody after a good day at work when you want to just chill and not be completely knocked out.....

VPhenomenal taste and texture, for a concentrate, that&#39;s saying a lot. The taste is legitimately sweet to the tongue and the high is oh so gentle but not disappointing. Probably a great first time strain or a casual smokers go-to, but any vet will appreciate good meds &#127797;

VGreat hybrid. Super potent with a candy sweetness that honors its name. I thought other strains smelled like candy in the past, but this legit smells like a bag of assorted gummy candy. Seems pretty balanced but its potency makes it best for stress relief/relaxing. Really enjoy that one of the reviews on here is about edibles too.

VI was expecting Gummy Bears to deliver a great fruity flavor, but that&#39;s not what I got. It doesn&#39;t have much flavor at all. The only effects I felt were feeling a bit sleepy about 30 minutes later. This strain was a complete waste of money for me because it didn&#39;t do anything or my depression, did not uplift my mood and did not leaving me feel carefree as described. If you have a higher THC tolerance, this strain will likely be a dud for you too, because well, I consumed a whole bowl (nearly 1/2 gram) and literally felt nothing - I felt the same as I did before I used the strain except 30 minutes later, I needed a nap.

VThese gummy bears were just what I needed.  I was a little skeptical at first but followed the advice of the good gentleman at Natures Medicine (McDowell Rd).  He told me to eat just one and wait for a good little while and then I&#39;d know how to adjust in the future.  To my surprise those little gummies had some power.  I believe it was the Baked Bros brand.  All I can say is wow, and one of the first great nights of sleep I got in a very long time.
