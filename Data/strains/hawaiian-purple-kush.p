VNothing bad to say about it.  I love the sweet fruity and floral taste.  You can definitely feel the influence of the two parents.  As a lover of most Purple Kush derivative strains, this does not disappoint.  The nugs I got from the store were just beautiful.  Thick, chunky buds just caked in amber and lab tested over 25% THC.  I grew one myself in a setup side by side with 9# hammer and GSC, and she had the fattest buds and was finished soonest.  If you love relaxing Indica that has solid pain relief qualities, try HPK.  It&#39;s my new favorite strain.  Easy to grow, easy to smoke, easy on my achin&#39; back and nerve pain.

VWild ride into oblivion. Smells heavenly. Many chuckles, larfs, chortles and guffaws along the way. Altho a heavy indica hybrid, tried a little before hitting the gym last week and had an excellent workout. \u000a\u000aFrom The Human Collective in Portland. \u000a\u000a21.68 THC - 0.09 CBD.

Vfeelings right now; incredibly relaxed, uplifted, very happy, and feel creative and outgoing.\u000a\u000aYou smoke this strain and you get very lemony earth taste with pine undertones. The high is a slow building high, taking a longer than normal time to hit you, but when it does it hits like a truck. immediately relaxed and incredibly euphoric. it gets stronger over time and eventually it hits you harder than the first. incredible strain. if you ever have the opportunity to grab this strain, treat yourself.
