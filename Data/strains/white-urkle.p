VOne of the best damn highs I&#39;ve ever had.  This strain is amazing, and it&#39;s now one of only three strains that I actually stockpile every month.  Balanced head and body high, and it made my mood disorders completely vanish just as wonderfully as it brought my inflammation and pain from Osteoarthritis down to the point where I felt normal for the first time in ten years.  If you need something that works for pain, mood, and swelling, this is the one!

VWhite Urkle is the perfect sleeper. The strain profile says almost nothing about effects but buckle up boys and girls. It smells amazing, the effect is heady, while also packing a crazy, powerfully heavy body high. Be careful and go slow this stuff can sneak up on you.

VSis in law flowed me a heavy gram just now and dayum...not reading leaflys guide yet, I&#39;d say the high is similar to GSC, maybe sunset sherbet...I&#39;m functional and locked at the same time. back pain gone. future&#39;s rapping/mumbling makes much sense to me now. I could go for a jog, but why? esp when it&#39;s 105&#176; at 2130...let&#39;s play some Diablo 3 instead.

VI absolutely love this strain. One can definitely feel the indica inside of this glorious hybrid. This is the kind of strain that you can smoke at the end of the day, even after a day of smoking, and still feel the relaxing effects. White Urkle is a great strain to have when you have nothing to do and just want to sit around with some friends on the back porch and some good food.

And I\u2019m a chronic pain patient with a collapsing pelvis ( not fun.) \u000a\u000aThis stuff is potent, but blankets you in a calm euphoric haze. Mentally, this is a great strain for depression and anxiety. Due to its stabilizing but uplifting effect upon your mental outlook. \u000a\u000aHighly suggest trying this one home alone on a Sunday afternoon. Great for introspection. Reading, tv, and music is all greatly enhanced. \u000a\u000a

Vgot this as a 1 gram preroll accidentally. ordered white widow. I was having extreme sciatic pain at the time. shortly after smoking about half of my joint my pain started to go away. this is only 19% so it&#39;s very low and I have a very high tolerance. I will def be getting this strain again for pain. love the smell and taste a big harsh not to bad but produces a cough. droopy eyelids smoked before bed. clear enough to carry on convo or watch tv and laugh.

It hits the head slightly to strong (I guess it depends on amount/ person&#39;s chemistry).  And sooner than later turns into a very strong mostly body hybrid feeling.  Clear but happy mind and BEST of all it makes my spine like pasta! Euphoria Delight baby!  Toke more than a nice hit or two and probably be prepared for couchlock bliss!

VI&#39;m still a relatively new smoker, and suffer from panic disorder, but White Urkle has definitely been a favorite so far. Its calming effects are amazing. I don&#39;t get dizzy or am in my head too much. It just makes me happy! And another bonus that I&#39;ve just discovered is pain management. I broke my leg last week and had to have surgery. I&#39;ve only been out of the hospital for 5 days, but am limiting my use of oxycodone because I don&#39;t like being out of it or want to develop a problem. I got some ACDC because I heard it helps the best with pain, but it didn&#39;t help as much as I had hoped. So I threw in some white urkle and it had me feeling so much better in a matter of seconds. I could enjoy some time without feeling the horrible pain in my leg, and I&#39;m so thankful for it.

VI feel mixed about this one. bought it on special a few days ago. It&#39;s superrrr dry, crumbles like dead leaves when I load a bowl. many sun bleached leaves. I can get a pretty good high after I smoke a few bowls but it doesn&#39;t last too long. pretty decent taste/smell. Thinking it was just a bad/old batch. Might try again, definitely have had worse bud than this.
