VLike it says... heavy, heavy indica. Smoked about 2/3 of a gram and I was glued into place. I sat, completely motionless and watched a full episode of Broad City. I was plenty chatty, but the body high was out of this world. Full body tingling and then just numb... felt like I was floating above my body.\u000a\u000aWhen the episode ended, I wasn&#39;t sure I could move my arms to get the remote. I had a pep talk with myself and... I did it!! I moved my arms!! It felt like a huge victory. &#128079;&#128079; I laid down, giggled through a few more episodes, and then night night. \u000a\u000aThere are strains I like more than this, but I think it comes down to personal preference. I would have appreciated more of a mental relaxing in addition to the physical, and my partner didn&#39;t have the same awesome experience I did, so. Regardless, if you&#39;re looking for something to help with pain or insomnia, POG is your guy.

VThis stuff is really sticky and dense.  Even when I tried to grind it, I had a tough time getting it to break apart. So be ready for that.\u000a\u000aThe buzz itself is very similar to Blackberry Kush. It is a very strong Indica that will leave you with your eyes half shut and just one with the couch. I took this after a night of heavy drinking and it put me to sleep like a baby with NO hangover. I think I may have found my hangover juice...

VI was skeptic of the strain at first. It is quite rare in my area.  It took longer then normal to kick in, but when it did. Wow. I felt very happy and the pain in my back disappeared.  I felt very relaxed and as it faded, I felt sleepy and hungry.  After I had a few munchies, I had the best sleep I had all year.  I slept 10 hours.  I was a new me after I woke.  It has a nice subtle smell and it has nice golden streaks in it.  It is my favorite to date. I would definitely recommend.

It felt great, but at the same time I was couch-locked. I ended up playing on my Xbox for about an hour and a half. This is an ideal strain for those who want to spend the night indoors and relax.

VThis strain is one of my favorites. The smell essentially overpowers all other strains I have recently had. Pungent and strong and the taste follows that very well. I prefer this strain in pipes so I can really taste everything it has to offer. As for the effect department, it is one of the strongest indica plants I have experienced next to Gods Gift and Grand Doggy Purp. I get through about half a bowl when the effects start to really come on strong. It hits my eyes, almost excitement in my stomach, and slows my breathing. It helps me sleep wonderfully as I have been on medication for my insomnia in the past. Also, it alleviates my pain from my patellar tendinitis. Overall a great sleep aid and advised to anyone trying to kick back and relax.

VBig chunky nuggets all over with a dangerously potent smell, especially once dried and jarred or bagged up. Hits hard and fast, but also increases as the minutes pass. Definitely a night time smoke. Leaves you feeling damn high but unable to get off the couch. Smells and tastes like hashy/sweet juicy skunkyness.

Buds are very dense and thick with resin, very pleasing light golden colour, smells quite sweet and floral, slight citrus tones. Tastes very floral, quite enjoyable and a bit different. Effects are very nice, very relaxed but quite a mellow high, not too intense. I think this is not a pure indica as quite a nice head high to start with, although not that long lasting. Overall I really enjoyed it and would recommend to indica fans who want something not too heavy.

This strain  is great for just sitting, or more likely, laying around and  enjoying the hell out of what ever it is that you&#39;re doing at that moment. Definitely not  good to smoke if you want to be productive. Quite a lot of fun.

VRecommend this indica by the bud tender and I&#39;ve been very happy with it. Buds are very dense and thick with resin, very pleasing light golden colour, smells quite sweet and floral, slight citrus tones. Tastes very floral, quite enjoyable and a bit different. Effects are very nice, very relaxed but quite a mellow high, not too intense. I think this is not a pure indica as quite a nice head high to start with, although not that long lasting. Overall I really enjoyed it and would recommend to indica fans who want something not too heavy.

VI have used medical marijuana since the early days of it&#39;s legalization for problems that normally result in over-medication with heavy pharmaceuticals (I know I sound all hippie &#39;mother-earth&#39;-esque...trust me, I&#39;m not). And I was extremely hesitant to sign up for this website, incase the stigma could be traced back to me, but this strain is worth it a million times over. It uplifted my, and a friend&#39;s, very somber and troubled mood to a point where we could work through our feelings, laugh at our eccentricities, and even epiphanize (yes, I made up that word). It made me giggle and feel completely relieved of my anxiety, which is no easy task. The same goes for my friend. It relaxed my muscles from their intense constriction, and eased my physical pain (admittedly not eradicating it, but I don&#39;t expect that). But the best part is that it seemed to exile my PTSD, lasting long after the &#39;high&#39; wore off, and my horrific nightmares that wouldn&#39;t allow me to have even minimally decent sleep for months didn&#39;t plague me that night. I actually got to sleep. This is the best strain I have ever had (of the many I have had), and if you want to be immensely in tune with yourself as well as able to work through your inner-struggles with an incredibly positive and self-accepting attitude, THIS is the strain for you. Additionally, I highly recommend you experience this with a good friend so that you can bounce off each other, move forward in your personal journey and experience, and laugh your a** off like you never had before. (This is especially relevant to those of us with depression and anxiety). Plus, it has a pleasant smell.
