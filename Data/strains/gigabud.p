VI was just a little disappointed that this strain did not turn me into Giga-Bowser like I was expecting. It&#39;s just kinda giga-bulls**t, ya know. All I got to experience was a relaxing and sedating effect that relieved me of all stresses. My entire body and mind calmed. Mellowed out. Peaceful. A true delight to unwind with at the end of the day, especially while listening to breathtakingly beautiful music. But dammit, I wanted to become a giant turtle-like giga-badass!

VGreat strain! Easy to grow(big harvests, from the big bud), heavy indica effects provided by northern lights and other indicas depending on the seed breeding company. , the colors are darker greens, dark purples, bright red hairs. Has a very earthy and berry aroma to it. The taste of the northern lights slightly can be detected in some batched, particularly organic grows.

VPlanting all five of my seeds turned out to be a head ache when it came to \u201cpredicting\u201d the final weeks of flower and knowing when to flush. These autos start and finish on their own time so I have one that matured at 73. Two more left and I think there\u2019s anywhere between 1-4 weeks left. That\u2019s 12-16 weeks. Better off to go with a regular you know when the flower process starts. \u000a\u000aMajor lose is the time I\u2019ve been flushing the plants that still needed the nutrients. This could be considered a beginners error however when determining harvest time the manufacturers should get a grip on their products

VI really like this strain. I\u2019m not much for real heavy indices but this was the bomb. It slowly creeps on you and settles in nicely. You feel happy, relaxed and sleepy. You can comprehend most things, but definitely a bedtime strain. Not too overwhelming!

VThis strain is a cross with White Widow. Very Similair look and taste to white widow. The high is very potent and long lasting. Lasted well over two hours. It burns pretty quick but at the same time hits hard. The high is very relaxing but it does not tire me out or put me on couch lock. Overall a great strain, awesome for anxiety. The only downside is I noticed after smoking a huge bowl three hours later I had a headache and in need to medicate again.

VThe Gigabud is a hybrid from G13 labs that packs an extreme sativa high not to be played with.  The high is somewhat deceiving as it comes on slow and is purely visual.  Don&#39;t look for any body high.  This stain will take you higher.  Very spacey high that will leave you confused and looking for your keys.  Don&#39;t do anything.  This high is best for an attitude change without any sedative qualities.  Purely head high with no body except when grown outdoors.  Outdoor gigabud is as narcotic as opium.  Note sure why, I think it&#39;s just the unmatched power of the sun:)

VI have this strain.  It isn&#39;t a 60 day strain as Leafly relates, nor is it a super fast flowering strain as many other websites claim.  If you take it down before 11 weeks, it&#39;s too early.  Many other strains which claim 7 or 8 or even 9 weeks are not even close.  The pics here for many strains are complete fabrications of who knows what strain. Most strain pics do NOT show the strain in question. It&#39;s true.
