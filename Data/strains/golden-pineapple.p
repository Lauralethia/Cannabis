VA mischievous high. Knocks your brain into an inebriated, puffy/numb head space. Also delivers the reckless confidence of alcohol. Strong hallucinogenic disassociation with a euphoric, positive energy driving from the chest. A \u2153 suppressive mellowness that\u2019s couch-locky. Vision is slow to respond, but focus and field of view is razor sharp. However, just like the mental state, you can only hold focus for a few seconds before concentration slips. Not a productive high. Too easy for the mind to wander. Not like it\u2019s even really thinking of anything anyway. Music is enjoyable to space out to, but truthfully not the best. I\u2019ll be damned if your concentration doesn&#39;t absently slip away even here. That short attention span seems best suited for socializing. It keeps things constantly interesting and enjoyable while exchanging with people. The coolness of the high imparts a bravery to try (and succeed) at things.

VPicked this strain up from a local dispensary and was blown away by it. Within minutes of smoking a whole bowl, the clouds turned into shapes and free association became a lot easier. I entered a creative state where all stress just melted away and there was only relaxation. If you need a strain to make you feel creative, and relaxed, this is the strain for you.

VThis was one of the best looking, smelling, and tasting strains I have ever come across.  The smell was very tropical (think papaya) and tasted just the same.  The high comes on fast and strong.  You can tell this hydrid is definitely weighted more heavily on the sativa side.  Lots of energy and a great cerebral rush.  Upon my first use of this, I did smoke a bit too much and it&#39;s relaxing body high took me down.  After that I began to use it sparingly and got some great benefits from this. It can be a bit spacy at first but shortly afterwards I gain focus and can get a lot done.  For those looking for a great cerebral daytime strain this will do it for you quite nicely!  For those just starting take it easy on this as it does pack quite a whallop!

VGolden Pineapple Review - 36/50\u000aMarch 20, 2016\u000a\u000aSummary: An absolutely beautiful sativa flower with delicious, yet somewhat mild aromas and flavors of sweet, tangy pineapple. Expect a wave of physical euphoria and a calming of your belly accompanied by surprisingly little head effect. \u000a\u000a\u000aBrand: Phat Panda\u000aWeight: 3.5 grams\u000aHarvest Date: 1/04/2016\u000aPackaging Date: 1/16/2016\u000aTotal THC (&lt;THCA * .877&gt; + THC): 24.54%\u000aTotal CBD: 0.3%\u000a\u000a\u000aEye: 10/10\u000aGolden green, wispy buds of large, pear-shaped calyxes, with bright orange pistils and mostly clear trichomes. Very high calyx:leaf ratio highlighted by an excellent trim job. \u000a\u000a\u000aNose (&lt;Aromatic Intensity + Aromatic Quality&gt;/2): 6.75/10\u000a\u000aAromatic Intensity: 6/10\u000aAromatic Quality (subjective to my palate): 7.5/10\u000aNotes: Yes, slightly more than a hint of sweet, tangy pineapple. No chlorophyll. \u000a\u000a\u000aTongue (&lt;Flavor Intensity + Flavor Quality&gt;/2): 5.75/10\u000a\u000aFlavor Intensity: 4/10\u000aFlavor Quality: 7.5/10\u000aNotes: Tastes very similar to its smell with sweet, tangy pineapple on the inhale and a little sweet citrus on exhale. Though quite delicious, the flavor is not nearly as pronounced as other varieties with similar terpene profiles. Would greatly benefit from a sucrose boost. \u000a\u000a\u000aHead: 4/10\u000aNotes: Surprisingly little mind-shift for such a high THC (24.54%) sample. Whatever other cannabinoids and terpenes are in this Golden Pineapple&#39;s entourage are clearly altering how my body/mind normally processes THC. Good focus though! \u000a\u000a\u000aBody: 9.5/10\u000aNotes: Excellent energy boost and physical euphoria! Definite calming of my gastrointestinal tract. Terrific body effect for a sativa, similar to ATF in this way.

VIn the immortal words of Larry David, this strain is &quot;Pretty...pret-tay...pret-tray...pretty good!&quot;. I an in love with this incredible sativa leaning hybrid.  The terpenes are top shelf.  Plenty of strains claim to smell like this or that, but Golden Pineapple really does smell like pineapple candy. The smell transfers to the taste for the first few hits. The unique high is like having a warm blanket around your mind and body, yet at the same time giving you laser focus and waves of creativity.  It is impossible to recommend any higher. If you live in Washington state get your behind to a recreational shop and taste the goodness.

VVery nice, now I&#39;m not positive but I&#39;m sensing a trend the last few times I&#39;ve gotten bud grown by Phat Panda they&#39;ve become some of my favorite strains obviously the quality of the strain matters as much or more than the strain itself and PP knows how to really grow. The Golden Pineapple was really good the pineapple taste and smell was very strong. The bud was a frosty bright green color, the trichomes just cover the bud making it very sticky and frosty. The high is uplifting focused but relaxed feeling a really fun time weed.

Vgolden pineapple is currently my most favorite strain. i drive an hour out of my way in order to get my hands on this beauty from the only dispensary i know which has it. after smoking, gp somehow has a way of focusing my thoughts and i am able to get through a surprising amount of work. unlike a lot of other strains, i do not get drowsy, it does not put me to sleep, and i do not get distracted by a million and one thoughts. i feel like bradley cooper in limitless a little bit when i embrace the golden pineapple. i seriously love this strain.

I guess I am going in for round 2 then I will do some online shopping. my cats need christmas presents. also, I am thirsty. I need like a really delicious jalapeno limeaid or something.

VExcellent strain, though I did notice it was rather harsh compared to other strains I&#39;ve been smoking lately. That however could always just be this specific yield. \u000a\u000aFocusing on the high, which I am right now.\u000a\u000aFor me it takes a few minutes to creep on, about 5-10 minutes before it really starts to hit me. The effects seem to be very relaxing and thought provoking when sitting down listening to some chill music (such as Route Around by Rebelution). However if I get up, get moving, and get some fast tunes playing I feel better than a cup of coffee. So harshness aside I think its an excellent strain. The harvest I smoking right now sits at about 29% THC-a and you can for sure feel it. Take it easy, relax, smoke a bowl, and have a great warm spring/summer afternoon with your friends.\u000a\u000aPeace\u000a\u000aEclipse.\u000a\u000aNote: Will add vaporizer review soon (Pax by Ploom and Launch Box by Magic Flight)

VAs someone who generally has a hard time with sativas due to severe anxiety and panic attacks this strain is Awesome.  In small amounts it has a very clear and clean high that kind of wakes you right up.  In larger quantities it has a pretty strong high that can get slightly overwhelming for someone who is anxiety prone but not too bad and personally easier to get past than some other strains.

VGreat day time smoke! I got Phat Panda&#39;s Golden pineapple CBD oil for my Panda Pen, and it takes care of my mood and my pain management needs simultaneously. Solid Sativa. Comparable to Cenex, Jack Herer, White Widow, or Blue Dream in effects. Not my favorite strain overall, but definitely a solid go-to for when I need to stay active, aware and productive.

This is some of the most delicious tasting concentrate that I&#39;ve had,  with strong sweet and piney notes. I can best describe the effects as extremely energetic and uplifting \u2014excellent for waking and baking or if you have a lot of things to get done. Very stimulating and focused high while still being clear and not too heady. 10/10!

VThis is one of the tastiest strains I have tasted. Very bright, fragrant, with sticky buds of medium density; darker green in color with flecks of purple. I didn&#39;t find it to be the stoniest of strains but like a fine wine or ale, it&#39;s all about flavor and aroma. This is usually the strain I treat myself to when I need something a little nicer after a long day. Looks great, smells great, tastes great. Golden Pineapple is a winner.

VGolden Pineapple is a lovely sativa-dominant hybrid that will have you salivating upon first whiff of its enticing, tropical aroma that distinctly resembles pineapple and carries on into the flavor as well. Few strains achieve an odor this unique and tasty, and its part of what makes Golden Pineapple a 5-star strain. The other factor of course, is the high; this sativa isn&#39;t so much psychedelic like I usually prefer my sativas but gives a really euphoric, energetic boost that is complemented by a relaxing but not sedating body high. I find it useful for any ailment as well. Definitely get your hands on some of this.

The bud&#39;s appearance is absolutely beautiful with it&#39;s incredibly frosted leaves and vibrant green hue, it&#39;s likely to surprise you when you open the jar for the first time. It&#39;s smell is very strong, so if you leave home with it and weed&#39;s not too widely accepted where you live I&#39;d suggest keeping this packed up well to hide the smell or just leave it at home. The smell is amazing though. It does smell a lot like pineapple, but with an icy end to the scent that&#39;s very pleasant and may surprise you. It&#39;s a very unique smelling strain and for that I give it a lot of respect for it&#39;s originality.

VPicked up some, grown by Phat Panda.  26.1% THCA 0.2% CBD. This stuff is amazing, was glad when they restocked at my fave 21+. The aroma upon opening jar is unreal, smells like the tropics, fruity, sweet. The smoke through bong is smooth, and the taste is smooth and sweet as well. After 2 hits, I was very pleasantly high, relaxed. After a few more hits, more  warmth, waves of euphoria,  &quot;contempt but fully aware&quot;. Could do stuff, or not.  So I watched last night&#39;s The Walking Dead. HIGHLY Recommend this strain to all longtime smokers, you won&#39;t be disappointed

VThis is one of the best smelling strains. The citrus scent practically punched me in the face when I opened the container. The bud is beautiful - lots of crystallization and bright green leaves. The smoke has a lingering sweet taste and was very smooth. The high came on incredibly fast and strong - I found my stream of consciousness was pretty clear and I flowed through my writer&#39;s block like it was nothing. Towards the end of the high I did some hoop flow and it felt amazing, I was able to relax and stream together moves a lot more smoothly. Another time, I was able to clean my house (and have a nice long nap afterwards). The climax was a heady euphoric feeling that left me giggling at everything. Coming down, I was left with a very relaxed &#39;everything is going to be alright&#39; feel for hours. The downsides were the dry eye, which happens toward the end (but some clear eyes had me feeling much better). Vision response will be a bit slow. The dry mouth comes a little after the high. And it is DRY MOUTH. I suggest drinking water and/or chewing gum to keep it at bay while you smoke.

VGot a really nice sample of this, Great frosty lime green with orange hairs. Very satisfying sour pineapple aroma in a tropical somewhat hazy background.  26% THC in this sample. Taste and smoke are pretty thick and coat your mouth well. Vape definitely delivers the fresh quality of the aroma for the first few good hits. The potency makes itself known pretty quick and each hit seems to get you higher. Definitely a good relaxed stoned quality with a nice light electricity seemingly flowing through my muscles, particularly around my lower back. Mind feels calm and focused, kinda renewed and up for anything even though I worked eight hours and  commuted for another one and did some chores. A lot of the tension and anxiety I had been carrying in the background of my mind seem distant now and less disturbing, not like I am checked out, but just have some perspective and peace to see things more clearly. Really really nice sativa/indica harmony going on effects wise. Not sure what&#39;s not to like about this one.

Very high THC content can induce energy and/or sleepiness.\u000aUsage: Smoke bowls, have a good time. \u000aLook/Feel: Emerald green, medium large buds with thick, long orange-red hairs, coated with many large crystals.\u000aSmell: Smoky, savory, fresh carrots.\u000aTaste/Smoke: Hint of sweetness like heirloom carrots.

Golden pineapple fits my description perfectly. Also, My wife has been going through chemo for the last 18 months and it has its fair share of side effects( nausea, loss of appetite, pain etc.).  Golden Pineapple has been the best strain for her. It kills the nausea and makes her hungry!  Best of all, She is able to go about her daily life feeling healthy, hungry and happy! This strain does it all!\u000a\u000a

VI got a gram of this from Cannabis Culture. The bud is glowing as I shine the light from my phone on it, the flick of orange really make this bud look nice. \u000aThe smell of this bud will make you think of a sunny holiday you had. The sweet smell of that refreshing fruity pineapple will make you want to eat it. As I break it up into my grinder the fruity smell becomes more powerful. It busts up pretty nice, it sticks together real well too. The fruity smell brings a calming and refreshing vibe over me. \u000a\u000aI smoked a bowl of this strain and at first I was a little bit like \u2018is that all you got Goldie?\u201d bit jaysus hey, such a smoke! \u000aI was feeling pressure behind my eyes so nice that it was like a head massage! This strain took me floating away and had me glued to the T.V! The euphoria I got from this was so nice. It made me feel so happy and stress free. Not a care in the world! \u000a\u000aI did get very paranoid for about half and hour after I smoked a second bowl. The euphoria took over me and my mind went racing! After an hour I settled into a happy lump on the couch with a smile on my face. \u000a\u000aGood in small amounts for me. This strain has some bite in it! \u000a\u000acouch&gt;\u000a

Vwith so many hybrid strains out there, sometimes it&#39;s hard to differentiate between them, but this one&#39;s a standout. just the right amount of energizing; you won&#39;t get too caught up in your thoughts, but no danger of nodding out either. it&#39;s a creative strain, but in that hybrid-y way, where you get ideas without any sense of urgency or jitteriness. the kicker is that this is what I call a &#39;social&#39; strain; confident, no paranoia - a perfect strain for going out dancing!

VYummy! This strain is so tasty; it tastes like a juicy pineapple and even made my mouth water like a starburst. The high is a nice combination of spacy and creative that makes you completely forget any aches and pains. Solid strain for new to moderate smokers. I love Phat Panda&#39;s cut of it.

VThis strain has a very fresh and clean taste. It creates great energy and attitude. Its one of the top strains I&#39;ve had with compressed and fragrant buds. I only vaporize for health benefits. I have an inflammatory neuromuscular orphan disease. It&#39;s called CSS. My CSS is systemic and causes 24/7 extreme burning of my skin and muscle spasms with chronic fatigue.

VHonestly I&#39;m pretty new to the wonderful world of Cannabis. This strain immediately became my top favorite due to its easy going aroma, smooth smoke and uplifting effects. And being so new I definitely knew it was an easy smoke because I didn&#39;t even cough. Also a great strain for waking up and starting the day whether it be going to work or running errands.

Like other reviewers mention the initial burst of tropical flavors is amazing. Sparks up nice and even and is smooth. Don&#39;t be fooled, at around 23% it packs a nice punch even for people who smoke often. Nice mellow buzz. Didn&#39;t find myself digging through the snack cupboard either which is nice sometimes. Nice cerebral buzz that makes doing chores more relaxing. I wouldn&#39;t call this a couch lock bud but it&#39;s good for if you want to just chill too. I&#39;ll buy again.

VThis stuff rocks. Do I have to tell you that? So delicious, incredible smell, fun vape. I feel bright from it, but it needs to be savored. Too much and that marijuana malaise sets in. It&#39;s so good it can seduce you into going too far. My favorite is to mix this with Super Lemon Haze (western cultured is best, others not so good). Mixing them seems to cancel out the negatives of each and I just get a nice, energetic experience all around.  Good for pain if I kick a little high CBD strain in there.

VFor sure a top 5 favorite. Very cerebral and euphoric high that still provides some pain relief when needed. The effects are slightly delayed, but probably not enough for me to call it a creeper. The taste and smell is incredible. Has a hazy undertone that is layered with a sweet and sour pineapple citrus smell. When smelled up close it can smell quite resinous, almost like a fresh cut pine tree.

VGolden Pineapple is an all-around beautiful example of a great sativa strain. The tropical fruity aroma and flavor make it an incredibly pleasant smoke which produces a potent mix of all the uplifting cerebral effects you look for in a sativa strain. However, it&#39;s potency can produce some more lazy, indica-like effects in high dosage, so you might want to be careful about over-indulging if you&#39;re new to the strain!

VThis is not a strain for lightweights. I smoked way too much of this in conjunction with a lesser quality weed of an unknown origin. I was extremely high and ate too many brownies (just regular brownies) and felt so sick that I scared my friend who was also way too high and made her throw up. Was fun until it was too much to handle. The whole room was moving and I was so cold and not happy. I thought I&#39;d never be not high again. When I finally stumbled home I got into bed and had the best sleep of my life.

Damn, this jar is filled to the brim, mostly one big nug... it&#39;s fluffy but a bit on the dry side. loaded in trics and tiny crystals. smells almost just like pineapple express but the flower has a more mellow &quot;burn&quot; on the tongue (I eat my flowers, just a tiny taste) these gorgeous orange trics look as if they are smiling with me. \u000asmooth and fruity on both the inhale and exhale. very tingly and cerebral. feels pretty creative and I&#39;m enjoying it

VJust picked up some of this in a concentrate and it was so amazing I needed to do a review. The stuff I picked up was a sugar wax that was absolutely beautiful bright golden yellow not dark at all and sooo sparkly. The smell was amazing to just like fresh buds with pineapple notes that really jump out and the flavor was about the same as the smell very citrus very fresh pineapple tasting. Then the high is perfect for daytime use at first I&#39;d say that it&#39;s very upper body I feel it in my temples and forehead, and in my neck and behind the eyes that deffinetly gets much more pronounced the more you smoke. There&#39;s a big boost of energy usually associated with sativas along with a burst in creativity and motivation I really love this strain it&#39;s TOP SHELF in every way.

Flavor is good, but sweetness may vary be region and time of year. Definitely a good &quot;cuddle on the couch with the dog&quot; kind of smoke.

VI got a gram of this from Cannabis Culture. The bud is glowing as I shine the light from my phone on it, the flick of orange really make this bud look nice. \u000aThe smell of this bud will make you think of a sunny holiday you had. The sweet smell of that refreshing fruity pineapple will make you want to eat it. As I break it up into my grinder the fruity smell becomes more powerful. It busts up pretty nice, it sticks together real well too. The fruity smell brings a calming and refreshing vibe over me. \u000a\u000aI smoked a bowl of this strain and at first I was a little bit like \u2018is that all you got Goldie?\u201d bit jaysus hey, such a smoke! \u000aI was feeling pressure behind my eyes so nice that it was like a head massage! This strain took me floating away and had me glued to the T.V! The euphoria I got from this was so nice. It made me feel so happy and stress free. Not a care in the world! \u000a\u000aI did get very paranoid for about half and hour after I smoked a second bowl. The euphoria took over me and my mind went racing! After an hour I settled into a happy lump on the couch with a smile on my face. \u000a\u000aGood in small amounts for me. This strain has some bite in it! \u000a\u000acouch&gt;\u000a

VGot a really nice sample of this, Great frosty lime green with orange hairs. Very satisfying sour pineapple aroma in a tropical somewhat hazy background.  26% THC in this sample. Taste and smoke are pretty thick and coat your mouth well. Vape definitely delivers the fresh quality of the aroma for the first few good hits. The potency makes itself known pretty quick and each hit seems to get you higher. Definitely a good relaxed stoned quality with a nice light electricity seemingly flowing through my muscles, particularly around my lower back. Mind feels calm and focused, kinda renewed and up for anything even though I worked eight hours and  commuted for another one and did some chores. A lot of the tension and anxiety I had been carrying in the background of my mind seem distant now and less disturbing, not like I am checked out, but just have some perspective and peace to see things more clearly. Really really nice sativa/indica harmony going on effects wise. Not sure what&#39;s not to like about this one.

VThis is one of the best smelling strains. The citrus scent practically punched me in the face when I opened the container. The bud is beautiful - lots of crystallization and bright green leaves. The smoke has a lingering sweet taste and was very smooth. The high came on incredibly fast and strong - I found my stream of consciousness was pretty clear and I flowed through my writer&#39;s block like it was nothing. Towards the end of the high I did some hoop flow and it felt amazing, I was able to relax and stream together moves a lot more smoothly. Another time, I was able to clean my house (and have a nice long nap afterwards). The climax was a heady euphoric feeling that left me giggling at everything. Coming down, I was left with a very relaxed &#39;everything is going to be alright&#39; feel for hours. The downsides were the dry eye, which happens toward the end (but some clear eyes had me feeling much better). Vision response will be a bit slow. The dry mouth comes a little after the high. And it is DRY MOUTH. I suggest drinking water and/or chewing gum to keep it at bay while you smoke.

I recently lost my apartment and I am now living in my car until I find an apartment and so it\u2019s hard to feel happy, but this strain really does it. I don\u2019t get tired, I have more energy, and it lifts my mood. Only con about it dry mouth. Highly recommend this strain if you need a mood booster!

Vwith so many hybrid strains out there, sometimes it&#39;s hard to differentiate between them, but this one&#39;s a standout. just the right amount of energizing; you won&#39;t get too caught up in your thoughts, but no danger of nodding out either. it&#39;s a creative strain, but in that hybrid-y way, where you get ideas without any sense of urgency or jitteriness. the kicker is that this is what I call a &#39;social&#39; strain; confident, no paranoia - a perfect strain for going out dancing!

VSlapping a five star rating down on another phenomenal product from Phat Panda. This stuff is like candy! Super sticky buds pack nicely and smoke even better. Like other reviewers mention the initial burst of tropical flavors is amazing. Sparks up nice and even and is smooth. Don&#39;t be fooled, at around 23% it packs a nice punch even for people who smoke often. Nice mellow buzz. Didn&#39;t find myself digging through the snack cupboard either which is nice sometimes. Nice cerebral buzz that makes doing chores more relaxing. I wouldn&#39;t call this a couch lock bud but it&#39;s good for if you want to just chill too. I&#39;ll buy again.

VHonestly I&#39;m pretty new to the wonderful world of Cannabis. This strain immediately became my top favorite due to its easy going aroma, smooth smoke and uplifting effects. And being so new I definitely knew it was an easy smoke because I didn&#39;t even cough. Also a great strain for waking up and starting the day whether it be going to work or running errands.

VI got some that was about 32% THC-A. Initially I thought &quot;damn, this shit is gonna get me too high!&quot; I took a snap and indeed, it slapped me hard in the face right away. Too my satisfaction, it was a wonderfully euphoric high. Laughing and feeling great. I would recommend grabbing a gram if you get the chance. You&#39;ll wind up going back for more!

VFantastic... one of my top 10 strains. Lots of others will comment about flavor, and it is no doubt great, but you will see that on your own. The effect: This hybrid is far more pronounced in the sativa spectrum. Expect creative energy and general happy feeling. Great for social smoking.  The Golden Goat genetic heritage bleeds over into making this a decent workout strain, but this strain is best saved for spending the day at the beach in the hot sun, swimming in the ocean. You can&#39;t help but have a good time! The Pineapple Kush terpenes also balence out that of the Golden Goat, minimalizing paranoia in users (myself) who are sensitive to Pinene (if you don&#39;t Jack Herer, for example).

VMay be the worst weed I&#39;ve ever smoked, so of course the first time I buy an ounce of something and its this crap... Also this weed was 100$ more then most oz size. Pineapple kush 200$ oz, golden pineapple 350 and its garbage. The high was alright nothing was funny nothing really felt good it was just kinda loke cool I&#39;m high now and then 35 munutes later the high is completely gone, i also know my despensary only buys from the higgest quality growers. The dispencary is barbary coast San Francisco amazing place! But golden pineaplle you suck, save yohr money and buy something better like green ribbon or red dragon, better high almosy same level thc. Tjays another thing the golden pineapple i had was 25.67% Thc and still sucked. So dissapointing :/

VTaste and smell is on point.\u000a\u000aThis is one of those strains that makes you wonder what the point was in smoking it. The high is really underwhelming. At its best, it feels a little like being on a tropical island where you don&#39;t have a care in the world but are also wondering wtf to do with your day. At its worst, it&#39;s mediocrity just pisses you off. The high is slightly floaty and fuzzy with an edge of anxiety, like a sugar high. Just irritating to be on.\u000a\u000aI could not unload the rest of my stash on two of my other friends, it was that bad.\u000a\u000aThe gram I bought was Phat Panda, super fluffy nugs that make it look twice the size of a usual gram.
