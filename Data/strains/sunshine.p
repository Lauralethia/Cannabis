VWow! fantastic strain. Just picked this one up and I have to agree 100% with babygoddess&#39;s review. Works great with bipolar/depression. It puts you in a great place and wipes out your worries. Definitely my new fav.

Vi got this strain mainly bc it was the best sativa at the dispensary i purchased at. thank god for that bc i fell in love with this strain. i have been very depressed, fatigue &amp; unable to focus on my homework. this morning i started it off with the sunshine and now it\u2019s 2:00p &amp; i\u2019ve accomplished more than i have the past 2 weeks!! highly recommend if you need a mood booster &amp; help focusing!

VWhile I often prefer Indica over Sativa, I always love good weed of any kind. Sunshine was good weed. While this might sound strange, Sunshine was one of those strains that it quickly becomes obvious how it got its name. Upon exhale, you get this very tropical, smooth aftertaste that reminds you of a sunny day. That&#39;s the way the buzz hits you. It isn&#39;t racing like some other strains, it&#39;s more like &quot;Damn, I feel great!&quot; kind of feeling.

VWhat a strain to wake up to. so energetic and mentally stimulating. going on a walk everything seems super interesting. shapes, patterns, color combinations... on the edge of being psychedelic.  but instead of being fogged in like with some strains it&#39;s a really clearly observable effect. kept me awake through the night with flashing random thoughts in bed. activities of any kind- oh hell yeah. bedtime.... not possible.

VAwesome strain.  I got my hand on private grow, the buds were soft, sticky and a light green, like pea soup. It ground well, and is one hell of a high.  The Ssn I used to getting was a bud that was hard not stick, they were a different green, like it had been in the bottom of the. Grind it was small hard piece like oregano. Never going back to the dispensary.

VThis was surprisingly good under the circumstances. I got the &#39;baker&#39;s batch&#39; from my local dispensary. The 1 oz glass jar was the trim/shake but you could tell that the tri-combs were baked right in as you could smell it and it got me pretty high. I&#39;d give it a 7.5 to 8 (out of 10) on the high scale. A very smooth strain. Worth the purchase as I got the glass jar ounce for only $125. This is a good strain to pass amongst friends. The &#39;baker&#39;s batch&#39; jar I got was from Pahrump Nevada.

VAbsolutely incredible!! I picked it up because of the name and it did not disappoint. This strain is amazing. It brightens up your day like the midday sun. Soon you\u2019ll be feeling the days end. Wonderful day time strain, but wouldn\u2019t recommend for wake-n-bake, especially those with a low tolerance. Potent stuff, wonderful effects. Safe in small doses if you get anxiety easily from sativas; however I do recommend for those who suffer from anxiety problems. I would buy again.
