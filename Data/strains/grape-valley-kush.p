VI got a batch that was 30 % thc. I smoke daily and this strain was AMAZING for my back pain. By the time I was done with 2 bowls, I was already on my bed thinking of nothing but pure bliss.

VJust.... DAMN!! Tried this on the recommendation of my budtender. I was suffering from major levels of pain on a multi-system level. After a decent sized bowl of Grape Valley, I didn\u2019t feel a THING for the rest of the night and, I went right to sleep a few hours later. My batch tested at 24.97%. This is my new favorite strain!!

VOMG!! One of my favorite strains for sure!! The relaxing high is so amazing! At one point, all I could do was sit on my couch and laugh, because my entire body felt like it was literally vibrating. Do yourself a favor and pick up some of this beautiful product.

VThe feeling hits just a few minutes after smoking. Totally relaxed and all stress has dissolved. Great for anxiety and difficulty relaxing. First time ever smoking this strain and I already know that this will be added to the rotation lol Has a great flavor, you can totally get the berry and fruitiness, even as a fairly new smoker with what I would call \u201ca pallet in training\u201d.

VBest indica strain ever. When I first get a hand on this I grab a gram from my favorites dispensary in Reno. Omg it was 32% thc. I always vape my weed trusted me this grape valley kush from shango is outstanding. Test good hit good and feel good. Every hit I inhaled I feel all kush favor on my lip like it so oily. Also it feel like you smoke weed for the first time even im daily smoker. If you see it at wherever u go to don\u2019t missed it!!!! And you will know what am I talking about

VMoxie PA :) Going into this experience I am anxious having a little bit of an anxiety ridden day so let\u2019s hope it takes rid of that. Looks super sugary due to the high Cannabinoids. Taking a smaller dab of course due to this as well. And &#128168;\u2014  I feel my anxiety leave instantly. My breathing and the chest tightness gets much better. I feel my mind thinking more fluidly in a wavy way. Very euphoric. I feel very uplifted I feel happy I feel ready for whatever I have to take on next definitely helped with my stomach relaxing a little bit really helped with my PTSD symptoms it also truly helps with mood elevation. \u000a.\u000a.\u000a.\u000aThis is much more euphoric than the Viper city OG that is definitely more of a strain that brings me to a peaceful state not as much euphoria and then the Jesus OG I say would be between this euphoria and that. So this definitely has the most euphoric most uplifting effects of any of the Moxie Indicas I\u2019ve tried. For me that\u2019s usually what I go with so being able to get the strains that are not only going to provide me with the anti anxiety  but also provide me with great euphoria and feeling great at the same time that\u2019s really hard to find so again I am thoroughly impressed with this strain and how amazing their extraction is to get such a high level of cannabinoids. 95.15%\u000a.\u000a.\u000a.\u000aIt makes things just more chill, life comes at you slower. Things are more relaxed and truly a happy , uplifting , euphoric , relaxing and super chill experience. \u2764\ufe0f &#127815; &#127815; &#127815; &#128168;

VThis flower grown by, Shango, is amazing.. Lime green core covered by dark green and purple frosted buds.. Very pleasant, sweet, light berries and sweet grapes kept my nose in the jar. The smoke is smooth and tasty, hits the room and rips through the house. The high is very soothing and relieving, focused but euphoric and happy. Definitely my favorite Kush..

VPicked this one up at Blum on Desert Inn. This strain has a very subtle, soft grape smell to it. It is sedative and gives you a nice body high. I smoked it on my bubbler, a whole bowl to myself mind you. Once I went to bed, that was it for me! Try this strain if it&#39;s available at any dispensary in your city!
