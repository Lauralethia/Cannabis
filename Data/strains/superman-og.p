VNot even Kryptonite could strip this new found treasure from me. Solid A+ mind &amp; body numbing Indica. The &quot;chill pill&quot; that I&#39;ve be craving. Great smelling skunky weed with an insane taste and better buzz. This strain is fantastic and strong, like bull.

VAmazing for pain and sleep.  It hits fast and it hits hard.  Not much can completely take away the pain in my feet from neuropathy but this does.  Stock snacks and lots of water then be ready for a nice long snooze.  Great night time med for me.

V[Superman OG x Orangebud is not listed in leafly - as &quot;SuperOrange OG&quot;]\u000aSticky green buds with outward, expressed leaves covered in a beautiful array of trichromes. Smell is piney, maybe more of a earthy/woody pungency? High creeps up over the back of your shoulders with an increasingly heavy onset behind the eyes. Probably not the best strain for patients suffering with migraines or headaches. Very relaxed, deep indica high over the duration that leaves you in state of zen.

Also I mostly smoke wax, but I picked up a gram of Superman OG &amp; it makes me feel great.  immediate relaxation, buzz hangs around for few hours.  Definitely try it if you can find it.

VFirst of WOW. I never thought I would find the perfect indica but after smoking this delicious strain I have been proven wrong. At first I didn&#39;t feel all that much and then... After a few minutes it hit me and my back pain was completely gone and so was my mind. I feel spacey but in a soft cloudy kind of way (idk if that makes any sense at all) and I feel like my body is totally numb from pain it&#39;s great! I suffer from Tourette&#39;s and this helps so much with my tics and muscle spasms! Just a truly great strain.

VI recently got a clone,at first when I harvested it and trimmed it I thought I made a mistake cuz it looked exactly like hindu kush but it looked different when growing,after smoking it I realized the flavor was different,Its a very heavy indica like hindu kush but a sweeter flavor and bigger buds!

VSuper strong, delicious, piney. I think this strain would be excellent for insomnia because I was asleep in less than ten minutes. I personally use cannabis for severe nausea , even though I wasn&#39;t awake to feel it , it helped enough to fall asleep. Definitely a strain to use before bed, not to wake up with.

Vthe perfect indica. exactly what you think of when you think of smoking weed. super chilled out, but not dead asleep. wicked high, but not too in my head an panicky. I was able to think coherently and creatively. definitely perfect for musicians or artists. I had such an amazing night. Picked up a ton for reserve. Don&#39;t want this to go extinct on me!

VIn the beginning I was a little skeptical On smoking this strain during the day, as it was described to be a somewhat potent Indica strain that is strictly for nighttime use. (from leafly app). Anyways, I smoked it first thing today and I got a nice heavy body buzz but also a slight head high.  I didn&#39;t fall asleep on it, in fact I got the giggles. Very potent, smoke with caution.

VSuperman OG provides the extremely calming effects of both Bubba Kush and Tahoe OG. When I first saw that my local dispensary had this strain I was fairly excited to get it! The buds were fairly small and very tight and it vaped pretty well. I can definitely say that this strain is one of those strains to try if you are in need of pain relief and/or in need of sleep. This strain will put you on your ass if you aren&#39;t paying attention and falling asleep is a very easy thing to do on this strain. A MUST TRY for indica lovers~

VI bet you thought I was gonna it&#39;s a bird, it&#39;s a plane!! I just read your thoughts!!\u000aOn another note, this ain&#39;t no pussified, pink panty wearing, joke of a Superman like Dean Cain. No, this is a MANS Superman like played by actor George Reeves. He didn&#39;t snap his neck fallin off no horse like that other pussy superman either!! No sir, smoked a fist full of lucky strikes every morning upon arousal. He ate 4 slaps of baby back ribs with a screwdriver for breakfast. He sexually harassed 8 women a day on the way to the bus, which didn&#39;t include his rapey comments on the inbetween. He was born the same day WWI broke out. He only got paid 10 dollars an episode for Superman, and that was only because he let Camera Man 1 stick his finger in his bum. I mean why&#39;s that in his contract?!?\u000a\u000aSo faster than a speeding bullet, more powerfull than a locomotive [which is an &#39;80 dance, duh nubes] and so on, this Superman died in prison from 30 angry Sarah Palin precons giving kryptonite douple penniz, wink wink!
