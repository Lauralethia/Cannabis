VThis has been a great strain for me. I have occipital Neuralgia and has helped immensely. Definitely an indica with a very calming nature. Night time strain only..

VSnow Monster is a pretty solid nighttime Indica for those that don&#39;t want couch lock, but still want a good body high. Smooth taste, and smoke. Not bad.

VSnow Monster is great...just make sure you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to go before partaking, because this was less, &quot;Oh wow, do I feel relaxed!&quot; and way more &quot;Hey, my pain is gone, I feel great, I feel *sleeping*&quot; and waking up 10 hours later. The pain lessening effects are no joke though, this made my pain a distant feeling, and had a very happy tone, but it knocked me on my ass. Going to take on nights where sleep is too hard to come by without assistance.

VI love this strain, if your looking for a nice Indica to relax then this is a must try. It smokes great, huge beautiful crystallized buds that just smell great! Stuff had me stupid right after the first hit 5 stars all the way! Seems to help me best with Pain, Spams, Depression &amp; Anxiety.

VMaker: Driftboat\u000aTotal Cannaboids: 18.22%\u000aLots of terpenes in this one. The smell was overwhelmingly beautiful. The hit was smooth and the taste was delicious. Great strain for unwinding and/or for sleep aid. Highly recommended
