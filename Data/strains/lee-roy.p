VNew England Treatment Access (NETA) \u000aLee Roy: Batch 133\u000a\u000aTAC: 25.1%  THC-A: 22.2%  THC: 1.4%  CBD-A:0.1%  CBG-A: 1.0% CBG: 0.3%\u000a\u000aNETA lists this flower as a hybrid/Sativa which contradicts Leafly and Allbud as they both state Indica hybrid.\u000a\u000aDark forest green with dark orange pistils, nice coating of fine white trichomes. Smells of forest or woodsy with notes of pepper as well. Tastes of peppercorn and slight pine pull through followed by a ceder like taste on the exhale.\u000a\u000aThis flower puts you in a nice cerebral high with some energy and creativity. Not overwhelming by any means and did not bring on any paranoia or anxiety. I recommend this strain as a daytime/morning strain to boost your energy and get the brain thinking clearly.

VAlthough it was only sold in grams, I was highly impressed!!! This strand does alllll it says. And I would add that its a great sleep aid for those who have nerve damage. Also, helps focus any person. So I wouldn&#39;t let the ADD turn you away. Extreme multitaskers, procrastinators and even cancer patients can benefit greatly!!! Kudos to the breeder!!!

VShocked and disgusted this strain only has 16 now 17 reviews... likes Scotts OG this is the more flavorful of the RD Triangle Kush Crosses v the more potent Scott&#39;s, on occasion. This has a soft flavor of lime and a slight Chemy flavor. Great for when I&#39;m nauseated or my arthritis is flared up or I have any inflammation at all. Another of my favorites from Rare Dankness

VI love it.. But you are listing it as Indica Hybrid.  A couple of reviews cite other sources and list an analysis that indicates Sativa.  I took it before bed and stayed up all night solving the problems of the world.\u000aMy internal dope meter points strongly to the Sativa side.  \u000a   May NOT cause drowsiness ... (lol) .. its great for body pains  and wonderful for depression -- calming, uplifting and euphoria...\u000a  Perhaps Leafly could cite their research, because I do believe this should be reclassified.  Forgive any mis-spellings ... I&#39;m Lee Roy&#39;ed.  &lt;)\u000a\u000aYou know how ants zig-zag around. Well this little ant found a drop of water in a spoon on my desk into which a chuck of half-smoked Lry had fallen. The littler guy drank his fill and then crawled STRAIGHT away. This s**t can take the zig out of ants.  Now if Lry were Indica, the little dope fiend ant would be asleep on his spoon.

VLoved this one! I\u2019m not usually an indica smoker but I bought some of this shake today. Ok, we all know shake is weaker than prime bud, but this was a real good deal and a great high... and I have been smoking Chem Dawg for the last week... would definitely purchase more...

VThis strain is great! After the first hit, I was instantly not stressed out anymore. I felt calm for the first time in weeks. It doesn\u2019t make me drowsy or make me feel lazy like other Indica\u2019s. My pain is mostly gone, but I also feel like being productive. Having said that, I agree with the statement \u201cit should be classified a Sativa hybrid.\u201d.
