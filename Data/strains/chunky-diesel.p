VI&#39;ve been missing this strain since I tried it in Denver, glad to see it pop up in Chicago. One of the best diesels around; dense/purple nugs with excellent resin content. The smell is as punchy as Sour Diesel, but with more coffee/chocolate notes. The flavor has sweet elements in amongst the funk, nice distracting experience.

VChunky Diesel smokes a lot like Chemdawg... particularly indica leaning dawg phenos. Clear headed, functional and still nice and stoney.

VAs a Diesel lover &#128154; .... I could not pass up trying this strain !!! \u000aFrom the first hit , it was love &#128522;&#128154;\u270c&#127997; . You can taste the subtle chocolate &#127851; undertones . The Diesel is there , but not too overpowering. \u000a\u000aThe Grove produced this batch ~ the testing info is : \u000aTHCA - 22.71 %   D9THC : 0.81%   CBDA: 0.06% \u000a\u000aMyercene : 0.834 mg/g \u000aLimonene: 0.472 mg/g \u000aLinalool : 0.341 mg/ g \u000a\u000aThe buds did not have the most eye appeal , and the trimming could be a bit better , but it was definitely worth trying , and I will be on the look out for more Chunky D &#128523;&#128077;&#127996;&#127851; \u000a

VI\u2019m a big fan of Sour Diesel, so my dispensary told me about Chunky Diesel. The characteristic diesel smell was apparent as soon as I opened the package. The smoke was earthy, and smooth. I used this strain right before I went to workout and it provided me with a consistent energy boost throughout. The mix of the indica deep chunk also helped my muscle recovery. I would recommend this strain for someone who is looking for an energy boost, coupled with a mood stimulant. Good strain overall!

VI smoke a lot of strains and often don&#39;t buy a particular strain more than once. Chunky Diesel is in our regular rotation for hybrids. It&#39;s not my favorite, but it&#39;s a crowd pleaser for sure... I know that with Chunky Diesel, everyone will enjoy it and have a good time. The way it hits me is almost like a very chill, more balanced Headband. There&#39;s a burst of mental energy and mood lifting, and it settles into a calm, relaxing high that isn&#39;t too sleepy. Obviously with a cross between Afghani and Diesel, the taste and smell are very good.

VIllinois THC around 23%. This is probably my favorite day time strain. It&#39;s strong even though the potency is sometime not as strong as other, the combo of whatever terps make up this plant is a big win. However it is very smelly , don&#39;t be surprise if your neighbors next door can smell it , and the smell lingers for a very long time

VGreat hybrid, does not give you couch lock but will allow you to relax enough to go to sleep if you choose. I enjoy the fact that this can be smoked first thing in the morning and does not make me,tired. Great taste and Cresco offers in a great deal of shake with nice chunks of kief for a great price.

VI tried Chunky Diesel pre-roll shorites by Cresco and lordt I&#39;m pleased. I&#39;d describe the taste as being that of marijuana. It&#39;s a pleasant taste, but nothing to write a blog about. The high is relaxing and euphoric. Perfect for long trips. 10/10 would smoke again. &#128077;&#128077;
