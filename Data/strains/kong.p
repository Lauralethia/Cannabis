Vnow I know why its name is Kong, its potent and packs a punch. To me Kong is more of a indica which I like. I was relieved of all pain in my body, but awake enough to do homework for school. Definitely a must try if you can find it. I got mine at Nature Herbs in Colorado.

VKong is king! This is an amazing indica dominant hybrid with dense colorful buds. The aroma is reminiscent of a diesel strain as well as the flavor. Three hits in and I&#39;m feeling a tingly warm body high and extremely relaxed. This would be a great strain for pain relief. Recommended with a comfy couch... enjoy!

VI would say the &quot;strain attributes&quot; for this strain are spot on. It makes you feel relaxed and helps with pain, I have bad back issues and it helps with a good amount of the pain. I also have felt very lazy and sleepy. I smoked this out of a bubbler and it was very smooth. The actual flower was pretty dry. Overall, the high was very mellow and relaxing. I would recommend this to someone who is having a hard time sleeping or has issues with pain to use at night.

There was not much of a &#39;head high&#39; to speak of, but the general euphoria and buzz you&#39;d expect from a hybrid strain is still there. I will definitely buy this strain again.

VA Deeply Sweet pineapple and mint smoke. Smooth and not intensely coughing at all. Impact on head can be intense especially when dabbing. The unset of head change is almost immediately. Definitely had moment where I had to pause and reflect to myself that I was really high. Body is very relaxed and a couple times I did feel hot and lethargic but doesn&#39;t last long. Great on pain and is a appetite stimulator completely. Recommend to any solid smoker.

VKiller Ganja! Kong delivers in every category beginning with looks! This is one of the most absolutely gorgeous buds to lay your eyes on as these colorful hairy buds are covered in thc resin crystals. The smell is pungunt and zesty and can cause your mouth to water just smelling it. The flavor brings it all together with a tasty smoke and relaxing high that is mellow without being too body heavy, but just right.

The smell is a bit skunky with a nice, mellow woody taste. Not hard on the chest at all and leaves you high in just a couple of puffs.

It&#39;s a very potent one, but you can never really smoke too much of it - I&#39;ve actually tried for curiosities&#39; sake.

Kong is very elating, and it got rid of my stomach pain almost entirely. There was not much of a &#39;head high&#39; to speak of, but the general euphoria and buzz you&#39;d expect from a hybrid strain is still there. I will definitely buy this strain again.

VWow, what a bud. This stuff will knock you on your ass within moments of sparking up a bowl. The folks at Holy Smoke Seeds definitely created something genuinely awesome here with this indica dominant Hybrid strain. It hits smooth but punches hard. It&#39;s fragrance is copacetic, but the taste can be a bit rough. It&#39;s like licking some pine sap straight out of a tree.\u000a\u000aBut I definitely slept really well the 2 nights I had it...and that was just off of a 0.75 g bottle of shake.
