VI grew two phenotypes of this strain, and tried the 1st pheno last night and got completely STONED. The one that I tried grew small loose airy buds with very dark orange hairs and a faint citrus smell. Not much taste, and after 3 to 4 hits and no feeling at all, was wondering how good it was, but then BAM it started in the face and alternated body head, but mostly head and very very STONED. EXCELLENT.. The 2nd pheno grew a larger bud with purple and pine green color and I will review that one next..

VSativas are not my favorite.  I suffer from high anxiety, so this strain had me a little paranoid. I smoked a bowl in my bong before going into work and at first I was very talkative and productive.  After a few hours went by I started to feel how I feel with any Sativa.  A little paranoid, anxious, slight headache, and very hungry.  Overall pretty nice high.  It would have been better if I brought more to smoke on my lunch.

VOne of my favourite Sativa strains at this time.. I picked this up solely for daytime use to treat anxiety. Before anyone says anything about using Sativa for Anxiety, if you use a moderate to low dose, it\u2019s perfect such a use. The batch I currently have is crystal coated, hand trimmed, and beautifully dried and cured. The smell is very pungent with heavy notes of citrus and spice. The flavour is sweet and almost fruity with a hint of spice. Effects are very much on the Sativa side of things with enough northern lights genetics to keep it from being too racy. It is perfect for keeping my mind off the negative thoughts and worries I often deal with while still giving me the energy and motivation to go about my day.  Even in a higher dose, this strain really helps my anxiety and worries. Love it.

VAmazingly unique smooth taste and very clear headed uplifting effects, found it functional for the day. \u000aNo drowsy feelings or sleepiness with this one, being that it&#39;s actually a bit energetic. \u000aWhile energetic it did not induce any sort of racy feelings that can sometimes produce anxiety.\u000aOne of the best sativa dominant strains for producing true sativa effects.

VThis strain is known as a precursor to the heavy hitter Strawberry Cough, known as &quot;The Cough&quot;! Bud Structure: Nicely trimmed bushy Christmas tree nugs, some shaped into torpedos. Caylaxes all over this bud, like happy trichs dipped in a vat of kief. Purple spots here and there, though deep redwood oak hair&#39;s covering this nugget from head to toe. Pushing on it leaves my fingers caked in kief. The Smell: Funky skunky, and deep aged cheese brings to mind each smell some citrus tones come out in the background, the funky smell is overpowering some of the other aromas.  The Vape: Toasting this at 190C\u02da brews a heavily thick bag!\u000aThe Taste: Woodsy, very herbal, dry has the haze in here for sure. \u000aMedicinal Effects: I can feel musclues waking up to each tap of the keyboard it helps me become a little bit more creative if you have writers block happens a lot with ADHD with a combinational mood disorder like depression or stress. Gives me hope and a relaxed mind, in a statis of zen keeps me in the zone. If you also have a hard time with concentration. I usually can&#39;t get anything done if I am at home constantly. It&#39;s a mircical it actually separates categories for me so it&#39;s not in a big pile enabling me to get things done. &quot;The Cough&quot; If you are coughing lol will help with asthma, I can run longer distances while medicated especially on NLH try it, it has exhilarated me every day to enjoy being in this extremely hot weather, it could just be me, however, I&#39;ve noticed I feel one with the earth and sky at 101\u02daF that&#39;s about 39\u02daC if you live in the UK, or anywhere else where you use the Celcius scale. If you are looking for a heavy hitter to keep you going I recommend this for heavy duty hitters! I heard polish are heavy hitters this would be a good one for you. WATER! Like that SpongeBob episode when he&#39;s exposed to air. It&#39;s a must, or aloe vera\u200b does the trick as well :p stay medicated everyone gonna do one for Durban Poison Next :p.

VAs soon as I heard NL plus Haze I knew I was going to experience something special. Northern Lights is to me a straight KO indica. Mellow mood and strong bodyhigh.  Love it for pain etc.. Most Hazestrains have a bit of a racey side and can be challenging on the more anxiety ridden patient with its intense sativa-trait.\u000a\u000aThis strain is a godsend, especially for those dealing with anxietyproblems. It has that Indica feeling of painrelief and relaxation while being brainteasing and with enough of uplifting traits for a Sativa guy like me&#128526;. I&#39;m gonna shut up now since this review is becoming a book.\u000a\u000aPerfect mix in this hybrid for the best of two worlds. Also the buds are big and chunky which I like&#128512;. Tremendous flower

VIn all honesty, a well grown and cared for gem like this, can be an ethereal event. After perusing the online dispensary, which is my daily job, Out of nowhere appeared this amazing and undeniably alluring listing for N5h. I acquired a fat eighth in Palm Springs, and immediately knew I was in for an nearly psychedelic brainwash. My suspicions were not unfounded.  My experiences began in the late 70&#39;s so I have had the pleasure of enjoying fine strains over the years. I know the quality,  that the union of these originators of all great things to come in cannabis, was and is still today a caviar strain as I sit here very well baked.  I like to think of it as a nostalgic high. Took me on a trip I hadn&#39;t experienced in a very long time. It was an exceptional high that was intensely psychedelic and energizing, but I was too spaced out to move very quickly! This high made me think about walking( or should I say how to). Cerebrally, this strain is great for daytime in small doses, but the line cant be crossed or you will be completely stoned, which as I wright this, is fully setting in after almost an hour. Great long high with truly stoned effects after two bong hits. My next test is vaping to get the flavor. This will fill your throat almost instantly, and gave me that true lung expansion feeling that sometimes even surprises me. This Did just that! I love this strain! Truly high and truly stoned. Exceptional.

VI recently picked up some of this strain at a medical dispensary. It brought me back to the 1990s when both NL5 and landraces were popular. Glad to have found this herb because I remember being happy and the high was always long lasting. The NL5 definitely felt more dominant. Good strain for visiting the zoo or museum. As for my condition, it helps keep my headaches at bay.

VI tried this amazing strain last April in Amsterdam. It was my last day there with my wife and it was 10 PM. Our feet were destroyed. I found that Boerejoengens Coffe Shop and explained them that my wife and i would love to stay up another 3 or 4 hours before headin&#39; to the hotel. Well, they gave me that strain and it was perfect. I think the best weed i ever smoked...I smoke from 1988 btw :)\u000aWorth a try

VIt was back in the 90&#39;s. Closet grow. Seeds were ordered from a Vancouver shop. Plants were taller than expected. Colas were huge! Little &#39;whirlwind&#39; buds continually popping out prompting me to consider that it may never stop producing. Finally took it down. \u000aBeautiful smoke. Quite an uplifting high. Flavour was similar to NL#5 from what I remember. Great for computer work. Focused yet oblivious to all else.
