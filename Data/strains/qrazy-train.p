VThe first thing that really made this bud stand out was the density. I bought a quarter, which; after some observation, looked more like an eighth. However I put a decent sized nug in my grinder and almost an unexpected amount of bud came out. The second thing you notice is the taste. Very very earthy, but it&#39;s a nice flavor. Being more of a straight sativa man myself, this hybrid was quite fulfilling and effective. The main drawback from this strain was a sense of dizziness it gives you, however I can imagine some people enjoy that feeling. A strong 4 out of 5.

VAn extremely potent cross between Train Wreck, Trinity, Purple Urkle, and Space Queen, this hybrid  is a perfect balance of indica and sativa. The buzz starts out quickly as a cerebral and somewhat uplifting high, but then toward the end the indica effects can be felt as you sink deeper and deeper into the couchlock. The taste is often that of a grapey trainwreck, and the smell is a fruity/grape/lavendar/trainwreck aroma.  This is not a strain for beginners, so take it easy because the high can be INTENSE.

VI went back and grabbed a 1/4 after trying a gram of Qrazy Train from Grass Shack in PDX. It is a special sort of high and it knocks out the hip pain and cramping I often deal with, while not knocking me unconscious in the process. I&#39;m able to focus, but the mindspace is a bit more conceptual than functional, so I prefer it for pain relief during creative projects, light household chores (weeding is so much easier!), or just watching a movie. Seems kind of hard to find in Portland, but this would be the flower to get me to grow my own; it really ticks all the marks.

VI was feeling really anxious and scatter brained even on my way to the dispensary, and I was looking for something that would ease my anxiety without putting me straight to sleep. Qrazy Train was what the clerk suggested and after purchasing I came home and put on Pandora, Smoked a few hits of a bubbler and I was almost instantly effected. I completely calmed down and at the same time became more focused. Pretty decent head high with uplifting effects, without couch lock. Definitely Would recommend, and I myself will probably  go back and buy more :)

VThis is a really interesting hybrid.  First it looks great, next it does take a few minutes to hit and it&#39;s very relaxing and refreshing.  So you think ok, like it, and then it hits again slightly different and it&#39;s oh wtf?  I&#39;m no expert, I think this is caused by the crazy genitics and different parts hitting different times, during the first few minutes?  Anyway, I thourghly enjoyed it the train ride is Qrazy.  I recently had  surgery that hurts 24x7 this made it go away so good pain relief as well.

VI got this from Green Dragon in Lake City. I medicate for anxiety, stress, and potent headaches, and after smoking a relatively small amount of Qrazy Train I went from being frustrated and depressed with my day to being extremely happy and relaxed. I noticed a heightened sense of smell in particular - I decided to plant some tomato seedlings afterward and the potting soil smelled wonderful.

VThe first few hits have a very interesting flavor. It&#39;s earthy, but has a lot of subtle undertones that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on. Hints of diesel with hints of &quot;dirty grape.&quot; \u000a\u000aAs my palate adjusts :) and I take a moment to recover from a slight case of the giggles, the next few hits begin to bring out a sweet citrus taste with peppered earthy undertones. \u000a\u000aThis is a fantastic strain in terms of flavor and it comes with a solid high. \u000aThe high is slightly euphoric, with a touch of the spins. This strain is not a PED, by any standard. Unless doing nothing was the competition. \u000a\u000aMedicinally, keeping in mind this can only be measured from personal experience, it&#39;s not for me. It seems to give me the &quot;wobbles&quot; and I will probably take my time getting up, if and when I decide to do so. There also isn&#39;t much relief of my symptoms, but on the upside I don&#39;t care about them either. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain for its flavor variety. If you want a strain that will taste different but the same every time you step up, this is the one. \u000a\u000a*if you&#39;re reading this, please keep in mind that this &quot;critique&quot; was measured over multiple doses in a short period of time. Thanks for reading! \u000a\u000aLegalize it! And make cigarettes illegal (it&#39;ll help me quit)

It&#39;s odd to explain, but I think I&#39;ve found my new favorite strain. Cause you can relax with it when you want and focus with it when you want as well.

Prior to vaping it smells like a sweaty shirt. The skunks and citrus maybe some cheese and a whole myriad of flavors which makes it hard to explain. I really like this one and it was an awesome suggestion. A new favorite for certain.

VBrothers Cannabis Club Se Division: Crystals were clearly visible but didn&#39;t look dense and was afraid wasn&#39;t gonna have weight to them. Picked up an 1/8th for $35 (normally $45) of Qrazy Train blindly. Never heard of the strain before but the lady told me it was children to 4 strains. These flowers looked mighty fine and had a nice citrusy/orangy smell that reminded me of Orange Sherbet/Tangie. Smoked good from the bong and fairly easy to roll up. Has a nice sweet aftertaste that is orangey. Breaking into the bud I found that it wasn&#39;t as sticky as it looked and what I expected it to be. Super good heavy head high and relaxing. Recommend.

VQrazy Train is hands down a champion. The strain hits every note that a cannabis strain should. It touches your humor center, as well as your mind, both uplifting your stresses and providing a bit of psychedelic fun. But as one other reviewer noted, it comes in waves. You\u2019ll feel yourself becoming stoned in the first moments, then suddenly you\u2019ll start feeling that sativa rising high come on, then you\u2019ll notice both at once. Eventually you almost plateau and then you find yourself rising again. You\u2019ll be alert to noises, but relaxed enough to tune them out... until you end up hearing It again as if it were the first time you\u2019ve heard it in your life. Personally I feel that this isn\u2019t a \u201cworking\u201d strain; you\u2019ll really want to be seated and unoccupied. I didn\u2019t experience any munchies, paranoid, sedation, or an adrenaline rush. However it has given me some serious red eyes and they feel water af. All of this came from one regular sized dab. Definitely a hitter, and quite possibly my favorite strain recreationally. I hope to keep it in my rotation forever, and I hope you give it a shot more importantly. You really won\u2019t regret it, no matter your strain preference. Happy toking &#129305;&#127995;

The earthy smell makes for a good body high but only after you first experience the head high. I liked that I could get up if I needed to but was able to relax after the task was done. The only draw back is if your a newbie, like myself, it can be a little unforgiving (paranoia). Treat this strain respectfully and you&#39;ll be in heaven.

VThis is a very &quot;low dose&quot; strain. Just 1 or 2 good hits will have you focused and productive for hours. It has a good quick incline on the uptake that easily and seamlessly glides into cruise on relatively short order. this strange may have some Puna Butter roots (a rare Hawaiian strain from the late 70s-early 80s) in its lineage. Wipe up some crumbs and end up cleaning an entire kitchen. If you have something to do, engage shortly after medicating and you will stay with it ALL day. Excellent strain. I found 3-4 hits at the end of the day and lights out. This strain reduced consumption from 1g to .5g per day. Hands down favorite.

VIt really is a &quot;Qrazy Train&quot; ride. Great strain for being creative, productive, but still helps you relax at the same time. I was at a [8] after 2 hits and it lasts for hours. Get ready to be flipped flat on your ass.\u000a

VI&#39;m mainly an Indica smoker but the excellent Christmas tree like bud-structure, Beautiful Orange Hairs, we an uplifting, euphoric, day time medicine. Definitely an excellent 50/50 hybrid in mail opinion.  Loved it!

VQtrain...or Qrazy train whatever.\u000aHad some of this recently from a dispensary in Golden, CO and was very impressed with the buds.  The smell was too good.\u000aMade me feel guilty for breaking up the nugs and toking bud that you just hate to see disappear.\u000aThis stuff is awesome with a very nice taste, smell and high!\u000aI&#39;ll pick up more of this strain anyday!

Vmy favorite. first 30 minutes you won&#39;t get much done. but after that,  good daytime. no couch lock. lots of energy. may keep you up. \u000a\u000apretty much my only strain,  except hard candy where lighting up would be inappropriate. \u000a\u000avapor or bong. I prefer bong with this. vapor buzz is shorter, but very nice. bong buzz lasts several hours. pain relief for me is fantastic. \u000a\u000a

VVERY GOOD at dealing with OCD!  Works WAY better than Straterra AND, since it makes you feel like time is going slow OR you&#39;re just thinking really fast, you tend to get more accomplished.  I write software for a living so I CANNOT have medication that makes me forgetful sleepy or anxious.  Also, can&#39;t have any negative &#39;time-warping&#39; effects.  \u000a\u000aNow, the above is all true IF..... IF doses are small.  If you go nuts on your dosing then all bets are off.\u000a\u000aHaving said that....Qrazy Train is my daily go-to for getting the grind going.\u000a\u000aALSO, do not take before bed as you will then spend the next 2-4 hours hyper analyzing your day.

VOne of the worst strains I&#39;ve had recently (since everything&#39;s been so amazing lately.)\u000aQT is tastes harsh and not very potent. It left me feeling sleepy and slightly annoyed, but not very stoney. Felt like I was smoking some bunk brick weed, so I kept having to look down and check it was the same shit I bought that looked so good prior. \u000aAvoid.

It makes you think of anything and you dont care what your thinking about. Little couchlock. \u000aFucking with my eye sight while I type. Cross eyed!!!  \u000aReally fucking with the think feeling couchlocked in the MiNdDdddDd!!! Thinkings all meshed up and slow fast... \u000aQrazy Train really reminds me of C99 in the thinking fast trippy feeling like a genious. Content. Like your on organic SpeEDddDDd!!! Like I just sNoRtEd a line of coke!!! Gotta Be Quick!!! If You Know What I Mean!!! This doesnt last as long as C99.?.? \u000aThis strain is heavy/light powerful yet subtle. \u000aIts QrAzYYyyyYy!!! \u000aSometimes Qrazy Train makes me feel little flashes of crazines even though Im on [ScHiZoPhReNiC] pills to not be qrazy!!!\u000a
