VI&#39;m an extremely picky and lightweight spoiled on my flower choices due to growing up on the hill. That being said I&#39;ve seen this flower from 2-4 diff growers and has always been an A list strain . Super potent indica , I&#39;ve seen tested at 28%( by far highest thc content seen from this strain) . It&#39;s a beautiful flower , incredibly dense and incredibly smooth flavor smoke. I have high high standards when it comes to rating a strain but without hesitation I&#39;d rank this 9.8/10. It&#39;s not super easy to find and personally is don&#39;t produce this strain bc of very high difficulty level and what&#39;s considered a low yield. But if you like indicas this is a must try

VAn indica that I\u2019ve been searching for!! My dispensary REALLY likes its Sativas &amp; Hybribs but don\u2019t carry many pure indica strains. So I usually just buy a hybrid. \u000a\u000aThese buds are VERY pretty with a ton of purple &amp; coated like sugar. It gives you that munchies, couch lock high thats great for insomnia &amp; anxiety. It relaxes you but you can still have a conversation with someone &amp; laugh your ass off. It does make you hungry(which isn\u2019t great for my diet) so be prepared for that.\u000a\u000aI had a strain with 26% THC &amp; it was actually called Diamond Valley OG, but the description fits it perfectly, so I assume its this strain.\u000a\u000aIt takes away pain(I\u2019m incredibly sore-just had a baby) and it you need to get shit done, do it at the beginning of the high. Its a great strain if a true indica is what you\u2019re looking for.

VDiamond OG provides me with great relief. This strain was exceptional helpful for my Crohn&#39;s Disease. This strain helped alleviate my PTSD, chronic nausea, intermittent and constant pain, as well as muscle spasms.  If you do not have much tolerance, this strain will probably make you tired after a bowl or 2, but if you have chronic symptoms that other strains barely touch(help elevate)...this one is probably for you

VAmong the better kush varieties I&#39;ve had the pleasure of coming across. The one complaint I&#39;ve heard about it is that it&#39;s almost TOO strong! But really, its exactly what a top shelf kush strain should bring to the table. It&#39;s fragrant and floral, with a sour zing that makes you take notice. The stone is very deep and soothing, with moderate to heavy couchlock. As long as you don&#39;t have anything important to do, Diamond OG is a real gem.

VThis is a great Indica strain. The one that I have is the Diamond OG in shatter concentrate form,  from Xtractology in California. Around 74% THC and around 4% terpenes. \u000a\u000aThe description is dead on - this strain is a true indica. I&#39;ve noticed after I take a nice dab, I&#39;m very talkative at first and just have a relaxed, euphoric feeling throughout my body. Definitely an OG taste and smell, that comes out right up front. But with a slight hint of lemon behind it. What I like about this strain is it does not give me ANY anxiety or paranoia, which I can get sometimes depending on the strain. Pain relief is great with this strain. I had an annoying headache and forgot all about it after I dabbed this. My uncle recently had major hand surgery, he had a stretched out nerve from all the football injuries back in the day, and he had pulsating sharp pain that would not go away after the surgery. Gave him a little dab of this Diamond OG and he was so happy, he told me he completely forgot about the pain. It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a mental thing with the pain and you just stop thinking about it, then you realize it&#39;s not there anymore. \u000a\u000aOverall, a great strain. If you&#39;re looking for a true indica to take away your pain at night, but not make you have racing anxious thoughts, this is it. I will also mention that even though it made me talkative right after the dab, it still knocks me the hell out after about an hour maybe hour and a half. I LOVE this strain for sleep, it really puts me out at the end of the night. If you see some of this, give it a try!

VBeing BI-POLAR 1 its a constant struggle between me and my brain. I treat people so they never want to talk to me again.Bi-Polar 1 destroys everything period.I came across DIAMOND OG here in Mesa AZ. I have to have this strain every day now.. When I get that MANIA rolling 1 rip off the bong and then the guilt pours in and the apologizes start. Not saying it removes bi-polar from you BUT it makes you realize when your a MANIAC and then you and only you take control and slow down(try anyway)with the help of DIAMOND OG. I wish I could get a years supply this strain has changed my life in many ways. Thank you Mother Earth for your enlightenment, Sorry we are destroying you every minute of every day.

VOne of the loudest of the OG&#39;s, the smell honestly sets the bar too damn high, cause after a joint i got this meh  thas it?! feeling followed by a sativa like uppity detail your car feeling, so i rolled another, smoked it 3/4 through  i went straight to the other side of chill unmotivated, pushing the buttons on the remote is too much work to ask of a man, this infomercials gonna do.  followed by a boring dont talk to me feeling like the -sooo say goodnight to the bad guy scarface introspective scene-where he feels like &#39;is this as good as it gets?!.   So dissapointed with the boring strain i say ok, skrew it my eyes are half shut let me end the night with a heavy bong rip of this.  Light the bowl and as the cloud seeps up the glass and into my lungs i begin to feel a slight euphoric tingle, the oxy,morphine,hydro come up mixed with an amphetamine ears popping rush, i exhale a blimps worth of fog and kush smelling sweat immediately drips off my forehead and i finally find the &#128142; dose.  So in conclusion the strain is shitty as rough black sand or sublimely excellent depending on finding that diamond dose.

VDiamond OG is one of my favorite strains! You feel the rush pretty instantaneously, and its a great rush! VERY relaxing, uplifting, excellent for pain, nausea, and increasing appetite! It also gave me some creative juices (as i like to draw a lot) and i think that if you have some social anxiety this strain will help! I dont have social anxiety, im actually pretty comfortable going up to strangers and what not, meeting new ppl is exciting for me, but i think it gave me a little confidence boost! not sure what it was, but i just felt content all over! The BEST part is the pain relief, though. IMO, at least.. I have fibromyalgia which causes me a lot of pain and Diamond OG is truly a great alternative to OTC pain relievers or even worse, Narcotic ones! Also, if you have trouble sleeping, smoke a few-couple bowls of this! If you want a fabulous head/body high, smoke less. Either way, though, this is a FANTASTIC and true Indica, and I am SO glad my go-to clinic had it! In the last year I have tried 3 specific strains that i will usually choose over any other, Diamond OG being one of them! (Dizzy og and OG #18 are the other two!)

VSo the other day I picked up a strain called Diamond &#128142; OG from Manny the Masterful. Two grams was a good sampling for the first time experiment. Had some pain this morning in my hip due to the cold and toked up on some Diamond &#128142; OG flower &#127802;. I can tell I am becoming medicated by the feeling of tingling in my face. I was comfortable and soon was delightfully lifted. Having a conversation with anyone while on this strain is difficult; so be aware. I then proceeded to go to my bed and take a three hour nap &#128564;. Very comfortable rest after two bowls. I saved some for this evening since my chronic pain levels are off and on today. I shall hopefully be able to try this strain again.

VDiamonds are forever, and this strain is no exception! (With puns aside) This strain quickly made it to my favorites list (it was almost my favorite but Sour Diesel beat it by just a bit) With a fast-acting and long lasting high, this will really relax you and ease your mind. You might also gravitate towards the couch after a while but you&#39;ll still have a bit of energy if you needed to get up! It has a fantastic taste and smell as well as a great smoothness. Overall, if you need something to ease your aches and pains or to just simply relax with a movie or a good video game,  Diamond OG is just the strain for you! 4/5!

VLove the smell of this one, extremely pungent with heavy pine and earthy terpenes. The buds aren&#39;t overly big but glisten like diamonds under light. Hits fast and hard felt first in the forehead, then a deep relaxing buzz quickly encompasses the rest of my body. Made me want to sit my ass down and chill, forget, relax, get the munchies and unwind from a long day. Perfect indica, top notch, love it. We recommend this one at the dispensary for those that need to relieve stress and anxiety, increase appetite, and easing body pain into a deep tranquility leading to sleep.

VThis is definitely one of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked in a while. The bud has such a beautiful appearance and texture accompanied by a delightfully fresh and sweet smell, which is also a nice way of describing its smooth flavour. You don&#39;t want the joint to end once you have a puff of this stuff and get lost in how much you are in enjoying it. Such a nice smooth stoned buzz, that hits pretty hard, but doesn&#39;t last too long. I usually always switch it up with trying different kinds of strains each time I visit a dispensary, but I&#39;ve bought this kind twice now and will definitely be buying again. Would 100% recommend.

VSo the other day I picked up a strain called Diamond &#128142; OG from Manny the Masterful. Two grams was a good sampling for the first time experiment. Had some pain this morning in my hip due to the cold and toked up on some Diamond &#128142; OG flower &#127802;. I can tell I am becoming medicated by the feeling of tingling in my face. I was comfortable and soon was delightfully lifted. Having a conversation with anyone while on this strain is difficult; so be aware. I then proceeded to go to my bed and take a three hour nap &#128564;. Very comfortable rest after two bowls. I saved some for this evening since my chronic pain levels are off and on today. I shall hopefully be able to try this strain again.

VGreat relaxation and couch lock. This one relieved pain, and kept my RLS at bay. I didn&#39;t have the most pleasant dreams with this strain, and was a little groggy in the morning, but I&#39;m still giving 5 stars because the smell and taste is pretty good, like a sensual perfume.

VLove the smell of this one, extremely pungent with heavy pine and earthy terpenes. The buds aren&#39;t overly big but glisten like diamonds under light. Hits fast and hard felt first in the forehead, then a deep relaxing buzz quickly encompasses the rest of my body. Made me want to sit my ass down and chill, forget, relax, get the munchies and unwind from a long day. Perfect indica, top notch, love it. We recommend this one at the dispensary for those that need to relieve stress and anxiety, increase appetite, and easing body pain into a deep tranquility leading to sleep.

VTilray&#39;s Diamond OG while good quality medicine isn&#39;t a knock your socks off Indica. Perfect for pain relief in the afternoon or evening relief. Does not intoxicate very much on a standard dose so it can be easily used during the daytime but I would not recommend using this strain all day.  It&#39;s taste is of an earthy piney variety that is clean and very smooth tasting. Good job Tilray!

VDiamond OG is yet another OG Kush mash-up, this time with an unknown strain. The smell and taste is a slightly mediocre pine mixed with light hints of the OG Kush chemical-like terpene profile. The truly impressive aspect was the bud&#39;s appearance-under the magnifying glass and light it looked like it had been dipped in a billion tiny crystals. Although the high wasn&#39;t 100%, this is still a decent quality strain.

VThis is definitely one of the best strains I&#39;ve smoked in a while. The bud has such a beautiful appearance and texture accompanied by a delightfully fresh and sweet smell, which is also a nice way of describing its smooth flavour. You don&#39;t want the joint to end once you have a puff of this stuff and get lost in how much you are in enjoying it. Such a nice smooth stoned buzz, that hits pretty hard, but doesn&#39;t last too long. I usually always switch it up with trying different kinds of strains each time I visit a dispensary, but I&#39;ve bought this kind twice now and will definitely be buying again. Would 100% recommend.

I totally recommend . I like it.Will buy again.\u000ap.s I make coconut oil infused with cannabis and this is really good just take 1 gram bud and de carb. \u000aThen put it in a little mason jar with warm coconut oil to cover the flower. Then put jar cover on and cook in the crockpot for 90 minutes. Take it out and put in fridge . it\u2019s a really good edible and you just need a little pinch. &#127793;&#127793;\u000aI would rate it 4.5 . There\u2019s no half stars &#128077;&#127800;

VAn almost true Indica, this OG Kush baby packs a punch and is not for those days when you need to get up and go! These are known to have a lustrous coating of trichomes- hence the Diamond nametag, which are sure to have that sweeter OG aroma, super earthy and pungent. This strain produces a sleepy, happy and hungry high which benefits those looking for stress and pain relief, insomnia help, anxiety relief, and appetite stimulation.

VThis strain provided a great deal of pain relief, it also made me extremely relaxed and also caused very little followup fatigue the day after smoking before bed, it&#39;s like if you removed all the negative parts of Rockstar Kush and Tuna Kush and increased the level of pain relief and relaxation at the expense of duration (4hr), this has been my favorite strain to date, I oonly received a small amount of it because where I purchased it didn&#39;t have a lot of the stock left and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for strong relaxating pain relieving lettuce.\u000a\u000aFirst 5/5 since I started 6mo&#39;s ago.

VAll I can say is Diamond OG is a top shelf strain right beside Master Kush. The taste and effects are very similar to OG Kush. The differences are : the taste is sweeter, and the effects are heavier. Like your already heavy on OG Kush but this is like turning it up a dial or two. Gets me every time! Great for killing time, even makes ya rhyme. Eleven out of ten, buy if your feel in lazy. It is pretty strong so novice consumers use at caution if there are plans latter that day.

VI just picked up a little under a quarter oz. of this fine, fine bud. Very happy about it. The aroma of the bud is absolutely breath taking. The bud itself, a very greenish almost blue in someways. And the feeling you get from it is just pure bliss. when i first got it i only took 2 hits from my bong and it just felt like someone hit a reset button in my head. My body felt extremely relaxed, my mind was hopeful on wanting to do something at very first( like a second after i took in the hit) then slowly turned it a &quot;well ill just sit down and see where it goes&quot; type of high. I suffer from Anxiety and Depression along with eating problems and digestive issues, so this strain was very beneficial to me. Will look out for this strain again for sure!

VDon&#39;t let the 3 star rating fool you, this is a fantastic indica, Very relaxing however the appetite that comes with this strain is unreal. I generally prefer to smoke strains that are light on the munchies but I couldn&#39;t stop eating after smoking this one. Def choose this if you&#39;re looking to stimulate your appetite.

I felt really uncomfortable and had an intense body high, tripping over all sorts of shit. I would not recommend it to someone looking to relieve stress or feel happy, this is a strain that fucks you up big time. If that&#39;s your game, by all means. But I&#39;m gonna have to vote no on trying it again.

But with Diamond OG, I was able to be lucid though very sedated. \u000a\u000aI could actually follow the action adventure film I was watching and even had the peace of mind to give it 3/5 stars. Normally, I just say they&#39;re all 5&#39;s when I vape a strong strain like this. \u000a\u000aThe body can move but only on command when using Diamond. Pine smell in the room after and even the one who hates OG smells liked it. Win/win.

A heavy, deep, but not-at-all unpleasant calming washes over me, starting just above my nose, and slooooowly lifting up my face, through to my now-droopy eyes, and then, blissfully, to my overworked and often anxious brain. \u000a\u000aThis exhibits all the lovely \u2018down\u2019 traits of its Kush-y lineage, while adding light notes of red berries-  think a raspberry dessert, covered in fluffy alpine snow, while resting high in the Himalayas.\u000a\u000aThis is a modern bedtime classic, if ever there was one.  A huge vote up for Diamond OG!

VThis strain provided a great deal of pain relief, it also made me extremely relaxed and also caused very little followup fatigue the day after smoking before bed, it&#39;s like if you removed all the negative parts of Rockstar Kush and Tuna Kush and increased the level of pain relief and relaxation at the expense of duration (4hr), this has been my favorite strain to date, I oonly received a small amount of it because where I purchased it didn&#39;t have a lot of the stock left and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for strong relaxating pain relieving lettuce.\u000a\u000aFirst 5/5 since I started 6mo&#39;s ago.

VAll I can say is Diamond OG is a top shelf strain right beside Master Kush. The taste and effects are very similar to OG Kush. The differences are : the taste is sweeter, and the effects are heavier. Like your already heavy on OG Kush but this is like turning it up a dial or two. Gets me every time! Great for killing time, even makes ya rhyme. Eleven out of ten, buy if your feel in lazy. It is pretty strong so novice consumers use at caution if there are plans latter that day.

VAn almost true Indica, this OG Kush baby packs a punch and is not for those days when you need to get up and go! These are known to have a lustrous coating of trichomes- hence the Diamond nametag, which are sure to have that sweeter OG aroma, super earthy and pungent. This strain produces a sleepy, happy and hungry high which benefits those looking for stress and pain relief, insomnia help, anxiety relief, and appetite stimulation.

VI just picked up a little under a quarter oz. of this fine, fine bud. Very happy about it. The aroma of the bud is absolutely breath taking. The bud itself, a very greenish almost blue in someways. And the feeling you get from it is just pure bliss. when i first got it i only took 2 hits from my bong and it just felt like someone hit a reset button in my head. My body felt extremely relaxed, my mind was hopeful on wanting to do something at very first( like a second after i took in the hit) then slowly turned it a &quot;well ill just sit down and see where it goes&quot; type of high. I suffer from Anxiety and Depression along with eating problems and digestive issues, so this strain was very beneficial to me. Will look out for this strain again for sure!

VDiamond OG gave me full body relaxation, reduced my pain and muscle spasms, got rid of my headache and got me ready to slip away into sweet slumber.  The taste of this bud is delicious. It is smooth, with a pine and citrus taste and a strong, OG smell and a fuelly undertone.  The nuggets actually do sparkle when you look at them, were quite condensed and broke out beautifully.   This is a strong indica strain that helps me with my insomnia.   A must try for indica fans.

VI purchased this the other day, two grams and then three more grams! Absolutely splendid on my chronic pain. Helps out with nausea and overall Blue mood. I found myself able to relax enough to smile; no pain either. I find this strain gave me a wonderful head high as well. I am able to calm and relax my mind more than usual. I bought this in crumble form and the smell to me is diesel with herbal undertones, like rosemary or thyme. I am enjoying this strain immensely.

VAfter 10 very hard deep 10sec pulls at 360F gradually increasing to 410-425, felt the following. Dissociation without tingling float a way head top off feeling, slight skin tingling/dissociation worse than rest of body. Confusion, sleepiness, swollen and drying eyes (not dryish, or dryer eyes, but as if I can almost feel them drying gradually) eyes. Head tightness but also sinus infection? Intensifying the feeling the sinus infraction maybe - touch is enhanced but inky when concentrating just slightly. Dizziness but more vertigo, like tilting feeling of the room - almost the same feeling as IV Benadryl, narcotics, or conscious sedation/nitrous oxide/twilight sedation feeling. Very strong sudden come-on of a \u201chaving to sleep\u201d type feeling.
