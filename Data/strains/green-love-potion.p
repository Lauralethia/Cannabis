Vvaped this in soft snap and pull concentrate form from a herbalizer.    taste is mild, smooth and creamy with a light woodiness, more\u000abalsam than oak,  pleasant, easy smoking and surprisingly clear-headed.   I plan on recommending this to patients with pain management needs who are desirous of a great daytime strain.

VGot this from Doc Croc at 25.1% THC. Not much for cerebral effects, but the body tingle is very nice. Does offer some, not a lot, aphrodisiac properties. Smells like tea, but taste is near non-existent.

VGreen Love Potion is now available at Philadelphia despensaries. Patients who have tried Green Love Potion say it has rapid relaxing effects for chronic pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia. Its unique flavors of lavender and menthol and smells of sweet floral and lavender have patients raving about this flower.

Vthe first few times I tried this strain I wasnt particularly impressed. I was aiming to use it as an anti anxiety/sleep/relaxation aid. It definitely has those benefits but not quite like you would think. I had a long drive that caused me to have awful back spasms I was in pain for a long ride home and I finally looked here to find which of my strains would be best for pain and now I know why  this strain stuck out to me. I feel like a million bucks paired with an indica edible.

Vvery bland indica, I really enjoy BD but GLP just hasn&#39;t done it for me. no stimulation physically or mentally really. my sample is not a good example I believe although it looks great.

VThis is one indica that I really did not enjoy all that much, I believe a lot of the negative effects that I experienced were due to the poor quality in the sample I purchased at my dispensary.\u000ajust nothing there as far as any positive stimulation physically or mentally for myself or my wife. I&#39;ll definitely

VFirst time vaping this and it is wonderful. I can\u2019t do a lot of strains that have a sativa edge, makes me jumpy. But this is smooth, I stay chill during the day. And I\u2019m able to be really creative and paint throughout a session. \u000aNext imma try the flowers.

VWish I could &quot;Love&quot; GLP! Sadly, I purchased without seeing the product; 2 oz. It&#39;s was pretty with purple, hairy, and the worse thing It was dry with lots of baby seeds, and hardly any leaf matter either. Taste is blah, not so good. \u000a\u000aNow for the effects, it&#39;s as they say a clearer high. I do prefer the couch lock type(s)! I&#39;ll finish what I have and hope to sample again a better GLP product at some point.
