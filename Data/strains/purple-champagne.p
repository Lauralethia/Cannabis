VThis stuff is awesome, berry/fruity smell and flavor, tastes great out of a vape,   Really uplifting happy high, no paranoia anxiety, or any negatives whatsoever.  This is a favorite of mine for sure.  Good for day use, won&#39;t put you to sleep, can talk and socialize, do activities without feeling sloppy.

VThe aftertaste alone is amazing and very strong and tasty. Like you&#39;ve been drinking champagne while eating grape gum. This one is a touch stoney, and does start like an Indica, before gradually moving to a semi-Sativa effect. Good vibe; you can feel the Granddaddy Purple genetics here.  A pretty smiley one that&#39;s a creeper. Purple Champagne is perhaps better classified as a sativa-type hybrid, instead of just sativa-only. Not bad, but expected more considering those genetics.

VTook a small pipe hit no more then 5 minutes ago to help me get some stuff done around the house. As soon as i inhaled the smoke i could feel the effects already sprouting out. I now feel this sativa heavily behind my eyes. Its a pleasant and relaxing feeling, that hasn&#39;t taken me away from the things i have to get done.\u000a\u000a8/10- First thoughts\u000a*Note i was hungry before smoking.

VThis strain has very very sweet aroma, and that honestly is the bulk of the smell. I sense some notes of grape, and a bit of earthyness, but it&#39;s just very smelling, and it was very very strong, but about middle ground on pain relief.

VThe grower didn&#39;t want to test this product in a medical state! Why! And WTF! With patience I finally convinced him to do the right thing and with samples in hand I grabbed an 1/8th because of the genetics! Very tasty gdp in the flavor of this hybrid. If the effects are sativa well I shouldn&#39;t have hit the blue mystic after lol. I can&#39;t tell cause I&#39;m really high! Super sweet and dank covered in tricomes. Dense sticky with dark colors.

VPurchased @ Greenside Rec Des Moines for $50/3gs by Top Shelf Farms\u000a17% THC Sativa\u000aFlower: nice tight little asparagus spear shaped buds with purple leaves amongst the orange hairs. Smells like fresh squeezed lemonade/citrus champagne. I wanna sleep in the bag. Intoxicating. \u000aCrumble: grinds up like I expect top shelf farms product to. Fluffy and seems to increase in size when ground. Very frosty. \u000aBurn: clean and even due to its great grindability. \u000aTaste: the highlight of this strain is most definitely the delicious chocolatey-grape-citrus/champagne then cream soda notes I was tasting off the first hit. Great way to start off my 4/20!  The taste with this one, IMHO, is one of my top 5. Delectably decadent!\u000aHigh: here&#39;s my one issue with this strain that keeps it out of my 5 star list, being a 17% THC sativa, it gave me a decent head buzz right off but it went away quickly and I was reaching for more.  It is a good daytime high strain but I think it lacks the potency that I want. \u000aOverall: 8/10
