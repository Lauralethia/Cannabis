VIt&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve smoked, I&#39;ll just get that outta the way. All I can say is that this has a wonderful aroma and is really easy on the throat. Beautiful structure on the bud. This was recommended to me because it was supposed to be a little lighter. Well, from the first hit I could tell just how effective it was. Personally I get a nice warm feelings in my legs whenever I smoke a strain that gives me that energy to get up and do something. Keep some water on hand because it&#39;s gonna give ya a real good case of cotton mouth. Overall though, damn good active relaxed smoke.

VThis is an amazing heavy-hitter that i am loving! \u2014&gt;best suited for/enjoyed by those whom are seasoned \u2014 def too much for novices + those new to the medicinal marijuana community. Taste is very pleasantly appealing, yet difficult to describe.. it&#39;s reminding me of something on which I can&#39;t quite put my finger..but it&#39;s an organic fruity, herby, flowery-- yet all so very mild, so differentiation is tough! But I enjoy strains that &#39;keep me on my toes&#39;/guessing..and the creative, inspirational, energized quality of my hybrid shatter (crossed w/Ghost OG) makes Flo an ideal daytime medicine.. also with nary the l&#39;il funk that can sometimes accompany the back end of a dose. Definitely worthy of 5 stars! Beginners beware, but pros\u2014&gt; this one&#39;s for you! You will not regret going with this Flo!! &#128521;

V(I wish I had this while I was a student) This is probably one of my personal favorites... \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a peaceful deep thinking high. I&#39;ve only done this one alone, but when I do my ADHD calms down and I can sit and just think about stuff. It&#39;s possible to be high on this and have intellectual thoughts. I even like to write when I&#39;ve got Flo in my system. \u000a\u000aADHD Students - Might be helpful for essay writing when you can&#39;t sit still and focus. \u000a\u000aps; I don&#39;t say stupid things on FB or get crazy munchies - those two things alone are a plus in my book.

VThis is the first high I had that didn&#39;t make me paranoid. I became sociable, elated yet relaxed and toward the middle of my high, introspective. I was completely functional during the day. The strain also assisted me in relieving chronic pain in my shoulder.  Personally had a wonderful time sans paranoia or tingly body high which I&#39;m not fond of at all. \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re looking for a well balanced high, go with Flo.

VFlo is popular in Colorado right now and it&#39;s obvious why.  This plant produces purple/blue buds that are quite large in size.  Covered in trichomes not only are they gorgeous but this strain reiks! Not in any negative way but it is a pretty unique aroma and taste.  It&#39;s dark and musky but sweet.  The effects are very clear headed, great for daytime at work or around people.  It knocks out any anxiety I feel and makes for comfortable conversations and no major sluggishness on the comedown.  You won&#39;t find this strain boasting high THC %&#39;s but it&#39;s definitely not to be forgotten.

I have Chronic Pain and  Fibromyalgia and movement is absolutely vital for pain relief.  FLO OG gives me the energy and pain relief to exercise and complete some of my daily living skills.

V-1st Degree BLACK BELT BUD- This bud kicks @$$ to be sure! the buds are a light green with dark red hairs and the leaves are a light lavender/purple color that is just BEAUTIFUL. THE TASTE IS OUTTA THIS WORLD TOO! Juicy sweetness in the taste as well as a pleasant aroma but not at all overpowering (well, maybe a little bit). Dank/Chronic to the max TOTALLY! Trichromes coating the entire bud/bud leaves. Effects are very stoney with a sleppy feel. Helps sure a sour tummy in one hit. Doesn&#39;t hurt the lungs when smoking so much so that I can take abnormally large hits. Flo doesn&#39;t seem to be effecting my asthma! It hits my back pain hard and fast but wears off kinda quick it seams to me... All in all a definate new one of my top 10 all time faves...

VVery good taste.  Hard to quite smoking cause it&#39;s so good.  Very clear sativa high.  A friend of mine thought this weed sucked, he was a novice smoker, was used to indicas.  But I find this weed to be a superior high.  The high is distinct, and I find after smoking this all day, is seems to do the trick every time.  One of the truest &quot;one hitter quitter&quot; weeds.  One hit held for a moment is a true medicinal dose.  Very resinous, very strong smell.  Awesome.  They call it flo for a reason.

VFinally got a version of flo that hits me pretty hard, it has a lot of the fruity smell attached to it. This phenotype Flo #2 it has a white purple leafs and bush out more wide than tall, there is a lot of room in-between the branches and calyxes are very frosty and foxtail outwards,it&#39;s pretty heavy for the weight to size ratio surprisingly. The pistols on this thing are blood red mad, and have a gradient of bright starting at the base and dark at the tips. This version of flo hits me straight dead on and I have a lot of the creative side, there is no lingering effects and I feel happy, but not so overly stoned. I finally understand the nice balance of this strain the purple thai really shimmers in this strain the afghani structure for the bushy-ness over all wonderfull and excellent it replaces my morning cup of coffee very worth it. I also wrote this review, simply because the phenotype of this strain is just a stronger version of flow. There would have to be a different cross of genetics to create a different phenotype that or just heavily inbreeding to create something new. Over all a great sativa/ awakening. Helps with pain concentration and getting my shiz done for the day thanks flo your really nice tasting and the effects are great and the cut off is nice and straight forward :D. Makes me a happier camper.

Best part is it still alleviates my pain and nausea and allows me to MOVE more, as I&#39;ve been very sedentary lately.

VI got this strain in an off-white colored honeycomb concentrate. \u000a\u000aThe high is more situational than I would like. This is the first strain I have come across where I only like it for very specific activities. It gives me strong energy and focus with a nice overall uplifting feeling, but little to no euphoria or happy feelings. I like this strain as a get up and get stuff done strain, very good for school work or regular work. I just didn&#39;t find the high as fun as most other strains. \u000a\u000aThe flavor is a pleasant, sweet, pine smell that isn&#39;t overwhelming, and tastes the same. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOverall, I don&#39;t think I would buy the flo again unless I needed something specifically for focus and energy.

VGrew me some Flo lately. It grows buds from top to bottom. Didn&#39;t even need fan leaves after awhile and trimmed them. Flo don&#39;t like humidity and easily get&#39;s powdery mildew easily, so a dehumidifier is needed. But a very nice yielder. Smells like citrus at first, then berries, with a tiny bit of skunk. I love the immediate sensation behind my eyes and tingling in my temples as Flo massages away my stress and leaves me feeling very euphoric indeed. I can still accomplish things so no couch lock if smoked in moderation. One of my favorite hybrids for sure and grows big buds fast.

A little dry but nothing to harsh herbal taste. Its a light hitter for sure I think I&#39;ll try a harder version by cranking the vape heat thin vape that lingers and moves around. Its the high that makes you feel nice I will admit this original Flo is very different from others I&#39;ve tried I&#39;m impressed with the effects of this strain.\u000aIts good for concentration even though I am absolutly sore all over and feel so lazy this reminds me of how awesome it is to be alive and achieve so much and prepair tomorrow better :D

VPicked up an 1/8th of this with 4 other strains. This strain by far blew the others out of the water this weekend. Not sure if it was the harvest or what but the % THC felt was high on this flowery goodness (emphasis on felt I&#39;m not a scientist). Made for wonderful productive mornings when paired with french press coffee and munchies filled afternoons when winding down. The flavor was lemon/citrus with some flowery tones. Had me going a bowl shorter than my normal consumption. yum! Would recommend. Especially from Rocky Mt. High in Downtown Denver.

Just when you think that it is some wimpy hybrid it kicks your ass and you start crying out for graham crackers and milk from your mother.  No really, ignore the THC ratings for Flo. The awesome product I got at The Green Solution will kick your ass down the street all day long.  Also, a not to be missed is Lambs Bread.  ns

Compared to the last couple strains I&#39;ve smoked, I require less of this to get me to a comfortable state.\u000a\u000aI use cannabis primarily for Major Depressive Disorder, Acute Anxiety Disorder, Extreme Daily Nausea and IBS. Flo got me in a comfortable state and ready to eat without having to finish a whole bowl.\u000a\u000aFlo has a potent earthy/diesel aroma that will permeate through pretty much anything that is not vacuum sealed.

VAfter seeing this strain all around, I finally decided to try it (may have had it previously, but can&#39;t recall if so). This is a very nice strain but I honestly don&#39;t really know how I should describe it. All I can say is that after smoking a bit of it I get this lingering haze effect, like I never fully come down from the high, which is quite a nice sensation. Definitely recommend to use for anxiety, depression, and/or nausea and I use it to curb those.

VComfortable, energized high. Clean your bowl thoroughly with alcohol before smoking to get the full value of the flavors of sweet citrus/grapefruit with a woody/earthy finish and a hint of mint. Especially pleasant mixed with Agent Orange. High sets in fairly quickly and last a couple hours (smoked flower). Feeling is stoney and relaxed (in the right way), while leaving you energized, creative, and focused. Full-body tingling is a cool side effect, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend to folks with migraines, high CSF pressure, or other intracranial issues as this strain gave me headaches (though I don&#39;t feel it actually raised my ICP).

Right when you think you may have smoked too much and feel paranoia about to set in, it just doesn&#39;t, and you&#39;re fine. You can smoke this one without having any overly sativa effects, but you definitely still get high. Very feel good strain.

VFlo is a unique strain since it&#39;s covered in head to toe in dark leaves but when I grind it up the bud is fluffy and light green it has a hidden make and when ground I guess reveals it&#39;s true colors. Reeks of lemon lime and has a very thin vape. It&#39;s a medium hit, but next time I should pass on flow its still needs to heavier, but over all has a hopeful mood and a depression and of course if your looking for more of a boost of energy this is for you somewhat on pain too. Love the taste just wish it was a higher powered strain for my heavy hitter tolerance, its funny thats genetic stonerism from my mothers side XD.

VLiving with chronic illness, it feels great to not just feel better, but actually feel good. Or at least what &quot;good&quot; has become for me nowadays. I don&#39;t have to use very much of this Flo to feel good, like I do right now. It&#39;s around 5 AM and with it having been one of those nights I didn&#39;t sleep well due to extreme discomfort, I got up and did my usual &quot;wake and bake.&quot; What I really like about Flo is that I feel great after taking a few hits of it off of my Pax 2, and then thinking &quot;Wow, that was nice, I think I&#39;m done for a while.&quot; One of the few strains where I don&#39;t have to get pretty damn high to feel genuinely good. I also thereby do not get the paranoia that tends to come along for me with most other sativa-dominant strains where I start commiserating about how shitty my life has become and have an all-out weep fest. Nope, not with this strain, thankfully, as that&#39;s been happening far too often lately with other strains. It&#39;s nice to get a break from the paranoia I get from some others: I mean, the other day I got good and ripped off of another strain, and I was freaking out over that episode of Planet Earth II with up-close male komodo dragons fighting with each other and eating their prey! It was about the worst horror movie I&#39;d ever seen. Now with this Flo, I think I could watch them and find at least something to laugh at.

V&quot;High speed and Thai weed on tha freeway; when when they learn to take it easy?&quot;  A quote from the best to begin this review of Flo.  Sour, Astringent, Fruity smell; beautiful light-green buds, that beam light off of their matured trichomes.  The effect is immediate, felt before exhaling your hit even, but then seems to disappear shortly, only to return in full force, and disappear once again.  Very wavey high in that way.  Very thai-like effect as I have heard &quot;thai-weed&quot; described.  An effect that can certainly lead to &quot;over-smoking,&quot; however, the Afghan Kush influence in Flo, balances the high nicely.  Once you have smoked a good dose (for me a full bowl), you feel comfortably euphoric, giggly, and medicated, with bursts of psychedelia.  The taste is sour-ish and purple-ish and quite unique (dare I say Flo-ish).  Really, really enjoyed this flower from Sandia Botanicals in Albuquerque, NM.

VThis strain has made such an impression on me that I can&#39;t stop talking about it! Beautiful buds with purple flowers throughout that are heavy in THC crystals. A smooth yet strong high, its hands down the best strain I&#39;ve ever had! Had I known it was going to be so good i would&#39;ve bought more than two grams. This Hybrid has a heavy body flow but euphoric mental stimulants which makes it th perfect strand! I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on another batch, I think I&#39;m obsessed with it ! It&#39;s that good, not to mention I love any bud with purple in it!

V&quot;High speed and Thai weed on tha freeway; when when they learn to take it easy?&quot;  A quote from the best to begin this review of Flo.  Sour, Astringent, Fruity smell; beautiful light-green buds, that beam light off of their matured trichomes.  The effect is immediate, felt before exhaling your hit even, but then seems to disappear shortly, only to return in full force, and disappear once again.  Very wavey high in that way.  Very thai-like effect as I have heard &quot;thai-weed&quot; described.  An effect that can certainly lead to &quot;over-smoking,&quot; however, the Afghan Kush influence in Flo, balances the high nicely.  Once you have smoked a good dose (for me a full bowl), you feel comfortably euphoric, giggly, and medicated, with bursts of psychedelia.  The taste is sour-ish and purple-ish and quite unique (dare I say Flo-ish).  Really, really enjoyed this flower from Sandia Botanicals in Albuquerque, NM.

VFlo is at the top of the &quot;creative-active&quot; class of strains next to G-13. They are very similar, and both shine in situations that call for heightened physical activity and sharp mental abilities. Flo and G-13 are the perfect strains for shredding the mountain on a snowboard, hiking, or taking on a creative mental task that requires long periods of focus.

VFlo is the PERFECT daytime, outside weed! In small amounts, Flo just clears your head. Whatever you were doing before is enhanced, and you will be incredibly focused on the task at hand. On Flo, you won&#39;t feel very stoned - just relaxed and focused. Your thoughts will drift on by, so if you are stressed and anxious, this will help immensely. This would be great after a bad day at work. Be aware: if you smoke too much you will be quite high and sleepy.

VVery happy high, I do a lot of laughing. The bad side, sleepy after a couple hours; and the appetite goes through the roof. I would say this is more of a late afternoon, couple hours before bedtime. Great for someone that has no appetite. Very earthy taste.

VMy favorite strain ever! It gets me super motivated, focused, energetic (but not crazy energetic), slightly creative but mostly just gets my brain firing on all cylinders, almost like I have a thinking cap on. It tastes great, like a semi-sweet backwoody refreshing pinesoly taste with some earthy tones. The first time I vaped it, I started working on a difficult long school project over SPRING BREAK on VACATION! If you want to be functional and also maintain a focused work ethic while also feeling great, this is perfect for you like it is for me.

VAfter smoking this a few times I&#39;ve found that this is a good strain for driving on long, boring trips or for work if you don&#39;t find your job particularly inspiring.  For me, it&#39;s definetly not one for chilling out or if you are looking to be inspired.  It is however ideal for making the routine daily work grind more interesting though.

VI&#39;m loving DJ Short&#39;s Flo. My tolerance is sky high lately and I&#39;ve been looking for something that won&#39;t put me to sleep or put me on the couch, but will still give me a buzz. Found it today in Flo via a recommendation from my budtender. Clear-headed stoney high, stimulating and euphoric. Great strain!

Also if your manic depressive (bipolar) give this one a go. As long as it&#39;s grown right these genetics are fabulous the particular batch I have been using for the last month is 19.6 thca and .06cbd and wide spectrum of terps. Great for functional daytime medication, just going with the flo

V&quot;High speed and Thai weed on tha freeway; when when they learn to take it easy?&quot;  A quote from the best to begin this review of Flo.  Sour, Astringent, Fruity smell; beautiful light-green buds, that beam light off of their matured trichomes.  The effect is immediate, felt before exhaling your hit even, but then seems to disappear shortly, only to return in full force, and disappear once again.  Very wavey high in that way.  Very thai-like effect as I have heard &quot;thai-weed&quot; described.  An effect that can certainly lead to &quot;over-smoking,&quot; however, the Afghan Kush influence in Flo, balances the high nicely.  Once you have smoked a good dose (for me a full bowl), you feel comfortably euphoric, giggly, and medicated, with bursts of psychedelia.  The taste is sour-ish and purple-ish and quite unique (dare I say Flo-ish).  Really, really enjoyed this flower from Sandia Botanicals in Albuquerque, NM.

VI decided to give this strain a five star because it is such an easy flowing high. I usually see it labeled as a sativa, as i notice that leafly calls it a hybrid. It&#39;s definitely a functional high that doesn&#39;t seem to provoke any anxiety. Need something to help your day move along and productive? I&#39;d give this one a try. Nice &quot;feel good&quot; vibes. Hakuna Matata Stoners!

VFlo has a very smooth draw, and it&#39;s initial sweet flavor lingers into a nice aftertaste. My initial reaction is that it&#39;s just a very good hybrid which is both mind-relaxing and body-energizing. It also gives a good head buzz that feels clearing and enlightening. I would definitely recommend this to someone who needs some stress relief, or to someone who needs a good start to their day.

VThis was the first strain of ANYTHING I have tried in 20 years. I have no idea what I ever tried when I was younger.\u000a\u000aHad a visit to Colorado. Found I dispensary and went in. Learned (as us old folks must) difference between Indica &amp; Sativa, and asked for a hybrid. Specific things I asked for: &quot;doesn&#39;t make me sleepy&quot;, &quot;makes me happy&quot;, &quot;makes me creative&quot;.\u000a\u000aBudtender recommended 3 strains, two of which I forget. The third one, of which I bought one gram for vaping, was this strain, Flo.\u000a\u000aThat&#39;s all we tried while in Colorado and it was perfect for easing into these new, pure strains of marijuana.\u000a\u000aThe experience was clear and focused. Very little did quite a bit to us, although we are probably at this point, utter newbies. The taste is great, and actually something I started looking forward to. Seemed lemony and tangy.\u000a\u000aAs a result of this strain I was markedly more relaxed, less anxious, and able to focus better. I&#39;ve heard precautions about using marijuana medically if you have ADHD, but my experience was amazing.  \u000a\u000aOriginally, having been thoroughly diagnosed three times by both psychologists and neurobiologists) over the past 22 years (taking meds for 20) with combined (impulsive/inattentive type) ADHD, I was curious to see how this strain would do for my ADHD.\u000a\u000aIn short, it helped tremendously. I vigilantly focused on the most interesting things in the room (or bar) and could pull myself away instantly as needed. I hyperfocused just as much, but the &#39;view&#39; for my attention was way more flexible thanks to &quot;Flo&quot;.\u000a\u000aI, and my husband, also noticed a marked drop in anxiety and depression with &#39;Flo&#39;. I felt more energetic and relaxed each time I medicated with it.\u000a\u000aThis strain was, and is, perfect in every way I can conceive.

If your a music head like me. This is the perfect smoke and jam medicine. Extremely euphoric and beautiful. It\u2019s so hard to find in my area. I have to source it from a grower 2 hours away.

VNew Flo Tincture - 5 Sprays (15mg) trying to see if this can replace some caps I take \u2014- 10 minutes in you feel relaxed in your body a tiny bit but on the other hand your mind feels like goo as it\u2019s is melted into a gooey relaxed creative mind with uplifting and energetic undertones. You feel happy and I personally got hungrier. I feel good.  May have used to much. I really feel it in your head it\u2019s spacey. Def try 3 sprays next time. Testing this for day time use.  I definitely do think that this would be a good option for use for during the day time , so it\u2019s nice and gives a little bit of energy but for overall use it definitely would not be good for PTSD it may be good for sometimes when you need energy or something like that but definitely use too much you need to use less of this then he would the other tinctures. 1 HOUR LATER - feel anxious for the first time today so not gunna use as much and not unless earlier.  So those of you like myself who suffer from anxiety at times be sure to start low with the stream it\u2019s a great strain just micro dosing is necessary at least for myself.

Giggly and relaxed with an energetic boost to start the day...and this is most defiantly a daytime strain. The taste is good but more diesel than I prefer. But the effects outweigh that and it\u2019s worth it. My dispensary sold it as a straight up sativa, but I\u2019m not able to find it on here other than a hybrid. No worries though. &amp; Don\u2019t let that deter you from experiencing its groovy spark of energy in the morning. Wake and bake!

VJust go with the Flo. That isn&#39;t a bad way to describe this strain. It smells and tastes of sweet earthy hash. This is up there on my favorite smelling strains. It&#39;s similar in smell to Gorilla Glue in a way. The high of this strain can be considered quite tranquil. It leaves the user in a state of profound relaxation. It uplifts the user just enough, without any chance of over stimulation. The high is pretty mild so those looking for a hard-hitting high might be a little disappointed. Still, this would be on my list of strains I&#39;d pick to introduce to a first time toker.

VI really enjoy this strain. it gives me good body pain relief and a nice head high. This is one of the only hybrids I have smoked that doesn&#39;t give me insane munchies which is really good. the high lasted about 2 hours and makes me nice and relaxed without  putting me in the couch like an indica. This is an overall awesome strain that I would most definitely recommend to any smoker.

VThis one is a creeper. Effects didn&#39;t hit me till about 10min after my first bowl but then it gets continuously stronger but plateaus about an hour after smoking. Its a strong body high and gave me decent couch lock. It really let my creative juices flow and it gave me a lot of motivation to create. After about 3 hrs it put me to sleep which is good for me bc I like to enjoy the high before I sleep and this strain allowed me to do both. Only thing I wish was different is the strength of the head high to be stronger. Other than that, Great Strain!

Taste is very different than you&#39;d expect.

VI continue to look for a Sativa or Sativa leaning Hybrid that meets my expectations of-euphoria-(of Course- ) &gt;), uplifting energizing and fairly clear-headed to get stuff done  effect during the day**that does NOT give me or leave me head-achey hungover-ish afterwards. Also, I want no anxious feeling. Sour Diesel does not do the trick for me like it seems to do for so many of you.  I feel headache from it. So far, Flo comes close. No headache from it. I get a body high but it leaves me pretty clear-headed. My head  also feels nicely lightly blanketed in comfort, although I would like more of this feeling--I can&#39;t say I feel euphoric.This all may be because of the MA version of the strain which serves up a lighter numbered  profile.

VThis is definitely an interesting strain.  For me after finishing a bowl I got a little bit of pressure behind my eyes and my whole body loosened up.  It definitely felt like an Indica-dominant and then I started getting a really nice euphoria in my chest and cerebrally.  A light Sativa-sheet lay over the high.  I became surprisingly alert, but very very relaxed at the same time.  It was perfect for my anxiety and body pains.

The smell is mild until you crack open the bud, then you will really smell the hash-like aroma this strain has to offer. The taste is great, as is the high that follows. The high is good for both daytime and nighttime, but personally I would use this as a night strain.

Flo doesn&#39;t leave me feeling sleepy at the keyboard either and that is a MAJOR plus for me. I smoke all day every day. Flo has been my go to strain since I tried it about 2 weeks back. Beyond Flo, I&#39;m a big fan of the Kush strains. That Flo though, it&#39;s loud AF and gets the job done every time!

VI consumed the edible version of this strain in a Love&#39;s Oven blueberry bite. It took about an hour to kick in and left nothing to be desired. I found it to be very similar to Cindy 99 in that, there was mainly a cerebral head high with a slight body high present. The effects were very clear headed and chatty. My mom called and we chewed the fat for a little over an hour. It was a pleasant high, for sure. I rated three stars as I found the strain to be a bit generic and the edible tasted like a skunk cracker, which is unusual. I&#39;ve never had a bad tasting Love&#39;s Oven edible but they exist, apparently. No matter, though, it was a fine high!

Clear head high, talkative buzz, use when you&#39;re with close friends and you&#39;re all just having a great time TALKING and thinking. Pass around a bowl of Flo and enjoy. Conversation soon becomes the sweetest music. Listening is amplified, others have a song they are expressing to you. You find yourself speaking with ease. Conversation is energetic and intellectually stimulating. Everything flows with Flo!

VI picked up a gram of Flo grown by Deep Roots Harvest. Has a citrus/piney smell. Taste is very pleasant. I think this strain would work best for someone that can handle strong sativas. I did get some anxiety and chest tightness but not that bad. I would recommend this strain for daytime use. I felt euphoric and happy. Very talkative. Great for having deep conversation. \u000aTHCA 25.55%\u000aTHC 23.07 %\u000aCBD 0.05%

VHappy Happy Happy -  the only way to describe the effect.   I have depression and there is a significant improvement in my mood and affect after using Flo.  I get chatty as well.  This can leave to a bad case of the munchies - food tastes so much better with this - so  leave healthy snacks like fruit around if you use this strain lots or you will be putting on the pounds.  \u000a\u000aThe smoke itself is fairly mild and I experience no coughing or harshness.   I  experience a very slight touch of paranoia when I use too much but I  do not notice that effect with a few hits.  \u000a\u000aHighly recommended if you have depression.

VI was recommended this strain when trying out a new dispensary. It is quite the sativa dominate hybrid. The bud was heavily frosted, a light sage green color, with a small amount of brown pistols. The smell of this bud is what does it for me. It is the sweetest, creamiest, cakeiest smelling bud i have ever had the pleasure of inhaling. And the taste is quite similar, sweet and creamy/cakey but not as strong as the scent. The effects where also pleasing. Flo definitely gives you some energy and a nice cerebral sativa high. It gets me thinking and and causes some creativity. Right now I&#39;m developing my own extraction processes and it helps me problem shoot and generate new ideas. It eliminates nausea and brings a sensation of hunger i haven&#39;t been able to feel in a while because of chemo and other pharma. The bud is uplifting and at smaller doses can actually be relaxing as well. Right now as I&#39;m typing this the high is a lot more racy. All in all an excellent day time strain for patients or recreation.
