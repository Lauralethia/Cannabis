VThis strain is straight out of Spain. Those breeders over there know what they&#39;re doing. I got a packet of seeds from Cannabis and Seeds, grew em and was absolutely floored. I got a huge yield. The flavor is mild and creamy. It sort of coats your mouth, but in a nice way. It tastes really good. The high is one of the longest lasting that i&#39;ve found and it&#39;s really good for stress headaches.

Vthis variety of Spanish weed is delicious, with a sweet intense smell and a flavour which reminds a bit the caramel.

VCream Caramel from Eleven Eleven Organics: This is a very good strain for relaxation. Personally (because strains react a little differently from person ton person) the effects mellow my mind a bit and helps relieves stress. I don&#39;t feel all that tired but I would imagine toking larger amounts will put me to sleep.  \u000aAs for the taste.. It reminds me of a good creamy maple syrup. It&#39;s amazing! \u000a

VI&#39;ve tested a batch of Cream Caramel that i&#39;ve grown, treated and cured myself and here is what i&#39;ve learned:\u000a\u000a1st batch was an early harvest with almost exclusively white pistils. Heady high, kind of euphoric, clear and energetic with almost non-existant couch lock. I always want to get moving when smoking a small amount of it. Though it provokes some anxiety, that could be because it&#39;s an early harvest and not cause of the strain itself. Very pleasant smell. Taste is standard skunk like. Haven&#39;t finished curing so can&#39;t tell yet.\u000aOn the down side, i seem to get a strange feeling when i smoke it. Can&#39;t exactly pin point it but something feels strange to the point that sometimes i just want the high to end.\u000aLast hours.\u000a\u000a2nd batch will be a late harvest. Will update as soon as i test it.

VWas looking for a new indica to try, once i saw the name of this i had to chose it. Buds are very light mint green in appearance with a white sheen. The smell is very sweet and sugary, it almost has a sherbet smell to it, quite lemony but some earthy tones below it. I was a little disappointed to not smell any caramel what so ever. The buds are very thick with resin but ground up fairly well. The taste of this strain is incredible, the most interesting strain ive had in a long time. Tastes just like caramel, or butterscotch, very sweet then fades into a creamy coffee on the exhale, slightly minty overtone. It really tastes amazing. Effects are very strong indica. Totally relaxed and calm, quite strong so i didnt need to use too much. Nice warm relaxed body feeling. No couch lock for me but i didnt exactly want to sit chatting to people either. No real urge for the munchies. Would 100% recommend to indica fans.

VCC is an exceptional strain.  Granted, this is the first I grew and it did grow very well in it&#39;s dry Hawaiian summer environment.  It is a hard hitter, very relaxing and calming but not sleepy at all.  Creativity and focus seemed to be another branch of the long lasting effects.  Cant say enough about this medium height... good yielding (nearly 4 oz dried/trimmed) strain.

VThis is an indica dominant that I grew and it took FOREVER in the flower room to fatten up and mature. I stopped counting after 11 weeks...It finally finished with big thick glistening buds an an awesome skunky smell. Dried and cured it was just not a standout to me. Great night time medicine to sleep, but not the best. The taste bland and if you dream it up enough you will THINK you taste caramel. Trying Karamelo next to see if it is any better. It is OK..

VMuy buena.\u000aTiene unos cogollos peque&#241;os i compactos, con un olor bastante intenso, verde intensos de color.\u000a\u000aSabor muy dulce, se nota algo a citrico, pero solo un poco cuando empieza, y despu&#233;s, deja un sabor m&#225;s seco, a hierba.\u000aOptima indica, deja una sensaci&#243;n de relajaci&#243;n general importante, baja rapidamente tensi&#243;n y stress. Perfecta antes de acostarme, para relajarme mejor y reducir mi insomnio.
