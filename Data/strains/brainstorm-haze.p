VVery decent sativa, great for creativity and staying alert and focused. This is a great wake and bake as it doesn&#39;t tire you out and gives you a nice calm happy feeling.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t however recommend smoking this before bed because it can keep you awake and wanting to do things.

VI grew this strain from seed. It is unlike any sativa dominant strain that I have grown in the past year (this year being my first as a grower). I consider it a very body dominant &quot;buzz&quot;. It doesn&#39;t slow my energy or focus on work or any other tasks at hand. Brainstorm doesn&#39;t last all day, but it will last a good 2-3 hours after smoking a cig/joint, or a few good bong rips.  I consider this strain to be a bit of a creeper! Most common or uncommon traits that I noticed about this strain are: It&#39;s strange floral yet spicy aroma. The odd flavor that I can&#39;t really exlain as a poor flush, but more of a resinous taste. I find this to be a decent day time smoke that helps slow anxiety and nervousness, as well as pain or muscle discomfort. All in all, I can say that this strain is not for everybody. It&#39;s just one that I would encourage everyone that uses medicinaly to try at least once. Especially if you are a Sativa lover!

VAfter smoking Brainstorm Haze, creativeness kicked off in 10 minutes tops. Lots of energy began to occur leaving me feel going for a leg like run around downtown. I would not smoke this stuff at night! Great use for course studies! This is my no.1 Sativa. This Sativa give you the effects you want out of a true Sativa.

But not offensive either. A little sweet, slightly cough inducing.\u000a\u000aEffects: Very mild initial high considering the THC content. Good, cerebral high, very low paranoia.\u000a\u000aDown: Easy comedown, no real headache or anxiety. Decent product.
