VCrater Lake is a great afternoon, lazy morning, or camping kind of strain. At no point is it racy or speedy, but it gives you an uplifted, motivated high at first, before slowing into a Blue Dream-esque stone. Really nice, hard to find but if you do, grab some and roll a couple joints. You&#39;ll end up having a really happy, nice day. &#128076;

VI love this strain and cant wait until its more popular.  The high is so clear and relaxing. I got Crater Lake in a live resin and even in high doses, .1-.2 gram dabs, you still feel extremely balanced and calm and clear and in control. i took a huge dab of it after not having smoked for 12 hours and it was just lovely. if you see this strain in your local dispensary do not hesitate to pick up an 8th or 2 ;)

VI had the Crater Lake #6 Strain. I really enjoy it. It really helps me focus and get things to done if I choose too. I usually smoke this before I have to do chores around the house. Not a super long last high, usually around 1.5-2 hours for me but I only take 2-3 hits since I don&#39;t need more than that. It starts off strong and tapers off really nicely. Definitely a favorite.

VThis strain is no doubt one of my top favorites to smoke. Very bright green buds, thick trichromes and the high is super heavy. Crater Lake dominates other top shelf buds when it comes to the quality of high you get.

VOne of my favorites. This puts you in a euphoric, productive state of mind. Great for social gatherings or really any talkative situation. This buzzy head high, is beautifully partnered with a relaxing body high. Great overall daytime strain. Just don&#39;t smoke too much or you might end up locked into the couch thinking about life for hours :)

VThis strain blew my mind. Very similar to blue dream in taste and high. Imo crater lake is just as good if not better than blue dream. Perfectly balanced hybrid.
