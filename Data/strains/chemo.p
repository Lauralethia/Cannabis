VVery narcotic, valuable for every kind of ailment, amazing taste, amazing stone, full tingly body buzz, crazy munchies, stops nausea, lessens stress, very calming mentally and physically, lulls to a deep sleep. The type of weed you wake up to find your hand still stuck the Doritos bag haha. Every insomniac owes it to themselves to try this one

VI have smoked this strain since the late 90&#39;s and can attest to it&#39;s Canadian availability and rumored medical quality. This strain completely embodies an Indica. There is a very heavy sedative effect, great for sleep, pain and appetite. Watch out for red eyes and hunger on this strain. If you have something important don&#39;t use this strain.

This is a true Indica great for pain such as muscle spasms and sciatica which is absolutely agonizing pain

VI can always count on chemo to obliterate my pain, but this time the  bud is exceptional. It wasn&#39;t bedtime, and I wasn&#39;t sleepy yet, but as soon as I closed my eyes was flying through a colorful neon tunnel. That only happens with music and really high quality meds, but today I had no music.  An hour later I was so sleepy that I didn&#39;t want to vape the second half of the bowl.  Bonus- it was tasty, smelly, and smooth. I hope there is still some left when I come back on payday!

VOne of my top favourite strains! It&#39;s been used a lot for cancer patients, and although I&#39;m not one myself, I was blessed enough to receive 1/2oz, but was never able to get anymore after that. This strain is known as an indica, and oh boy does it wear it&#39;s title proudly. If you plan to do anything in the evening, I suggest not doing so. UBC is potent and will leave even veterans flat on their ass. The sheer couchlock you receive gives you the impression of a gravitational change. It&#39;s heavily euphoric too, leaving you looking spooked and confused while retaining that uplifted feeling. The muscle relaxing and pain reliving aspects to this strain shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly. If you haven&#39;t slept in awhile, here&#39;s your one way ticket to the ends of the universe and back. If you are able to escape the grasps of an instant KO, have some visine or eye drops around because you&#39;re eyes will be redder than the devil&#39;s dick. I hope to find more one day, it&#39;s difficult in my province to get strains you want, but they still have a variety of choices. Anyways, that&#39;s the UBC Chemo experience! \u000a\u000aStrain features:\u000a- I didn&#39;t really know what colour the leaves where since the nugs where triple battered in trichomes. At this point in my reviews, I think the amount of kief that has been mentioned that slather each strain doesn&#39;t compare to UBC Chemo. \u000a- This strain has a lot of foxtails as well, and give the strain a really cool shimmer\u000a- If you use your hands to crush or pick up this strain, make sure to check your fingers for thc, because the nugs are heavily coated, like a Winnipeg or Minnesota winter\u000a\u000aSmell:\u000a- Cheese, yes cheese\u000a- Earthy, piney, did I mention cheese? Subtle kushy tones as well, but I forgot to mention cheese.\u000a\u000aTaste:\u000a- piney, and kushy, not so cheesy like the smell, but some sort of really really subtle hazelnutty/spicy taste\u000a\u000aAnother indica for insomniacs, but I can also see this used by people with intense bodily pains and aches. This strain shows no mercy to the fridge as well. YOU WILl EAT whether you like it or not. \u000aI&#39;m glad that cancer patients have some variety in their strains, UBC Chemo has a lot of medical properties, but can easily be a recreational strain for those seeking the stoned vibe.

VChemo&#39;s effects were very good but was not a very enjoyable smoke as I found it to be harsh when smoking in a joint. Not saying it&#39;s bad weed, in fact it was lovely - just didn&#39;t taste all that great. Buds were dark almost dark green buds with small hues of purple. Smoke was thick and heavy and upon exhale but kinda tasted &quot;burnt&quot; to me. Effects were strong and long lasting. \u000a\u000aOVERALL GRADE: 7  / 10

VAn extremely powerful indica ideal for medicating at night. Just one dose of Chemo sends waves of relaxation throughout the entire body and floods the mind with a similar blissful relaxation. Higher doses of Chemo will bring on an intense feeling of sedation, eventually followed by deep sleep. Not an overly flavourful strain; but an earthy taste with a slight hint of mint and woody undertones are present. The smell of this strain are much stronger than its taste, emitting a pungent forest like aroma with hints of mint, pine and wood. Great choice for anyone looking for a reliable night-time medication.

This chemo right here..... is a............\u000a\u000aPotion. Not medicine.. not a cure.. not a drug.. a potion for serenity. \u000a\u000aI\u2019ve been on a very time consuming and annoying.. social media type addicted hunt, to find a strain that is right for me. For my anxiety and depression (prescribed: clonazepam and escitalopram) and this shit right here.. is a purple velvet glove of subtle love type beast... dosage is oh so crucial. One toke from a joint and nothing more, will have you floating in a land of everything luxurious.. from the fresh air we\u2019ve been blessed with... to even this surprisingly.. amazing feeling of our own skin providing you with all these irrefutable positive chills... is what chemo will give you. Treat her the wrong way... and she\u2019ll have you feeling anxious just like you would if you did something that would prompt a negative thought spinning through your mind for days/weeks/months on end. \u000a\u000aShe is beautiful. And I would love for everyone with a truly good heart and mind (regardless of the bullshit you\u2019ve done and how much you\u2019ve beaten yourself up but are sincerely trying to find and continue down the right path) to try this wonderful strain. My personal quest continues... but I am very glad that this strain will be a part of my journey that lies ahead..... \u000a\u000aPeace and love. All the best.

Indica but I still recommend Chemo as your GoTo strain for Pain, Stress, Anxiety and Insomia. I mentionned Insomia because I sleep like a baby after. You don&#39;t feel tired at all after taking it. No side Effects at all neither. It&#39;s smells very good and don&#39;t hesitate to take it after a smoking flower of any strain. It will be make the effect even better. You really feel in control of the situation. Enjoy.

VSo, we all use cannabis for all kinds of situations.  For me, Chemo has one use: medicine.  For those hoping to curb anxiety , relieve pain and sleep, you will never need another strain.  This is powerful medicine.  You can try to watch a movie on this, or socialize with a couple friends.  But you&#39;re wasting your time and money.   A Big euphoric wave will crush your stress, the powerful body high will dull pain completely, and after a couple hours you will need to sleep. Need. To. Sleep.  I keep this around like Tylenol.  Newer smokers, look elsewhere. This is a world champion cruiserweight indica.  A one punch knockout every night.  Get this if youre need relief from symptoms.  If you&#39;re looking for recreational fun, go find it someplace else.

VAmazing \u201cbefore bed smoke\u201d. Relaxes all my muscles, clears my mind from stress and just puts me right to sleep. I don\u2019t consider this one a social strain. I don\u2019t feel creative or curious or chatty \u2013 I just want to sleep. No giggles, and if I try to watch a movie or read, my attention span is short as I just want to nod off. Hasn\u2019t given me the munchies, but I usually smoke and go right to bed. Be interesting to try it during the day, but it\u2019s such a great sleep/relaxation/bedtime strain, I think I\u2019ll just keep it at that. I\u2019m someone who tends to let stress of work eat at my head \u2013 Chemo makes those bothersome thoughts go away. Great for getting rest and relaxing. Highly recommend. Great body effects \u2013 makes me feel light \u2013 like a big gigantic sigh of relief. A must-have from now on.

VBy far my favorite all-time strain for pain. Suffering from severe chronic pain related to fibromyalgia for over a decade, the most relief I&#39;ve ever found was in the Chemo strain. It&#39;s like a super strong ibuprofen with muscle relaxing qualities and inflammation stomping goodness. Highly recommended for medicinal use for pain, anxiety, stress, headaches, and related nausea or stomach issues. I seek this strain often, but prefer heavier doses for nighttime use as it can and usually does make yah dozey. Though smaller doses during the day prove beneficial to ease pain and calm high anxiety levels.

VIt&#39;s very relaxing and mellows you out so much that it became extremely hard to stay awake. The herb basically enticed me and motivated me to just sleep. There is an overwhelming feeling of body relaxation and your mind is so toned down. You get creative thoughts at first, but then you gradually tone down. I can definitely see this strain being useful for cancer patients, hence the name. Any person wanting to use this medicinally, whether it be for pain or insomnia, has pretty much hit the nail on the head. I would like to note that this strain felt quite potent, and this is coming from someone who has built a tolerance (from having consumed everyday, several times a day, for a span of two weeks, before going herbless for the past 5 days). As such, you should start with small amounts. I felt quite dizzy at one point, and when looking at the &quot;negatives&quot; section of this strain, dizziness appears as the second most common effect at the time of writing this, so I would recommend having some slight experience first with other strains, namely milder, hybrid strains, before trying this goliath of an indica. This strain is not one to use during the day, unless you have absolutely nothing to do; I wouldn&#39;t recommend this strain for work or school too. I didn&#39;t feel much in the way of dryness in either the mouth or eyes, and although my appetite definitely increased, it was controllable. Overall, you will feel spaced out and content.

VCannaCentral: &quot;Chemo was supposedly developed by the Canadian government in the 70\u2032s for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments. The medicinal value is amazing and the strain is quite potent with a hashy taste. Recognized amongst the medical community as the best strain available for chronic pain and nausea&quot;. All I know is daammnn! This stuff is hardcore! My caregiver got this strain down to the T, one of even his top 3 strains! (which is saying something if you knew the guy lol)! Its got a deep hashy/almost pnemonia smell at first. The taste is all its own tho, with a almost citrus bite at the end of the exhale which u can taste very well if using a vape like me. The medicinal effects are very powerful and this stuff will most def get you stoned from the first rip. It took awhile before my tolerance starting building up to withstand more than just one bowl of it! My severe headaches and muscle spasms subsided IMMENSELY! Pretty much no pain, which is amazing for my conditions. The only downside for me is that it gave me the munchies real bad, as it was desined that way for cancer patients undergoing chemo radiation. Sleep is sound and peaceful with just a few quick rips right before bed time, and if you really rip a bowl then u might just comatose! GET THIS IF U CAN!\u000a\u000a

As others have said, a little goes a long way, so go easy if you&#39;re not a regular cannabis user. Also, best used in the evening, because you&#39;ll likely fall asleep on the couch. Chemo is one of the best strains for insomnia, no doubt.

One of only ones I have tried in my life to do so. Too much for in day time. Tastes woodsy and vapes nice too.

Vthis is the most relaxing high I&#39;ve had. a complete couch potato driven indica with extremely relaxing and numbing effects. I wouldn&#39;t recommend smoking this before a long walk or long way home because your feet can get sore very easily. this stuff is extremely strong and feels great all the time.

VChemo has a narcotic effect. \u000a\u000aFirst I felt a warming sensation behind the eyes which slowly worked its way down my body. \u000a\u000aNothing too intimidating as it did not take me to the edge... I found it to be very relaxing and enjoyable.\u000a\u000aThis is definitely an evening strain that is relaxing and enjoyable provided you don&#39;t need to pretend that you are sober or need to initiate conversation with non par takers. \u000a\u000aEvery strain has its time and place... This one is great if you want to just relax, unwind, and chill at home alone in the evening and get a good nights sleep... Although I did feel a little groggy the next day.

VHad that strain back in the 1990&#39;s for the first time. A thing I like about the one I tried in 2015 is that it respected all the parameters and characteristics linked to the strain. It&#39;s the perfect strain to kill pain and to gain appetite. It&#39;s extremely potent so beware the beginners, use it in small quantity first to see how you react to the substance before taking massive quantity. That said this is definitely not my type of weed. It taste and smell terrible. The smell is stereotypical of what you think weed will be and exactly what you wanted to conceal from mom and dad back in the days. That smells pungent, earthy, skunkish and herbaceous but not in a good mix and it stays were you vaped or smoked for a long time so use deodorant if you like the effect but not the smell. It produce a lot of smoke. It taste terrible, earth and woody mainly but with herbaceous notes. A positive note about the smell of your smoking or vaping instruments is that after a few hours they will smell a good roasted tea flavour like many indicas. The buzz is very boring mentally. Help you sleep and really keeps pain away so that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t rated it 0. I&#39;ll definitely pass the next time even if the one I have now is really well grown with lots of trichromes.

It&#39;s flavor, it&#39;s smell, the way it looks and tastes is superb. It&#39;s a divine treat to enjoy on weekends and after work. I usually smoke a couple bowls in the morning before work but with this strain, I only ever need one. Pine smell and peppery flavor.

VFor what people have said is a heavy indica, this strain is actually quite mild and mellow, to the point of having very little effect at all, especially on the more seasoned smoker. The buds are slightly leafy with a darker green tone, and they break up nicely.\u000a\u000aTaste was very bland and seemed like a generic street dealer weed. Definitely much better strains to seek out for pain relief, such as Death Bubba or WMD. Try to avoid this disappointment.

VHello Everyone!  In hopes of combating my insomnia, I purchased this strain in shatter form to vape in the evening.  In terms of taste, I found it reminded me of Chamomile tea, coincidentally a herbal tea best for calming and eventual sleepiness.  As for the effects, it\u2019s in the body; a most relaxing sensation that takes over in a matter of minutes.  Truth be told it\u2019s the best Indica I\u2019ve consumed to help with my insomnia.  Additionally, I fall asleep fast enough that the munchies don\u2019t have time to hit me (thankfully).  Since this strain was developed by UBC to combat the effects of chemotherapy, I must say they did a great job; a cancer patient can smoke this and feel clear headed and functional, they wouldn\u2019t become lost in \u201cstoner thoughts\u201d.  So, if you\u2019re looking for a more psychedelic experience, this is not the strain for you.  But if you\u2019re looking for quick relief from insomnia, you found it right here.  Enjoy!

VIt&#39;s very relaxing and mellows you out so much that it became extremely hard to stay awake. The herb basically enticed me and motivated me to just sleep. There is an overwhelming feeling of body relaxation and your mind is so toned down. You get creative thoughts at first, but then you gradually tone down. I can definitely see this strain being useful for cancer patients, hence the name. Any person wanting to use this medicinally, whether it be for pain or insomnia, has pretty much hit the nail on the head. I would like to note that this strain felt quite potent, and this is coming from someone who has built a tolerance (from having consumed everyday, several times a day, for a span of two weeks, before going herbless for the past 5 days). As such, you should start with small amounts. I felt quite dizzy at one point, and when looking at the &quot;negatives&quot; section of this strain, dizziness appears as the second most common effect at the time of writing this, so I would recommend having some slight experience first with other strains, namely milder, hybrid strains, before trying this goliath of an indica. This strain is not one to use during the day, unless you have absolutely nothing to do; I wouldn&#39;t recommend this strain for work or school too. I didn&#39;t feel much in the way of dryness in either the mouth or eyes, and although my appetite definitely increased, it was controllable. Overall, you will feel spaced out and content.

The strain I got was UBC Chemo. probably around 18-20% THC.\u000aI suffer from severe insomnia and smoking this in my vaporizer before bed relaxes me and puts me to sleep.

VIf you&#39;re looking for a velcroed-to-the-couch Indica, or just really calming, effective and pleasant smelling medicine, look no further than Chemo. I found that it took only two or three bowls to put me in a world of euphoria and sedation. I ended up watching Planet Earth for the seventh time. It&#39;s got a very pungent smell, and taste, and will probably have some purple calyxes, if you&#39;re getting Jordan of the Islands genetics.

As others have said, a little goes a long way, so go easy if you&#39;re not a regular cannabis user. Also, best used in the evening, because you&#39;ll likely fall asleep on the couch.

It&#39;s like a super strong ibuprofen with muscle relaxing qualities and inflammation stomping goodness. Highly recommended for medicinal use for pain, anxiety, stress, headaches, and related nausea or stomach issues. I seek this strain often, but prefer heavier doses for nighttime use as it can and usually does make yah dozey. Though smaller doses during the day prove beneficial to ease pain and calm high anxiety levels.

I don\u2019t feel creative or curious or chatty \u2013 I just want to sleep. No giggles, and if I try to watch a movie or read, my attention span is short as I just want to nod off. Hasn\u2019t given me the munchies, but I usually smoke and go right to bed. Be interesting to try it during the day, but it\u2019s such a great sleep/relaxation/bedtime strain, I think I\u2019ll just keep it at that. I\u2019m someone who tends to let stress of work eat at my head \u2013 Chemo makes those bothersome thoughts go away. Great for getting rest and relaxing. Highly recommend.

VCannaCentral: &quot;Chemo was supposedly developed by the Canadian government in the 70\u2032s for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatments. The medicinal value is amazing and the strain is quite potent with a hashy taste. Recognized amongst the medical community as the best strain available for chronic pain and nausea&quot;. All I know is daammnn! This stuff is hardcore! My caregiver got this strain down to the T, one of even his top 3 strains! (which is saying something if you knew the guy lol)! Its got a deep hashy/almost pnemonia smell at first. The taste is all its own tho, with a almost citrus bite at the end of the exhale which u can taste very well if using a vape like me. The medicinal effects are very powerful and this stuff will most def get you stoned from the first rip. It took awhile before my tolerance starting building up to withstand more than just one bowl of it! My severe headaches and muscle spasms subsided IMMENSELY! Pretty much no pain, which is amazing for my conditions. The only downside for me is that it gave me the munchies real bad, as it was desined that way for cancer patients undergoing chemo radiation. Sleep is sound and peaceful with just a few quick rips right before bed time, and if you really rip a bowl then u might just comatose! GET THIS IF U CAN!\u000a\u000a

VOne of the heaviest, if not THE heaviest, indica I have ever tried. Oh it&#39;s heavy! Nice dark dense bud that filled up the lovely grinder, with instant pungent tones of kush. This may be the best damn medicine for pain, insomnia, and general lack of appetite. Puff, vape, eat away and enjoy life, food, and sleep. Your body will be heavily sedated, you WILL want to sleep, or have a nice meal before dozing off. Take my word, I&#39;ve tried a lot of strains and this one somehow sticks with me. If I am ever in any sort of great pain, I&#39;ll remember Chemo and wish I had some for the moment. \u000a\u000aLook: 5/5\u000aScent: 5/5\u000aHigh: 5/5\u000aBurnout: 5/5\u000aOverall: 5/5

VSo the rumours are that this strain was created to assist people going through chemotherapy, and due to that I expected a heavy hitter. I was wrong.   This strain is for evening use, but did nothing to assist with my insomnia. It did however help with appetite loss and reduced my pain slightly.  This smells pungently woody and has a woody and earthy flavour.

VGot this strain here in Canada and at first impressions i thought wow this doesn&#39;t look like that special of a bud. It was just average, but with a strong smell but it&#39;s very woody, earthy and a natural musk smell to it. Once grounded up through the grinder, the woody musk comes alive and the bud itself breaks very evenly. The high and effects are a creeper. I took a hit out of a bong and i was very indica baked. It&#39;s not a strong strain at first, but i&#39;m a daily moderate user and after a day at work, it just hit my spot very well. Talking full effects you get that muscle tension relief in the shoulders and leg portions of your body. The rest is very relaxed and some can say the couch melting feeling will also be there if you get that. There is a bit of a head high, but it doesn&#39;t make your eyes dry or feel weighted down. All in all it&#39;s a super uplifting and relaxing, calming strain. As the name suggests if you have Chemo or are going through it, i would say this would be a very comforting strain i can&#39;t say from experience but it is very happy relaxing high. In the future if you see it, pick up a gram or eighth and enjoy.
