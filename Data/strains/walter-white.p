VWow no wonder it&#39;s called what it is, this gram filled up my grinder with a nice amount to throw right back in the joint.. Now I feel like running a marathon, and when the burnout comes you&#39;ll feel like you have. It&#39;s more in line with green crack this strain. Up then down, but it&#39;s not like you&#39;ll be put to sleep. I&#39;ve tried it at work and still very functional. Highly recommended, just a little harsh in the morning I find. 4.5/5

VThis stuff is very mellow. I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d smoke it first thing in the morning, but it&#39;s got enough go that it would be a good afternoon weed. Not a kickstarter--personally I wouldn&#39;t do it before any job I HAD to get done, but I would totally take a hit or two while I was in the middle of a task and feel confident it would energize rather than derail me. Mildly spacey, relaxing, and clear-headed enough to let you do life. Great for writing. Definitely loving it.

VGreat hybrid strain! Felt a pretty intense head high as my body relaxed and melted into the chair. Not as heavy as my fav indica - G13 and not as buzzy as Green Crack. It\u2019s a nice in-between but strong high. Definite citrus taste and aroma. Smooth smoke that doesn\u2019t give that feeling like your chest is on fire. Walter White will be in my hybrid rotation for sure

VI picked this up at universal collective.. For taste alone I would give this review a one star. I feel like I&#39;m smoking a cigarette.. very little to no taste except smoke, buds smell like dirt. It is very weak and mild compared to most strains in my opinion.. \u000a\u000aIt feels like a cbd strain in ways. I feel good and happy when I smoke it.. focused and energetic but nothing to write home about... Almost as if I had a lot of caffeine or something. Keep in mind I try 3 new strains a week and I honestly would not get this again. There is just too many better strains out there. Peace and love :) &amp; happy smoking

VJust got some Walter White OG from Blum on Decatur.  All I did was open the bag, break it up, rolled a j and put it in a smell free tube.  The entire upstairs of my house smelled from just that.  Couldn&#39;t wait to puff on it and when I did, the taste was amazing and one who has a high tolerance, I was buzzed out of my brain.  Enjoy it!
