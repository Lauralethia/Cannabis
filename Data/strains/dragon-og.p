VI picked up some of this for my girlfriend and I to try. I have smoked some both from a bowl and using my Pax 2... Have to say the bowl definitely laid me out. The Pax 2 at medium heat gave a really good clean high. Super heady and I think both of us got going a bit.

VFire. Sniff the bud and feel alive. Smoke this and feel limitless. But it&#39;s time for bed - and I feel sleepy at 2a. Nite.\u000a\u000ap.s - Will try in the day forest later could easily hike and sight see on this. shout out to Bud Nation. Also I want to play cards for some reason too. Like baccarat for instance. &#127773;

VThis is another phenomenal strain that I have come across.  Dragon OG is a great daytime smoke.  Dragon OG gives the body a nice relaxed high while stimulating creativity and energizes all at the same time.  The flower is very pungent and dense and covered in a blanket of tricomes.   Use in moderation as too much can mean nap time!\u000a\u000a&#128293;&#128293;JediForce&#128293;&#128293;

VLove hybrids!!! \u000a\u000aI&#39;m absolutely IN LOVE with this strain!!! When I first saw this strain I loved the way the bud looked. The buds themselves are very dense. light green with VERY visible pollen on the outermost layer. \u000a\u000aThe flavor of this strain is semi sweet on the inhale. faint hint of bubble gum. On the exhale a nice smooth, cool, slightly peppery flavor. \u000a\u000aThe effects of this strain are extremely versatile. Dragon definitely packs a punch, but the ride to the &quot;crescendo&quot; is a smooth one. One could definitely function and perform daily tasks. \u000a\u000aI feel a nice smooth buzz, and then get hungry and sleepy. i think this strain would be great for those suffering from anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia. \u000a\u000aI saved some of this strain! It&#39;s one I want to share with others on special occasions!!!

VPhenomenally stony strain that is felt from first inhale like a smooth sizzling warm sensation growing outward from chest &amp; nasal area.  The odor of this bud is very intense, beautiful &amp; unable to be hidden so heads up.  If there was one word to describe this flower it would be &quot;content&quot;.  Strong enough that one toke of the flower will leave user on a calm ride for a few hours.  When there is a need for focus this is not the strain to overdo because of the spaced out high produced.  On the top of my list for Kush &amp; very highly recommended for pain relief when needed at high levels.  Also a great medicine for appetite enhancing for Dragon OG brings on a heavy case of munchies before settling into the more couch locked second half of buzz.

VI love pressing this strain into tasty rosin. The flowers I bought were tested at 27.9% and yielded 23% at 200F for 3 minutes under 2 tons of pressure. The rosin was a light tan color and buddered up nicely. Very light, fresh taste but not floral or fruity. It is the most potent of the 12 rosins in my stash right now and rides the line between sativa/indica so is good for both relaxing in an alert way or being productive in a dreamy way.

VThis is an exceptional strain that really compliments a friendly hang out sesh or really just chilling and playing some DND, because let&#39;s face it...it&#39;s Dragon OG! Sweet flavor with notes of that really stoner friendly OG on the back end. Highly recommend you give this one a try if all the dragons haven&#39;t already gone up in flames and smoke.
