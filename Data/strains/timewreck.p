VHow do I love thee, let me count the ways...\u000a\u000a1. You are a cerebral dream. Your head high has me singing Chi-Lites \u201cYou got me going, stoned out of my mind.\u201d You are my muse. You spark my creativity. You make me feel so focused and motivated.\u000a\u000a2. Anxiety free. You are a drama free zone. You know I have difficulty in social situations. You support me, I feel so euphoric, happy and talkative when you are with me. I never want you to go. Which leads me to number three...\u000a\u000a3. You are so potent. A couple hits of you and you got me going steady for two to three hours. \u000a\u000a4. You smell and taste fantastic. Hints of citrus, even pears come through over this earthy savory base. I could bathe in you.\u000a\u000aTimewreck makes a great wake n bake strain. Not too racy, but still incredibly potent. &lt;3

VThis strain makes me happy and upbeat. Somewhat focused, and it&#39;s a fine choice for a daytime mind/body high. I like its smell from its baggie, it&#39;s not pungent at all. From a recommendation by a local budtender, this is so far my favorite strain (Cinex is a close second). I perfer sativas, as most of the time I don&#39;t want a couchlock effect.  Discosure: I&#39;m quite new to marijuana, only just this my 47th year on this planet actually having disposition to experiment with the herb.

VI&#39;m normally not big on Sativas, but I had the opportunity to get some very beautifully grown Timewreck with a high THC content and a pretty good CBD content. I like CBD for my anxiety and PTSD. So I smoked a bowl and immediately felt super uplifted and happy, social anxiety was gone, I was bubbly and talkative, it was nice. I definitely recommend this flower to anyone looking for a great daytime smoke.

VGreat strain for motivation and pain relief without the couch lock of an indica. Yields are average for a sativa. Anywhere from 1-3 oz per plant depending on grow type and container size. Once put into flower cycle the plant almost doubles in size. 9 weeks is usually perfect for this strain. Sweet smell with hints of lemon, lime and the signature smell of baby poop from TGA Genetics. In small amounts the high lasts 2-3 hrs with clarity but in large doses it does become very euphoric and you turn into a puddle very quickly&#128513;&#128513;. To obtain the best flavours organic growing is recommended in a dirt grow with a 5 gallon pot.

Sometimes peppery in smell, and sometimes reminiscent of movie theater buttered popcorn. Timewreck allows me to function without haziness but in larger doses it often leads to uncontrollable giggles and bursts of laughter. LOVE this in the morning! My go to strain

VVery nice strain. Euphoric, uplifting yet relaxing. I put this strain up there with ATF in my top 5. I would buy this everytime its available. I wasn&#39;t fond of mixing and matching with this strain. It is just fine on its own and adding other strains really seems to take away the over all effects of Time wreck. I had some indica style body effects that were pleasant, reduced pain and increased blood flow in the body.

I enjoyed the effects of this sativa concentrate more than I thought I would as it was not nxiety inducing for me at all.\u000a\u000aThe flavor was a pretty straight forward earthy sweetness.

VThis is becoming my go-to for anxiety and bouts of depression.  My family massively betrayed me and it cost me a relationship with my son.  This has the nightmares pretty well stopped, the daytime stuff pretty well managed, and is just a nice medication.   Everything you want from a VA medication without all the pills hangover side effects and withdrawal symptoms of SSRI&#39;s.  It&#39;s a shame marijuana isn&#39;t prescribed by the VA yet.  It&#39;s coming though.  I feel genuinly human again using this as a tool to grow out of PTSD and become a contributing member of society again.  it&#39;s taken time to find exactly the right strain and dose.  highly recommend for people who have been through serious trauma.  This in conjunction with outdoors is a winning therapy model.

VThis strain is hands down AWESOME it&#39;s very beautiful and the taste and smell lives up to its appearance. I usually smoke indica for my pain relief but this sativa does a great job of that! Definitely a 2 maybe 3 hitter if your a light weight, 4 maybe 5 if you smoke every day. The batch I picked up last a while as well, no need to go back to the pipe for at least 4-5 hours! Definitely will be picking more up if the dispensary I go to (GTWC) still has some!

VI&#39;m not sure this is the best daytime medicine for me. It&#39;s very strong, which is good, however, the effects on me are not compatible with being productive at all. It&#39;s got me feeling dopey and spacy and couchlocked. But the pain relief is exceptional. It seems a great strain if you&#39;re injured and need to be still; It soothes the restless parts of me.
