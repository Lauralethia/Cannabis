VDefinitely a new favorite. I like smoking this at night once the kid is in bed, I can stay up and watch so many Netflix shows. This one keeps you up all night. Usually when I\u2019m coming down from smoking sativas I get tired... nope not this one. \u000a\u000aThis tastes pretty good and the smell... omg so good. If your store has this, don\u2019t pass it up, give it a try. It\u2019s really really good.

VI&#39;m new to the vape scene so I asked my local budtender what strain he thought would be great for getting some creative writing done. He suggested Top Shelf&#39;s Pineapple Super Silver Haze based on his personal experience, and I&#39;m SO glad he did.\u000a\u000aThis strain gave me a strong head high that wasn&#39;t too overwhelming, and I was able to sit down and get a bit of writing done. Goal = accomplished. \u000a\u000aNot only does this strain make me feel euphoric and motivated, the taste is super sweet and tangy like a juicy, ripened pineapple. So, so good. Will definitely be keeping this strain on hand at all times!

VAs always with Top Shelf strains (you can say I&#39;m a fan of this grower), it was perfectly dried covered in gorgeous crystals. It crumbles beautifully between my fingers into my paper.

VI don&#39;t usually get sativas simply because I do all my smoking in the evening to help with my insomnia. However, last weekend a few friends and I were going on a sort of camping trip so I wanted a strain I could smoke in the day and still feel social. Pineapple Super SIlver Haze was a beautiful, compact and sweet haze with a tropical undertone. My particular phenotype had a more diesel taste than a tropical one but the smoke was still fantastic. Clean, smooth, and burned amazing in a spliff. I never felt anxious or paranoid which is always my worry with a strong sativa. Instead I just felt euphoric with a very heady high and was still able to either be social while drinking and hanging with friends or hop on the ATV&#39;s and still feel totally in control. This is a special strain and recommend to anyone looking for a tasty, clean smoke that leaves you clear-minded and social without the heavy body effects.

VGreat strain! It has all the qualities I look for in a sativa-a nice wave of euphoria and happiness, with slight boost in energy and focus, but also calming and relaxing. The buds are absolutely beautiful and the scent and taste of pineapple is so strong it&#39;s crazy delicious! From Top Shelf at Green Collar Cannabis 20.2% THC and a whopping 1.06% CBD! I&#39;m glad I picked up an eighth-this will definitely be my go-to daytime strain while I have it :)

VI&#39;m not the biggest sativa guy. Usually if I smoke too much l will not enjoy the high as much with my anxiety... However this strain is a hit! So Stoney.
