VPleasant strain, but a little is all you need, and I learned that the hard way. Had my girlfriend roll the majority of it into some mixed joints to give away because I was ambivalent the first few times I smoked it, and saved a small nug to give it one last go for writing my review. With one bong hit, I feel very centered, quiet inside, my thoughts are clear but also capricious, warm, tingly body high. What I lack is focus, but I&#39;m not so high I can&#39;t put my mind to something and take care of it once I&#39;m there, all the while feeling very mellow. That said, this was recommended to me by a budtender because they were out of Bruce Banner, and it&#39;s nothing like that. BB&#39;s focus lets me avoid anxiety for the most part if I get a little too high. Mst gives me bad anxiety attacks with too many bong rips, and I know now that&#39;s why I was so ambivalent about it each time I smoked it before--it&#39;s easy to go overboard. If you never experience anxiety with certain strains, you might really like this, but it&#39;s not for me. It&#39;s stony enough that adding a more chilling weed to calm things down if I overdid it (like Girl Scout Cookies) would probably just make me sleepy. But I would never discourage another person from trying it.

VI live in Montana and am a patient of Lion Heart and have personally tried it and I find it to go well with anything piece wise that might suit your fancy :) I personally Vape mine but I know not everyone has the money for Vapes or just prefer ( other ) :) but let me assure you it&#39;s good any route you take :D as for effects it deals well with *Physical Pain* well and I personally have had positive *Headach Relief* it&#39;s very Relaxing but not so much that you want to sit around :P you will probably want to do some thing outside or inside constructive :)

VDeserves every bit of the rave you always hear whenever someone mentions Silver Tip. Excellent cross of strains. Tight and dense nugs, perfectly manicured and break up very nicely for whatever your preferred method of smoking is. Very frosty. Flavor-packed - nothing harsh - terps re very prominent without being overwhelming. High is immaculate. This is one of the few strains that will get me within the walls of a dispensary in Eugene. However, I was lucky enough to score this from a private grower.

VNicely balanced hybrid. I dig this one it&#39;s a great campfire strain. Relaxing but enough of the Silver Haze comes through that it leaves you alert.The Haze comes on instantly, then settles nicely into a nice body relaxation. I&#39;ve seen some cuts of this gal test in the upper 20s thc%. Buds are definitely have more of the sativa structure, with highlights of Rosey clayxes with splashes of silver. Smell was very slight and fresh. Smoke was very smooth. Flavors profile definitely has both parents come through. The sweetness of the GDP followed up by the haziness of the SSH.

VThis strain is a very good hybrid. Frosty dark green buds near brown/orange pistols with a touch of purple but I&#39;m a little high rn and its hard for me to tell. It had a piney oaky scent. The flavor upon vaping was what i initially described as an earthy dessert, it had some sweetness. The sativa side of this hybrid shines. I waked and baked my first week of chemo and radiation with this. I was able to go to class and work on projects as well and be able to focus on them. Focusing on a chemical engineering excel sheet can be difficult sober. Nausea and stomach pain were easily relieved by close to 1.5% CBG. But at the same time the high was still relaxing. It had some creative cerebral effects as well. I would recommend to patients.

VPicked up some Silver Tip to try.  It took a little time to fully come on.  There was a light initial high that came on within a couple minutes.  Seemed to last a while and I was beginning to think this was a dud. Then band it hit me hard and fast.  A very powerful high. After a couple minutes it seems to step down a bit or maybe I just became more comfortable with it.  I was walking my dog and noticed that my legs felt like they had weights on them.  Didn&#39;t seem to interfere with my walking but legs definitely felt heavy.  This particular Silver Tip had a pretty high THC percentage so don&#39;t know if lower percentages would produce a similar high. A little dry mouth but not too bad.

VMy personal favorite strain for relaxing recreation. Silvertip has a strange herbal flavor that can cause a tingly sensation in the lips. Its effects are for me relaxing and perfect for movie time or a video game. It always has a strong and fast pain relief for me and its my go to on high pain days. I have noticed some of my friends are put into a drowsy state after smoking , it doesn&#39;t make me sleepy, but I have noticed this strains effects and can really vary from person to person.

VI don\u2019t know if I can ever smoke anything else after Montana Silvertip. I started with 1 gram after being recommended to me for depression, adhd, multiple sclerosis related pain, fatigue and social anxiety.I felt curious, talkative, bubbly, and focused. My adhd meds had long worn off, and I felt so incredibly focused. Traces of depression, fatigue, neurological pain, exhaustion - poof - up in smoke. No munchies! No anxiety, yet lots of energy. Yet, with all that energy, I could still sleep really well. This made video games, Netflix, and hanging out with a really good friend the most incredible evening because the social anxiety we both have got caught in the bong water. I woke up the next morning feeling revitalized, energized, and focused - no wake &amp; bake required.

VThis strain handles very well in concentrate form, usually very stable even when not winterized. Yields in excess of 25% are common, but unless finely diffused, prepare to cough.  Then, prepare your munchies, because they&#39;re coming.

VThis cut from Buddy Boy in Spokane from 7/1/16 is now 8 months old.  Terps have faded...color is lackluster...aroma is pleasant but not potent but does smell like God&#39;s Gift a bit.  The flavor is a lot like God&#39;s Gift...hashy...citrus...grape/berry...makes sense if you consider the cross...ssh could have og kush type phenos pretty easily...most uplifting and tranquilizing effect...this one will make you pay attention to the fact that you better be careful for at least an hour.  Then you might go to sleep depending on the dose. One of the finest hybrid Kushes I have found. This one is rated at 26.95 total and .3cbd.   A bargain at 11/g from High 5 in Vancouver WA

VThis strain has achieved Legend-status in the Montana medical cannabis community. It&#39;s one that has its imitators, but the real deal is undeniable. \u000a\u000aGDP x SSH = a knockout punch to any tension you might be feeling, but keep in mind that, for the novice (and some experienced) smokers, this one will make you cough.
