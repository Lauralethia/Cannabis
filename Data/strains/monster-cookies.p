VMonster Cookies sweetened Oscar into Fozzybear. \u000aA medium bowl  served beautifully on a Fri night, wound up from a couple of bumpy days. GSC like euphoria with GDP pain relief, except this one is a bit less sedative.  The smell and taste was mild, reminiscent of peppercorn and &quot;Hawaiian Punch&quot; drink crystals. I like the parents, and they made a nice offspring.

VMonster Cookie is the best Cookie &#128126;&#127850;! If u are a really heavy smoker then this is for you. It&#39;s strong I give you that, way strong. At first I couldn&#39;t handle it a bit, but then I man up and so the adventure began. Me and my crew ended up rolling 3 to 4 blunts. My favorite strain so far.

VThis is the only stain that puts a smile on my face, no matter what, literally a second after I take a hit.  It also feels like it&#39;s taking weight off me but pulling my shoulders down.  I love this strain. For anyone who maybe is trying to switch from benzodiazepines to marijuana, but never meshed to well with weed, or weed gave them panic attacks (my case)...I would definitely try this one.  I&#39;m using it for ptsd, anxiety, and depression. Monster cookies has gotta be one of the best I&#39;ve tried so far. It feels like I&#39;m inhaling a Valium. And it always makes me smile I love it! Plus it&#39;s great for migraines!

VOk. Let me start off by expressing my love of the real Girl Scout Cookies strain. Such a great balance and hybrid in general. With that said, if you&#39;re looking for something a little less in your face that is the signature of GSC but still want that lingering somewhere in background of a nice zoney cloud of purple-fused introspection and contemplation, well this may be just what you&#39;re looking for. Almost like GSC is in the backseat and GDP is driving, and controlling the radio. Heh. \u000a\u000aI found that it still allowed me to get stuff done and be creative but definitely more sedative. But not a traditional indica, definitely a hybrid leaning in that direction. This is a great one for dealing with stress while having to do things you don&#39;t necessarily want to do. Or zone out on a project. Some indicas I find you can drift to a negative space if you&#39;re dealing with some things that life deals you. This one puts a smile on your face once you&#39;ve crossed that threshold and gives you enough get up and go. But not too much. \u000a\u000aHad a bowl of Monster Cookies before this and a small taste of Dutch Treat, so things are good. @.@\u000aStill love me some GSC though. \u000aThis is a nice down-shift. Would have been perfect if it was like 60/40 Indica dominate reverse of the original. But it&#39;s cool. It&#39;s all cool, man.

V&#128126;&#127850; Monster Cookies is off the menu delicious. Heavy on the indica, this shimmering flower delivers a uniquely euphoric high. Long lasting in both the groovy relaxation and the focus, this cookie stands out in the bakery. Santa wouldn&#39;t get past another house if he stopped and enjoyed these cookies... the euphoria is very substantial in this member of the cookie family. I highly recommend this strain to any lover of indicas or anyone looking for a powerful uplifting blast off. Polaris did a fine job with this one. Limonene: 1.77 mg/g, a-Humulene: 1.45 mg/g, b-Caryophyllene: 1.46 mg/g.

VTop shelf quality purchased in So Cal. Emerald green with dull rusty hairs and just a few bits of purple here and there. Light in appearance because these flowers are extremely frosty; the stickiness backs that claim up. Smell, I can&#39;t pin down. It&#39;s slightly sweet with citrus and a bit of artificial white grape. When vaped the flavor is about the same, when smoked it matures to this really sweet oatmeal raisin flavor that&#39;s pleasing. The high is very euphoric and body relaxing. Relaxation extends to the head, but it&#39;s not a head high and I felt very clear. Senses are heightened and I&#39;m a bit more talkative; should be an interesting strain for anxiety. Certainly feels like a strain for a more experienced smoker, I can see the really loose, relaxed body effect making novices either feel uncomfortable or luring them to sleep.

VSo this strain was my first from a legit dispensary. I&#39;m so used to street bud so I was super excited to try something really good. Newbie here so bare with my review guys. To me, the smell when I first opened the jar was amazingly good and strong. Loaded with sticky trichomes and earthy goodness. Best bud I&#39;ve ever seen in person. Two hits from a bong and I had a near panic attack. I learned my lesson. It is really smooth and has a sweet after-taste to it. The euphoria was really intense for me and the body lock was just what I was looking for. It didn&#39;t take long to affect me either. I&#39;m so happy I got to try something this good so I HIGHLY recommend this strain for those looking at the indica direction. Take it easy if you&#39;re new to good bud such as this like me, it kicked my butt, but I&#39;m gonna do it again soon!

VMy generalized anxiety disorder is often the worst at night when I get home and just have time to think and over analyze everything basically drive myself crazy. Monster cookies is the only strain I have yet to come across that completely puts my mind at rest to enjoy things like a book television chatting with friends while also not feeling like I was about to fall asleep like other indicas I\u2019ve used for similar purposes. That being said my tolerance is extremely high so this Strain must be potent as shit however I\u2019m so grateful for it and have to get it every time it comes around. For anyone who just wants to shut that mind up and forget about all your worries to enjoy some pampering or leisure this is for you

Tastes really good, I guess you could call it &quot;Grape Mint GSC&quot; Definitely one of my favorites hands down. The smell, high, taste everything is there. 80/20 Indica Hybrid great for insomnia and pain for sure. If you ever have a chance to check it out I highly suggest this strain for people like myself with PTSD!!! When you rollup, make sure you don&#39;t have any plans because chances are you aint getting off the couch. \u000a-Fiend4Green420-

VGot nearly half a Z of this bud, some for New Years and some for myself, and I smoked this God-sent herb everyday for a week, about 4-6 times a day before New Years. Next thing you know I\u2019m basically passing out nearly everyday that week because I was falling asleep because of how strong this weed is. This is the strongest indica I\u2019ve ever had, I can\u2019t name a lot of indicas as I mainly smoke sativas, but it\u2019s far stronger than blue cheese or northern lights, but I wasn\u2019t smoking northern lights daily, so it might\u2019ve had a different effect on me if I was on it 24/7 for an entire week, like I was with monster cookies. The amount of kief I got in my 3 piece grinder was insane, I\u2019m still smoking the kief from this bud today, and I grinded it well over a week ago now&#128514; Anyway if you ever get your hands on this bud, you\u2019re in for a  unbelievably relaxing high.

VIf you&#39;re going to Netflix &amp; Chill this is definitely the right choice for that late night date night.  Love ripping into the bag and getting that wonderful forestry smell.  I can surely feel the cookie effects of relaxed, no stress zone, or pain.  I am also happy and loving life.  &#127795;

VGot nearly half a Z of this bud, some for New Years and some for myself, and I smoked this God-sent herb everyday for a week, about 4-6 times a day before New Years. Next thing you know I\u2019m basically passing out nearly everyday that week because I was falling asleep because of how strong this weed is. This is the strongest indica I\u2019ve ever had, I can\u2019t name a lot of indicas as I mainly smoke sativas, but it\u2019s far stronger than blue cheese or northern lights, but I wasn\u2019t smoking northern lights daily, so it might\u2019ve had a different effect on me if I was on it 24/7 for an entire week, like I was with monster cookies. The amount of kief I got in my 3 piece grinder was insane, I\u2019m still smoking the kief from this bud today, and I grinded it well over a week ago now&#128514; Anyway if you ever get your hands on this bud, you\u2019re in for a  unbelievably relaxing high.

VThis Indica has a very special place in my heart. Monster Cookies has such a special baked feeling. My first experience with this extraordinary strain is one of my favorite experiences with marijuana. I enjoy this beautiful substance at least once everyday and unfortunately I have gained a slight tolerance. I decided to consume two grams to compensate with this. When I say I was baked I mean I felt as if I was a freshly baked batch of Girl Scout Somoa cookies. This strain gives you a very body heavy, tingly high, but also very euphoric and creative feeling as well. If this strain is available to you, I would absolutely recommend getting some. It will never disappoint.

It&#39;s also great for watching tv because you  get the giggles plus the couch lock feeling and it&#39;s like being 16 again all over. \u000a\u000aThe grape flavor plus the cookies is incredible and the buds them selves might be the most beautiful looking buds I&#39;ve ever laid my eyes on.

VI would rate this one higher; but I&#39;ve discovered that I don&#39;t share the same affection for the Cookies strains as others do. \u000a That being said, the effects offer pain relief and euphoria that a medical patient (or someone in pain) would desire. My only beef with this and all &#127850; strains is that they are harsh on the windpipe and lungs. The smoke is never pleasant even with soft or shorter pulls. Not saying it&#39;s an awful experience, just that it&#39;s not very gentle on the lungs. Perhaps vaping it would be different but smoking is a different story.

VI suffer from lupus which tends to keep me up at night with a bad migraine but this strain did the trick. It took my headache away and made me sleepy as I started to come down. As for the taste, it was excellent. A mix of sweet citrus and the fresh taste of fresh herbs &#128521;

VA very good strain, the buds tend to be very small yet dense and super sticky. I still Prefer the real cookies over this strain, yet still a very strong strain.  I&#39;m a heavy indica mostly smoker, so this is more of a day time smoke for me. If your not an indica fan stay away! If you are I give 4/5. Made me hungry as hell (lol)

VI&#39;m a true believer in GSC fo real. So while at The Cafe Liv in Ann Arbor, MI I seen among their vast and impressive selection of superb herb there was a jar of Monster Cookies. As I write this review I&#39;m feeling real chill and the buzz is steady. Still functional and aware. The taste I would say is semi-spicy and &quot;herbish&quot; with a nice after taste. Definitely a great discovery and now among my favorites.

Just wore off very quickly. \u000aWhile using this strain, everything seemed very humorous and for a fraction of my high, I was extremely aroused, but that faded very quickly as well.\u000aAll around, this is an excellent strain to smoke if you&#39;re out with friends and not trying to come home blown off your ass.

The smoke is tasty, like a fruity GSC- pain relief 10/10, relaxation 10/10 taste 15/10. One puff and you\u2019ll see what I mean. \u000aAll of that, and it doesn\u2019t bog you down like a heavy indica can. I stay alert and mentally awake. Great round the clock weed.

VThis Indica has a very special place in my heart. Monster Cookies has such a special baked feeling. My first experience with this extraordinary strain is one of my favorite experiences with marijuana. I enjoy this beautiful substance at least once everyday and unfortunately I have gained a slight tolerance. I decided to consume two grams to compensate with this. When I say I was baked I mean I felt as if I was a freshly baked batch of Girl Scout Somoa cookies. This strain gives you a very body heavy, tingly high, but also very euphoric and creative feeling as well. If this strain is available to you, I would absolutely recommend getting some. It will never disappoint.

VI use cannabis primarily for anxiety, pain, depression (or mania) insomnia and muscle spasms. I have bipolar disorder (Type 1, Severe), with social and general anxiety disorders. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve tried several different strains, but this one is probably my least favorite so far. It&#39;ll quell an anxiety attack either just after or just before it really gets rolling. It&#39;s alright for insomnia, and will let me stay awake if I need to. It&#39;s pretty good with pain. Similar to a narcotic, it kills minor pain, but with major pain, such as a bad backache or in my case, knee pain, I still feel the pain; I just don&#39;t give a shit about it. It&#39;s great for depression. It instantly lifts my mood for a while, until I start to come down. \u000a\u000aThe euphoria does hit first, the 20% sativa acting more quickly than the 80% indica of the strain, leaving my mind able to accept the body-high. It relaxes me, but not enough that I *have* to take a nap. It gives me a brief case of the giggles, which I like. \u000a\u000aIt disconnects me from the things around me, and I do, in fact, feel more introspective, and it usually inspires me to shut the hell up. (This is a blessing for others, I&#39;m sure.) The spacey feeling also sets in. \u000a\u000aThis stuff doesn&#39;t hit as quickly as some strains. But once it does, it washes over me nicely. \u000a\u000aThe coughing is pretty nasty. It&#39;s like I can&#39;t stop. And the scent is STRONG. Normally, my house doesn&#39;t smell like pot very often, what with four cigarette smokers in the house (I&#39;m the heaviest smoker), and the whole house just REEKS of the stuff. It smells like a Weezer concert. \u000a\u000aHowever, there are some definite drawbacks for me. \u000a\u000aWhen coming down, it seems like the anxiety and depression that was initially stopped comes back with a vengeance. Some strains that have paranoia or anxiety as negative effects sometimes don&#39;t affect me, but this one did. Hard. I had myself a nice little freakout and I tend to be cranky and bitchy after the comedown. \u000a\u000aFor insomnia, it isn&#39;t great. Yes, I can get to sleep when I&#39;m supposed to, but the sleep isn&#39;t nearly as deep as I could get with other strains. It calms the muscle spasms in my legs I often get when I&#39;m trying to get to sleep, but not as much as others. It also leaves me groggy. And crabby. \u000a\u000aThose around me have noticed that I don&#39;t have a spectacularly good reaction to this one. And once it was pointed out to me, I noticed that after three days of smoking this stuff (tried morning, afternoon and evening), it has become patently obvious that this is not the strain for me. \u000a\u000aNaturally, because of my brain chemistry, it&#39;s possible that this is only a &quot;me&quot; thing. But usually when trying new strains, the properties that are listed for a particular strain are remarkably close to what I&#39;m &quot;supposed&quot; to experience. \u000a\u000aThis stuff will do in a pinch, but I wouldn&#39;t personally use it for the symptoms I listed for myself because the side effects far outweigh the benefits for me.

VGreat strain for the price.  Faster acting on an experienced toker. Heady buzz with pain relief without feeling extremely drousey.  This is a solid medium strength strain, to possibly the higher (pun intended) side of a moderate strength strain depending on the quality of your bud tenders supply.  Two thumbs up!!

My fianc&#233; doesn&#39;t love the affects of this high after going to sleep, she said she felt groggy or in a daze when she woke up, however did refer to it as &quot;the viagra for her vagina&quot;. I love the high I get off of this and will keep it on my shopping list. Good for just chilling . No paranoia or cotton mouth ... did get the munchies though.

VA friend of mine gave me a phat round nug of this great strain, and I am so happy he did! This nugget of dankness is coated in a silvery glistening layer of trichomes and it smells insanely dank and pungent. It looks like it would have a good forest kinda green color but I do not exaggerate a bit when I say it is heavily coated in trichs. The smoke from this flower was very smooth and I held it down for as long as I could. Loaded a few good size single hits into my bowl, and I am squinty eyed, red eyed and felling just amazing and baked. I feel really happy and overall a great sense of ease and peace of mind. Great strain! Definitely get it if you can. Especially if your a fan of GSC and GDP

Tho it didn&#39;t kill this cat,  that combo had me fucking stoned. ***\u000aI strongly urge anyone who&#39;s     in need of relief from muscle/joint aches, insomnia,poor appetite, anxiety ,racing thougts, A.D.D., to give this a shot.\u000a\u000a

I&#39;d almost bet the spot I got it from just put the name monster cookies bc the hype name. But this is just a select pheno of gsc with the cut I have at least x either huckleberry almost like the sherbet with that Pussy kush. But wow I&#39;ll review it under what I bought as so - appearance ; A+, Smell; A, taste ; B+, high A- almost A . Overall this is a 9.4-9.6 on my rating system .

VOne of my favorite if not favorite strains. A cross between two already amazing strains, and now you get the best of both worlds. You get the indica feeling through a very relaxing and euphoric body high and then the sativa effects in the head where it feels like its being massaged. This strain also makes you feel overwhelmingly filled with joy.

VWow this stuff gets u bakkkeed. Monster cookies is a Potent strain. S/O LEFT COAST CONCENTRATES. Pre gamed a few dabs of this and dropped E before a Mello Concert and it was a tripppp. Tingly, euphoric high. Mild open eye visuals and vibrations throughout my entire body. When smoked at home, the effects tend to be more indica dominant couchlock munchies happy etc. A couple fat dabs of monster cookies had me asleep in a sitting position lmfao. Strong shit. But if you smoke it before going out it does give u a burst of euphoric energy. As the high set in I felt tingles all over. It doesn&#39;t last forever, couch lock will eventually come regardless of setting and I almost got a little too lazy/relaxed to dance after a few hrs at the rave. TBH this prob isn&#39;t for beginners but veterans smokers would love this shit.
