VWhat I smoked was &quot;Wild Thai&quot;.  Saw one other review for the strain, under the basic &quot;Thai&quot; heading, so am including mine here.  It soared up into my brain pretty quickly. It&#39;s a strong head high that would have been great at a party, but I was just trying it out while glued to my laptop one night. If put to music, this super-charged high would be: Chop Suey by System of a Down

VThis is the first time my girlfriend and I have tried this strain. It has a very sweet and soothing taste but smokes potently. It left us feeling warm, tingly, inspiref, motivated; as well as giving us that hesd high that you feel when youre smoking an indica. I smoked Thai out of a blunt and my girfriend had her share in her vapor. I did try her vapor and it hit exactly the same. I wrote the review immediately after I smoked so that my thoughts would be fresh. Enjoy your Thai.

VI&#39;m not big on Sativas but I have to make an exception on this one. Great for wake and bake because it&#39;s like having a cup of coffee. Very energetic afterwards and focused. If you&#39;re into indicas like myself and you have to do a sativa. Go with this one. #420sweepstakes

VThai stick was fantastic but now its very hard to find. I London we get alot of Thai brick weed, which has some seeds and sticks in it. The appearance is awful and the smell is not very strong. Although generally it is under rated, as it gives you one of the clearest and most euphoric sativa head high. Do not smoke the strain in the evening as it will keep you up all night

Vthis strain is in Kandy kush and it helps to get you motivated to get things done around the house or if you wanna relax playing video games solo or with friends,  listen to music and watching TV/Movie(s)with your lover or playing video games with him/her.  also without the  paranoid feeling and no dizziness so far,  it&#39;s also good for wake and bake in the morning,  can help to increase your appetite  for the evening around 6-8  and this strain isn&#39;t for before bedtime.  leaves you clear headed,  focused,  creative,  lost in your own space of thoughts and helps with pain. can&#39;t help but say enough about this strain, and if you have the chance to have it give it a try it won&#39;t disappoint you! this strain is for sure in my top three list and five. peace love and joy!  happy toking! :3

VThai is a fantastic cerebral strain. Very uplifting and relaxing. I felt very creative and made some interesting drawings that each corresponded with a number and colour. They seemed really important whilst I was high but didn&#39;t make any sense at all when I returned to the ground. Had some minor paranoia whilst a car was driving slowly in the middle of the night driving past me a number of times. Other than that it was a great experience. Would recommend for artistic smokers.

VFocused. Clear. You can do whatever you do and actually get into it with this sativa. Intensity level of THC: also four stars, and it stays with you and if anything increases for a while. Fruity aroma and a pleasant taste, though milder than I expected. A nice nostalgic strain that really stood out (with a few others) decades ago, and now is one of thrillions of fine ganjas.

VI&#39;ve used this probably a couple dozen times (vaporized) over the past month or two, and although it&#39;s not a favorite, I like it and can&#39;t say anything bad about it. It&#39;s rare that I get super baked with this one, even if I try, so that generally is not my goal with the Thai. The taste with my Pax 2 is earthy/dirty, tangy, and foresty; I don&#39;t care much for the taste but at least it&#39;s not harsh upon intake. I do experience more of an upbeat and mentally energetic affect from this, more of a head high than a body stone. It does well enough with controlling symptoms of pain and nausea which I have daily. I tend to be a bit more thoughtful and talkative with this, but not in a silly way as I do with some indicas and hybrids. It&#39;s more of a regular everyday type of strain that I could effectively function with, but also help with relaxation when the time comes. Also it doesn&#39;t have the tendency to depress me like some others seem to. I&#39;ll continue to use this and maybe purchase again someday.

Your focus can be realy good in observing what you are do&#39;ing... (not recomended for paranoid people) and help you further with the things you want to learn in your Tai Chi.\u000a\u000aIf you like to do Still Qigong.. smoke a little bit more and you&#39;ll find yourshelff grounding like a three. Even standing in Whu Chi (starting stance) will ground you verry heavy.. go with the energyflow and feel relaxed and centered.

VI can&#39;t say as positive things about Thai as others have. If you simply want something that &quot;works&quot; then sure it works. But the effects are not the best. It doesn&#39;t give a very clear high. It has very weak pain relief effects, yet it causes very uncomfortable tingling in hands and a very unimpressive cerebral feeling that I&#39;ve felt better from other strains. It does cause appetite rather quickly. Just not very good on its own in my opinion. Hybrids made with Thai, many of those are nice.
