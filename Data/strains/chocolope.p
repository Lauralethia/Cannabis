VRolling up to the candy store and out pops Chocolope a top favorite for this reviewer, the extreme energy and cerebral buzz are definitely worth checking out... with the legendary Chocolate Thai and Cantaloupe Haze she produces thick popcorn buds with dark green running through the bud structure but really has me on the looks is its so covered in dark brown hairs its almost looks like a milk dud, upon opening the jar the pungent smell of coffee and chocolate fill your nostrils, this strain is absolutely amazing when it comes to dealing with stress and depression, with its amazing uplifting and energetic vibes will have you soaring through your day

VChocolope is like my morning coffee, wonderful for morning and day time. It&#39;ll perk you right up and keep you happy for hours. It&#39;s more of a mental clarity high, zero head fog, but you are just incredibly happy, more of an upper than a high really, perfect in places or situations where you&#39;d need focus. You have to find the right kind of person to like this strain, but so far I&#39;m a fan.

VI&#39;m rather new to medical marijuana but have tried several strains. This one knocked all my symptoms out of the ballpark. Fantastic for anxiety, also good on pain. For anyone with mental disorders, this is the one. It calmed my muscle spasms, it calmed my mind and I could think about other things than my obsessive and repetative thoughts. I was happy. One down side for me was that the first two time I used it, the next day I was worthless. Just really tired. That goes away after you&#39;ve used it twice though, then it was just pure relief !

VI was at a Denver houseparty that was full of hippies and pot smoke. I saw a guy light a bowl, I was stopped in my tracks after one whiff of what he exhaled. It had a spicy, overwhelmingly strong, DANK smell... that jumped out above all the rest of the stuff people were smoking. He said it was Chocolope and sold me a sack of it. Chocolope is FIRE. The fresh bud really smells and tastes like cannalope, but I don&#39;t really smell the chocolate. This strain is what I&#39;d call the heavier side of sativa. Great for chilling (pronunced anti-anxiety effect), leaves you with some energy.. but it is stoning and smoking too much of it will make you sleepy. The smell and the quality of the way this bud burns makes it a great &quot;late afternoon&quot; kinda bud for me. Recommended! 8/10.

VThis is the only time I&#39;ve tried Chocolope but I have to say I&#39;m very happy with it. This is a sativa dominant hybrid and, the nugs are light green and absolutely covered in orange hairs. The trichomes are easily visible and it is incredibly sticky. Honestly, the smell is hard to describe, and differs a bit once the bud is ground up. On inhale the smoke has a mostly earthy taste, while on the exhale you get a hint of cocoa and some sweetness.\u000a\u000aThe high is uplifting and euphoric at times and VERY potent. I have a very high tolerance and this bud got me quite high very quick. This is a buzz where you want to do something and has an energetic aspect to it.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is a top shelf strain. The potency is where it needs to be, and it looks beautiful aesthetically. Try this. \u000a\u000a*That being said, I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend this to beginners. The potency may be a little much for those with a lower tolerance.

VThis is a great strain for creative writing.  The ideas flow on this strain, one thought after another.  The high is only about 30-40 minutes after 10 bong hits.  Use this if you are into channeling, it will open up a window to wonderful new ideas, creative ideas.  It will keep you awake for hours so do not use before bed time.  Not great to be on during a movie because your mind will have to many thoughts to really focus on the movie.  This is great when you are alone with a pen and paper and want to channel some new insights from who knows where.

Vgreat night time Sativa which sounds weird but I can&#39;t really smoke on this in the morning I like it&#39;s euphoria and creativity burst and the powerful but comfortable head high stands unparalleled. the smell is very unique and indeed somewhat cocoa leaf like in its smell and taste but I will say don&#39;t smoke this without something to drink because it is a hard hitter and the after taste is like a strong celery taste that isn&#39;t the worst taste in the world but definitely can make you hack up if you don&#39;t get it out of your mouth eventually. I like this at night to relax and hangout but also because I can&#39;t really get back to my equilibrium after the buzz I stay foggy or dusty for the remainder of the day which is thought was odd but makes sense and it does have some amnesia that lasts all day too which I could live without but I was impressed beyond the expectations I had for the strain and definitely will be rolling more of it and picking up more probably whenever possible very enjoyable buzz and strain pick it up if you wanna try something new and appreciate big strains

VFantastic strain. One of those that just always puts a smile on your face.\u000a\u000aGrabbed a pure pre-roll (100% cannabis) of this one from Grey Area the last time I was in Amsterdam. Smoked it right outside while listening to some locals toke and go about their day (seemed like they met up there around that time pretty regularly).\u000a\u000aInstant burst of energy, euphoria, and focus after smoking...proceeded to walk 6-8 miles around the city, including a good bit of time around &quot;De Wallen&quot; (the red light district).\u000a\u000aThat&#39;s a long way of saying that this is a wonderfully enjoyable strain and anyone visiting Amsterdam should consider a toke of this before the longtime rite of passage of checking out the beautiful women under the red lights.

Since I&#39;m a light toker two puffs is good for me. As it&#39;s wearing off it&#39;s very slow light landing, as with any strain I can imagine if your already sleepy any cannabis will put you to sleep, but if your up and looking to be socially active this will do it for sure like GG#1 , \u000aOh before I forget the taste is like a hearty Coffee Chocolate !

VIt does taste like sweet coffee \u2615\ufe0f. This gives a pretty good energy buzz all around. Very cerebral and makes you spacey. If your stress this will bring up your mood and forget your troubles. However, there was a little bit of anxiousness in this. It didn&#39;t mess up the high though. This would be a good wake and bake with its energizing euphoria. \u000aMedical use would be for stress and fatigue. Take very good caution on this if you are prone to anxiety though. Will cure a headache and mild to moderate pain. Will stimulate appetite if your suffering from low appetite.

I guess it has a slight chocolate taste taste to it.\u000aThe effects are great for managing depression, stress, or fatigue.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend everyone try this. It&#39;s not so strong it&#39;ll trigger some peoples anxiety, but it will out a smile on your face from ear to ear.\u000aVisually colors looks more in depth and pleasing. \u000aI just spent an hour cleaning my dab rig just from one dab...I did it because I&#39;m full of energy &amp; I wanted to get the cleanest taste since it&#39;s so flipping delicious.\u000aOne of my favorite Sativa&#39;s.

VHonestly, I&#39;ve been on a weed-connoisseuring binge, and I&#39;ve been smoking a ton of sativas and hybrids. But this is by far the most evident in leaving a mark. A personal favorite. I would use this all day with a personal vaporizer. \u000aBeautiful texture, very different than most hybrids, smells like cocoa and coffee grinds, and the inhale tastes minty cool with citrus.  The exhale I quite like, tastes of ground cocoa and tea.\u000a\u000aI admit, the reason I use marijuana is not to admire its flavour or taste, although that&#39;s a great pastime. I use it, we use it, to get high. And this strain will not get you stoned, but rather high with a heady euphoria that is light like its odor and a rush of cool energy and relaxation and ease like a wave of bliss. You really can either get up and go do something or sit and enjoy your life and the surroundings. Its a vwry happy experience and I advise those who are suffering from chronic bullshit depression and anxiety and OCD and ADHD/ADD and bi-polar disorder to pick up at least a quarter of this. Its perfect for the morning, lunch and dinner hours. All hours, in fact. Not sleepy. \u000aEnjoy.

VWow, what a fantastic strain . the flavor profile is so unique. very mellow, very smooth. and the high is absolutely uplifting and energetic.  I found myself cleaning my room, doing a great workout , and just getting shit done. definitely felt very motivated to do stuff . also felt very focused , good cerebral buzz. also left my body feeling really at ease and comfortable. I love sativas for this effect. I hate the couch lock strains . indicas I&#39;ve found make me feel really lethargic and lazy. overall great strain. I don&#39;t smoke any longer , I only vape CO2 extracted oils.  this one is by far my new favorite one to have on deck. I really recommend the Jetty Pure extracts. they come in really cool discreet pre-filled cartridges. their is no smell, very discreet, can be taken with you anywhere you go. and if someone asks you just tell them it&#39;s an E-Cig. really awesome medicated buzz. I highly recommend them, I haven&#39;t smoked or burned flower ever since getting these vape oils. it&#39;s a great alternative to sick patients who don&#39;t like edibles, def give them a try , they have tons on strains available . Chocolope , girl scout cookies, and shipwreck are some really stand out flavors.

VChocolope still delivers traits many growers sought from the classic Thai strains \u2013 choco-smokey flavor and a dreamy high with a strong mental shift. Smokers who are sensitive to paranoia or psychedelic effects might approach this variety with caution. Even experienced smokers sometimes report unusually comic situations due to the \u201chigh school\u201d like stone of the Chocolope. Some consider this advice a recommendation: the chocolatey 1980s high is a euphoric and trippy blast from the not-so-distant past that can spice up any weekend.

VWow, what a fantastic strain . the flavor profile is so unique. very mellow, very smooth. and the high is absolutely uplifting and energetic.  I found myself cleaning my room, doing a great workout , and just getting shit done. definitely felt very motivated to do stuff . also felt very focused , good cerebral buzz. also left my body feeling really at ease and comfortable. I love sativas for this effect. I hate the couch lock strains . indicas I&#39;ve found make me feel really lethargic and lazy. overall great strain. I don&#39;t smoke any longer , I only vape CO2 extracted oils.  this one is by far my new favorite one to have on deck. I really recommend the Jetty Pure extracts. they come in really cool discreet pre-filled cartridges. their is no smell, very discreet, can be taken with you anywhere you go. and if someone asks you just tell them it&#39;s an E-Cig. really awesome medicated buzz. I highly recommend them, I haven&#39;t smoked or burned flower ever since getting these vape oils. it&#39;s a great alternative to sick patients who don&#39;t like edibles, def give them a try , they have tons on strains available . Chocolope , girl scout cookies, and shipwreck are some really stand out flavors.

VAbsolutely one of my new top 5 Sativa strains.  With me, Sativa&#39;s can be hit and miss.  This bad boy was definitely a hit.  The high set&#39;s in quickly and is very euphoric.  I could feel it from my head to my toes.  You can be active, social or just chill.  Didn&#39;t suppress or trigger appetite.  Provided excellent pain, anxiety, stress and  depression relief.  Tasted amazing!  Will definitely buy again!

VChocolope tastes pretty unique. Can&#39;t quite put my finger on if it&#39;s chocolate or coffee that I&#39;m tasting, but it&#39;s not exactly a sweet flavour. A tad earthy but with a hint of underlying perfume. I love the taste! Kinda felt a little like I was back in the 80&#39;s again. Which is a good thing. What could be better for an afternoon strain than a Thai &amp; Haze cross? I felt myself mentally shifting into happy n&#39; high gear immediately as soon as I started smoking it. Never felt any anxiety which sometimes happens to me when I try a sativa for the first time. Slight dry mouth, but no other negative side effects. Chocolope left me enjoying the music and ready to tackle things head on.

VClassic Thai-stick flavour &amp; effect beautifully captured in this easy-to-grow, fast-flowering, nearly pure (95%) sativa.  That&#39;s what I&#39;d write on the seed packet for this magical strain of weed.  Complex woody, herbal taste &amp; smell with a smokey hint of chocolate; and a clear-headed, focused, inspired high.  \u000a\u000aI would place Chocolope second only to Kali Mist (another 95% sativa) as the best strain of cannabis, of any kind.

VLike it&#39;s namesake you will be overwhelmed with deep earthy chocolate aromas that transition into a sweet mocha flavor upon lighting. I cannot get over how truly unique this strain smells and tastes. Bud structure is nice and sound although it&#39;s hue along with its undeniable back woods dark chocolate smell gives it a more Indica appearance. Not to be mistaken Chocalope&#39;s traits are all sativa with very little body effects to it. A few hits in and you&#39;ll begin to feel the mental tension relax  as you slowly come into a happier uplifted state. This strain seems to boast wonderful creative traits that really get the thoughts flowing. I&#39;m a drummer and Chocalope seems to help me clear any blocks or anxiety towards writing drum tracks. Once I smoke it I can sit down and just be open with my kit and find creative sparks that transition into different sounds or riffs that I can tie into drum beats. That creative openness carries over into conversations too, helping with any social anxieties or shyness. Instead of wondering what to say or feeling bashful to say what&#39;s on your mind you find yourself being more easily expressed. I guess in a nut shell this strain definitely boosts being able to express yourself creatively in many different ways. Definitely recommend a try!

VLet me start by writing....this is my all time favourite strain!! I use medical marijuana to treat chronic pain and to facilitate a good night&#39;s sleep. For the most part, I typically look for CBD rich strains to provide pain relief and indicas with higher THC for sleep, but I thought I would give this sativa a try. It is an exceptional mood enhancer...pure HAPPY POT with no burn out!!! It does provide some good pain relief too :o) Tweed&#39;s version (Clarence) is AMAZING!!! I would highly recommend this strain.

The scent is more coffee than chocolate, as well as some subtle fruity notes. When smoking, it\u2019s not harsh, it\u2019s actually more of a chocolate flavor than just a harsh taste. You\u2019ll love this strain if you need to wake up in the morning and get your day started. Thank you Patriot Care for hooking this up for me! Much love!

VChocolope isn&#39;t the kind of strain that&#39;ll knock you out in a matter of minutes. The high comes on moderately, starting in the head and then the body. My body feels slow &amp; calm while my head feels elevated/euphoric/talkative and in better spirits. Emphasis on the talkative. This strain induced allot of talking and is great for social gatherings.\u000a\u000aThe come down is very very slow and just leaves you feeling very grounded/calm/comforted/happy. Munchies aren&#39;t a big concern here, and it definitely reduces paranoia and anxiety.

V4.8...A &quot;true sativa&quot;; What a wonderful surprise! It is quite the strain. Chocolope has exocotic genetics and it shines via smell, taste and high!  It has been available but for no good or particular reason I have passed it up until recently. I&#39;m definitely a huge fan of this strain now. The high has a strong uplifting feel along with mind motivation! Focused and relaxed. Sweet earth and coffe/chocolate smell! A taste that closely matches (not quite though).

VAwesome Taste with an outstanding Balanced relief. The Haze genetics create a magical vail of relaxation that starts with the eyes and ends at the shoulders. Not too cloudy of a haze because there is still an existing feeling of motivation.

VPicked up from Tempe wellness. Not much smell to the dense buds. Buds are slightly darker in color than your average MMJ due to darker orange hairs. Smoke is smooth on the front and a litttle bit harsher on the back end, Not to intense but all around a very good choice. Good for relaxation. Not to upity,

V4.8...A &quot;true sativa&quot;; What a wonderful surprise! It is quite the strain. Chocolope has exocotic genetics and it shines via smell, taste and high!  It has been available but for no good or particular reason I have passed it up until recently. I&#39;m definitely a huge fan of this strain now. The high has a strong uplifting feel along with mind motivation! Focused and relaxed. Sweet earth and coffe/chocolate smell! A taste that closely matches (not quite though).

VMy experience with the wonders of Chocolope have been a delightful find.  I have enjoyed the serenity and the happiness that is at the same time uplifting.  The taste is rather smooth and chocolatey.   I feel very light and focused.  Great time for a bit of creativity.  Have  to fight wanting to give in to the sleep side of the total relaxtion.  Worth it all the way:)  More Sativa feeling in this hybrid over indica.  And I am a Sativa fan!  Also may I add it it awesome for my backpain and especially my depression, oops, where did it go? :):)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

VIf you aren&#39;t assigned a philosophy paper, but want to write one anyway, Chocolope is for you! Very cerebral high. Very introspective.  Not a great strain for those who want to remain clear headed and attentive during their high. Curiously, it made me very sleepy for a Sativa. Overall good, but there are many other common strains that provide more consistent effects.

VChocolope: choco-smokey flavor and a dreamy high with a strong mental shift. If you are trying to alleviate anxiety, nervousness, or lack of appetite, the Chocolope is your strain. However, smokers who are sensitive to paranoia or psychedelic effects might approach this variety with caution. Even experienced smokers sometimes report unusually comic situations due to the \u201chigh school\u201d like stone of the Chocolope. Some consider this advice a recommendation: the chocolatey 1980s high is a euphoric and trippy blast from the not-so-distant past that can spice up any weekend.

VGrower: Happy Tree Valley THC: 34.01% CBD: 0.0% What an incredible sativa that is just amazing for a great boost of energy. Seriously this can keep you awake like coffee at night which makes it awesome for studying late night,late night gaming sessions, and going out for the night. But this strain also really shines in the morning with some coffee it is almost like Adderall as its a very focused and clear headed high, but has loads of euphoria along with a pleasant uplifting body high. It has a nice cerebral feeling that is not overpowering like super lemon haze. The scent of this strain is incredibley pungent with a strong sativa sweet and chocolatey mocha finish from the chocolate thai. However there are slight notes of a skunky grapefruit or melon from the cannalope haze. The taste is that same sativa sweet that has that spicey chocolate finish like a mexican hot cocoa. The smoke is very light and a really smooth smoke. Its great medically for something like ADHD or glaucoma treatment for the day as well as fatigue. I was very impressed with chocolope and is now easily my #2 favorite sativa other than HazeWreck.

VChocolope isn&#39;t the kind of strain that&#39;ll knock you out in a matter of minutes. The high comes on moderately, starting in the head and then the body. My body feels slow &amp; calm while my head feels elevated/euphoric/talkative and in better spirits. Emphasis on the talkative. This strain induced allot of talking and is great for social gatherings.\u000a\u000aThe come down is very very slow and just leaves you feeling very grounded/calm/comforted/happy. Munchies aren&#39;t a big concern here, and it definitely reduces paranoia and anxiety.

VAmazingly smooth strain, I smoked it with a bubbler and it was so smooth going in with each draw. Hardly any burn whatsoever, that it made it a joy to want to continue taking hit after hit. \u000a\u000aThe smell is sweet, you can definitely notice a slight chocolate/coffee hint with each draw of this amazing tasty strain. High is amazing as well, it\u2019s a perfect mellow smoke that\u2019s not too in your face for those who suffer from paranoia. However, it also depends on just how many hits you take and your tolerance of course. For me though, it was a great happy uplifting high that relaxed me without leaving me unable to function.\u000a\u000aStill surprised as to just how smooth this was to smoke. Durban Poison is also another one that\u2019s surprisingly smooth as well by the way.

VMy first sativa strain, it&#39;s been great for getting things done around the house. I get a mostly clear headed high and it gives me enough energy to stay motivated through the day. It&#39;s not a huge burst of energy, but I&#39;ve found if I take it a few times through the day, by the night time I have a hard time falling asleep! My high usually lasts 2-3 hours. Takes the edge off of my social anxiety, and it&#39;s mild enough not to betray my buzz to people around me. \u000a\u000aI will say I don&#39;t get a consistent high with this- most of the time I get a moderate buzz, but occasionally just one hit will give me a head rush of a high and I have to wait about 30 minutes for it to subside. \u000a\u000aSide effects are very mild- moderate dry eyes (no redness), no headaches or anything. My local dispensary has been out the past few weeks and I&#39;m starting to miss it! Hard to find a strain that behaves similarly.

VOne of my least favorite strains I have had in a long time, the  smell is chocolatey when smelled but I feel like that translates to a very mediocre taste and the high isn&#39;t anything special either...avoid this strain, it&#39;s all hype.

VI smoked a medium size joint (.6grams) of this stuff . Very smooth to inhale. Half way through the joint I felt a euphoric wave of energy overcome my mind and body. My anxiety/worries from the day were completely gone and I was elevated into a very focused energetic mood. I ended up jogging to the gym and having one of the best workouts of my life. This strain is great if you want to get active with a clear mind . Absolutely loved this strain . This strain is much more mellow and clear headed than alot of the popular sativa\u2019s out there. Good for both daytime and night. I actually have never done a strain review before but I feel so strongly about this strain I had to make an account to share with you guys . I usually find with most sativas they give me anxiety and don\u2019t actually give me that much energy but I have finally found the strain that gives me clean energy and leaves me in a mindset where I can actually stay productive and focus.

VTried Chocolope from Purple Star MD, and found that for me it wasn&#39;t my favorite. It definitely improved my mood and helped with muscle aches, but didn&#39;t last more than an hour, wasn&#39;t very potent for me. It did make me a chatty cathy for a while, which can be a good thing in social situations, but I prefer a stronger, more cerebral Sativa buzz.

VIn my opinion, this is one of the greatest strains of cannabis, period. \u000a\u000aI discovered, smoked, and got it many years ago. I had been looking for it ever since. 5+ years later I found the my &#39;holy grail of cannabis&#39; that is CHOCOLOPE, and now, I never want lose it ever again.\u000a\u000aTo begin, this purebred sativa has a silent but deadly effect to me, the smell and taste of it do reflect a chocolate/wooden/vanilla&#39;y profile, but are admittedly underwhelming when compared to the super loud strains. Because of it&#39;s lineage, it has that profile of flavor and smell that you don&#39;t commonly see as often in the era of contemporary trend strains like your OGs, Sour Ds, GSCs, Blue Dreams, etc. However, this strain I don&#39;t have because of the flavor or the smell, this is one badass sativa! \u000a\u000aIt has an incredibly pleasant exhale, tasting notes of the coco/woods/vanilla when passing through the mouth and nostrils, immediately the happy cerebral stone steadily welcomes itself gratefully in your head as you puff on the &#39;Lope. Elementally, this strain embodies this Earthy property (not smell, just purely esoterically speaking, you&#39;ll know what I mean when you smoke it). Bringing me right into a delightful, uplifted, smiling squinty stoney feeling, it&#39;s relaxing to the max, creativity-inducing, depression-killing, laughter emoting and energetic effect. You can feel this energy in the back of your knees, so it&#39;s oddly quite relaxing and also happily uplifting with regard to energy, it&#39;s a beautiful feeling. I feel confident and capable of whatever I set my mind to. It&#39;s not de-motivating, it&#39;s re-motivating (to me), so it&#39;s really this magical alchemy that this strain holds within it. \u000a\u000aChocolope is the result of Chocolope&#39;s parent strains, of which is Chocolate Thai and Cannalope Haze, so you get that really groovy, what in my mind I would categorize as the perfect afternoon cannabis sunshine Haze/Thai stoned feeling. Upon inhale, it gives this beautifully euphoric happy and relaxing yet energetic, mellow and almost proto-psychedelic cerebral blast every time I smoked it. If you consider yourself someone who honestly loves sativas, you NEED to find some Chocolope.\u000a\u000aThis strain is a unique throwback to a trend of cannabis in the 1980s where these chocolate strains became popularized and smoked among heads. I can picture smoking this stuff at some Grateful Dead show in 1987 like at Alpine Valley or Red Rocks or something. When you smoke this kind stuff , the effects are where you actually almost begin to feel as if you are at that &#39;87 Alpine Valley &#39;Dead show. Or it feels like this is what pot is supposed to be, IMHO of course. Which as mentioned, much of the sensory and beautiful effects of this strain comes from the obscurely odd lineage of the Chocolate Thai/Cannalope Haze combo. It&#39;s just so pleasant and probably my top 3 favorite of all time, if not favorite sativa currently. It just works every time people! \u000a\u000aAfter spending some more time with Chocolope again, I realize that I really like the taste profile, it&#39;s just not so common that I don&#39;t think many people like it or are given the chance to like it as much as I believe they should, but I&#39;m all in with every aspect of the strain. And especially when you know the effects that it creates, how can you not like it? That&#39;s why I believe us contemporary stoners need to continue to carry the chocolate-strain Thai/Haze tradition onward and let the almighty Chocolope be a strain that takes everyone who enjoys it&#39;s amazing effects into a proverbially sunshiney future. I say that because even as I type right now, it&#39;s this ridiculously pleasant smiling cerebral stone, I&#39;m teeth smiling as I write, I&#39;m about to go take a walk and then after that Im going to work on some writing and music; it awakens within me a powerful sense of creativity, of thinking outside of the box, laughing and delighted by life, add to that the heady pre-psychedelic contentment with the universe, a happily relaxing but also potentially energetic or uplifted stoney groove. How can anyone argue with that? In fact, and this is real, I applied to go back to college and I&#39;m finally excited to pursue something in my life that might be extremely fulfilling and spirit-feeding for me after a tumultuous last few years, and to have a strain that doesn&#39;t debilitate or couch-lock but rather motivates and brings a sense of drive and ambition. That&#39;s really incredible, and Im grateful for that. Yet! I also know the Chocolope is certainly not THE end-all-be-all reason these positive productive things are happening, but it definitely hasn&#39;t hurt any up to this point. And Ill be mindful of those things.  I honestly had been searching for this strain since I had first tried it about 5 or 6 years ago, and when I did it blew me away. Which I noted the name because it really affected me in a way that felt as though it was my first time smoking, every single time.  Anyway, so after I first had it, I loved it so much that inevitably it got all smoked up and I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere after that for quite some time. For some reason it&#39;s not as popular in the states anymore as it was a few years back (at least in my area in the upper Midwest, I&#39;m sure it has been around in the legal states as one would imagine). So when I found it last month, I was so excited that I got my fair share to have and to hold and to forever cherish in sickness and in health,  for richer or poorer... I eloped and married the Chocolope! /jk\u000a\u000aI&#39;m rambling on here I realize but that&#39;s okay, I want to ramble as much as necessary to present the case that I am totally biased about loving this understated yet wildly potent, wonderful  smelling and uniquely flavorful strain here in the age of what are often some of the same old predictable trend-strains. As stated before, I truly feel EVERY fan of Cannabis in general, and particularly that of sativas, YouMUST try Chocolope, you NEED to!  It&#39;s just the best; find it, request your vendor carry it, and smoke it. The dosing can be varied with effects varying too, one toke gets you good, two to four get you great, and five and you&#39;re grand. The only negatives would be some dry mouth (so just have some water near you) and there&#39;s also this potential &quot;too-stoned and thus sleepy or needing to pass out&quot;-effect if you just smoke a ton of it, but otherwise a few puffs of Choco and you&#39;ll be set for a blessing filled day of bountiful happiness and joy. This stuff can creep to an extent, but is also surprisingly fast acting and absolutely effective when combating depression/anxiety, stress, fatigue, anger, nausea and more. I&#39;d also say it&#39;s effects are relatively long lasting too. Feeling the effects for a few hours at least. \u000a\u000aIn the end, when it comes to the Chocolope, I love the taste and smell, I love the way it looks, that Thai/Haze lineage will treat you sativa-lovers very very kindly.  he come up and the peak to plateau and the &quot;come down&quot; feeling (though there isn&#39;t much of one aside from just surfing the wave on the way as it crests) and it all is just perfect and incredibly valued so much by me. I I feel like I can conquer the world when I enjoy Chocolope. This is pure, potent, sativa medicine ladies and gentlemen!\u000a\u000aGet/Request CHOCOLOPE Today!

VMy favorite strain on my trip to Amsterdam. Had this at Baba, and Stone&#39;s Cafe. The latter really killed it. Stuff was awesome. People that are unsure of themselves socially, or who may become anxious in public would love this stuff. I was the mayor of Amsterdam for an hour or so, talking to anyone that would listen. I was also in a fantastic mood the whole time... if only people who take paxil, zoloft, etc knew about this stuff. The smell actually does have the tiniest hints of dark chocolate, with an overall dank of high quality stuff. I wish I had this stuff in the States, I&#39;d smoke it everyday. Also pretty munchy on the finish, so prepare for that.

VChocolope allowed me to focus as I focused on my agenda for the days and weeks to come. \u000a\u000aIt wasn&#39;t a high that suffocated my senses in any way; rather, I had a pleasurable and smooth high. I was able to get things done, meditate, write, read, and even have a full conversation with strangers I interacted with throughout the days. \u000a\u000aA fun strain to have. Stress-free thoughts are inevitable with this strain, so BEWARE: You will be super happy with this.

I&#39;ve been getting a good 2-3 hours of work out of each session, even after a full day.  I would recommend this flower to anyone who needs to work through a project, but needs a little extra focus :).

VMy favorite strain on my trip to Amsterdam. Had this at Baba, and Stone&#39;s Cafe. The latter really killed it. Stuff was awesome. People that are unsure of themselves socially, or who may become anxious in public would love this stuff. I was the mayor of Amsterdam for an hour or so, talking to anyone that would listen. I was also in a fantastic mood the whole time... if only people who take paxil, zoloft, etc knew about this stuff. The smell actually does have the tiniest hints of dark chocolate, with an overall dank of high quality stuff. I wish I had this stuff in the States, I&#39;d smoke it everyday. Also pretty munchy on the finish, so prepare for that.

This strain has a wonderful chocolate, woody taste. It has a nice light cerebral high and light body effects just enough to iron out the uckys. Very good for early morning. I didn&#39;t have any anxiety with this strain. Not buzzy or racy. Definitely keeping this strain around.

VChocolope.\u000aSo if they (whoever assigned the value to the random shape) had decided that 3 was actually 4 and 4 was actually 3 then wouldn&#39;t 14 minus 3 equal 9?

VThe best Sativa for those who struggle with ADHD or have problems finding motivation. I have tried every strain you can name and I can say with confidence this is the most clear headed high I\u2019ve ever experienced. I would say the only down side of this strain is that it only last less than an hour, HOWEVER, you still feel calm and a happy post that first hour. The best Sativa to smoke when you need to find the inspiration to feel creative or motivated.

VChocoloupe is probably my favorite sativa strain right now.  My dispensary has this marked as a 95% Sativa. I love the &#39;fruity with hints of chocolate&#39; smell and taste.  I smoke this in the morning and midday and I experience the following:  motivation, feeling generally happy and positive, calm, relaxed, focused, able to be social.  \u000a\u000aI tend to cut myself off from this strain in the afternoon or early evening and switch to a heavy indica or else I get a little wired, anxious, prone to panic attacks.\u000a\u000aI gave it a 10.

VI haven&#39;t been feeling that great lately, some personal issues made me feel anxious, mildly depressed and I often find it hard to stop worrying and fall asleep. So many times I would be in my bed, ready to take a trip to dreamland, but my mind didn&#39;t agree...\u000a\u000aI found Chocolope to be a perfect strain for these moments. This strain is very uplifting and happy. Not the bouncy kind of happiness, but more in a relaxed and comforting way. It didn&#39;t make me sleepy, but I was able to put things in another perspective: feel like what I do with my life is enough, and let go of negative thoughts, embrace the peace of that moment. So I would absolutely recommend trying this strain for people who find themselves struggling with depression and/or anxiety.\u000a\u000aI think this strain is great to make yourself comfortable with at home, a hot chocolate on the side and extra comfy socks. Or use it for a carefree cuddle session with your partner(s) and/or pet(s), or when listening to some ambient music...maybe meditating?\u000a\u000aAlso, I found the side effects pretty minimal with this strain. Usually I am someone who has red eyes and cotton mouth immediately, but not so much with this one.

The head buzz starts of slowly but developed to a quite heavy feeling, even though it was quite mellow, odd right? Leaves me pretty euphoric too, \u000a\u000aOveral I&#39;m pleased.

Vi&#39;ll always remember the first time i trided the Chocolope. it was 6years ago, at the Grey Area coffe shop (best weed ever smook in amsterdam, with very nice curing) and OMG what a taste, what a high (crystal clear :D, a bit like the G13haze) and what a smell, with chocolat/coffee w. a lot of sugar/earth mix. Defenitly in my top 5 best weed souvenir. Girls love it...

To me used to Indicas it\u2019s for sure a \u201clight\u201d strain to me. \u000a.\u000a.\u000aI\u2019m still under the weather and it for sure cleared my head a good bit. I also have my anxiety fly away like a bird &#129413; I feel a euphoria as well as mood elevation. \u000a.\u000a.\u000aI really enjoy this as a sativa with energy and happiness qualities. Doesn\u2019t bro g on anxiety yet it attacks it, after a couple hits you can feel your body relax and your mind get that nice melty cheese &#129472; feeling yet still clear headed. Great for PTSD day time working. Lovely strain from Cresco yet I can firmly say does nothing for my Crohns. \u000a.\u000a.\u000a

Effects are energetic and euphoric. Expect a good laugh if anxiety from it doesn\u2019t bother you. I maybe would get again.

VI would describe the taste like drinking a spicy, peppery, mexican mocha. The initial feeling was racy, with focused head high, I was able to get tasks done. The high then tapered off and became warm, pulsating, and euphoric. Not the best for cardio, but great for some other workouts like pilates or some strength training. Strain 12 of 100.

VI went to the collective with high hope and some doubt. I&#39;m typically not into sativa/S.dominant anything. I much rather smoke an Indica but this strain was so good! I loaded snaps into my bowl so I would hit greens every hit and the taste is on point! I was actually lite after smoking roughly .4g. This bud is fire! Not to strong but it&#39;s still some potent medicine.

I will buy another one of these for sure! I feel like going for a hike and a bit of adventure actually lol. very relaxed mood. high 5!

Vmost potent weed I&#39;ve ever smoked, the  sour citrus flavor is unlike that of any other strain I&#39;ve smoked and so is the high. the nugs look almost red and aren&#39;t too frosty, but they&#39;re denser than anything else I&#39;ve ever seen, and I would take this strain over any cookies or kush variety, as half a bowl of this stuff is enough to get me higher than a full blunt of either of the other two. I&#39;ve shared this strain with several other experienced smokers and they all say that it&#39;s the best weed they&#39;ve ever smoked.

VI tried this strain on a trip to Amsterdam last year. If you get Chocolope that was properly grown you are in for a treat. It takes you to a new level mentally and has a very euphoric effect. The effects are long lasting as well, and you will probably get hungry after a little while. But if you get the chance try this strain out.

VThis is one of the first strains I got a hold of, once I obtained my medical card. One of the top sativa&#39;s on my list next to the hazes. Love the hint of chocolate and earthy smell. Big fluffy darker green nugs, covered in trichomes. A lot of sativa&#39;s get me a little anxious or paranoid.. but there&#39;s something about this strain that balances the sativa effects, with a calmer/ more relaxed high.

VThis is the first full sativa I&#39;ve decided to purchase, and being an indica type of gal, I was born excited and nervous to see its effect. The smell was unlike anything I&#39;ve smelled before. It was subtle and sweet with hints of earth and chocolate. The buds are huge and fluffy and sticky. The taste is a nice incarnation of the smell. Mostly earth with a bit of chocolate. Would pair so nicely with a coffee especially if it was a mocha. The fact that this strain pairs well with food and drink was something I hadn&#39;t noticed with other strains and I love that about this one. The high was not racey like I was afraid it would be due to it being a sativa. Instead it was creative and uplifting. I figured that all weed was gonna make me tired no matter the kind, but this made me less so. I&#39;m used to heavy hitting or creeping indicas so I kept smoking more than I needed of this guy because I wasn&#39;t feeling &quot;stoned.&quot; That&#39;s not the point of this one, though. It gets you relaxed but still functional. Your mind can stay focused while your body starts to melt. It&#39;s a fun and childlike feeling. \u2728

I lucked out and have experienced only the second mentioned thai pheno right before DNA permanently sold out the remaining stock. By far the sweetest best tasting most energetic uplifting stuff i&#39;ve had in my life.

Nice tightly packed buds. The effect is a nice and intoxicating buzz, leaves you a bit on the sleepy side though so its not best in social situations id say but if your tough its no big thing to be active. Relaxes you nicely. Not so heavy on the eyes, but enough to let you know youre buzzin. Worked really nice to settle my nerves. Pleasant buzz, left me wanting more. Was able to settle in and do my homework.

VI found this to be a very pleasant, not too over the top and super uplifting. Very mild taste that I can not seem to find chocolate in.  I do find the buzz is not super long but for me has very little burn out and I can get right back to where I was with two long slow hauls off the vaporizer.

VIt is ok, but it doesn&#39;t taste like chocolate, lol. I read a review that said this was a chocolate tasting weed that would make me energetic. I agree it tastes sweet and if found in time, it can be fire. But it&#39;s built up too much with this strain. I&#39;ve had better sour d. This makes me sleepy as I smoke it now. I can stay awake though if I want. But for a wake and bake it&#39;s really disappointing. Trainwreck, J1, other similar sativa hybrids get me up. This is a pure sativa and I&#39;m struggling to leave my bed lol. Otherwise, a decent strain, I just feel heavy body sedation and slight uplift similar to GDP.

VGot a sample of this out of a dispensary in Denver, and as the name would suggest, the flavors of chocolate and cantaloupe definitely jump out at you. Like 90% of the dispensary buds I&#39;ve sampled, this one was bone dry but the flavor and high suffered none. Very unique. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something different.

VI took a couple of pre rolls of this to my daughters place last week. She is a highly stressed person with MS and this took away her headache and the stress just went away. the whole family passed this one around and all thought it was a pleasant blend of chocolate and cantaloupe flavor that  just made our movie a and our get together extra nice.  It has a nice mellow flavor and was extremely enjoyable.

Vdefinitely good for getting shit done. I smoke auto dabbers and this shit has me cleaning and getting shit done and actually wanting to do it so thats a plus. Will definitely be good to smoke before going for a jog. Or strength training.  Very uplifting but relaxed at the same time. Great day strain. Didn&#39;t mix well with Monster Cookies though. I smoked on em both yesterday and it heightened my anxiety. Well that and I didn&#39;t have my shopping list.

VI just moved to Seattle - just for weed! - from japan so I&#39;m still just discovering so much but this is the 2nd time in two weeks I have tried chocolope and I must report, like it!  But 5 minutes ago, before I managed to open fracking leafly, this is what I was thinking:\u000a\u000aBetter smoked alone and at night.   Comes on strong.  I Even think drinking a can of Sierra Nevada beer will chill me out but so far, no dice.   Good stuff though.  I actually toured this growers place today thru kush Tours in Seattle and they do a great job.   Anyway, the tour is the sky high gardens (??) grower which was an amazing grow op tour.   Well done and I really enjoy their chocolope pre-rolls.  great product.   I approve very \u000aenthusiasticicalky!

VI bought this in Vape form, so I didn&#39;t get the full flavor, it didn&#39;t taste bad at all. It woke me up and make my whole body just feel happy. I didn&#39;t get the head high at all, just a body high. if you want to stay up late or workout, this is a great strain for that. It didn&#39;t last to long though, so that was kind of a let down. I would recommend this strain, but it&#39;s not going to couch lock you and mess with your head at all.

VI suspected I already smoked some choco-related unknown strain from the street. I knew it packed a punch for me but I smoked it like I would anything and on the bong! I felt it behind my eyes then quickly I received a jolt of energy to the head (the soaring head high, I presume). This kind of quick energy can trigger anxiety (or wake you up If you don&#39;t suffer from anxiety) but I remained calm and enjoyed a cannelope type high (a bit stonier, a bit more uplifting) after this one jolt. I think I would have a better high if I hit the joint and take my time instead, next time.

VI&#39;m reviewing this strain on two different experiences. Separated by several years. The first experience I had  with this strain was back in 2014, I purchased a 1/2 oz of this strain from a dispensary in Santa Cruz, CA.  I was a fairly inexperienced stoner at this point, but happened to stumble upon a 29% THC grow of Chocolope. I don&#39;t even think I fully appreciated, at the time, how dank this particular grow of Chocolope was. I took this extra dank half-oz on a trip to a friends cabin up in the Gold Country of Northern California. This strain was not only the perfect grow of cannabis to compliment this memorable adventure, it also stoned us all thoroughly for the entire trip. In a wonderful way of course. I remember the high bringing happiness, and a dream like quality along with a fairly prominent body high for a sativa strain. However this was a body high that did not lock me down, it was a body high that was just relaxing and genlte. Fast forward to June 2017, Boston, MA. I&#39;m now accustom to my dab rig and concentrates as a full fledged stoner, but I decided to snag some flower for fun from Patriot Care in downtown Boston the other day. I saw Chocolope on the menu, and I was enticed. I remembered the glowing California summer days and the great times shared with friends who now live on a coast far far away. I was sold. I purchased an 1/8th, hopped on the train back to my apartment, packed a bowl in the bubbler and ripped a few big tokes. I was back. A feeling of immediate, and yet lingering happiness unlike any other strain I have smoked. It was trippy and dream like as I remembered also. And of course the relaxing yet subdued body high was prominent again. This grow was only 20% THC as opposed to the insane 29% THC grow I copped in Santa Cruz, but was every bit as good as I remembered. What a strain. One to be remembered.

VThis used to be my &quot;go-to&quot; strain but developed a tolerance to it and am smoking it less and less - discovering some other amazing strains very similar. My biggest complaint about this strain is that the weed sizzles when I smoke it in a pipe, this leads me to believe that it wasn&#39;t dried out properly and therefore makes me wonder what else wasn&#39;t done properly - not to mention the extra $$ you&#39;re paying for water weight - this problem can be solved by keeping your weed in an open jar/leaving your baggie open. Overall a really good strain though, great taste and produces lots of keif.

VChocolope is definitely a prime candidate if you&#39;re looking for an uplifting euphorical high. It&#39;s one of my more favorite strains when I&#39;m looking to chill out and listen music to, but that&#39;s to say the least. This strain is what I would call an instigator, or a motivator that puts you in a creative state of mind. Giving you a good sativa-based high with a mellow indica-based relaxing feel to it. It&#39;s a must try for sativa users!

VThis was my first experience with Chocolope and WOW! It&#39;s been on my list of strains to try for awhile because of the uplifting but still relaxing qualities it&#39;s supposed to have and it delivers! \u000a\u000aI suffer from chronic pain and the depression that inevitably follows. This strain dissolved all of the negative thoughts that tend to swirl around my brain and just plastered a grin on my face. Which was exactly what I needed. It made my head a little fuzzy at first, but once I got up and moving around it cleared and I was able to be productive. I suspect if I let myself, I could easily just sit and listen to music for hours. \u000a\u000aA little too dopey to want to use if I have to leave the house, but it&#39;s great for getting chores/projects done at home. Helped my restless leg syndrome chill for awhile but didn&#39;t bring my pain down as much as I&#39;d hoped. It did not worsen my anxiety as some sativas do.

VPicked up an 1/8 of this at High 5 Cannabis in Vancouver, WA at their Vendor Day featuring the grower Kola Bear recently and I have to say, Chocolope is top of the line for improving your mood in my opinion.\u000aIt turns bad moods around and takes good moods and sends them into orbit. \u000aThis is one of my new found favorites without a doubt. It\u2019s just a good clear headed high that helps you see the positive in almost anything.\u000aFor me there is also the added benefit of a nice youthful increase to my libido for the evening :)\u000a\u000a5 star for sure

VI would describe the taste like drinking a spicy, peppery, mexican mocha. The initial feeling was racy, with focused head high, I was able to get tasks done. The high then tapered off and became warm, pulsating, and euphoric. Not the best for cardio, but great for some other workouts like pilates or some strength training. Strain 12 of 100.

VChocolope - really tasty sweet and earthy great morning flavor &#128069; I don\u2019t feel any body relaxation. My mind feels more awake and I\u2019m taking info in withab more creative and uplifted take on things. The wonderful flavor really helps with just puffing away on this cartridge. To me used to Indicas it\u2019s for sure a \u201clight\u201d strain to me. \u000a.\u000a.\u000aI\u2019m still under the weather and it for sure cleared my head a good bit. I also have my anxiety fly away like a bird &#129413; I feel a euphoria as well as mood elevation. \u000a.\u000a.\u000aI really enjoy this as a sativa with energy and happiness qualities. Doesn\u2019t bro g on anxiety yet it attacks it, after a couple hits you can feel your body relax and your mind get that nice melty cheese &#129472; feeling yet still clear headed. Great for PTSD day time working. Lovely strain from Cresco yet I can firmly say does nothing for my Crohns. \u000a.\u000a.\u000a

VI am just getting into the world of knowing what strain I&#39;m smoking and always thought I liked Sativa&#39;s over Indica&#39;s. But this one reminds me of most of the things I didn&#39;t like about the &quot;bad&quot; batches I&#39;d get in town instead of from a dispenser. the flavour and knocking my out 4 hours early were appreciated but other than that, I wouldn&#39;t choose this one as a first choice that&#39;s for sure. I got the munchies HARD CORE which may be the only reason I fell asleep so easily tbh. I didn&#39;t get a body or mind trip. basically all I could think of was food. I didn&#39;t have any paranoia which was nice but I heard shit that wasn&#39;t even there the whole time I was awake. I don&#39;t like weed making me feel like a nut. Needless to say, in continuation of my first statement: buying a variety pack helps beginners figure out what they prefer, in general and I definitely recommend it. CuZ if I&#39;d gone and just bought a ton of Sativa&#39;s I&#39;d have been truly disappointed since every indica I&#39;ve had so far gives me everything I look for in a bud.

VIf mix it up by grabbing some strong sativas, heavy indicas, and more balanced S/I hybrids at once and Chocolope is one of the strains in there, it&#39;s probably going to be the first one I run out of, and that is a testament to the it&#39;s psychoactive and medicinal effects because personally, having my weed taste like coffee or chocolate I could give a sh*t about. The whole palate is sort of muddled and ill-defined anyway, but the high can be, and generally is, one of the best. Being almost pure sativa and therefore producing a more cerebral, energizing, thought-provoking, dare I say mind-expanding high, it has that strange ability to both calm and provoke anxiety depending on the person/circumstances. If you don&#39;t succumb to the later (and anyone smoking enough week to be reading a strain review  probably wouldn&#39;t), Chocolope may very well encapsulates all that is positively associated with smoking weed: Expanding one&#39;s mind; Gaining insight into previously foreign perspectives on things in life; Becoming more thoughtful; and often more interesting as well.

There&#39;s no second guessing on this stuff - it&#39;s just amazingly good.  Allows me to think fast, act fast, move fast, and also hang back and chillout when needed.  Superb mental and physical effects - makes me happy, alert, upbeat, and really just feeling awesome overall.  Can&#39;t be beat for me - I know it effects everyone differently but this strain has been used several times now under several varying conditions and climates and it&#39;s always produced consistent results for me.

After 5 minutes, a little more high than I thought I would be, but still fully functional. Open lungs, relaxed. Very nice chocolate taste on the inhale and exhale. Post workout: So far the best Sativa for Asthma by far, surprising. A little more spacey than Jack, so perhaps not great for super focused mental activity, but a very positive up high for asthma and stress relief.

VA guy next to me, at Silver State recommended this strain and I&#39;m pretty darn happy he did!! I intended on buying some Indica flower, to be used in the evenings before bed, but he said it didn&#39;t have a typical Sativa high AND he said the taste was worth it. This strain tastes great, has a elevated, but relaxed head change and did I mention the taste...!? The other nice thing about Chocolope, is that it didn&#39;t make me want to munch out!

VI am usually a heavy Indica user, but I decided to give this heavy Sativa a try. The phenotype I purchased was 95% Sativa. Almost immediately after the first hit from my Herbalizer, my mood lifted and I could feel the high coming in my head. After the 3rd hit, it was like I had a shot or 2 of espresso enter my bloodstream. The energy and focus from this strain was very nice. An extremely clear and smooth high. I haven&#39;t had a Sativa in months, but I was extremely pleased by this. No paranoia/anxiety (which I have more often than I want) with this strain either. It was very smooth sailing. I highly recommend it.

VRecommended by a great budtender for high anxiety and it&#39;s a great smoke. a coffee-ish taste a tad and really woody/earthy big time. very mellow but not a couch potato :-) I could use as a daily smoke just for the calmness and wow does it help my anxiety! really thirsty, more than normal. great for depression/anxiety/calmness. I will buy another one of these for sure! I feel like going for a hike and a bit of adventure actually lol. very relaxed mood. high 5!

Vi am fairly new to medical cannabis (about 6 months) but Chocolope is my favorite strain so far.\u000a\u000aI have infused it into coconut oil, butter, honey and tincture.  I find that vape or smoke produces a nice and very pleasant high that never overstays it&#39;s welcome while providing fast  relief for headaches and pains associated with Fibromyalgia.\u000a\u000awhen taken as honey or capsules (filled with coconut oil) it provides a well managed body relaxing effect which aids with insomnia as well as aches and pain.... love it.\u000a\u000a

Vmost potent weed I&#39;ve ever smoked, the  sour citrus flavor is unlike that of any other strain I&#39;ve smoked and so is the high. the nugs look almost red and aren&#39;t too frosty, but they&#39;re denser than anything else I&#39;ve ever seen, and I would take this strain over any cookies or kush variety, as half a bowl of this stuff is enough to get me higher than a full blunt of either of the other two. I&#39;ve shared this strain with several other experienced smokers and they all say that it&#39;s the best weed they&#39;ve ever smoked.

Extremely smooth smoke, in fact one of the smoothest I&#39;ve had, it has an excellent flavor. It&#39;s a good social strain to smoke. The high didn&#39;t last very long nor was it very strong. It would be ideal for the first time smoker. This bud didn&#39;t jump start any arousal effects on myself or my girl. Unlike many other strains, chocolope didn&#39;t give me the munchies which I consider a plus.

VAmazing energy! Super uplifting. This is one of my top two favorite strains, the other being Sunshine Daydream (two totally different vibes), and I&#39;d have to try them both again to try to determine which really takes the top spot. I loved Chocolope so much that I have a centerfold of it along with champagne and sparklers (from High Times magazine) framed on my wall. Sounds like the perfect New Year&#39;s Eve celebration to me! Planning to grow both aforementioned strains and will definitely come back with another review when I have more long-term experience with it. In general, if you love a peppy sativa, you will really dig this one.

It is great for a newbie like me cause it&#39;s a light and happy high. I didn&#39;t smoke all through my 20s because of a couple bad paranoid highs, but no paranoia here.

The effect were clear headed and focused the physical effects were close to drinking a energy drink. There were only a few times that I kinda lost track of what I was doing but quickly got back on track without any confusion. Will be buying again when it comes back in stock.

VDefinitely a sweet smelling strain. After grinding it up I sometimes get whiffs of the famed Coffee/ Mocha smell. The buds themselves are light and fluffy, a lighter green with plenty of vibrant orange &amp; amber hairs. \u000a\u000aThe smoke is smooth and flavorful. The inhale feels sweet but is replaced by a slightly bitter taste similar to dark chocolate on the exhale. This is my favorite part of this strain because I love that flavor! Also, I&#39;ve found that even if I have a coughing fit from a big hit, my throat doesn&#39;t feel harsh afterwards, so that&#39;s a plus!\u000a\u000aThe high is uplifting and clear-headed, leaving a social and productive mindset. Easily one of my favorites!\u000a\u000aOverall, classic Sativa strain: great look/ smell, great taste, great stone! Definitely worth trying if you haven&#39;t already, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

VOne of the best tasting bud I&#39;ve ever smoked. The smell right out of the bag was incredible, citruses all over the place. Smokes incredibly smooth, no harshness even after several tokes. Very strong cerebral high. Gets you motivated to do things and move. Awesome daytime smoke : a shot of espresso for your mind. Made me giggly and talkative. Awesome chocolate aroma when grinding it. In my top 5 Cannabis strains for sure.

VNeed to watch for paranoia. I knew I was tripping balls when I had been going to dab central with another strain. But I knew it was the chocolope only because it&#39;s hard for me to trip balls and I had read that it is known to be ... Or maybe it was all in the head. Inevitably i went outside to take a piss and thought someone was outside about to get me and when going in, I felt like damn zombies or someone was going to crash the damn door lmao before going to bed I had thought of some just evil ass demonic shit and I tried my hard to think on something more happy just to get off the subject. During that time I had thought of a wheelchair just rolling up and I open my eyes for a quick second\u2014 THERE in direct view on my eyes site a wheelchair was at standby... Funny thing is I have a wheelchair in my room for fun and my friend had been sitting in it earlier LUCKILY lol. Damn right I went to move it I wasn&#39;t fucking around. **OVERALL** great strain I use it before going to class and does well...well to enhance everything but again I do get a hint paranoid but know I&#39;m just tripping. Strain doesn&#39;t leave me Schleepy and does know how to get the day started. Also I can talk my ass off with it as well as get intuitive like I did so rn

VNot an ideal combination for those with depression,  stress,  pain, and fatigues. This  strain though produces mental alertness, depresses the body and results in feeling &quot;rush&quot; as in hurried state of mind. Another way to put it: alert mind but stoned body. Not ideal for people suffering nerve damaged because the body is slow in responding to the mental demand and tends to feel stressed out and overwhelmed. \u000a\u000aWith this strain, your mind is willing--but your body is complaining, therefore though physically active, desire or enthusiasm is lacking in activiry that you are performing. \u000a\u000aPhysically draining. As the brain demands more output from the body, it tends to block the sensory nerve leading to injury or abuse due to forceful act or repeated careless movements. \u000a\u000aMind and body contradiction can also lead the body to activate its defensive mechanism, causing it to rebel and ignore the brain&#39;s demand. The alienation between the two can depress the lungs causing delayed breathing intervals,  which can trigger panic attack. \u000a\u000aConclusion: No therapeutic effect, only feelings of anxieties enhanced with euphoric alienation. Strain needs to be reclassified. \u000a\u000a\u000a

VStrain: Chocolope\u000aSource: The Herbery\u000aTHC: 16%\u000aCBD: 0.1%\u000a\u000aIngestion: smoked\u000aSmell: Pine, sweet coffee, dark chocolate, melon (hints).\u000aTaste: Sweet coffee, bitter chocolate, almost cr&#234;me fresh or panna cotta\u000a\u000aEffect duration: 3.5 hours (I commonly stay high longer than others, so your mileage may vary)\u000aEffect: Up happy high. Mainly cerebral on the come up, some body relaxation and slowness on the way down. Had me dancing in my kitchen for 10 minutes. Not at all a &quot;racy&quot; strain, more neutral energy. Can do more active things, or relax and socialize. I think this sample was a more Indica phenotype, and was good for house chores, exercise, etc., but not advised for logical analytical tasks.\u000a\u000aFor me it was a little more &quot;disorienting&quot; than I was looking for. I remembered it as a clearer high when I tried it a couple of years ago. I believe there is a Sativa phenotype with more intense melon smell that is clearer with less body.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m used to Durban Poison lately and that stuff is really clear for me, to the point that I can do work tasks. This Chocolope was a great &quot;moving and doing stuff&quot; up high positive high until the last 30 minutes of the comedown, so pace yourself and remedicate if your plans involve &quot;staying up&quot;.\u000a\u000aDefinitely an active recreation strain for me, not a getting work done strain (for that, Durban Poison fits me best so far).

Smoked it again another day &amp; huge rush of anxiety and racing heart. Gave it another try and didn\u2019t pack the bowl so much &amp; it was worse than the last time, anxiety all night long and extreme paranoia. Never been so paranoid medicated before &amp; I usually love sativa strains! I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I\u2019ve been heavily smoking high CBD strains lately.
