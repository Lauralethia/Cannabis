VMy local dispensary provided this for $30 per 10 gram 1/4 so I got an excellent deal on this. i feel like I had to smoke a lot to feel its effects, but it&#39;s definitely a decent smoke. if you can find it really cheap, it&#39;s worth a try. I found that it always helped me focus and concentrate on my own thoughts so if you&#39;re a daytime smoker this is good, but make sure to have another strain to mix it up or else you&#39;ll grow too accustomed to its effects.

VFor someone who only smokes indicas, Twisted Citrus got me hooked. It&#39;s a nice vibe smoke and it&#39;s stinks like citrus and oranges. It&#39;s tastes better then how it smells. It&#39;s a pretty strong strain and I really recommended it. 9/10

VNot bad but not very potent I find, it gives you an alright high but doesn&#39;t seem to last all that long for me. I must say that the description doesn&#39;t lie, as soon as you open your grinder all you can smell is that strong almost orange peel scent.

VEnjoyed a bit of this citrus-y goodness today. The flavor is intense and one can really taste the THC. Really calmed me down and lasted a good while. I would recommend this for morning use. Thanks PotCargo!
