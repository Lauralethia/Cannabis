VJesus this stuff is POTENT! Get ready to get stuck when you toke this one. Vaped a bowl out of my Volcano and sweet jesus I couldn&#39;t move but in a very good way! This is a must try as it has the OG traits but with a Purple tasting high. Definitely a very strong indica and a must try for people looking to relieve pain, trust me on this one!

VI think it is better than purple kush thanks to the OG kush parent. It starts off very mellow or an hour or so, then causes some serious couch lock... also serious munching. I&#39;d recommend for night time use for sure and watching funny shows like American Dad. This strain is beautiful with its long orange hairs, heavy trichomes, and dark purple leaves throughout.

Fruity aroma, mildly floral, sweet. \u000a\u000aDense, plush bud, pleasantly frosty and with some good pale-orange curly hairs.

VPurple OG Kush smells and tastes great! This flower gives a very stoney indica high which is excellent for pain management, muscle relaxant, stress, anxiety, as well as creativity, deep thoughts, but depending on the individual one may experience extreme sleepiness. If you&#39;re a veteran indica smoker you won&#39;t be disappointed. If you&#39;re a new comer to the game, start with a little. You may become sleepy, or you may find yourself shredding on the guitar, one of my favorite indicas.

VSo what to say about this strain other than WOW! Honestly i&#39;m a huge fan of every sinlge kush out there but the Purple and the OG are definitly some of my favourite ones. The mic is just straight perfection for my medical condition. The flavor are just as expected. A very Kushy smell and taste with a subtile earthy aroma that just make your mouth watering by smelling it. The high was a very solid stony sleepy feeling but not too overwhelming if you smoke it reasonably. It fixed my lack of appetite and made me very euphoric and happy. After about 2 hours, i just wanted to have a good sleep and a few minutes after laying down, i felt like floating on a cloud oh highness and it was really enjoyable. Overall, the smell and taste was 9/10, the high was like 8.5/10 and the look was 9/10 with those very dense cristally bud. Hope it helped you, have a great sesh!

VI&#39;m new to the whole (medical) cannabis game so I&#39;ve only had the chance to try vaping four or five strains so far, this being one of my first ones. I prefer concentrates but have the flower of this Purple OG Kush. I really wanted to love this strain but sadly that didn&#39;t happen. I suffer from a chronic pain condition and insomnia and while this strain does help with the pain and my sleep (which is why I gave it three stars) it gives me crazy headaches once it begins wearing off. It is very relaxing and makes me incredibly sleepy but the bad headaches aren&#39;t worth it. It also gives me terrible dry mouth and dry eyes. Looks like this one just isn&#39;t for me.

VThis strain not only offers a satisfying head buzz but it also provides a relaxing body high. While this strain has very rare occasions of headache, paranoia, and blurred vision. It is guaranteed to give you the mighty munchies! Have food at the ready! This earthy and pungent strain comes with a hot dog like taste making the hunger even greater! I recommend this strain for anyone who just wants to chill and eat.

VThis is great the buds smell more like fresh tea with pungent berry smell as well. This is great for just taking the edge off and really relax. Perfect for pain, stress and overall a great time. If you need a chill pill this strain delivers you calm cool and collected. I would give this more likes; however the dry mouth and taste on this is very bleh but must say for a Kush strain its really got some magic in there, doesn&#39;t make me worry or panic just a go with the flow. 8/10

VI&#39;m new to the whole (medical) cannabis game so I&#39;ve only had the chance to try vaping four or five strains so far, this being one of my first ones. I prefer concentrates but have the flower of this Purple OG Kush. I really wanted to love this strain but sadly that didn&#39;t happen. I suffer from a chronic pain condition and insomnia and while this strain does help with the pain and my sleep (which is why I gave it three stars) it gives me crazy headaches once it begins wearing off. It is very relaxing and makes me incredibly sleepy but the bad headaches aren&#39;t worth it. It also gives me terrible dry mouth and dry eyes. Looks like this one just isn&#39;t for me.

Va new strain to me that was mentioned by my cannabis driver, This stuff is really smooth typical of a kush strain typically, the batch that I acquired was definitely grown right and was extremely dankified, and definitely helps with muscle pain, spasms, and stiffness, strong body high with mild head high, sweet taste and the high is great and long lasting, I really enjoy kush especially if its indica dominant,  don&#39;t miss this one if it comes around!

VTried this strain as very well crafted BHO concentrate. I usually favor the uplifting nature of a Sativa, but this is one of the few Indicas I really appreciate. Has a superb aroma of candied berries, and the concentrate produces a flavor that compliments its sugary scent. Great pain relieving massaging body-buzz across the forehead, back, and chest, without much drowsiness. Great strain for kicking back after a hard day&#39;s work or even hanging out with the family after a big dinner. Just don&#39;t plan on going anywhere - you won&#39;t feel like doing a thing.

VThis strain is magical. I just quit smoking wax because it was killing my tolerance, but a bowl or two of this leaves me floating like I used to back in the day before concentrates. I&#39;ve put down the vape temporarily to go back to smoking joints (will eventually go back for health concerns) so maybe that has a contributing factor but this high is fantastic, and I to top it off I no longer need a tolerance break.

Vthis is definitely a strain that is best used when you have nothing to do for the day, and you&#39;re going nowhere. this high does make you get a whole body high, I only smoked 3/4ths of a blunt (by myself) and I was pretty gone. really didn&#39;t want to conversate with anyone till the end of this high, when you start feeling low. when that happens, all you want to do is talk. this is some strong ish, wether youre a experienced smoker or beginner. so hit this with caution! no driving with this one. but while I was under, I really started noticing my surroundings, did a tad bit hallucinating, but it never fucks with you too much. This is an overall great high, best smoked with friends, bc if you&#39;re the only one chopped, they DEFINITELY notice. Smoke this shit, Final rating.

VIt&#39;s nice, I suppose, but I&#39;m definitely more of a Sativa guy. That being said, it&#39;d 100% be best to help you go to sleep, not to inspire any sort of creativity or big happiness, so to speak. Relieves anxiety very effectively, but at the cost of feeling unbelievably sleepy. Like I said before, I&#39;m not big into the whole &quot;sleepy&quot; feeling when it comes to smoking; I&#39;m a comedian, so I look for something to stimulate the mind, but this makes it nearly impossible to think. Makes it very, very easy to overeat and transports you outside of your body. Floating, absent sensation. Not super into it myself, but if you&#39;re looking for something to tone down anxiety for a little while and help you go to sleep, this is the strain for you.

VI was hoping this strain would help with pain, anxiety, or insomnia.... It didn&#39;t help with any. \u000a\u000aI got it from Medreleaf at 14% THC so maybe if the strain had a higher content...\u000a\u000aI felt a little groggy but really nothing to give it more than one star. I vaped about half a gram (double of what I normally do) and still I had just like a little fogginess and a headache. \u000a\u000aI did try it on 3 separate occasions and feel confident in my review. \u000a\u000aMy advise; if you are using MMJ you need a way better strain than this. \u000a\u000aThis dog is very disappointed!

VI grew this thinking it was real Purple Kush but later discovered it was actually Purple OG Kush. I smoked it only at night and it did the job but compared to other indicas this one doesn&#39;t have the same heavy or sedating effects. It&#39;s very comparable to OG Kush so if you like that one you&#39;ll like this one. It&#39;s a good strain but I&#39;m more of a pure indica kind of guy. You&#39;ll feel relaxed, somewhat sleepy and hungry.

VAs a person that prefers indica to sativa this strain was nothing like one to me it has done nothing for my body and in tern all I have gotten is dry eyes, a headache, and a super weird spacey foggy feeling. I have sweaty palms and an anxious feeling which isn&#39;t a good feeling at all and I am strangely clenching my jaw that is a effect I was not expecting. I am sadly disappointed in this strain and wish that I would have gone with a different strain. Lesson learned this will be a strain that sadly goes on my Do Not Smoke list.

VIt&#39;s a good daily driver. It gets you where you need to be. I smoked with glass and paper, and in both cases in seemed like it was a slow rising high. In the case of a joint, it seemed a little slower, but that&#39;s obvious since you can&#39;t rip a joint like a bong. \u000aIt definitely doesn&#39;t help with focus if you&#39;re not able to control your high. People that are new (potowans :-), or more susceptible to &#127811;, to approach with caution. Smoke a bowl, or a joint and give it twenty before moving on just so you can have time to tell where you&#39;re at high-wise. \u000aTo all the pros (jed-high:-), smoke on, y&#39;all!

VJust had a beautiful 3 minute perfectly grinded vape session with Purple OG Kush. This strain provides everything described in every review of this flower! The smell is grape/pine and the taste for me was the same as the smell with my cloudv phantom premium vaporizer. The THC reached my head within 8-10 mins and the CBD reached my body within 20 mins after vaping. Very much what a quality indica should provide. This strain came with excellent after work stress, anxiety and pain relief. And to top it all off like a good purple should it treats insomnia with excellent results!. If you are an indica fan do not pass this strain up if it becomes available at your local dispensaries.

VI love this strain! I&#39;m more of an Sativa fan but this Purple OG Kush does the body right! POK takes you into a deep body relaxation high, yet not so strong that it puts me to sleep. I get really close to the sleepy stage (that eyes low, don&#39;t hear anything, don&#39;t want to move stage.) but I&#39;ve never fully fell asleep and usually popped out of it refreshed and energized. \u000a\u000aI prefer this in the day while I&#39;m active because if I&#39;m busy it keeps me from being couch locked, yet still my body stays relaxed and I&#39;m not in a euphoria state and can function.

VI&#39;m not too fond of the flavor of the one I got ahold of. It was a bit too earthy for my taste. Anything around 18% thc I&#39;m pretty immune to at this point so this strain wasn&#39;t a knock out for me. I got the munchies though so that was cool. The effects were nice and showed it&#39;s indica properties with a slight couch lock feeling. It defiantly makes you wanna chill after working hard all day. I&#39;d love to try this strain in a higher thc. For the novice smoker, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d get a good nights sleep on this one. It&#39;s worth a try if you have a dispensary or a buddy who grows it.

VTried this strain as very well crafted BHO concentrate. I usually favor the uplifting nature of a Sativa, but this is one of the few Indicas I really appreciate. Has a superb aroma of candied berries, and the concentrate produces a flavor that compliments its sugary scent. Great pain relieving massaging body-buzz across the forehead, back, and chest, without much drowsiness. Great strain for kicking back after a hard day&#39;s work or even hanging out with the family after a big dinner. Just don&#39;t plan on going anywhere - you won&#39;t feel like doing a thing.

VI have a few conditions and this made my day. Pain was gone, I felt instantly in a better mood off one bong rip! I would buy this strain in bulk and I don&#39;t say that often about any strain. Comes close to my favorite blue dream. I wish I could also review where I got this from but vaporroom isn&#39;t on leafly yet.

Vbest ever next to the original purple kush. however the intensity is a bit above the original... this is a one of a kind must have if you are a true smoker... newbies may want to try something simple like green crack which has no real buzz to begin with... this is by far going to be in my jar and garden for years to come!

VOne of the most powerful indicia strains ive ever had. It felt like I was hit by a Tsunami of warm milk. It aided in my appetite and food tasted much better. Food wise it was a total euphoria and bliss all the way through. Felt nearly opiating. Negative wise the only thing I noticed was a very dry mouth. I was completely couch locked and tranced by my music. This stuff is great!

VI picked up some of this amazing bud from my local dispensary and was absolutely blown away. I&#39;ve been smoking for almost 20 years and never seen bud like this. Soft, ultra sticky and burns with a smooth tasty smoke. It&#39;s very hard to enjoy other strains after this.

VNIGHT STRAIN! One of the best indica beside purple haze of course. Be prepped to succumbed to a couch potato. Lolz. That being said it was amazing for my migraines too. It definitely was good if i wanted to just knock out too. For beginners or even the pros remember alil goes a log way. The best way though indeed.
