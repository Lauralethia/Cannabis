VThis is definitely a kicker. I&#39;ve been smoking for 3 years and this is one of most effective highs. Great for pain and the body. Don&#39;t need to smoke so much to feel it&#39;s effects. And generates a creative and positive mind. Love it. Definitely one of my top 3 favorites

VWhat can I say about tangerine that is honest and also brutal at the same time. Lest start by saying if you don&#39;t respect this strain then you will find out very quickly moderation is the law when it come to smoking this one. Smoke too much and you will end up in the bathroom puking your guts  out. Smoke just enough and you will enjoy movies like you have never seen them before. This strain is my go to for the ultimate movie experience. Smoke this and watch avatar and I swear you will think you are an avatar. Absolutely brilliant strain. I will never watch a movie without inhaling this first. I suggest anyone to try and enjoy \u000a\u000aFlower smell &#128541;\u000aFlower taste &#128523;\u000aFlower high &#128525;&#128250;

VI&#39;m use sometimes at night a Honey which is made with this and Ghost Train Haze. I used it one of the first mornings and it was very strong. It&#39;s a blended honey edible which is distributed by a state run medical dispensary. I find it&#39;s a bit strong for me for the mornings. I put a half a teaspoon in some tea at night and drink it very slowly. It hits pretty hard. I am a lightweight. I find it brings out a bit of anxiety for me, of which I am very susceptible. But it can help me get into a sleepy mood. I find it does not help that much with pain.

VI got an ounce of this on a whim. Thank God in heaven and the stars that I did.  Hands-down the best weed I&#39;ve ever smoked. Taste: five stars. Duration: five stars. Beauty: priceless. Effects: also priceless. Is it good in the morning?: Absolutely. \u000a\u000aSmells like an orange. Taste like an orange. But like a fine cigar orange where even the smoke feels like a smudge stick of bright light. It&#39;s like eating an orange popsicle and jumping from peak to Peak. But one needs long legs for that. The high doesn&#39;t push you in any One Direction; if you&#39;re experienced, you can control the high very easily. It yields to your good intentions without a fuss and The high always rolling on down the highway  even when I think it is done. It pops up hours later and remind you to be grateful to God almighty on high for creating a plant like this. \u000a\u000aThis weed is so good that I almost wanted to stop smoking it and give it to the Smithsonian museum but then I thought: no. It should be smoked. That&#39;s what this plant leaves for, that&#39;s its purpose. So then I smoked it on my porch and it grew my beard and listened to Willie Nelson&#39;s 2012 album: HEROS which has quite a few tracks where he does do wet with his son and who sounds remarkably like his father. and then I wrote this review. The next thing I recommend is for you to get in your car or walk if you have to and go to a store or a dealer that grows tangerine. Then buy it. Then smoke it. Best in a joint BTW \u000a\u000aJS &#128076;\u000a\u000a

VIf you want a pretty mellow mood enhancing strain, this is it. The strain definitely leans toward sativa effects, with a nice energizing head buzz and eye pressure that took effect, not immediately, but minutes after, very gradually. It was one of the most accommodating come ups I&#39;ve had. My mood improved the more I smoked, that&#39;s no doubt. And more than just the usual mood improvement you get from smoking all the marijuanas. The smell is pungent and citrusy, much like a tangerine ide say. The taste is not far off either with a sweet earth on the inhale and citrus on the exhale. Not the strongest strain I&#39;ve had but with the taste and smell being so great I love it. And regarding the potency, that could just be the quality of the bud I picked up. Good for long shifts at Target&#128073;&#128073;

Orange-Tangerine favored is everywhere from my fingers, to the smoke and the wonderful scent of the flower. Always feel great when I smoke it, along with the urge to doing something, anything.

VI thought this was a little on the weaker side. This strain should be consumed  more for beginners and novice. If you like the &quot;higher&quot; THC strains then I wouldn&#39;t recommend Tangerine in particular. Although the taste is on point, just low THC. So ENJOY and smoke responsibly..Peace&amp;\u2661\u2661\u2661

VLiving in a state that legalized recreational cannabis has granted many new perspectives on the plant.  Considering I have been smoking for over 25 years with the majority of that time consisting of being handed bud with no strain name.  Even if there was a name thrown at you when buying a bag it was not considered legit. In one ear out the other taking little notice of the difference of the high from one bad to another.\u000aSo I&#39;ll admit something once considered a passionate habit that caused great troubles for me as a teenager has turned me into a passionate scholar on cannabis. One thing that has come up is that indicas work better with my personality type.   Also realized that sativas make me have to pee a lot at night if I smoke them later in the day..Love them both just had to observe the buzz of each flower in order to gauge a proper time.  \u000a\u000aThat is responsible me, but really with herb anytime is the right time.  Never have I had an issue with any side effects being too strong doing anything anywhere I have ever been.  And I have been high for 25 years give or take a breather where I was probably high on something else.  You got it, LIFE =)  Whoa, pulling myself back to subject there are some strains that cause a claustrophobic type feeling.  Nothing severe or intense, if anything boring, which is not why I get high.  Medicating is a whole other story.\u000a\u000aTangerine helped me learn that there are strains out there with a great balanced buzz.  As a fan of many hybrids most being more dominant to one end or the other it is only a few that tow the line.  For example, White Widow another being Gorilla Glue #4 strangely Raspberry Kush made the list.  Unbalanced buzz&#39;s with a strong body and head high competing like a speedball in your veins.  If that reference meant nothing keep it that way.\u000a\u000aTangerine is the perfect teeter-totter of light on your feet indica meets down to earth sativa.  At the beginning of the high there is a perfect mesh of a not heavy relaxed feeling with an active mind offering a little motivation.  Also at times inspiration with a creative edge.  The closest I have come to balanced perfection, but can not necessarily claim to be a hybrid.  A 4th generation inbred CH9 Aroma which makes me wonder if the hybridization factor plays part in making for a better blended buzz.\u000a\u000aMy assumption is that it does play a big part and so folks should def check out Tangerine if looking for this.  And even if you don&#39;t give a crap about any of that the taste is super yummy =)

VI bought Tangerine after reading so many good things about it! I was hesitant to give it a shot at first because of the name \u201cTangerine\u201d, it just didn\u2019t seem appealing. I smoked Tangerine and man oh man, I can\u2019t feel anything but happiness and calm and warm feeling, i can tell you will feel euphoric with this one, it can\u2019t be very harsh at first if you\u2019re used to sativa or sativa dominant hybrids, this one is like a push in the pool into the world of Sativa: euphoria\u201d. Anyways I recommend this one to younger people or someone seeking excitement. Tangerine &#128525; 9/10 BTW: it\u2019s true! TANGERINE TASTES LIKE COTTON CANDY AND WHIPPED CREAM AND THE FLAVOR IS AMAZING BUT IM ON A ROLLERCOASTER SND SATIVA IS CRAZY

VThis stuff smells and tastes like peeling a tangerine but more pungent. To be honest. it was only mediocre for pain management, so all the stars are for taste and smell.

VA great smelling and tasting straing, the first thing you&#39;ll notice is that Tangerine hits you with pungent aromas of tangerine peels and cheese.  When vaped, the strong citrus, orange, and sweet taste is a pleasant introduction to the inset of its effects.  Feeling it in the head first, a thick, but comfortable high will ease on.  Definitely a giggly, mood enhancing strain.  A few minutes after the effects settle in to the head, a comfortable body high rolls through that makes chilling on the couch a heavenly experience.  This strain is real good for enjoying movies and if you allow it, you can find yourself on a couch for hours just because of how pleasant the strain is.\u000a\u000aGreat Sativa dominant hybrid!!

VTangerine in name, tangerine in taste. Boy was this strain delicious. The citrus flavors are overwhelming, and will leave you wanting to munch on some citrus (as in it gives you the munchies).

I was planning on doing my english paper, but no, I am way too happy listening to my favorite songs and I&#39;m dancing the best I have in my whole life. I just felt overly happy and it was really nice. I had a strong urge to remain standing and dancing when high, but I was also typing my paper. This is just the best strain I have had and it tastes like I&#39;m eating actual tangerines. AHAHAHAHAH! Pick this up now!

VA great smelling and tasting straing, the first thing you&#39;ll notice is that Tangerine hits you with pungent aromas of tangerine peels and cheese.  When vaped, the strong citrus, orange, and sweet taste is a pleasant introduction to the inset of its effects.  Feeling it in the head first, a thick, but comfortable high will ease on.  Definitely a giggly, mood enhancing strain.  A few minutes after the effects settle in to the head, a comfortable body high rolls through that makes chilling on the couch a heavenly experience.  This strain is real good for enjoying movies and if you allow it, you can find yourself on a couch for hours just because of how pleasant the strain is.\u000a\u000aGreat Sativa dominant hybrid!!

Vlove this strain! it really smell like oranges, I couldn&#39;t stop smelling I was pretty impressed. At first I got full of energy and couldn&#39;t control my talking since my mind was fast. THen shortly after that everything was just in slow motion least I thought it was... then I just felt heavy and giggly and Sooooo relax and chilled.

VI am new to the idea of vaping. Usually, I&#39;ll hit the vape pen later in the day, after I&#39;ve already smoked. Last weekend, I tried vaping first and WOW. I got the best buzz and pain relief ever. Not sure if it was the strain or process, but it gave a lot of relief delivered in a more cerebral way. Will definitely try again. Hey growers, how about a bit more of a selection of disposable vape pen flavors and potencies.

VAgent Orange is my favorite citrus strain; this runs a close second.  Tangerine has diesel overtones while Agent Orange has more of a peppery taste.  Anyone that likes citrus flavor will like this strain.  Use a vape or your favorite glass piece that brings out the flavors.  I experienced a very long aftertaste with citrus lingering in my nose long after the exhale.  Taste + a great high; strains like this spoil me and raise the bar in terms of what good weed is.

VTangerine is great for day use. It makes me friendly and appropriately outgoing. I can focus on tasks and I feel incredibly creative. Kills nausea, but doesn&#39;t really kill my lower back pain. \u000a\u000aI can smoke this while working (discreetly on a break, of course) and stay on task. I don&#39;t get too bummed when I come down either, so that&#39;s a plus. Great for stress.

Vthis is by far the best sativa I have partaken of, it may not seem strong but it overcomes the anxiety almost immediately, very uplifting and chipper. This strain smells amazing, when you get complemented on your cologne after smoking you know you smell great haha. also the body high at the peak is pretty good as well.

After one hit my eyes and body slumped feeling the full effects of the potent strain. Very euphoric and almost a perfect blend of energy and laziness. Absolutely loved this strain and would buy it again!
