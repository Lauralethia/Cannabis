VI was told that the purple dream was a mix blue dream and granddaddy purple; two of my favorite strains. I had to try it based on that, and I am impressed. Apparently (according to the description here) it is part purple kush rather than GDP, but it doesn&#39;t matter. I really like this strain. It is mellow/calming, but doesn&#39;t stop me from functioning...pretty much exactly what I was hoping for. One of my new favorites :-)

VMy all-time favorite.\u000a\u000aIt is as if Blue Dream and the sweetest purps in the valley got together for dinner one night, and made some poor decisions that led to the rapid maturity that comes with adolescent parenthood. They then took that little bundle of joy and taught it everything they knew about unconditional love and caring for their fellow citizens. \u000a\u000aThis is Purple Dream; see her, favor her, get to know her.

Giddy-like excitement wells up in your chest and causes you to beam and feel thrillingly good. That purple is always just so irrepressibly happy! Mentally engaged and quite sociable while simultaneously clear and relaxed. Euphoric like a cold, mountain lake. Music is trippy, you hear it differently than normal.

Upon smoking the J, the colors of the night became vivid, and the beauty and warmth of the world popped out at me. A great idea came out of nowhere and I was able to take action on it with no hesitation. I then enjoyed great conversation with clear thoughts, and the feeling of a blanket all over my body.

VBought thus strain as a gram of &quot;Natural Trichomes&quot; aka kief from The Green Solution on Potomac in Aurora. It was in the Sativa section and it&#39;s info tab also said Sativa but this strain is an Indica dominant hybrid (obviously with either purple strain being India&#39;s dom and Blue D being a 50/50.) I normally don&#39;t like Blue Dream or it&#39;s offsprings but I enjoyed this strain. While smoking it straight as kief after every hit there would be resonating warm from the sternum outward, enveloping one in a euphoric tingling warmth. Despite it bring an extremely heavy Indica dom that is great for insomnia, the Blue Dream certainly made itself felt by providing a euporhic and delightful head high that was great for socializing (so great in fact that my friend, a 30 yr old who has smoked daily since age 10, was so stoned off of about 6 or 7 hits that he wouldn&#39;t STOP talking [was slightly annoying honestly.]\u000aThis is a strain I would recommend for night time use or a lazy day because of the heaviness of it&#39;s indica side (it&#39;s not so heavy you are 100% couch-locked but heavy enough to make one extremely unproductive.)

VSince moving to Colorado and having the ability to shop for strains, I&#39;ve been able to place this fantastic medicine into the afternoon portion of my daily rotation and keep it there. Excellent relief from my nerve pain and muscle spasms while providing a calm focus and an enjoyable flavor. Maintains the great high from the Blue Dream that I use in the mornings, while bringing the relaxation in a bit more. It&#39;s the perfect middle between Blue Dream for the daytime and the Purple Kush or Purple Urkle I use for the evenings.

I prefer this strain over blue dream, just because it a lil more indica dominant. It helped with my pain, helped a lot. The plant was similiar high to trainwreck.

VPurple Dream is a very solid nighttime/winding down type of strain. It&#39;s got great bag appeal and tastes great out of a vape. The high is great, its solidly cerebral but I also feel the GDP coming through in the body effects. You remember that little angel from angels in the outfield that shows up in the dugout rubbing the players shoulders? that&#39;s what I&#39;m feeling right now from the body effects.  I&#39;m really happy I was able to snag the last 1/4 on the Med side @ fox street. Its a great strain. Must try for sure. Can we just all go back to the 90&#39;s?

VLove this strain, for anyone thinking about trying it out. I highly recommend it. It doesn&#39;t just sack you out for hours, it gives you a light but focused feeling, while being pretty relaxed. Especially for any new smokers, the smell is fruity and pungent. It can get your pretty ripped, but not to where you can&#39;t function. One of my favorite strains.

VReceived an 8th from a delivery service in phoenix area az. I really enjoy this hybrid. If I see it again, gonna make another grab. This is one I can function on, blue dream is straight and the purple indy seems like just the right body. Slight crash at the end I suppose. Works wonders for my nausea and stomach/back pain.

VTried this strain for the first time about a month ago and it is now my go to having a good evening. It\u2019ll put you in a happy, relaxed state but not couch locked. Everything is rainbows and unicorns after a few hits. Never fails to put me in a great mood and de stress for the night. You\u2019ll go to bed and wake up after the best sleep.

They effects were very euphoric and could be felt all throughout the body. i was awake and had no trouble interact with large groups of people but obce i went to relax I got really melo and chilled. 10/10 would recommend

VOne of the main reasons I use medicinal marijuana is for my PTSD symptoms. I often have periods of numbness followed by periods of anger. sleeplessness, or depression. I&#39;ve found that Purple Dream works for both of these states. When I&#39;m numb, Purple Dream makes me more alert, present, and creative. When I&#39;m depressed or anxious, it can really calm me down, and help me focus on what is right in front of me. My creativity level is really up on this strain as well! I find everything really interesting. 5/5 stars! I&#39;ve never had such a versatile, blissful strain. This is a real godsend!

VIMHO this is another pointless strain. Blue Dream by itself is way better; crossing it with a strong indica just muddles the effects. No real effect on inflammation and it makes tinnitus horrible. It does spark some creativity but it makes you too lethargic to do anything about it. P.D. also made my depression worse, I did not feel uplifted at all.  No wonder this bud was discounted.

VThis is a pretty good strain, though definitely not one of the best. What i think is that we had some not-so-committed growers of this bud, because these nugs werent dense &amp; they werent really crystallized, &amp; this bud just looked sad... but they would reek up a room in half a second, I mean this bus smelt extremely strong, which sorta payed off for the bud itself... When the high first hit me, my mind was completely altered &amp; it just burst of ideas &amp; thoughts. At the time me &amp; my friend were trying to make a song &amp; we also had complete writers block, though after that session we had made the song, i loved the fact that it actually helped me alot with my personal issues. Great for creativity &amp; strong mind thought. Strong headband.

VPurple Dream&#39;s effects are relaxing, uplifting and pain relieving. There is definitely a cerebral stone with this strain so daytime use may not be the best time to partake of Purple Dream . I like it but I much prefer Blue Dream&#39;s effects. Overall a pleasant strain but there is some burn out when using. Would recommend for moderate pain relief and as a stress buster.

VI just happens to pick up a great deal on this beautiful little flower. By nature I gravitate to strong heavy Indica s. Lately I have been trying to work some hybrid or straight sativas into my mix. This blows blue dream away in my opinion. The very slight kick you get from the GDP takes any of the more annoying sativa traits and blends in to a perfect anytime smoke, fully function, yet relived. There are zero negative effects commonly associated with a sativa plant. If you can find it in quantity you won&#39;t get tired of its consistenty. \u000a***5 star rating is due to the balance this flower has**** fantasitc cross.

VVery nice high, a bit tweeked from my ATF (Blue Dream)\u000a\u000aA bit sleepier than Blue Dream as well. Still a very nice high. The smoke was smooth and cough-less. The taste is VERY good. Kind of a woodsey finish. Dig it.

VKeep in mind im not a frequent smoker &amp; I have a weaker constitution. I took 4 tokes mind you....got violently sick &amp; dizzy...threw up and laid on my bed deep breathing to stop the spinning. My whole body was in a full blown flutter tingle....I thought I was dying until I passed out
