VShabbat shalom fellow tokers ahaha! I totally understand why Kosher Kush was the first strain to be blessed by a Rabbi. This is a true indica with some staggering THC levels. In other words...It will knock you on your ass if you don&#39;t respect it. Stoned me completely and I was lights out in just less than 2 hours. Not too dense of bud but it looked very similar to all other types of kush strains. The scent was also your regular kush tones of earth and pine/wood, and on top of it all extremely pungent. High sets in heavy on the body and will make you feel sedated. Great for entering the most deep state of relaxation, striking up an appetite, or beating insomnia. Note that I overdid it with this strain a couple of times and noticed I became dizzy and very disoriented, which is not the greatest feeling when you&#39;re stoned. Not much else to say about this strain, just a REALLY great indica :)\u000a\u000aLook: 5/5 \u000aScent: 5/5\u000aHigh: 5/5 (Knockout)\u000aBurnout: 5/5 (you will want to sleep!)\u000aOverall: 5/5

VVery pretty buds, upon breaking the first one one I took a close smell. Notes of Diesel, ground coffee, with a hint of citrus  Extremely dense insanely sticky weed. If you break it up by hand your thumbs and forefingers will wind up just as sticky and mine did. This is a nice smoke. Sweet citrusy flavour with  a hashy skunky finish. Prepare to cough .. I rolled a good sized joint half the size of a cigarette and smoked half. Was instantly high from first hit and after smoking the buzz intensified for about 10 minutes to an almost perfect balance of head and body high. ... 40 minutes later .. still satisfied. A++++  here .. the real diggity dank. Stop reading this bullshit and go get some Kosher Kush .. lol

VWONDERFUL insomnia medicine!  I&#39;ve tried so many different indica strains and the vast majority of them, while good for the pain,  did NOT help me sleep and left me sorely disappointed in that area.  Kosher Kush, on the other hand, has me very impressed.  I&#39;m actually feeling tired and should be able to get a good night&#39;s sleep after writing this review.  There was a nice tingling body buzz for the first few minutes, followed by a gradual mellowing out and getting more in the moment.  I feel a euphoria, but it&#39;s different than normal - not spacy, but very lucid.  The mood is definitely upbeat and optimistic.  The flavor when smoking it was just so wonderfully fruity and spicy.  VERY strong grape flavor.  Didn&#39;t taste any plant flavors at all - just grapes, turmeric, black pepper, sandalwood, roses and a touch of oranges.  By far the best tasting pot I ever smoked.  A true exotic arabian dessert...WOW!\u000aZero anxiety or paranoia.  Really one of the best medical strains out there.  I would highly suggest insomnia sufferers to try Kosher Kush if they have been disappointed by the others they&#39;ve tried.

Vhalom, my Friends!   Just winding down the evening with Kosher Kush. There wasn\u2019t a star of David on the label, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s kosher anyway.  I was actually raised Catholic and the warm weighty smell and taste of Kosher Kush reminds me of heavy purple velvet papal vestments, permeated with incense and a little bit of dust.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis indica smells and tastes of a heavy grape and balsam \u2013 and it took me awhile to come up with the word \u201cbalsam\u201d for this taste palette. The heaviness this strain imparts has me wanting to crawl into a pile of blankets.  Mine tested at 22.11% THC and .05%  CBD.\u000a\u000a\u000aThis one is warm and cozy, and has me thinking this would be a great strain for winter when we hibernate.  In fact, I think I\u2019m going to go upstairs, smoke some more Kosher Kush, and slink under the covers and see what happens.  It\u2019s been a long day and it\u2019s time to unwind and let go.

VKosher Kush... What to say about this strain?.. Kosher Kush is the greatest indica I have ever had and it&#39;s probably my favorite strain of all time! It&#39;s pungent and wispful aroma of an earthy and woody is a scent of pure divine and Maya.\u000a\u000aThe feeling of such a comfortable and relaxing Indica is destined to leave you happy and giggly throughout your journey in Dreamland. I personally suffer from immense anxiety and panic especially from Hybrids and Sativa&#39;s (excluding Jack Herer). Kosher Kush is most definitely a strain to call your favorite.

VI love this strain but i love the sour kosher so much better and i have dont  both. The bigger yield and height go to this plant not the sour. It is one of the most yielding kushes I have done. It had a citrus and hazey kush feel. It was good and about the right amount thc i would say about 16-19 percent. So great smoke all round. But if chose is given get the sour.

VIf you vape be sure not to turn it up to high unless you want to go into a coma of sleep. Best bud for sleeping next to la confidential. If you have pain and just want a mellow sleepy cozy body relax then kosher kush aka known as jew gold for its medicinal effects and has been blessed by a rabbi, you just can&#39;t beat that unless its been knighted lol but yes great for body and ocd thoughts as well.

With each hit I feel my anxious symptoms start to reach a calm state and I am relieved of any negative and stressful thoughts.after finishing my session I returned to my couch with a content feeling that helped me recuperate my emotions, Life conflicts, and satisfaction from a strain that has both a strong potency and high medical benefit for users that suffer from depression and triggered anxiousness. ~ \u26c5\ufe0f

As soon as I smoked this I felt like I had found the high I had been looking for with the last 100 strains I&#39;ve sampled.  I realize Leafly says this is mainly for Insomnia but that is simply untrue.  This is a very potent strain with excellent pain relief properties and can give you the giggles and serious munchies.  This strain is simply a lot of fun to smoke - no matter what you are doing.  My #1 favorite after sampling 100&#39;s of strains over several years.\u000a10/10

VKosher Kush - dense deep green buds with a noticeable resin filled squish when you squeeze it. Do not, I repeat, Do Not expect to roll joints with this. No workie. Bong or pipeloads only. Two full tunes of this out of my 3ft Graffix and that&#39;s all she wrote for a solid 2 1/2-3hr high. Smooth deep blue smoke. Nice pine,kushy, forrest floor taste. Can&#39;t build a tolerance on this zip. Smoked and smoked, and only noticed very slightly,near the end (23 days per OZ) that my tolerance was increasing. Great for pain, joint stiffness, anxiety, insomnia. if you have something very important and pressing to finish - move along. This strain exhibits many of the stereotypical properties of really tasty indicas. I love it.

VThe single best adjective I would use to describe this popular strain, is &quot;heavy&quot;.  The aroma is strong and the smoke is expansive in the lungs.  The sample I experienced totaled 26.74% THC, with 1.00% CBDA.  Nowhere that I researched could give definitive information as to genetic ratios, but this is an Indica heavy hybrid by all accounts.   Its effects are &quot;hard to breathe&quot; heavy (may induce anxiety), strong stone that eventually relaxes and makes you want to sleep.  This one, I suggest be used as &quot;medicine&quot;...  when needed and not for daily use due to its potency and lingering effects.   If that is your aim and/or you like Indica strains, then you will likely be happy with Kosher Kush.

The sample I experienced totaled 26.74% THC, with 1.00% CBDA.  Nowhere that I researched could give definitive information as to genetic ratios, but this is an Indica heavy hybrid by all accounts.   Its effects are &quot;hard to breathe&quot; heavy (may induce anxiety), strong stone that eventually relaxes and makes you want to sleep.  This one, I suggest be used as &quot;medicine&quot;...  when needed and not for daily use due to its potency and lingering effects.   If that is your aim and/or you like Indica strains, then you will likely be happy with Kosher Kush.

VKosher Kush - dense deep green buds with a noticeable resin filled squish when you squeeze it. Do not, I repeat, Do Not expect to roll joints with this. No workie. Bong or pipeloads only. Two full tunes of this out of my 3ft Graffix and that&#39;s all she wrote for a solid 2 1/2-3hr high. Smooth deep blue smoke. Nice pine,kushy, forrest floor taste. Can&#39;t build a tolerance on this zip. Smoked and smoked, and only noticed very slightly,near the end (23 days per OZ) that my tolerance was increasing. Great for pain, joint stiffness, anxiety, insomnia. if you have something very important and pressing to finish - move along. This strain exhibits many of the stereotypical properties of really tasty indicas. I love it.

VThis is the happiest indica I&#39;ve ever had. This stuff crushes my depression like nothing else. But it&#39;s not a goofy, giggly happy - it&#39;s more like everything is ok in the world. Kosher Kush (or Indicol P in Connecticut) will eventually make me sleepy but it takes a while. I stick to afternoon/evening sessions and sleep great. This will be my go-to indica from now on.

I feel like more people need to try or at least know about this bud. the taste is incredible, and this true indica is perfect for what I look for most: sleep, pain relief, and headaches most of all. i find this strain great for body aches and pains as well, and of course perfect to eliminate stress/anxiety\u000aLook [8/10]\u000aTaste [9/10]\u000aSmell [8/10]\u000aLinneage [10/10]\u000aHigh [9.5/10]\u000a44.5/50

VKosher Kush is great for insomnia, and it was the first strain that made me realize medicating with cannabis can have some amazing results in my overall health.\u000a\u000aKosher Kush has a very potent anti-anxiety effect, potent anti-depression properties, noticeable appetite enhancement, decent euphoria, decent pain relief, and very potent anti-insomnia effects. I have collected these findings over the course of 3 separate Kosher Kush grows. \u000a\u000aKosher Kush is a very advisable cure for insomnia, and it&#39;s a great night time indica all round.\u000a\u000aBoth as a caveat, and as advice I would have to add to this review that indica THC capsules will totally end insomnia with very little failure at around $50-$85 CAN per month with no inhaling of any combusted or vaporized cannabis plant matter whatsoever. Indica THC capsules common side effects are mild constipation, and less common side effects are moderate drowsiness upon waking. Remember that using cannabis doesn&#39;t have to cost much, so save your money, and pass on the information if it aided you.

VKOSHER KUSHxBlueDream- Pineapple Dream (hybrid)\u000a\u000aPineapple Dream doesn&#39;t have a page yet, as it probably is a southern California exclusive strain at the moment. I found the name of the strain to be misleading, as the amazing flower of Pineapple Dream resembles much more of LA Kush type of flowers in smell, appearance, and high; than a pineapple express x blue dream hybrid as the name falsey suggests. The large, dense buds reeked of a skunky berry with strong hints of fuel and pine. Very pungent smell. The type of weed your neighbor&#39;s neighbor could smell. Beautiful big nugs, very frosty and sticky. White ashes, yet smoke was a bit harsher than others, typical of &quot;the good kush&quot;. Makes you cough then you stop and realize how stoned you just became. Intense head buzz at first. Feel it right behind the eyes too. Not racy but super happy and focused. Very euphoric and uplifting at first, the giggles and all too. extreme munchies and couchlock soon ensue, be warned. One of the best hybrids I&#39;ve ever enjoyed.

VI have had this strain several times and in different forms as well. This however, is a review on a concentrate form of the Kosher Kush. \u000aThis particular batch comes with a slightly different flavor than of that which I am used to smoking. It does have it&#39;s chemical/diesel flavor, but there is a &quot;tone&quot; of a soapy chemical. Since the concentrate itself is of the highest quality, I must assume that soapy flavor occurs naturally. There is also a hint of pine throughout the after taste which could possibly be the cause of the soap flavor. It is important to note that the soap flavor is not overwhelming, if anything it is very subtle. The most overwhelming flavor is diesel/chem taste. \u000aThe high is a relaxed, meditative state of couch lock. If you&#39;ve done this before then you will have no problem &quot;functioning&quot; but at the same time you can find what you&#39;re looking for in an herb. Do not over use Kos if you are a novice. The Kos concentrate is a strain that will induce &quot;the fear.&quot;

VKosher Kush is probably one of the single best buds and concentrates I have smoked/vaped. The body high is an incredible wave tingling. Plus this strain is approved by God, it&#39;s Kosher!

It&#39;s an amazing high. Use for all activities.

I\u2019m happy that I did because it\u2019s helped me combat my bouts of anxiety which come in waves. I definitely notice a difference in my thoughts and overall sense of relaxation. Kosher Kush helps me adjust and become more comfortable with my surroundings. It\u2019s also great that it makes me sleepy as fuck. The come down is where I find more of the sleepy effects kick in.

VThis review is for the PAX Era Kosher Kush pod. Honest and truly, it was one of the best smokes I\u2019ve ever had and I\u2019ve smoked since May 1996. The live resin was very smooth and never made me cough, which also meant I took bigger hits. This got me to one of my highest highs. Immediately after I smoked, I felt the gentle wave of the extremely relaxing cerebral effects. When the physical effects hit, it felt very relaxing and gently tingling, like I just had a great massage. I truly can\u2019t recommend this strain enough.

VCurrently smoking KK. This flower smells excellent. Slight citrusy zest smell with a little sweetness is how I would describe it. Think yellow starburst candy. This particular bud is only 16% thc but man it gives a great high. The high is very much in the face and eyes. Very good body melt too. This and 9 pound hammer seemed to give me the best body melts. Smokes really well. Like I said, this gram I bought is only 16% thc, but I\u2019ve seen this strain other places well into the mid and high 20s thc. I look forward to trying the higher thc Kosher Kush\u2019s. I think this bud, when strong enough, will make for a very useful night time sleep strain for those struggling with insomnia. It makes you quite tired and gives a good amount of couch lock. Focusing is quite difficult on this strain. Overall this is a great strain. Very happy with it. 4.8 Stars.

I feel like more people need to try or at least know about this bud. the taste is incredible, and this true indica is perfect for what I look for most: sleep, pain relief, and headaches most of all. i find this strain great for body aches and pains as well, and of course perfect to eliminate stress/anxiety. 29% THC is earth shattering, thats at the very top of the flower game, percentage wise right now.\u000aLook [8/10]\u000aTaste [9.5/10]\u000aSmell [8/10]\u000aLinneage [10/10]\u000aHigh [9.5/10]\u000a45/50\u000a

VSo great for insomnia due to pain and leg spasms.  If you have difficulty falling asleep because of pain, spasms or tightness, this strain is a great choice.  If you have trouble falling asleep for other reasons, I&#39;d recommend other strains since the way this one fights my nerve damage symptoms directly which allows me to fall asleep.

I feel like more people need to try or at least know about this bud. the taste is incredible, and this true indica is perfect for what I look for most: sleep, pain relief, and headaches most of all. i find this strain great for body aches and pains as well, and of course perfect to eliminate stress/anxiety. 29% THC is earth shattering, thats at the very top of the flower game, percentage wise right now.\u000aLook [8/10]\u000aTaste [9.5/10]\u000aSmell [8/10]\u000aLinneage [10/10]\u000aHigh [9.5/10]\u000a45/50\u000a

VSo great for insomnia due to pain and leg spasms.  If you have difficulty falling asleep because of pain, spasms or tightness, this strain is a great choice.  If you have trouble falling asleep for other reasons, I&#39;d recommend other strains since the way this one fights my nerve damage symptoms directly which allows me to fall asleep.

VOne of my personal favorite strains. Whatever ails you, this is good medicine. Earthy, musty smelling, and smooth tasting. Not a ton of flavor on this one, but a nice, mellow, relaxing high, body and mind. I&#39;m nodding along with some good tunes, and not thinking about much else, if anything.

VThis review is for the PAX Era Kosher Kush pod. Honest and truly, it was one of the best smokes I\u2019ve ever had and I\u2019ve smoked since May 1996. The live resin was very smooth and never made me cough, which also meant I took bigger hits. This got me to one of my highest highs. Immediately after I smoked, I felt the gentle wave of the extremely relaxing cerebral effects. When the physical effects hit, it felt very relaxing and gently tingling, like I just had a great massage. I truly can\u2019t recommend this strain enough.

VI have this strain 5 stars due to fact that it gives me one of the longest lasting effects I have yet to experience!! 4 times, 3- 4 hour lasting on average. My caregiver is Awesome, so that helps &#128522;. I am a seasoned smoker, and with these 24k,  I can medicate &quot;all needs&quot;. Genetics are 2 of my personal favorites  (Kosher kush is one of the best Indicas, IMO!) Tangie is Terpene queen! So Highly recommended by me, the true Sir Tokes A Lot! Follow my reviews, and I won&#39;t be disappointed my peeps! 1 LOVE

VThis is my second go with Kosher Kush.  First time was a few months ago but I do not remember much about it.  All I can say now is that it&#39;s probably my favorite strain.  It knocks out everything I need.  No negative fleeting thoughts.  Appetite: I take an antidepressant (as a supplement to bipolar meds) that destroys my appetite.. One bong rip from this and I am able to eat.  I think my favorite part of this medicine is that I do not have crazy or obscure thoughts which I get ALL the time from sativas and a little with hybrids.  I don&#39;t want that.  My mind is racing all the time I don&#39;t want more of that shit.  Probably my go to now since it covers all my needs.  Great stuff.

VWOW, another great Kush strain!  Although there is some great indicas, this one is my favorite. Within the first two or three puffs, it hits you and after about two or three bowls, your gone. One of the strongest, most potent strains I have smoked. Highly recommend trying it. Great for pains, but even better for stress and depression. Has a very strong, relaxing body high.

VThis one surprised me. Their regular price was steep but it is top shelf and definitely worth it on sale-day. Strong pain relief, but fairly &quot;up&quot; considering the strong indica body effects. Ate everything in sight. Sleep came easily at the end. Vapour was tasty, kind of a woody/earthy with a hint of lavender-mint tea.

VI love this strain. It\u2019s long been one of my favorites and just recently I had a strong desire to get my hands on some. I\u2019m happy that I did because it\u2019s helped me combat my bouts of anxiety which come in waves. I definitely notice a difference in my thoughts and overall sense of relaxation. Kosher Kush helps me adjust and become more comfortable with my surroundings. It\u2019s also great that it makes me sleepy as fuck. The come down is where I find more of the sleepy effects kick in. Overall I\u2019ve loved &amp; still love this strain so much that I needed to share my experience with it.\u000a\u000a\u000axoxoxoxo

No paranoia and I vaped a good amount, so that&#39;s a good sign.  Did it at night and was still able to get things done that I needed to do, so I wasn&#39;t couch locked at all.  Also made me a little sleepy, which was perfect, but it did not make me just want to fall asleep.

VKosher is rugby up there with Bubba Kush in my Indica favorites due to its consistency in potency, bud-structure, and flavor. Understandable why it has so many awards under its belt. A must try if you haven&#39;t already. Seeing is how its everywhere @ the moment. The SugarWax of it is fire as well, brings out all the terps

VKosher Kush is one of the best strains for a creeping, heavy, couch-lock high with great pain relief and treating insomnia. Wonderfully earthy smell with a slight taste of buttered popcorn.

My bud came in a big sticky cluster of goodness! It leaves you feeling relaxed and in a good head-space. If you keep at it with this strain, it&#39;ll be hard not to doze off.

VWhy do people say this strain is spicy? Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve smoked wayyyyy spicier weed than kosher kush, or maybe it&#39;s because I use hemp blunt wraps I don&#39;t notice. But yeah this strain is proper. I got a half zip at bloom in phoenix at first I was upset I didn&#39;t get a sativa but once I got home and smoked I was very happy. But stay warned it&#39;s a night time strain and it&#39;s a creeper so don&#39;t smoke a blunt then go to work. If u suffer from insomnia, pain, or depression, this will work for ya.

VA super solid indica! This strain smells like sweet pine to me. The flavor is great, sweet &amp; herbal. It&#39;s different shades of green, with plenty of red-ish/brown tricomes! My bud came in a big sticky cluster of goodness! It leaves you feeling relaxed and in a good head-space. If you keep at it with this strain, it&#39;ll be hard not to doze off. I really enjoyed this indica! L&#39;Chaim!

So as long as I\u2019m close to bedtime, it\u2019s great. \u000aBUT...it gives me the WORST dry eyes. Like, I wanna scratch my eyeballs out, it\u2019s so bad.

It was in Albuquerque NM dispensary called seven Glover. Great place with Saturday and Sunday bud discounts. 6,7 gram middle of the the thc grade 19.oo to 22.oo percent. usually 1 sativa and 1 indica. Now to the  the real good quality ( this Saturday ,Sunday Kosher kush. On my top 10 list. If you love a sweet smell, great body high.

But yeah this strain is proper. I got a half zip at bloom in phoenix at first I was upset I didn&#39;t get a sativa but once I got home and smoked I was very happy. But stay warned it&#39;s a night time strain and it&#39;s a creeper so don&#39;t smoke a blunt then go to work. If u suffer from insomnia, pain, or depression, this will work for ya.

VKosher was described to me as a heavy strain when I made my first purchase. I&#39;d say it&#39;s heavy with a cerebral threshold, where I can have a bigger than usual session without feeling like I went overboard. The high provides me with reduced muscle tension, without the energy depletion that&#39;s sometimes attached with other heavy Indicas. Being able to keep my mind somewhat sharp while having a head-to-toe body high is advantageous, especially while working on art in the later hours of the day. The leaf grinds and smokes great and is super tasty vaporized. Tastes like the air at a Pennsylvanian Amish farmstead just as the sun comes up over the horizon and the dew in the wheat fields begin to disappear.

VA solid 8 for me, nice chunky clusters. Very dank nugs, if you get it fresh the aroma is very fruity, must have been near a juicy fruit strain. Normal it kind of smells musky to me almost over ripened fruit. Heavy smoke left me day dreaming here and there every 10 minutes felt like some other being was calling my name. It has the nice warm feeling and it makes you want to sleep. I had unusual ideas, and the sense of depth was very 2D rather than 3D.\u000aThe first couple of times I did kosher Kush it was the laziest I think I have ever been next to lavender Kush.  Has some couch locking features, overall if your not experienced with the strains I highly suggest this one it comes on smooth and locks you, but doesn&#39;t force you to become couch locked. Found it great for stress and lower back pain, if you have a ruptured disk or been over working your muscles this is excellent for taking a break and letting your body rest completely. \u000a\u000aThe second time it me much harder than before. It was mentally trying to lock my body, I had some pains in my foot from walking, that vanished, but if your in the energetic mood this is a strain that will give you the most relaxing feeling great for working on Home Work or getting all your chickens lined up in a row. Whenever I see Kosher Kush I make an effort to get at least 2grams the latest. You never know when you might get a day off or work double shifts.

VKosher is rugby up there with Bubba Kush in my Indica favorites due to its consistency in potency, bud-structure, and flavor. Understandable why it has so many awards under its belt. A must try if you haven&#39;t already. Seeing is how its everywhere @ the moment. The SugarWax of it is fire as well, brings out all the terps

Few minutes pass as I laid on the couch and it developed into one of the more relaxing indicas that I have tried. Not saying this one packs a punch, but it can sneak up on you, so first time users of the strain beware. Great strain for passing out to a movie or otherwise good nights sleep.

Brain buzzing, but not in over-drive, and happy happy all around.  Soon enough, I&#39;m flat out in da couch, kinda wondering &quot;How did I get here?&quot;  The effect was great- from high to stoned - and still smiling inside and out.  Nice wake and bake kinda buzz.  I like the transitional buzz. (Now I think I&#39;m just making stuff up.) Enjoy this smoke.  I did.

I took a couple dabs of this with a friend and felt amazing. My body pain melted away, I was incredibly relaxed, and you know I was hungry. Oh my goodness I was hungry. After chowing down, we took a few more dabs of the Kosher Kush and called it good. Expect to be really hungry &amp; sleepy after indulging in this. Overall, this is one of the few strains that delivers all the great effects you&#39;d expect of marijuana. Cheers!

VJust had a half of this come to me(head stash, sry NJ) and after the 1st taste i decided to hoard it all for myself. Tight, yellow cheesy hairs cover the entire bud, and while its so rock hard that feels like it would turn to dust at first contact. it breaks into sticky little nugs rather easily. the smell and taste remind me of Fire OG without a diesel infulence. Very lemon floor cleanery, yet something in there lets you know its def a OG strain. The effects are unmistakeable, and undeniable, your stoned. After smoking Kosher, youve got about 5mins to plants yourself were you wanna be for the next 4 hrs, because this stuff SEDATES you. Complete and total relaxation. A legut medical quality strain for insomnia and stress/pain relief.Definetly lives up to the hype.

VI have smoked Kosher many times now.  I tried the strain maybe 6 months back and have been buying it ever since.  A very sticky bud, smelly and dense, it invites many just by its look.  As a patient i have a lot of pain, this strain maybe isnt the best at elevating pain, but it does make you forget it lol.   (maybe just as good).  I will not only recommend it but will continue to smoke it for pain.  Happy to have found it!!

Vhesitant at first dew to how heavy India&#39;s tend to feel.  Also the dispensary i went to didn&#39;t have the Sativa selection one would like too see. soooo... i almost had no choice. it was $10 gram day, and i wanted to get a few different strains to explore in hopes of a new fav. anyhow. This strain by no means is my fav although it had some very useful medicinal values worth speaking of. This strain really is a mood changer one vap hit and i didn&#39;t have a worries in mind. For the past 2 day i been asleep by 8 and this great news for someone like myself with sleep issues. Also worth noting its left me seriously hungry.  im not sure what the info for this strain is but omg i only recall eating like a king before it knocked me out. good luck u guys

VKosher Kush is an all around deep strain.  For example, after typing a fairly decent albeit long winded review for this strain my elbow clicked the mouse.  This elbow slip erased my work &amp; magically turned me into a raging bitch.  As I foamed at the mouth ready to email a complaint to Leafly it came to me carried by the angels of the interweb in bold letters KOSHER KUSH.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s Kosher man!  Two tokes later in a DEEP relaxation let&#39;s go into the DEEP zone again. Instead of over the DEEP end.  Flower was a DEEPer greenish brown color &amp; fairly dense.  Did not seem like much until breaking DEEP into the bud it broke up into a lot.  This also made for the pipe going around for a long time, it was impressive.\u000a\u000aSmoke was thick smelling of smooth milk chocolate and DEEP dark cocoa with berry sweetness hints.  Much like eating at a fondue fountain.  Really like the smell and the taste almost was there, yet after the pipe kept going burnt ass taste overpowered.  As expected of course, but that awesome terpene profile stuck around in my nose.\u000a\u000aThe buzz was the DEEPEST element of them all as I would have hoped.  With an awful migraine one evening this strain offered DEEP, complete pain relief.  Deep sleep.  Deep thoughts.  Never have been one for shallow ventures whether of the soul or life so this strain is perfect.  Way stoney, way DEEP stoneeeeeee =)

VI have smoked this strain for a couple of months now off and on and I keep coming back to it.  It is a real clean tasting herb and the terps, I have found to be subtle but present.  The smell consists of pine, citrus and that earthy Kush fragrance.   A really nice mid day strain at least for me!

VThis is the best flower I have ever tried. The smell, the taste, the high, is really the best I have ever had and I have been smoking for over thirty years. I will let you know when and if I ever have better. This strain taste as good as it smells and the high lasts a long time. I first tried the stain in California and them when I moved to Arizona I had it again. Same quality as back home but I still think it is the best no matter what state I am in. I have not been able to find it lately, but would most likely drive far to get it for sure! Kosher Kush is the bomb and if you have not tried it I would recommend it to anyone!

VThis is great to lie back and relax with. It relieves muscular pain and really puts you on a nice and calm level where everything is okay... It is certainly obvious that this is an indica. Gives me major couchlock and a huge amount of pain relief. Still clear enough to react well and act sober if needed. Has a somewhat &#39;male&#39; musky taste to it which is giving me the munchies (trying to get rid of the taste!). Nice everyday Indica.

VI had this strain as live resin &quot;batter&quot; from The Lab Infused Products. It was rated at 69.30% THCA and 5.20 % delta9THC. The smell was very intense, and reminiscent of the strain dogwalker. It was mostly piney, slightly lemony, with a very very slight dry fecal smell if you really look for it. It seems like this has some true OG parents. Every hit was very intense and with send your head soaring and your body relaxing. It sent me right to sleep after an hour of eating.

Four good hits from a Select cartridge was the dose about an hour before bed time.  \u000aEffects were greatly heightened awareness of sound and tactile sensation.   Though I was very sleepy, my brain was highly energized with lots of cerebral space bending.   I had to do the ground pepper trick at one point.\u000aIt was a sleepless night and a miserable next day.\u000aI&#39;ll try it again, but just a very small amount and maybe with something high CBD.

However very potent for what it is -if you like enhancing depression, worries feelings of insecurity etc. These are the reasons why I smoke not to enhance. Like someone said before this strain makes you feel stupid...i would say brain fog along with extreme fatigue. it feels like it completely wrecks your adrenals. I have def had some euphoric &quot;floating&quot; feeling on Kosher but not without the expense of some serious brain fatigue and feelings of unworthiness.

VThe Kosher Kush had just been delivered only ten minutes ago, and I offered to use my 40+ years of joint rolling experience to get the party cooking, and already the crowd is turning ugly.\u000a\u000a\u201cThought you knew what you were doing\u201d, some fool blurted out, as I carefully placed the beautiful little crystalline buds into the grinder. \u201cIgnore him\u201d, I said to myself, as I took the single paper, folded it into a cradle for the herb by taking the edge up to meet the middle fold,of the paper.\u000a\u000a\u201cLet\u2019s get the show on,the road\u201d, the S.O.B.,says. Ok, I don\u2019t get pissed off in public very often. I truly try and be a gentleman and have fun, but this guy needed a lesson in manners, in general, and in Cannabis Etiquette, in particular, but I held it until I finished carefully massaging the finely ground Kosher Kush into a great joint.\u000a\u000a\u201cIf you wish to partake of this fine herb, I suggest you remain silent,\u201d I said, looking directly into his eyes. \u201cPerhaps your observation skills need more work and your tongue less, A hand rolled joint is an act of love for all who smoke it. It is not only a way to consume marijuana, it is a work of art\u201dI said. \u201cHand rollers are like an dying breed, so I a honored to carry on the traditional method,but It takes patience to roll correctly,\u201d, I said.\u000a\u000aI fired up the Kosher Kush reefer. I took a nice hard hit, because I knew I might not get another off this joint, because it was going round the room. Very sweet and smooth. I held the hit in for awhile, then exhaled. I got a certified, genuine HEAD RUSH,. Just like back in kindergarten when we\u2019d sniff glue. (Please know I\u2019m joking).\u000aThe crowd is nodding their approvals, but Bozo the Clown is getting antsy. \u201cHurry up and roll another\u201d, he babbles. \u000a\u000a\u201cYou have the mind of an infant,\u201d, I said. \u201cPatience is needed to gain wisdom, and you obviously have neither of these gifts,\u201d  \u201cKeep your mind open, and your mouth shut. In this way I will show you,how,to not only grow as a man, but you might actually learn how to,roll a joint.\u201d\u000a\u000aI\u2019m an old guy, and this character was at least 25 years younger, and could destabilize me in an instant physically, but he responded quickly and quite positively when i handed him the new joint I rolled, (I ended up rolling 9joints out of the 1/2 oz. we got for the party), and he was a happy camper as he lightened up after a couple of hits of Kosher Kush.\u000a\u000aKosher Kush is smooth; it\u2019s sweet, and it can be an effective tool to bring people together, even when the crowd turns, \u201cUgly.\u201d\u000a\u000a5 Star material for the Kosher Kush. So say I.

VI picked up an eighth of this by Fireline, in the form of budlets - an odd choice to me. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the budlets (which sounds a lot like a slight upgrade on shake to me), or the fact that it was harvested all the way back on 3/21/16, but this just doesn&#39;t have body high that I&#39;m looking for in a Kush, or any strong Indica.

VA great alternative to melatonin and Aleve. This flower also gives you a nice mental happiness and calm flow throughout the entire medication. \u000a\u000aSmells dynamic and looks like a snowball. Taste is pure and the kush taste is very there. \u000a\u000aBetter bowl bud than rolled.

Vjust picked this up for 12$ gram, cracked it ooen and could not believe how dense the buds were and there were so many trichomes it was glissening almost a bit gooey when you crack a bud . great body buzz tons of crazy feeligns everywhere and its making me have the igiggles by myself which never really happens. eyes feel and i feel relaxed and have energy def not couch locked yet, i got a lot of diesel flavor and even some berry and woddy undertone really good taste overall. felt like i got a steal for 12$ a gram for this def top shelf

VA solid Kush with those earthy piney scent and taste.  Not my favorite but absolutely helps with insomia.

VSo so. Nothing special for me. Long lasting, smells good. Tastes good. However, mine was pretty harsh on the throat.
