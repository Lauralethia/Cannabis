VThere&#39;s nothing that could truly be said about this extremely rare *gem* of a strain from Exotic Genetix - at least not much which could do it proper justice.  This indica provides all one could ask for: relaxation (followed shortly after by sedation), psychedelic effects (among the most vivid of any strain out there), analgesic feeling throughout (gravity pulling you as you melt like butter), and a very nice look, smoke and taste (worthy of its name). The quality (like any) can vary quite a bit from batch to batch and each grower&#39;s penchant (if striving for quality as a trade off for time), ranging from &quot;as described&quot; (when grown and cured proper) to &quot;better than good&quot; (with a weaker batch). You can get a pretty good sense of quality right away from the bud look (if you&#39;re lucky enough to find some - it hasn&#39;t been around too often)! \u000a\u000aWhile not a valid comparison semantically, the best of the &quot;Dark Side..&quot; could be thought of (and felt as) a light dose of Ketamine (by the dissociative like feeling as well as the psychedelic viewpoint) - with maybe a bit of Valium (as anxiety and concern instantly dissipate) - toss in some oxy for good measure (it is rather euphoric in nature and  provides a very enjoyable sensation throughout the body).

VNew favorite! I&#39;ve had headaches every day for 2 weeks. I&#39;ve tried over the counter pain killers, I&#39;ve tried my hydros, I&#39;ve tried drinking water until I felt like Violet Boragard. Within 30 minutes of smoking my headache melted away.  I felt so relieved I almost cried. I&#39;m extremely grateful the bud-tender suggested this stain.   Shared a joint with my boyfriend and we both almost immediately started coming up with ideas to open a candy store in our neighborhood. Super relaxing with only a couple hits. Don&#39;t overdo it though lol. No brain fog. Spicy, fruity, and tastes pretty good. I&#39;m in love with this medicine!

Vwonderful colors on this indica , the smell fresh out of the bag is Pungent, looking at the bud I saw those reddish orange hairs sticking out but when you blow on the bud the red hairs sway in your breath, fantastic on the breakup of this with your fingers , I didn&#39;t have to wash my hands after breaking this bud up. When I tried this strain I had eaten an hour before and this was the first weed of the day for me. So after dinner I participated in the inhale of this divine , wild looking strain. My legs relaxed my mind relaxed and I enjoyed a movie.\u000aThanks Cannna Clinic

VTalk about aromatic and bag appeal! This strain is a delight to smoke and even better to vape. Dont let the intensely fruity and sweet flavor fool you, this strain is a heavy hitter (at least the batch I had was).  Dark Purple medium sized buds were coated in trichomes. \u000a\u000aThe medicinal effects were good for relaxation, sleep and stress relief.

I haven&#39;t seen this much purple on a bud (excluding Grandaddy Purple &amp; Purple Kush) in a long time! The taste is absolutely delicious. Very fruity, almost like a blueberry koolaid.

VAlso, while scouring the interwebs for seeds (which are apparently now listed under Exotic Gentix &quot;archives&quot;) and also looking further into the lineage, it&#39;s an indica hybrid using one of their best F2 strains (which itself has fostered many other nice indica hybrids) crossed with their own version of &quot;Green Ribbon&quot; (BX). \u000a\u000aIf your local dispensary or seed bank happens to have this strain and you&#39;re looking for an amazing indica (to &quot;get you lifted&quot;), or grow (to give others a lift ;) - don&#39;t pass this one up (only to the left). You won&#39;t regret it!

VDefinitely make sure you don&#39;t smoke too much of this strain. it delivers a very intense high, and is great is you&#39;re planning on grabbing some munchies. also had the best sleep on my life, which is great considering i&#39;m an insomniac. nugs are super dense and are primarily purple. the only downside is the dry mouth and it can make you dizzy if you smoke too much, even if you have a high tolerance.
