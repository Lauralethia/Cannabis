VMethod of consumption: Kandypen Galaxy.\u000a\u000aType: MPX Shatter\u000a\u000aPros: Good for pain, helps you to relax and provides for a little energy boost, which clears the mind. Smooth draw/exhale.\u000a\u000aCons: While not necessarily a negative, there was little taste on draw/exhale, but occasionally a little hint of mint. Small amount of dry mouth/eyes.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Definitely a medical strain with medical effects. Lack of taste was different, but not a bad thing, especially if you are looking for a non pungent strain (at least the shatter). Didn&#39;t experience any munchies. More of a daytime strain with the small boost of energy, more of a functional pain relief.\u000a\u000aI would recommend for daytime pain relief or relaxation.

Vafter a day of  smoking just high setevas I wasn&#39;t expecting this to take me where it did. while on a car ride with my brother around the southern coast of Maine; dreaming minds staring and thinking through the leaks and shatters&#39; of sunshine breaking through the trees that sit for the rain to come and soak their leaves. During our brains ability to enter the different perspectives I didn&#39;t know it had, we were both surprised of this strain and it&#39;s power to keep us close enough to the tip top of our ideal place while ignoring and blocking any sign of our possessed and controlling culture into the meandering surpentine thoughts we had after inhaling the medibud smoke

You can take a little or alot without feeling under medicated or freaked out.  Great anti anxiety strain.  Another good enhancement smoke.  Everthing is better on this.  Only complaint is i hate the taste vaped.  Its what can only be described as crotch-cheese flavored.  Smoked is great.

VI picked up a gram of Medibud at the dispensary to give it a try. When I opened the bag, the smell was quite soapy. It reminded me of the Mexican swag back in the day. The bud itself was not dense.  After three puffs, the taste was grassy and woody.  I liked the high. It&#39;s more mellow and relaxing than the Headband strain. I felt more &quot;medicated&quot; than the classic stoned feeling. Next time I pick up Medibud, I expect it to be a better quality than what I got at the dispensary. I would seek the buds from different growers before making my final judgment on this strain. So far, Jack Herer is my favorite strain in this hybrid-range category.

VHybrid but definitely sativa leaning.  Wouldnt call this big energy, certainly functional if youre doing something.  Will also let you chill in a recliner without feeling sedated.  You can take a little or alot without feeling under medicated or freaked out.  Great anti anxiety strain.  Another good enhancement smoke.  Everthing is better on this.  Only complaint is i hate the taste vaped.  Its what can only be described as crotch-cheese flavored.  Smoked is great.

VVery Nice! I got some of this cause I was hitting my wall on Sativa flower. This picked right up where the Lemon Thai Kush left off... very relaxing yet powerful head buzz and just the right amount of Indica influence to mellow out the creative thoughts racing through my mind:)

VI really like this strain. I feel less of a psychoactive effect which is still great because it&#39;s been helpful with my muscle pain in my legs. I recommend it for people who need pain relief but don&#39;t want the heavy psychoactive effect. Great strain!

VGreat strain but something is missing in the pain relief/muscle relaxing effects, bud are insane! Smells and tastes just like grape juice which is a first in my two decades of medical use. Never seen nugs this frosty and sticky. Great for just about anything, sure most would enjoy but after a while it causes some creeper headaches not felt in other strains. Could just be the batch, will try again. Solid B+ 4 1/2 stars Could be a staple in my medicine cabinet if it had a some softer effects applied.
