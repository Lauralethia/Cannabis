VApparently this strain is a combination of my two favorite strains: Green Crack X Blue Dream. My experience could be described as coursing euphoria and highly elevated heart rate- certainly not medical. I understand why this strain is called crack. I think I prefer the effects of Green Crack or Blue Dream more than this. It seems to be less than the sum of its parts.\u000a\u000aPretty bud, though. And a nice Green Crack sort of fragrance.

VPicked up some of this today along with some hydroponic grown Afghan kush. The buds were very dense and triched out. Very green and super soft to the touch when broken down. Grinding up this herb really breaks up its terps and lets you smell its flavours better. Had a very pungent citrus- berry like smell that came through well on the exhale of a joint. ( element rice paper )  head high was very instant but enjoyable and followed by a solid but very soothing body Buzz. BE CAREFUL though. 1 to many joints and you&#39;ll be looking for a snack and bedtime.

VThe particular cut I had was one of the worst I&#39;ve had. the grower obviously didn&#39;t put fourth the effort in truly utilizing the potential of this plant. the herb itself was extremely dry and burned fast. the high was Suttle and lasted only 45 min to an hour. however the flavor profile was surprising of all things considering. a lot of potential with this particular strain.

VNot what I expected, not at all.  In fact I was pleasantly surprised.  Upon exhale of the first hit I felt a strrooong head buzz similar to that of headband.  The delicious flavor kept me toking and before I knew it the bowl was long gone and I&#39;d leveled up my character a couple dozen times.  Ultimate gaming weed.  Perfect balance of relaxed and focused. Nice body high that creeps up well after smoking that reminds you of just how high you really are.  I enjoyed both the parent strains but this hybrid blows them both outta the water.

VI give the strain a 8, I think it has a lot of potential though. The quality of the stuff I got was not the best I have seen, maybe lacking some nutrients or light but it is a clean smoke. Relaxing, makes you want to be outdoors.

VNot a big fan, found it to ultimately be a lesser version of what I expect from Blue Dream and some of the other crosses with it I&#39;ve tried. Clear headed and energizing but a bit of an anxious buzz. Could be psychosomatic with a name like that though who knows. Don&#39;t think I&#39;d get this again unless I came across some that was exceptionally grown.

VPerfect day high.\u000a\u000aPicked some up from Five Point Wellness Center, on Sunset Blvd.\u000a\u000aThis is THE best day high. Perfect for taking before work, and completely acceptable to work on! I never felt tired on this strain! I definitely would recommended this for any daytime smoker looking for a clearer high as opposed to that hazey feeling.\u000a\u000aFeels very relaxing, calming, and zones you in! I get a lot done when I smoke this strain. I guess a good alternative to an energy drink.!

VGot this for 20 an 1/8th, so I figured it would just be some ok weed. The look and feel of it was of lower quality, however I ended up being very surprised with it. It takes about 10 minutes to kick in, and isnt the most potent stuff out there, with lackluster taste and smell. That being said, the high is great. This stuff is a serious mood lifter. Very rarely do I take moments to smile over nothing, but with this I&#39;m smiling and giggling thoughout the whole high. My mind wasnt incredibly slowed down, and at times my thoughts seemed to be racing along. Effects lasted around 2 hours from a small bowl. Great strain for socializing, but is also calm enough to just sit and game or watch movies.

VThis runs on a continuum for me. If I take it lightly it makes my mind feel more awake. Not so much my body though. And taken higher I get sedated and fall asleep. It&#39;s a very melty strain for me I guess. But also I got this in LA, which has no quality regulations. All they do is print (..or handwrite in this case) the strain name.

VI cant focus on anything\u000aNot a harsh smoke 0-5 this is a 2 on harshness.\u000asmoked 4 bowls in 1 hour\u000aThis sativa-dominant hybrid takes after its iconic parents, 50/50 hybrid Blue Dream and classic sativa Green Crack. Blue Crack reflects a balanced blend of its parents, with an energetic head rush from the Green that is mellowed out and mentally expansive thanks to the Blue, proposing an apt rename of \u2018Turquoise\u2019. Although dense by appearance, this flower yields soft, airy buds and a sweet, smooth aroma with blueberry undertones. As a high-energy strain with moderate to long-lasting effects, Blue Crack is a popular choice for daytime medicating.
