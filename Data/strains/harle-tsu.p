VHarle-Tsu variants have up to 20% CBD and down to &gt;1% THC. My review is for Harle Tsu #16 sold by a local dispensary displaying a lab report indicating 11% CBD and 5% THC. So for this strain I disagree with the current Leafly description &quot;without psychoactivity&quot; since the 20:1 description is only for an unusual strain variant. I definitely had a strong and full high, but it was somewhat different from a usual THC high (I am unable to verbally describe that difference).  Harle Tsu #16 is certainly quite psychoactive and furnished a very mellow after-high, which makes sense, since inhaled CBD reportedly has a half-life longer than 24 hours, far beyond the THC half-life.\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, Harle-Tsu is a stupid-sounding name; NamiQuin would have sounded cooler and cuter.\u000a\u000aStill, the question that health-conscious cannabis users must ask themselves these days: Since so many health benefits are associated with CBD, is there any good reason why a high-CBD strain  (or at least 1:1) should not be used instead of (or alongside) a &quot;normal&quot; high-THC strain?

Vthis strain is great for first time users and anxiety.  I suffer from panic and anxiety disorder and normally can&#39;t handle the effects of high thc strains but this strain is so relaxing.  first few times I smoked this strain I definitely got an amazing and fun head high  and warm body tingles. this strain had me laughing at my refrigerator.  the high feels light and airy and is so great. now I mix this strain with other high thc strains to enjoy a high without paranoid or anxiety.  this is also the strain I use to bring me down if infer too high or anxious off any other strain.  I can not recommend this strain enough, my anxiety has started to decrease, myadhd has mellowed out,  my social awkwardness has lessened,  and my people skills have improved all because of the cbd. I love my harle tsu

VVery nice and workable balance between the THC and CBD. Ratio on my sample worked out to 10% THC balanced with 15% CBD. \u000a\u000aFor my purposes, I prefer labeling and taxonomy that simply states species (Indica or Sativa), and a four digit &quot;name&quot; that indicates the THC/CBD percentages. \u000a\u000aAn example with Harle-Tsu would be:\u000a\u000aH1015 (Hybrid, 10% THC: 15% CBD)\u000a\u000aAn example of a High THC low or no CBD Sativa would be:\u000a\u000aS2500 (Sativa, 25% THC: 00% CBD\u000a\u000aI believe this system of taxonomy supports the education of users, gives a clear indication of the THC:CBD Ratio, and, for lack of a better word, gives greater &quot;credibility&quot; to medicinal and recreational marijuana use. \u000a\u000aLet&#39;s face it, medicinal and recreational marijuana use as won many hard-fought gains; however, there is a long way to go with some States and the Federal Government.\u000a\u000aBased on my experimentation and testing so far, Harle-Tsu hits the sweet spot for me. Individual psychoactive and physiological responses will vary user to user, so my personal experience may have very little similarity to another user&#39;s experience. Nevertheless, I will say that Harle-Tsu gives me a very nice, warm, and comfortable physiological response (CBD) and just enough of a clear-headed, albeit uplifting, psychotropic response to enjoy the day.\u000a\u000aNo anxiety (I am very anxiety prone to some cannabis strains) and just feel balanced and happier than my &quot;normal&quot; depressed state.\u000a\u000aI am a veteran with severe PTSD (multiple tours in both Afghanistan and Iraq). After several years of the usual potpourri of pharmaceutical medications, medical cannabis (in my case Harle-Tsu) has given me relief from depression, anxiety, hyper-vigilance, anger, and a sense of hopelessness.\u000a\u000aMost importantly, medical cannabis has given me hope.\u000a\u000aI strongly urge folks to try the different strains, intelligently, rationally, and with a keen eye on ratios and effects. In my humble opinion, THC/CBD ratios is a good place to start.\u000a\u000aWell, it&#39;s time for further scientific (journal driven) inquiry. I&#39;m off to take a hit of my H1015.\u000a\u000aThanks for reading. Namaste.

VWhere do I begin? I love this strain. I started using CBDs after I began having intense panic attack reactions to THC. I believe it was situational at the time- but I am still sensitive to THC. Harle-Tsu is a dream strain for those who suffer from anxiety and depression. I have bad upper back pain, and I noticed this didnt really do a whole lot for the pain, but it helped with the tenseness. I just feel super relaxed. The body high is mild and warm, it feels like small vibrations. There is no cerebral &quot;high&quot;, but I consider that a plus. I did get that classic headband effect from it, which I LOVE. some dont and feel like its a headache. to me it feels like tension releasing... it feels cool and tingly. The &quot;high&quot; is happy for those who have anxiety and depression... because you no longer feel burdened, the result is happy/giggly and just comfortable. it isnt euphoric in the THC sense. This is one that I feel comfortable smoking anytime of day, and in larger doses. it is my safe strain. :) flavor wise it is that classic earthy, spicey flavor. I really love it. It isnt knock out best flavor ever, but my love of the effects makes up for it. I recommend this to everyone with anxiety. Its also great with stress. :) the batch I had is 0.86% thc and 13% cbd. so, a little lower, but still effective. I havent tried it in a bing yet but I cant wait to!

VI am a housewife and mom of 4. I have to be focused and energetic. I can NOT be high. This is an excellent strain for day time use.  It does everything I need. Relieves pain in my joints and stomach, relieves anxiety,  makes me cheerful and energetic. Doesn&#39;t make me munchy either, which is great. I smoke some with my morning coffee and I&#39;m good to go!

VTest data: THC 0.23% THCA 7.15% CBD0.22% CBDA 11.68% TOTAL 19.67%\u000a\u000aSmell: Sweet fruit tree. Rose potpourri. Light chemical fragrance.\u000a\u000aLook: loose &amp; fluffy, light monotone green colas that look like tiny rose buds. Trichomes on colas look fuzzy with few mushroom tops. Pistils are wispy, red and have tan to red trichomes. \u000aNot as sticky in hand and easier to grind than higher THC strains. \u000a\u000aEffect: did not cough even with massive hits. Was easy to smoke with a good earthy flavor. Not very much resin left on glass afterwards. Not for a head high but for a whole body relaxing feeling. Was able to focus well and was very positive feeling. Relaxing without the risk of &quot;couch lock&quot; or time slips.\u000a\u000aWorks Well for: Pain, swelling, stress, anxiety, headaches(for some)\u000a\u000aStoner Tells: Cotten Mouth and Dry Eyes\u000a\u000aThis high CBD stain is great for the sympathetic nervous system. Those are the nerves that regulate things in our body like organs and blood vessels as well as carrying signals too and from the &quot;Lower Brain&quot;(cerebellum) to the rest of our bodies. The largest concentration of these neves is a network laced around the spine called the sympathetic ganglia. This is a great strain for Medical Patients as it gives great benefits with little to no head high.

VThis is my go-to strain. I suffer from Panic Disorder and Bipolar II, so higher THC always triggers anxiety attacks. I&#39;ve been using CBD products to manage my symptoms for years, and haven&#39;t needed to take big pharma meds since I started on the CBD. I came across this strain online, as I was never really &quot;connected&quot; with anyone and its illegal in my state. \u000a\u000aSince I&#39;ve started using Harle-Tsu, its been wonderful. I can handle the low THC content and still get that great CBD dose I need. I typically use it twice a day, and I&#39;m able to function great. It doesn&#39;t help that I LOVE the smell of it. If I could find air fresheners that smelled just like it, I would definitely use them, too. \u000a\u000aIf you deal with a lot of panic issues related to one of those conditions, and higher THC plants are troublesome for you, definitely consider this one. Its really great and does what its supposed to do. \u000a\u000aThe high is felt more in the body, and it does give you a sense of well-being, while not clouding your judgement. I&#39;m a writer, and I find that writing comes a lot easier when I use this as well. It helps kind of unpack that creativity, as well. \u000a\u000a5 Stars. I have no real negatives to this strain, which is what prompted the review. \u000a\u000aEdit: Well, the only negative I suppose is its availability, but that is really more location-based as far as I know. I can be ordered online, but it has to be done well in advance of when you&#39;ll need it, so plan ahead if this is an issue for you.

VThis is one of my all-time favourite strains. It&#39;s harder to find than most others, at least in my area, since it&#39;s CBD-dominant versus THC-dominant; however that is one of the reasons I love it so. It has amazing painkilling properties (due to the high-CBD to THC ratio) and doesn&#39;t get you stoned like standard THC-dom flower, but it still gets you relaxed (just not couch-locked). One other effect it carries over from regular THC-dom flower is the tendency to cause the &quot;munchies&quot;, so beware of that too! Anyways, if you are looking for an amazing painkilling strain that doesn&#39;t get you seriously &quot;stoned&quot; then Harle-Tsu is definitely for you.

Good body buzz relaxes everything in the middle.  \u000a\u000aDon&#39;t smoke this for a recreational hi because you won&#39;t get much of one.  This one is all about the cramping and pain.

VI&#39;d say about three times more potent than the Harlequin strain itself.  \u000aI&#39;m not familiar with sour tsunami but I would guess it was named that because it hits you with a sudden wave of force yet does not last long and quickly subsides.  \u000aOne good pull off the blown glass and the pleasurable lemon pine tart aroma cleared the pallet. It&#39;s a clean, sweet taste for a CBD strain and is very agreeable with a mug of hot tea. \u000a\u000aHeadache was gone in about 20 seconds. Tense shoulders and jaw muscles were released from a state of post surgery agony to a serene calm.  \u000a\u000aMan what a great hybrid.  Tsunami side of this hybrid is unmistakably dominant in terms of cerebral effects while the harlequin remains a diligent worker against pain. I feel like it&#39;s So much stronger than Harlequin alone that it would be easy to consume too much if careless. For the first hour I was in a groggy cerebral fog and unable to read my book. \u000a\u000aThis hybrid is a powerful and fast acting pain medicine yet smokes like a top shelf sour indica.\u000a\u000a Im still looking for the perfect &quot;high CBD low THC&quot; strain as I battle cancer and post surgery inflammation.   So far this isn&#39;t it because the head high is simply too much for me.  Harlequin by itself is still my number one in that regard.

VAs an epileptic, Harle-Tsu has become my go-to strain. Great for aches and pains. This is the type of strain that reassures you that the medicinal qualities of Cannibis are honest  and pure. I have very little to say about the actual High that comes from Harle-Tsu. There is a fair amount cerebral high from such a CBD heavy strain, but not one that is overpowering by any means. The best thing I can say about Harle-Tsu is that it hands you a bit of your life back if you suffer from depression or anxiety, epilepsy, or chronic pain.

VPicked up two high CBD strains recently, this and it&#39;s mommy Sour Tsunami,  with the goal of avoiding paranoia and anxiety at all costs. Of the two, I prefer this one. The little bit of THC gives me something to hold onto it with (just a hint of euphoria) but doesn&#39;t turn me fuzzy. I get no paranoia and only the smallest hint of anxiety, less than that of the euphoria.\u000a\u000aI have good focus, can think clearly, but can&#39;t multi-task and mistakes go up a tick although I spot them. It&#39;s not a good &quot;before&quot; bed for me; It may not be keeping me up but it&#39;s certainly not helping me fall asleep.\u000a\u000aIt makes me snackish, which I don&#39;t like but seems notable if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for.\u000a\u000aI like the aroma notes and don&#39;t find it harsh to smoke.

VI bought a gram of this stuff to be an adjunct to my Purple Hindu Kush for pain management and insomnia related to opiate withdrawal. The buds smell and taste very woody (but an expensive variety) and this strain is EXCELLENT for pain relief. I noticed a significant reduction in my muscle tension/pain within the first 5 minutes after a few bong tokes. Beyond the medicinal qualities that are so wonderful, this bud gives me a slight buzz, clearheaded and an accessory compared to the full blown effects of a high THC-low CBD type strain.\u000a\u000aGreat for medication, but don&#39;t expect to get more than buzzed without supplementing with a higher THC content strain

VHarle-Tsu is most remarkable to me because of its lack of any extreme tendencies. I tend to start my days with a vaped bowl of this, which essentially doesn&#39;t affect my energy or ability to work in any negative way. I definitely consume more of this than some other, more potent strains, and the pain relief from its higher CBD content seems to wear off a little quicker than other strains I&#39;ve tried, but I feel safe picking this up at any point. I&#39;ll also often blend it in with nighttime strains that are better at sedating me and giving me full-body relief for a smoother night&#39;s sleep. The taste is mild.

VHarle Tsu is the only high CBD strain that has given me any pain relief for Chronic Muscle and Tissue Pain. It&#39;s relaxing with a decent over all mellow feeling yet a touch energizing. It helps on stormy days when I&#39;m really aching and need to get chores done. It has a very slight buzz. If you get a bit too stoned on other strains, take a puff of Harle Tsu to bring yourself back down to Earth. Is great for mixing with other strains for added pain relief or that are not being used because they too potent.

VFor a high CBD and very low THC strain, this variety is a real winner for treating pain/inflammation as well as the mental effects of PTSD. There is a mild head change, which surprised me, since I typically use and am used to strains with a 2:1 ratio. \u000a\u000aThe flavor is outstanding! Probably one of the better tasting low THC strains with a flowery/berry inhale and an aftertaste reminiscent of skittles. The Harle-Tsu buds I used had a 23:1 CBD to THC ratio.

VHarle-Tzu is amazing in relieving pain, stress and allows for an amazing relaxation with just a touch of headiness. Great for nighttime and helping you sleep.  This strain is more for those who don&#39;t like the psychedelic effects of MJ, and those who want more CBD than THC, but need more than something like ACDC delivers.  It doesn&#39;t give you any heavy THC effects.  It does have more of a heady effect than ACDC but much less than Harlequin.  One of my favorites!

VThis is a wonderful strain. I was using it to quell anxiety back after the election. Now I&#39;m trying it for pain; I have abdominal scar tissue from radiation treatment that has been hurting. It doesn&#39;t kill the pain as well as a Percocet, but it comes close and leaves me chill rather than edgy. My thoughts can drift when I&#39;m on my own, but my girlfriend can get helpful input out of me despite how much I smoked. I also highly recommend adding some Harle-Tsu to any strains prone to make you anxious--it will take the edge off without really altering the head high. All in all, it&#39;s a great weed to have in our arsenal. I don&#39;t smoke it every day (in fact I was sitting on an 8th for a couple of months), but when I need it, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s around.

VHarle Tsu is worth a try. It is very relaxing and gives you better focus. The previous reviewer said that using this strain felt like taking half a Vicodin and I think that is right on the money. If you use enough of it will bring on fits of giggles due to the intense feeling of well-being. One caveat though. I do not think that Harle kills pain very well at all and everyone else I know shares that same opinion. The CBD levels are off the charts and it does work well for inflammation. It did nothing for my M&#233;ni&#232;re\u2019s disease however. My personal favorite use for Harle Tsu is as a mixer. Throw some of this in with a high THC strain and you will not experience any anxiety or paranoia. I throw a little bit of Harle into everything I do and have never ever experienced any problems.

VI have tried a few different CBD blends, this by far is the best and my favorite. It&#39;s a smooth smoke and tasty as well. I use this to help with my stress filled life, anxiety and mild depression. Not only does it help with all of that, but so much more. The strain I got was 20mg of CBD and less 1 of THC...so no heady high..I love it by itself but also if I&#39;m feeling like getting a little high, I blend it with a little bit of a higher THC strain like Mt Hood Magic. Harle Tsu will be an everyday medicine for me...if you&#39;re looking to help fight anxiety, or depression and can&#39;t have the psychoactive effects, or don&#39;t want them, this is the strain for you.

VHarle-Tsu was my first experience in high CBD low THC marijuana. Going into it I wanted something with little to no psychoactive effects while providing pain relief.\u000a\u000aI have to say it did just that. I didn&#39;t feel a head high at all while I experienced tremendous pain relief. The back pain \u000a\u000aI normally experience after skating wasn&#39;t noticeable in the slightest; and my elbow which slammed on the concrete felt much better.\u000a\u000aHarle-Tsu and other high CBD strains will be my new go-to post skate strains.

VI tried Harle-Tsu from CCH in goshen, CA.  This is THE best high-CBD strain I have tried, beating out a &quot;Lemon-Aid&quot; strain I tried in San Francisco. The taste is ok and there isn&#39;t much taste as it tastes more earthy and herby than &quot;danky&quot;. But holy god is it smooth as silk.. everyone who&#39;s tried it says the same. This strain was 20/1; CBD/THC like the strain is claimed to be and I actually got pretty high the first couple times trying it, this may vary from person to person but now it just mellows me out and numbs or helps with pain and anxiety, great strain and a must try for CBD users

VI have bipolar disorder and this strain is amazing. Instantly calms aggitation, racing thoughts, normalizes my sleep, and keeps bouts of depression at bay, seriously i never get depression using this stuff daily and this is coming from someone who has had depression so bad I could not leave the house at times and had to drop out of school for a semester. It makes you feel mildly high in a very nice way but CLEAR headed and able to focus and function very well. I buy it in concentrate form for vaping and only need one or two hits to feel NORMAL and healthy and sane. Highly recommend for psych issues. \u270c

VVery potent CBD strain giving me great pain relief of the mind and body. Perfect for day time use, specially if your job requires more focus, this is a great strain for you. I got a slight feeling of a head change, just the right amount to be focused and alert. It taste descent but for me this is a medicinal strain not a recreational strain.

VHarle Tsu doesn&#39;t stand out to me in the arena of smell or taste.  A mix of hay &amp; lemon sweetness that is a very mellow smoke easy on the throat &amp; lungs.  The buds physically look like home grown schwag (not brown brick weed) with big stems and fluffy light bud.  Have seen a lot of CBD flower like this so no worries it is the effect we are after.  Such a soothing buzz that radiates in waves of warm, numbing comfort down entire body wrapping user in blanket of peace.  Usually that wonderful CBD effect makes me very sleepy &amp; unmotivated leaving me content, yet out for the count.  The Sour Tsu evens the high out very nicely making for a more manageable energy level without stepping on the CBD&#39;s toes therefore becoming counter-effective.  One of those lineages that knowing the parent strains fairly well the dance they create together is awesome for effect.  May sound strange, but there is a respect for this flower &amp; other sativa CBD combos that are held in high regards in my opinion,  The buzz created by this fusion of head high mixed with the unique peaceful body vibe created by cannabidiol is phenomenal.  Honestly if more people knew of this emerging secret the pharmaceutical industry would finally be in decline.  Don&#39;t just take my word for it if Harle Tsu, Shark Shock, Mango Haze, or my personal fave Medihaze pick some up to try.  Shout out to the CBD Crew &amp; Adam J over at Sproutly (Lucy&#39;s Lion, Ringo&#39;s Gift, Lioness #21) among many others for breeding such awesome medicinal strains.  Thank you for bringing the CBD goodness into our lives!!!

VHarle-Tsu is a fantastic smoking experience. No psychoactive effects at all. My knees and back where hurting from working most of the day so I decided to give this strain a try and after 1 bowl in my pipe I had 3 hours of total pain relief. It was a very nice relaxing body type of high with a perfect pain killing type experience. No head cloudiness at all. Mine was 16% cbd and .62% thc.

VMajor failure at neuropathic pain that a high THC % variety like Grape Ape or similar suppresses. IMO, the attractiveness of Harle-Tsu lies not in its effectiveness; but the lower incidence of anxiety-inducing &quot;head buzz&quot;.  H-T leaves a residual mild body &quot;stoney&quot; high that relieves mild pain. The head seems neutral or relaxed.\u000a\u000aWith less head buzz, H-T may help those who don&#39;t tolerate THC dominant strains or those new to cannabis or those who don&#39;t use regularly. To note is that one can mix H-T with high THC weed to promote desired qualities. A mix may allow some who thought they were intolerant to high THC weed to try a mix for more severe pain.\u000a\u000aMy experience is this. If one is sick enough to see a pain specialist regularly or has gone through Neurontin and Lyrica prescriptions while trying to avoid opioids, then Harle-Tsu alone will not be potent enough. Higher THC% Cannabis is simply more effective.\u000a\u000aSince Harle-Tsu flunked my pain test but may rate as a mix, I can only give it one star total. It is interesting for the experience, but I will not purchase it again.

VVaporized\u000a\u000aI am reviewing CannaSol Farm&#39;s Harlequin Tsunami.\u000a\u000aI am not sure about this one. I was seeking pain relief with minor psychoactive effects, as reported by other users. I purchased one gram at Ganja Goddess  but regretfully forgot to check the packed on date. This flower is five months from pack to purchase - and it is dry as a bone. While it smells nice, I don&#39;t know if many of the terpines remain. I did indeed feel a mild psychoactive effect with a nice level of relaxation and no anxiety or paranoia. However I noticed no pain relief effects, although it did feel good to move my body around. I will try another brand and make sure to check the packed by date - and give it another try. But this brand? Meh...

VJust smoked a small bowl of Harle Tsu for the first time. This will obviously be my first impression of this strain... it totally crushed the anxiety I was having, I feel slightly warm, focused, pretty euphoric, but not much of an uplifting of my mood. I also feel very relaxed without feeling lazy. Surprisingly, I actually feel slightly high, which is odd because this is 8% cbd and only .34% thc. This has a similar \u201chigh\u201d to the original Harlequin but for me Harlequin is more happy and euphoric. Overall this is a nice strain. I would buy again just to have it around for anxious days where I need to medicate and not be high. I can see why this is a classic cbd favorite. \u000aI rate this a 4.4 Stars.

VJust smoked a small bowl of Harle Tsu for the first time. This will obviously be my first impression of this strain... it totally crushed the anxiety I was having, I feel slightly warm, focused, pretty euphoric, but not much of an uplifting of my mood. I also feel very relaxed without feeling lazy. Surprisingly, I actually feel slightly high, which is odd because this is 8% cbd and only .34% thc. This has a similar \u201chigh\u201d to the original Harlequin but for me Harlequin is more happy and euphoric. Overall this is a nice strain. I would buy again just to have it around for anxious days where I need to medicate and not be high. I can see why this is a classic cbd favorite. \u000aI rate this a 4.4 Stars.

VThis Strain is A-freaking-mazing.... Not only did I noticed that it helped with my spasm and stiffness, I don&#39;t need to take my usual medicine when I smoke this... But keep in mind that you will need to easy yourself on the CBD and off your  pills.... Don&#39;t go cold turkey like I did,  I quickly found out that was a bad idea, well if you have SCI  anyways...

VThis strain is a go to for me for back pain. It doesn\u2019t make me loopy or paranoid or ready to fall asleep. I feel it mostly as pressure in my head. The only downside is I have to smoke a lot of this to get an effect. \u000a\u000aHowever I have noticed that if I combine this with an indica dominant strain it amps up the effect big time. When I do that it almost completely knocks out my back pain - but be warned it is a super intense stone. I get extremely high when I mix this way. However very potent pain relief as well.

VAfter smoking a bowl of Harle Tsu, I sat and pondered a curious thought for a brief moment, which reminded me of a memory from far into my past, which was when I suddenly realized that I now had access to many more memories from my past, I visualized a nexus of information from inside my very clear vibrant coloured mind, an entire planetarium of touch sensitive constellations and stars, each blurring with white light begging to be touched, and each one could very obviously be seen to worm it&#39;s way through the 4th dimensional library of my neural network, some leading to irrelevant forgotten memories of nothings  that didn&#39;t matter, others lead to these complex and elaborate constructions of truths and ideas that all came together and formed my opinions and beliefs.

VThis afternoon I was on a CBD mission, and am taking bong hits of Harle-Tsu at the moment, which is .41% THC and 18.3% CBD. I really like the taste of it, kind of a spicy woody orange! I enjoy getting high but I like weed mostly for it&#39;s calming effects, as I&#39;m a bit high strung.  I like a heavy body high.  I do feel relaxed!

VI have bipolar disorder and this strain is amazing. Instantly calms aggitation, racing thoughts, normalizes my sleep, and keeps bouts of depression at bay, seriously i never get depression using this stuff daily and this is coming from someone who has had depression so bad I could not leave the house at times and had to drop out of school for a semester. It makes you feel mildly high in a very nice way but CLEAR headed and able to focus and function very well. I buy it in concentrate form for vaping and only need one or two hits to feel NORMAL and healthy and sane. Highly recommend for psych issues. \u270c

Vthis is a great strain for staying focused or having that cerebral buzz- but clear head - this is a mainly CBD high strain - I found this really took the pain away relaxing muscles and chillin right out - I found focus was there no heavy head rush or crash - felt really light and really pain free- one of the more stronger CBD strain I&#39;ve tried - taste nice, a little woody and a little pungent and strong - but great relief from pain and anxiety- takes the edge off for sure while keeping focused - excellent strain to try ! 5 star pain relief!!

VHarle-Tsu is a fantastic smoking experience. No psychoactive effects at all. My knees and back where hurting from working most of the day so I decided to give this strain a try and after 1 bowl in my pipe I had 3 hours of total pain relief. It was a very nice relaxing body type of high with a perfect pain killing type experience. No head cloudiness at all. Mine was 16% cbd and .62% thc.

VI smoked all through high school and into my twenties, I stopped after suffering from anxiety and panic attracts. I had tried to smoke a few times over the years but never with great results. Once marijuana was legal and I was able to really get informed information on what strain would be best for me things changed. I really like Harle-Tsu because it allows me to relax and focus. I don\u2019t get anxious with this stain. It\u2019s all relax and feel good.

VI use this in an RSO concentrate.  I love taking this right before bed.  I do enjoy getting high as well, so I blend the RSO with typically another concentrate I&#39;ll smoke on, or some flower.  The harle tsu though I take to go to bed.   I feel that it&#39;s overall long-term subtle affect is very focused and clean as well as clear minded. It allows me to get my medicine and be active. I have noticed that my recreational intake of marijuana since using this has about been cut in half.  Not by choice, but an interesting note that I&#39;m smoking way less.  Great medical useage.

VI can&#39;t recommend this enough for stress relief. I make video games for a living, so my work can be complex and overwhelming. I drink coffee to wind up, but midday I usually feel stressed and crashy. I tried a bunch of strains to help with the anxiety, but they all made it near impossible to write code. Harle Tsu feels like a gift because it relaxes and melts stress without a debilitating high. It allows me to work and rest without feeling overburdened by the workload ahead of me.

VI started experimenting with MMJ for chronic pain, (not just a shameless pun) depression, PTSD, and anxiety. My wife brought me some of this in flower form. I tried it and almost immediately felt all the tension release from my shoulders like someone letting go after a long uncomfortable bear hug. And the constant chatter in my brain finally quieted to a more manageable level. I tried several other strains after this one and every one made me either extremely anxious or glued me to the couch. it doesn&#39;t help that my tolerance to THC is very low, so with higher thc strains, functioning in everyday life is out of the question. Fast forward a month or so and a budtender friend of ours introduced me to butter capsules made from Harle-Tsu RSO concentrate and I am once again able to keep up at work without pain or distracting racing thoughts, hold meaningful conversations, and have a more positive outlook on life. All without being wrecked. I just wish this strain was more available. I don&#39;t really like to smoke because where I work has a zero tolerance policy for it and the smell tends to linger. So the concentrate in capsules is an amazing alternative.

VThis is the best all-around strain I&#39;ve found. I suffer from high anxiety, depression, migraines and various levels of chronic pain, making day to day life difficult and very stressful. I tried it in flower form first. It was like escaping from a long uncomfortable bearhug. I am a former recovering addict (11 years) and very sensitive to THC so the head high still hit me but it was soothing and comfortable. After trying several higher THC strains and a few other high cbd strains, this is my go-to. A few months ago a budtender friend of my Wife and I introduced me to this in cannabutter capsules. I gotta say this has been a life changing experience for me. my outlook and quality of life has been improving drastically, my anxiety, racing thoughts, depression and physical pain levels are a lot less distracting so I can function on a more &quot;normal&quot; level. I wish this was more available because I can&#39;t find it in concentrate right now. I&#39;m still experimenting with different cbd strains and think I found charlotte&#39;s web would work beautifully together with this for a full-spectrum treatment plan for me.

VIt&#39;s CBD weed. You know what it does or you wouldn&#39;t be looking at this strain most likely. I keep it on hand for pain but for the most part as a way to counteract THC highs when I get panic attacks. \u000a\u000aI totally disagree with the smell profile posted here though. Mine has a faint background if your typical green skunky weed smell, but strongly up front is citrus, kinda lemony and a little orange. It&#39;s almost like candy.

I seem to have decent results when mixing this strain with another [usually I mix high CBD with higher THC] but on it&#39;s own Harle-Tsu gives me a pretty nasty headache.

VI thought I&#39;d put up a recent review. I was just issued my medical marijuana card. At this point in my state we can only use liquid form. At first I tried the harlequin because CBD is my first choice which I like very much. But they didn&#39;t have that in the second time so I got the Harle-Tsu. I have not been able to get out of bed for so long and I was able to go 5 days straight getting up, getting ready for the day, doing my makeup, doing chores, entertaining people. I have ADHD and have been on Ritalin for a while, but the focus on this strain is incredible, I don&#39;t even have to take it. I have not had any paranoia or anxiety. I feel completely clear headed but have just this amazing chilled relaxing feeling in my being. I just cannot even believe how my life has been changed! I take this in the syringe RSO form. I used the cartridge with the Harlequin. They both are 1:1. \u000aI have been using Indica Mazar oil syringe for nighttime. It helps but could use some suggestions for something stronger. Sleep comes hard!\u000aThis is so new to me I can&#39;t wait to try others. \u000aActually our state has just past the flower form it will be available next month for vaping.

VThis high cbd strain is something I wanted to try because my thc tolerance is so low but this is not a good strain for me. I don&#39;t know if one of my mood stabilizers is conflicted with this strain but when I smoke it I get really agitated and aggravated. I hate being all negative when I smoke this strain so I stopped smoking it.

VI tried this after trying a high CBD/extremely low CBD Sour Tsunami. This particular batch was 5% THC/11% CBD. I&#39;m a total lightweight when it comes to weed, and just that little bit of THC knocked me on my ass-but in a good, relaxed muscles, giggly way. Def helps with insomnia and muscle relaxation, but I wouldn&#39;t smoke it before work! It is, however, wonderful to use right after work, all of the stress just floats away.

I will say that it was a good head high. Focused, energized but calm. \u000a\u000aSeems like it will be a good daytime strain. I&#39;m still not sure that CBD is for me, but this is one I&#39;ll definitely try again.

VAt 16.5% CBD and .5 THC, this strain has been a literal life saver. I have a chronic muscle disorder in my digestive system. It sends me into extremely painful spasms. after a day with no luck with any of my medications that are supposed to control this, I went to my go to shop and asked if they had any high CBD. I was given this strain and for the last week it has been a godsend. within minutes I can feel the spasms fading with no spasms at all within 20 min. A bowl will generally last me about 7 hours. Where I was popping pills every 2 to only take the edge off.

VMy first time trying a CBD. I was super skeptical...I&#39;ve never gotten pain relief from cannabis. Been a smoker for 15 years. My neck pain was GONE after trying this strain. I&#39;m in love. CBD works.

VThis is a fun strain. It is not medicine for me however. CBD Critical Cure and strains with similar terpene profiles are King. This strain is simply entertaining.

VI didn&#39;t have any seizures while taking this med . However it did nothing for my back injury . I found it was good for the morning with little overall strength holding me back from an energetic day. The price seemed high for the high received . Any other epileptics have reviews?
