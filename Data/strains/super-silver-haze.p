VMigraine pain comin on; nausea 6-7 when I medicated round 1830 or so. Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. No anxiety/paranoia (a must for me); very nice for a Sativa dominant. Head high energetic; awesome stoner sex with hubby! Body high exactly what I needed. Almost could not fall asleep; would not recommend for late afternoon/evening use. One of my favs for sure! Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea! :-)

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog - AgingEnt.com -- Potency Analysis: TTL 26.5% THC 22.7% CBD 0.21% -- Packaging: 5&quot;x3.5&quot; mylar-back 10mil plastic zip top bag\u000aCost: $15/gram -- The smell on this is very skunky, with a crisp but very muted citrus edge.  It sticks around quite a while.  The skunk gets deep in your sinuses and hits behind the eyes. \u000a--\u000aLike other Silver Hazes, the smoke on this is dense and sweet.  It&#39;s very crisply lemon and interestingly the skunk comes out on the exhale very powerfully.  \u000a--\u000aThis was a daytime smoke for me, so I could be productive and I definitely was.  This really got me uplifted, this was very sativa in it&#39;s focus.  Throughout the day I was hard working and I accomplished quite a bit.

VFeeling lethargic and unable to focus? Vape some super silver haze and you&#39;ll complete your work in record time. Phenomenal strain. At first it makes me tired, but after 15 minutes I&#39;m level headed and focused on whatever I need to do. \u000a\u000aAs a side note, this is the first strain that I haven&#39;t grown tolerant to. Usually after the first few grams of any strain, I start feeling exhausted and confused the moment I medicate, but this strain has stayed true throughout my experiences with it.

VSSH is a classic, hard-hitting, Amsterdam smelling, haze sativa.  Haze is almost an entire branch of Sativa genetics of its&#39; own - instead of the &#39;speed and tight head&#39; feeling of a pure sativa like Durban Poison, Haze genetics tend to produce an uplifting/soaring/euphoric high rising from the chest.  Wonderful daytime smoke with no crash and immediate effects that continue building long after you&#39;ve smoked; paranoia and excess energy are common, but sativa smokers know that going into it ... it&#39;s almost part of the quality of the high.\u000a\u000aThe sample I currently have has the typical light-green/grey/silver look that you&#39;d expect, with a healthy coating of trichomes - giving it a frosted  silvery look.  Lots of kief which is evident upon grinding - the herb looks even more white/silvery when ground.  The smell of the ground herb is a sandlewood-spice type smell with a little bit of flowery/citrus undertones - but generally that spicy-greeny smell that all good Haze tends to have (no skunk, cheese, fuel, kush, pineapple, etc.).\u000a\u000aThe smoke burns quickly and pops immediately in the lungs - you can feel the THC hit the lungs, travel to the brain/bloodstream, and down the legs before you even blow the hit our.  It leaves you with a really uplifting, rising/building high that feels like the first waves of LSD ... even breathing feels good, your nose might run a bit, you feel alert and energized from your chest to your brain.  The smell/taste when smoked is hashy and spicy - fairly easy on the throat but expansive in the lungs ... leaving a sandlewood-hash type taste on the tongue.  The high lasts 2+ hrs for me off of less than .5g - and I&#39;m an everyday smoker!  Strong shit!

VVery very sticky.\u000aSoft, dense nuggets. This was freshly put in this morning so its good.\u000aVery sweet, smells similar to pineapple.\u000aRich green color, with an abundance of crystals and hairs.\u000aBreathing out left a surprisingly earthy taste, but still smelled very sugary; overall very smooth hits.\u000aVery strong head high, 1 bowl of this and I started to forget about my body and could only feel the weight of my head on my neck. This isn&#39;t a bad thing, but its clearly a sativa. Very good feels so far, very giggly in the sense of I have a smile stuck to my face so I am definitely liking this strain. Good for a pretty sane day, I don&#39;t know how well I am at getting a ton of things done at the moment, but it&#39;s not hindering me to function at all. Though I must say, my joint pains have not really gone away, of course I ignore them a bit better but it is defiantly no Granddaddy Purple (I mean duh) in that realm. Still, if you are looking for a really really strong sativa, this is what you should be looking for\u000a\u000aAlso look for Pineapple Super Silver Haze, very good as well.\u000a\u000aI give this an    A

VSuper Silver Haze is one of my favorite strains.  Most sativas always leave me wanting just a little more of that &quot;stone&quot; that I love from indicas, and Super Silver Haze is potent enough to knock my on my ass stoned but still give me a ton of energy to get whatever I need done. If you doubt the power of this sativa a smoke it before bed you will definitely be sorry, or maybe just up all night giggling at some cartoons or late night infomercials. Check out Highland Health, whoever their grower is does an amazing job flushing, nothing but that beautiful herb taste, but could step up his game on curing, other then that, beautiful!

VThoughts as I finish a 2oz stash of SSH: this stuff is pretty much perfect daytime smoke.  Keeps you upbeat, energized, creative, and happy - very clinical, effective, &#39;purposeful&#39; herb ... the smell doesn&#39;t immediately give away the potency, but the look sure does.  Very frosty herb, inside and out - tends to be light green or even blonde with pale pastel orange hairs; not extremely compact nugs but considerably denser than your average stretchy sativa.  Some of my favorite smoke from my trip to Amsterdam in 2004 from the Bulldog, and again back home in the &#39;ol USA in 2014.

VJoints of this strain by puffin farms are excellent and give a nice energy boost and a little euphoria, yet still leave a seasoned smoker able to function in a relatively focused state. Also, the actual quality of the joint is probably the best I&#39;ve tried thus far. It burns evenly and is moist enough to prevent it from over-burning. Tastes almost like fresh mint leaves mixed with fresh pot. In general not a big fan of pre-rolls. With that said, I would actually consider stocking up on these.

I feel like this one is good in small amounts or for morning use, but not much else. I find the high to be too racey and fairly short lived, I prefer the ordinary silver haze and I suggest you pick that one up instead for a euro or two cheaper (or dollars if you&#39;re outside holland).

You&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re in a &quot;haze&quot;. I would not recommend this strain when you want to clean house and get stuff done. This is perfect for total relaxation without the couch lock. It makes you happy and uplifted. Helps you remember what&#39;s important in life. Excellent for pain if mixed with a high CBD strain. Not so good if you want to be social and hold an intellectual conversation. You&#39;ll zone out and feel the love on this strain. It&#39;s almost comparable to a spiritual experience. No racy feeling... Even when the THC is on the higher side. Just a little goes a long way.

VI had stumbled across this strain while looking on Leafly, and being a primarily Sativa smoker I naturally  wanted to try it. I discovered $25 1/8ths at Bloom in PHX, AZ and it&#39;s every bit worth double.  DESCRIPTION in ONE sentence:  This is the high I have been searching for.  I vaped some out of my G pen and I am feeling super good.  Alert and energetic, yet stoned and cerebally stimulated in a way I almost haven&#39;t felt with any other Sativas before (I usually smoke Jack H., Durban Poison, Sour D., et.) A both euphoric and well balanced high, this bud I would efinitely buy in quantity knowing it would be a very versatile strain.  A+!

VSuper Silver Haze has truly never let me down, this is definitely an amazing Sativa, with an AMAZING taste and smell. The high is an amazing full blown Sativa effects along with a very very nice body high. Definitely recommend it for Depression, Anxiety, Spasms, Pain, even Insomnia. Yes it&#39;s a Sativa but smoke enough and you&#39;ll be happily hazed over! The triple cross of Haze, Skunk &amp; Northern Lights is just insane yet amazing definitely a must try if your a new toker!

VI am no novice when it comes to knowing strains of MMJ. But I realized today that Super Silver Haze is my Favorite strain because how much it truly helps me. When I smoke SSH all my depression, anxiety, muscle spasms, come to a holt. I feel so happy, and not happy in the sense that I am high. Happy in the sense that I feel no anxieties and have no muscle spasms and or back pain when using Super Silver Haze. If you never smoke this Delicious strain, I recommend that you do!

VThis is one of my favorite Sativa strains.  It&#39;s a Sativa dominant Hybrid, though.  So it does have some indica effects.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s the perfect blend of sativa vs indica effects.  It&#39;s got a lovely scent and it tastes great through a volcano vaporizer.  It&#39;s not as strong as some other strains, but something about the blend of it makes it really special in my book.

Makes depression, anxiety, mood disorders (BPD/Bipolar) seem like a thing of the past. I always hope that the strains I pick will also work for pain. When I first took this one I didn&#39;t feel like it was helping with pain, but after about 45 minutes of it being in my system it took such a weight off my shoulders (no pun intended). Great for any muscle soreness or pain (I get back, shoulder and neck pain). No dry eyes,but dry mouth. Gives you the munchies for about 20 minutes, but feeling goes away quick. Makes you relaxed, but not couch locked. No giggle fits; no paranoia. Whatever your definition of a really good day is, this feels like that. Taste was very light and mild. Nice flowery, sweet but earthy taste.

VI really expected a sativa with this strain - something to combat fatigue &amp; provide an energy boost.  Instead, I received a heavy stoner-type head high that rendered me useless (&amp; near speechless) after only a few hits.  As an experienced smoker, this is a NOT a strain for pain, but works well for depression.  I would strongly recommend the Super Lemon Haze over this strain if you struggle with daytime fatigue &amp; need a real sativa.

VI would definitely highly recommend this strain!  As for the length of the effects, I was feeling great for about 3 hours before I started to come down again.  I did get hungry and eat a bit more than I normally do, but many strains do that to me.  My pains are Mid-back, knees, heels and overall lethargy, like I can NOT get out of 1&#39;st gear no matter how much I try!.  I used to have to &quot;JACK&quot; myself on Delottid.  (I sometimes still do but not NEARLY as much as I used to have to.) 3 pills of 4Mgs each in one dose just to get me to feel more well... not so...  well.. sloth like!.  But using cannabis has reduced my need for Fentanyl almost entirely!  I went from using the 100 Mcg/h patches to 12.5 Mcg/h patches and supposed to use them every 3 days.  Patches would only last 2 or 2.5 at best, but now I only use Fentanyl at the rate of 1 patch every week or two!!  Only when I get a REAL bad flare up, or when I know I have alot of physical work to do within the next 24 hours to help but otherwise, I am ALMOST completely off a dangerous narcotic.  Now that is not to say that it is because of using ONLY Super Silver Haze, because I use several strains. but using less of a synthetic narcotic is a MASSIVE victory for me personally.

VThere once was a pony named Stony and Stony the Pony loved prancing in the meadow, playing games with her pony friends and getting completely loaded off her pony ass. One day, Stony the Pony and her friend Snoop Dawg were blazing up bowls of Super Silver Haze. They agreed that it was very good weed. It smelled like a cross between her other friend, Buddy Skunk, and a hobo&#39;s feet. The buds were as snowy as a Christmas tree in winter. And it got &#39;em hella fucked up. Oh shit, son! They was BLAZED! Snoop was freestylin&#39; to some Deltron 3030 beats and Stony, well stony was just groovin&#39; right along. Then George Clinton showed up and was trying to mack some free buddage, which was totally cool because Snoop always brings extra and hey, the sharing the kind IS kind! Besides, it was George Clinton! If George Clinton shows up and asks to share your weed, you happily oblige. He&#39;s all old and shit, but he gave us Motor City Madness, so that&#39;s good for a free joint and a bag of Cheetos. Not those nasty-ass hot one, either, just the classic Kraft Mac-n-Cheese-orange kind; the kind that stains your fingers so when you go to jack off, your johnson ends up the color of Trump&#39;s hair. At the end of the day, when the  fat ol&#39; sun was touching the horizon, Stony the Pony reflected on her day. &quot;I got way stoned on Super Silver Haze!&quot; she thought and smiled silently to herself. Then the Furrys showed up. The End.

VStraight to the dome, this is my third time having Super Silver Haze and it has never changed. With a slight cheesy and citrusy aroma, Super Silver Haze  tastes sweet but has a swift earthy under tone. When I smoked this strain, I was applying for jobs and writing and it helped me focus and open up my creative mind state, even allow me to be talkative if I wish.  One could agree this strain is no doubt a sativa and that is  very apparent in the first drag. This strain does not make one feel disoriented as the high tapers off and could be an every day strain. \u000aI will request this strain again for when I want to do creative tasks, open my mind, feel energetic in a confident and smiling way,. or when I am getting ready to go on an adventure with friends. \u000aI hope every shop learns to carry this gem of a strain, Super Silver Haze.

VI would definitely highly recommend this strain!  As for the length of the effects, I was feeling great for about 3 hours before I started to come down again.  I did get hungry and eat a bit more than I normally do, but many strains do that to me.  My pains are Mid-back, knees, heels and overall lethargy, like I can NOT get out of 1&#39;st gear no matter how much I try!.  I used to have to &quot;JACK&quot; myself on Delottid.  (I sometimes still do but not NEARLY as much as I used to have to.) 3 pills of 4Mgs each in one dose just to get me to feel more well... not so...  well.. sloth like!.  But using cannabis has reduced my need for Fentanyl almost entirely!  I went from using the 100 Mcg/h patches to 12.5 Mcg/h patches and supposed to use them every 3 days.  Patches would only last 2 or 2.5 at best, but now I only use Fentanyl at the rate of 1 patch every week or two!!  Only when I get a REAL bad flare up, or when I know I have alot of physical work to do within the next 24 hours to help but otherwise, I am ALMOST completely off a dangerous narcotic.  Now that is not to say that it is because of using ONLY Super Silver Haze, because I use several strains. but using less of a synthetic narcotic is a MASSIVE victory for me personally.

VFor the money it&#39;s a good stain but it&#39;s definitely not the best strain I&#39;ve tried. It is a little airy on the bud structure, lower level THC I&#39;d say 15-17% tastes a bit piney, earthly, woody, rose, floral type. 9 times out of 10 I&#39;d go for more of a top shelf unless smoking spliffs or blunts for a whole bunch. something along those lines.\u000a\u000a-Jay

VThere once was a pony named Stony and Stony the Pony loved prancing in the meadow, playing games with her pony friends and getting completely loaded off her pony ass. One day, Stony the Pony and her friend Snoop Dawg were blazing up bowls of Super Silver Haze. They agreed that it was very good weed. It smelled like a cross between her other friend, Buddy Skunk, and a hobo&#39;s feet. The buds were as snowy as a Christmas tree in winter. And it got &#39;em hella fucked up. Oh shit, son! They was BLAZED! Snoop was freestylin&#39; to some Deltron 3030 beats and Stony, well stony was just groovin&#39; right along. Then George Clinton showed up and was trying to mack some free buddage, which was totally cool because Snoop always brings extra and hey, the sharing the kind IS kind! Besides, it was George Clinton! If George Clinton shows up and asks to share your weed, you happily oblige. He&#39;s all old and shit, but he gave us Motor City Madness, so that&#39;s good for a free joint and a bag of Cheetos. Not those nasty-ass hot one, either, just the classic Kraft Mac-n-Cheese-orange kind; the kind that stains your fingers so when you go to jack off, your johnson ends up the color of Trump&#39;s hair. At the end of the day, when the  fat ol&#39; sun was touching the horizon, Stony the Pony reflected on her day. &quot;I got way stoned on Super Silver Haze!&quot; she thought and smiled silently to herself. Then the Furrys showed up. The End.

VFirst time ever smoking a Sativa strain and I have to say the difference from anything else I\u2019ve ever smoked was immediate. I stopped smoking weed maybe 12 years ago because I hated the heavy slow stoned feeling. SSH was anything but that - everything I always hoped marijuana could be: invigorating, illuminating, inspiring. Took one hit this morning and I felt alert and social, happy and engaged. Spent some time writing and editing and cooking and then hit the gym. Super great focused energy. Open, relaxed heady feeling. Body felt light and peppy. This was a totally different weed experience for me and I think one I will def return to.

VStrong pungent citrus and tropical smells as I start to break open this  fat bud.  The flower is a really light green and short leaves in there are a few hairs here and there but not many.  It produced a very thick vape,  it&#39;s  herbal and sage really give a pungent flavor it&#39;s not Skunky nor woody.  The effects of this are really concentrated in the at and I can see why the haze characteristics give it that nice head high wall the northern lights give a body high.  I got these buds.  From high desert relief and they have some of the most hydroponic Crystal coated product I have ever seen This  .Super silver haze it is known to knock you On a roller coaster if you&#39;re not a high tolerance smoker or vaporizer. These effects are also really great and I love how it gives me an appetite to keep eating most strange to not do this green crack is another strain that I love that also does this for me. If you have pain depression stress and including nausea this would help you ideally.

VConsidering that the parents of Super Silver Haze are all classic strains in their own right (as well as excellent breeding stock), it&#39;s no surprise that this very special Haze enjoys critical acclaim and widespread popularity. Like almost all Haze strains, it can be finicky when growing and requires a long flowering time to really show its greatness but if you have the know-how and patience, the rewards are immense. The buds are extremely resinous and downright photogenic, and its high is uplifting, euphoric, and relaxing in a way that makes it great for any ailments that sativas are typically used for as well as some that other sativas don&#39;t help with. Basically, you just can&#39;t go wrong with a well-cultivated Super Silver Haze.

VThere once was a pony named Stony and Stony the Pony loved prancing in the meadow, playing games with her pony friends and getting completely loaded off her pony ass. One day, Stony the Pony and her friend Snoop Dawg were blazing up bowls of Super Silver Haze. They agreed that it was very good weed. It smelled like a cross between her other friend, Buddy Skunk, and a hobo&#39;s feet. The buds were as snowy as a Christmas tree in winter. And it got &#39;em hella fucked up. Oh shit, son! They was BLAZED! Snoop was freestylin&#39; to some Deltron 3030 beats and Stony, well stony was just groovin&#39; right along. Then George Clinton showed up and was trying to mack some free buddage, which was totally cool because Snoop always brings extra and hey, the sharing the kind IS kind! Besides, it was George Clinton! If George Clinton shows up and asks to share your weed, you happily oblige. He&#39;s all old and shit, but he gave us Motor City Madness, so that&#39;s good for a free joint and a bag of Cheetos. Not those nasty-ass hot one, either, just the classic Kraft Mac-n-Cheese-orange kind; the kind that stains your fingers so when you go to jack off, your johnson ends up the color of Trump&#39;s hair. At the end of the day, when the  fat ol&#39; sun was touching the horizon, Stony the Pony reflected on her day. &quot;I got way stoned on Super Silver Haze!&quot; she thought and smiled silently to herself. Then the Furrys showed up. The End.

VI would definitely highly recommend this strain!  As for the length of the effects, I was feeling great for about 3 hours before I started to come down again.  I did get hungry and eat a bit more than I normally do, but many strains do that to me.  My pains are Mid-back, knees, heels and overall lethargy, like I can NOT get out of 1&#39;st gear no matter how much I try!.  I used to have to &quot;JACK&quot; myself on Delottid.  (I sometimes still do but not NEARLY as much as I used to have to.) 3 pills of 4Mgs each in one dose just to get me to feel more well... not so...  well.. sloth like!.  But using cannabis has reduced my need for Fentanyl almost entirely!  I went from using the 100 Mcg/h patches to 12.5 Mcg/h patches and supposed to use them every 3 days.  Patches would only last 2 or 2.5 at best, but now I only use Fentanyl at the rate of 1 patch every week or two!!  Only when I get a REAL bad flare up, or when I know I have alot of physical work to do within the next 24 hours to help but otherwise, I am ALMOST completely off a dangerous narcotic.  Now that is not to say that it is because of using ONLY Super Silver Haze, because I use several strains. but using less of a synthetic narcotic is a MASSIVE victory for me personally.

VConfession of a Lightweight: This strain is a smooth and enjoyable smoke that has a classic aroma. It&#39;s understatedly strong however, a few hits is enough for an easy and euphoric high in which one is alert and content. But be warned that if one smokes too much they may feel shakey and interpret time slowing down, yet that will diminish like clockwork over 2-3 hours. SSH is great for going down the YouTube rabbit hole.

VSuper Silver Haze is one of the most well known strains because of the incredibly strong high it delivers. The user&#39;s mind is flooded with energetic and trippy thoughts. SSH is best when enjoyed during the day, preferably out in nature. On a hike, someone who has smoked this strain will be amazed by the beauty and color of their surroundings. The sun shines brighter, the birds chirp louder, and squirrels are squirrelier. Just be careful not to smoke too much at a time because, with a sativa this strong, paranoia has a tendency to kick in with higher doses.

Light on the &quot;stonyness&quot; but heavy in all the good sativa ways: existential thoughts, warm loose body, slight dizziness, elevated(like on stilts), high energy, and yet easily composed and coherent in company. Not &quot;the guy in the corner...&quot;  Good by itself for a &quot;light&quot; day trip. Also amazing when blended with something a little more cerebral along with a good body-heavy indica to round out anything this strain may be lacking or that you may be wanting.

VSuper Silver Haze, what can I say, for the next few hours I swear to god I may as well have been a writer in Hollywood, my creative force was, simply put, unstoppable.  In the past, my usual hesitation towards anything Sativa dominant (let alone pure Sativa) was in fear of overwhelming anxiety and inability to control my train of thought.  However, with Super Silver Haze, I was content with where my mind was taking me, even if it was on a Sativa-heavy journey.  Quite frankly, my mind was on fire in the best way imaginable.

VIt was all right. The best parts about this strain to me was that it was a smooth vape, was easy on my lungs, and I felt some fatigue melt right off. There was a sweet, earthy flavor to the exhale that had me intrigued, but it&#39;s not enough to make me come back for more.\u000a\u000aI had a pretty consistent pressure at my temples, and felt effects for 3 hours off of 2 vape puffs. (I&#39;m a bit of a lightweight with new strains and prefer microdosing whenever possible.) The downer? I got a headache after those 3 hours.

VSuper Silver Haze is great! First toke and you already feel it coming up, after 5min you even forgot how you started having that blunt in your hand!\u000a\u000aThe great thing bout this hybrid is that one time it can make you very high, other times it makes you very stoned but mostly both which is an awesome place to be. Sometimes it gives me &quot;radar love&quot; (kind of a head stone, but over your entire body, like you&#39;re being scanned by a radar). \u000aA strain you must have tried at least once in you stoner lifetime.\u000a\u000aPeace &amp; love, T.

VThis strain is tremendously good for getting work done. I normally go to bed at about 11pm, but on this strain in light doses off of my vape I found myself cleaning my house and scrubbing the shower etc until about 2am. If you suffer from insomnia this probably is not the right strain for you. \u000aThe reason for the lack of the 5th star is because I don&#39;t seem to get the stress relief that other people do. I don&#39;t really get paranoid, but I just seem to fret over work and money and such. Not enough to seriously mess up the high, but it&#39;s definitely noticeable. \u000aAll in all this strain is a very useful tool for getting you back on your feet and while I don&#39;t think it should be the only strain you have on hand, I think it definitely is worth keeping in the cabinet!

VSuper Silver Haze. What a blast. In my opinion even better than my all-time favorite Purple Haze.  Hard to describe the effects, but I&#39;d say this strain is like a jaguar: it sneaks, stalks upon you. And then, when you think of it the least, it pounces you with full force. \u000a\u000aEven after sleeping for almost 18 hours I still felt the effects. Slightly, but they were there.

VThis strain fucking destroys me.  In fact, I can&#39;t follow this up with anything else because nothing gets me higher than the SSH to begin with.  The first 20 minutes after smoking I&#39;m pretty stupid; trying to figure out where I am and stuff like that.  After the mindfuck settles down a bit I&#39;m left with a fairly energetic and focused high which lasts a long time and comes in waves, although I never can seem to shake the feeling that I&#39;m pretty fucked-up.  I dare say this weed might be a little strong for me, but I&#39;ll keep it around for those times when I just want to blow my mind out.  Buds are pretty...a nice sandy green with crystal fields all over the place; somewhat dense...some shake comes loose when handled.  I love this weed but it might not be entirely my cup of tea just because of how overbearing it can be.

VI was excited to get to try this strain for free in a pre-roll from a dispensary I registered with! \u000a\u000aI found the high to be extremely mellow and relaxed - almost too much so for me. While the body high was not as heavy or pronounced as in something a bit more indica-leaning, I would not describe the experience as &quot;energetic&quot;, which is what I look for in a sativa. I couldn&#39;t get out of my bed, and had very little motivation to do much of anything but stare off into space.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I felt VERY content to be completely zoned out! While I didn&#39;t get the big time distortions, or feelings of my body being very heavy like an indica, I was definitely stuck and going absolutely nowhere. And I was SO OK with that!\u000a\u000aI can definitely see how people describe it as a euphoric strain. Life was good. Not like INTENSELY good, but just perfectly ok just as things were. It felt kinda Buddhist, lol - I was just really at peace with everything and everyone. \u000a\u000aI also think I&#39;m going to try meditating while on some, as I think it *may* make a good combo...although it may be overly chill and I might just doze off &#128513;\u000a\u000aOverall, it&#39;s not a strain I would reach for if I wanted to feel creative and motivated and energetic. But it is absolutely something I would reach for if I was feeling depressed, or irritable, or generally just wanted to get OK with the world.

VSuper Silver Haze, what can I say, for the next few hours I swear to god I may as well have been a writer in Hollywood, my creative force was, simply put, unstoppable.  In the past, my usual hesitation towards anything Sativa dominant (let alone pure Sativa) was in fear of overwhelming anxiety and inability to control my train of thought.  However, with Super Silver Haze, I was content with where my mind was taking me, even if it was on a Sativa-heavy journey.  Quite frankly, my mind was on fire in the best way imaginable.

VSuper Silver Haze is an invigorating sativa perfect for day-time medicating. The effects are quick to onset and will provide you with a powerful uplifted sensation, accompanied by a subtle full body relaxation. An unmistakable taste that fills the mouth with an incredible citrus flavour which is slightly reminiscent of lemons, along with a candy-like sweetness and mild earthy undertone. The smell is dominated by an almost sour citrus scent, joined with a sweet earthy aroma. Overall a super sativa perfectly suited to day-time use.

VA huge improvement of silver haze, especially in flavour, with bud is sweet and even smells slightly of honey. It gives a strong, long head high. The buds fairly dense and pointed. They are covered in crystals and a good amount of trics. This bud is great when smoked through a bong, which seems to increase the high. Overall one of my favourite day time strains.

In the past, my usual hesitation towards anything Sativa dominant (let alone pure Sativa) was in fear of overwhelming anxiety and inability to control my train of thought.  However, with Super Silver Haze, I was content with where my mind was taking me, even if it was on a Sativa-heavy journey.  Quite frankly, my mind was on fire in the best way imaginable.

VA huge improvement of silver haze, especially in flavour, with bud is sweet and even smells slightly of honey. It gives a strong, long head high. The buds fairly dense and pointed. They are covered in crystals and a good amount of trics. This bud is great when smoked through a bong, which seems to increase the high. Overall one of my favourite day time strains.

VSuper Silver Haze is an invigorating sativa perfect for day-time medicating. The effects are quick to onset and will provide you with a powerful uplifted sensation, accompanied by a subtle full body relaxation. An unmistakable taste that fills the mouth with an incredible citrus flavour which is slightly reminiscent of lemons, along with a candy-like sweetness and mild earthy undertone. The smell is dominated by an almost sour citrus scent, joined with a sweet earthy aroma. Overall a super sativa perfectly suited to day-time use.
