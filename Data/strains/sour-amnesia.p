VThis strain is an absolute must try!\u000a\u000aThe smoke is very Skunky/earthy with a hint of diesel as an aftertase. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I feel like the Amnesia genetics overpower the diesel/chem on this one. \u000a\u000aI bet if this strain were to be grow outdoors, it would be some of the best smelling herb. \u000a\u000aThis feels like a true sativa to me...It&#39;s probably one of., if not THE best\u000afeeling  behind my eyes I have ever come across. There is a bit of an almost numbing effect on the body but not in a way that couchlocks you. \u000a\u000aThis is by far one of my favorite daytime strains. \u000a\u000a28.12% thc.

VKinda disappointed :(..  From what I heard and read I was expecting more. Not enough headhigh and not enough bodyhigh.  Tastes good and piney like The amnesias usually do but lacks its parents punching power... Might be a less than perfekt batch tho but Sour Diesel and The amnesia Family should come up with better..

VWhat a strain! Sour D crossed with Amnesia? Yes please! I&#39;ve had this strain a few times before but the batch I got today blew my mind. Nugs were super dense, a beautiful green covered in wild orange hairs. It smelled like a muted slight hazy Sour D. The high was instantaneous, I mean after a single hit my mood was soaring in the clouds, a grin spread wide across my face. Another hit later I was singing and dancing for no reason whatsoever. I then went and hung out with a friend because that&#39;s the kind of strain this is: a sociable one. It&#39;s one I would recommend for a concert or a party, somewhere fun and upbeat where you can be loud and spontaneous and have fun! It&#39;s also definitely a pure Sativa so it&#39;s best smoked in the morning/throughout the day but not so great for chilling out after a long day, it&#39;s too upbeat and energetic for that (unless you like that.) 5 star bud in my book.

VAbsolutley amazing strain. The sweet floral smell has a slight hint of its Sour Diesel parent and but the is much more evident in the taste which is surprisingly mostly sour with a hint of fruityness. The buds are huge and show colors of yellow green and slight purple spots. The buds lean heavy towards the amnesia side with their look but thats not a bad thing they are beautiful. Def 1 of the best strains out, amazing uplifting high.

VWhen two popular strains Sour Diesel crossed with Hollands Amnesia get mixed you know something good will come out of it and well here it is Sour Amnesia. This very potent sativa has made it into my heart and my regular rotation of morning breakfast and meds before i start my day. Just the terpene profile alone was enough for me to get this strain, with light green fluffy buds and nice orange hairs coursing through the buds, the flavour for me was similar to the milk in the end of a bowl of fruit loops, very sweet/skunky pungent aromas followed my a smooth milky smoke. The high is my most sought after type of high, this strain literally has me floating on a cloud of euphoria that just keeps the uplifting vibes flowing, it gets my morning started just right, fights off my morning fatigue and really assists in helping elevate my mood without being too over the top

VMore accurately I would have given it 4.5. It&#39;s basically everything you&#39;d expect from a very good sativa--it&#39;s energetic, very cerebral, about as subtle as a freight train in the way it comes on. It also tends to last longer than a couple of hours. Perhaps the most dangerous part of this strain is how badly I lost track of time when high from it. I suppose that comes from the Amnesia part of it because I can taste the Sour Diesel part, ever so faintly. Still, heads up on that time-loss part because that could cause problems for people in certain situations. That aside, this was top-shelf worthy flower that I&#39;d definitely consider buying again if I saw it.

VOn its own, 5 stars for sure.  When compared to my benchmark sativa Jack Herer?  4-4.5/5 stars.  This strain offers the clarity, the uplift, the energizing effect typical to that of a sativa.  Taste is smooth and robust (vaped), and hits immediately upon exhalation.  A quick uptick in the happy department, met with motivation, fairly clear mindedness, and a bit giggly and fun.  I feel it&#39;s not as sharp or focused as the Jack Herer, but offers a more &quot;round&quot; high, more &quot;all encompassing&quot;, more noticeable throughout.  Great daytime use, strong, and lasts a decent amount of time with no bad come down or headache or the like.  Great potent sativa strain that offers the punch and energy one would expect from crossing these 2 dynamite sativa strains.  No anxiety or paranoia, just a great &quot;up&quot;.

VWhen two popular strains Sour Diesel crossed with Hollands Amnesia get mixed you know something good will come out of it and well here it is Sour Amnesia. This very potent sativa has made it into my heart and my regular rotation of morning breakfast and meds before i start my day. Just the terpene profile alone was enough for me to get this strain, with light green fluffy buds and nice orange hairs coursing through the buds, the flavour for me was similar to the milk in the end of a bowl of fruit loops, very sweet/skunky pungent aromas followed my a smooth milky smoke. The high is my most sought after type of high, this strain literally has me floating on a cloud of euphoria that just keeps the uplifting vibes flowing, it gets my morning started just right, fights off my morning fatigue and really assists in helping elevate my mood without being too over the top

VDecent strain. Tasted like a mixture of diesel and citrus with a hint of berry. Not the most focused or energized sativas but definitely uplifting.\u000a\u000aNot one I&#39;ll race out to pickup again but wouldn&#39;t shy away from either. Decent smoke, very tasty  but not a favorite.

VA great strain... strong soaring high, that&#39;ll make your train of thought move so fast it&#39;ll feel like everything is reflex... This strains has traits that an occasional smoker may not like, but if you&#39;re a lifetime stoner, you&#39;ll enjoy. Great strain for use before a flag football game or a jui-jitsu tournament.
