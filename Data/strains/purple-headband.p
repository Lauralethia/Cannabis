VThis strain is more energizing on the physical side. Mentally, it is a relaxing and carefree type of high. Potency is medium, although overdoing the strain will give a slight nervous edge (not too bad though). Anyone who does well with Sour Diesel will like this strain. The headband was there when I first starting smoke this a year or so ago, now I don&#39;t even feel it. Overall, a good strain. I have bought a few times and will occasionally buy more.

VSuper sweet smell, packed with orange hairs, great hybrid. I love this strain! It\u2019s the perfect daytime high. Relaxes your brain, but you can still go hiking and go grocery shopping. I highly (get it?) recommend this strain. It\u2019s wonderful.

VPurple Rubber band is a 50/50 strain. Very euphoric at first then settle&#39;s in like your wrapped in blanket very similar to the feeling I get from  Lo drops CBD drops. Great strain if you want to remain pain free during day while accomplishing your Activities of daily living. If not available in your area throw some rubber band flower mixed w/ honey oil purple skunk like a cake or cookie.

VAmazing strain, one of my top 5. I am usually one to choose indica or sativa dominant strains depending on what I&#39;m doing, or what time of day it is. With this strain there is no need to figure that out I can smoke it all day and have a fun giggly High whether I&#39;m doing something active or just melting into the couch. If you come across purple headband I highly recommend it, it is the perfect mix of indica and sativa characteristics

Vpurple headband honestly made me feel weird. at first my high started off strong; but gradually it turned into more of an anxiety high. however, it does taste good and is probably the most beautiful bud i\u2019ve ever seen.

VI really love this bud, the high you get form this product is a nice giggly happy high, defiantly a hangout type of weed. The flavor you get form this weed is a smokey pine flavor. Nothing wrong with this strain.

VIt&#39;s a really well balanced strain. I like my weed to put me in a couch lock before bed and this definitely does. But you can also smoke it in the day and be perfectly fine. I was even able to work out on it, so it&#39;s a keeper for me. \u000aNo anxiety either, just a relaxing head and body high.
