VGood Strain, I and my relatives enjoyed this.  Mild to Strong high - in a good way, you aren&#39;t blitzed, but you are cheery and remain lucid, not recommended if you plan on driving at the height of the high lol\u000a\u000a- Relieves: Pain, Depression, Anxiety, Stress\u000a- The High: Uplifting and Very Pleasant, Europhia and Amplified Emotions (in a good way)\u000a\u000aRating: 9

VThis is a great strain, as mentioned here, for relaxing after a long day of work or a relaxing weekend.  For my applications, I will typically medicate with Purple Nepal first, get the mind and body relaxed, then have something like Querkle or GDP to ensure I will actually have a restful sleep.  Perhaps if someone is still a modest smoker this may actually give you a 2-3 afterrnoon nap, but more seasoned patients may need more.  Great medium stregfth strain though.
