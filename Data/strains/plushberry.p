VHeavy relaxation is an understatement this strain proves once again Space Queen gives us some potent strains the only downside to this strain Is the heavy resin production your piece looks like it needs a car wash afterwards the black cherry soda gives it a taste only one can imagine being a fan of Blue Boy from Seattle and blue satellite I wanted to try this strain and the aroma is there

VPlushberry is a strain of the kush family from TGA Subcool. This strain is coated with an abundance of trichromes, which make each nug sparkle in the light. Dark amber hairs and hints of vibrant purple can be seen on the body of this beautiful bud. Plushberry has a smell and taste that reminds the user of candy; the smoke is very sweet. That is this strain&#39;s most defining attribute. Its taste alone is unique enough to make it a must try for those looking to experience extraordinary bud. The high is both relaxing and invigorating. The user can simultaneously zone out and perform a task that requires focus; like playing games or studying. It is great for either one. Overall, Plushberry is a great tasting strain that packs a punch. It should not be missed by any reefer enthusiast.

VJust as a note this is my second time ever smoking pot and first time with this strain and I only took 1 hit\u000a\u000a10 min after smoking:  So I tried this as only my second time ever smoking and being that the first time I ever tried pot I had a super bad anxiety attack and it made the whole attempt horrible, I was very cautious choosing this strain. I needed to find something to help my anxiety better and something that would help me relax at night before bed. It\u2019s only been 10-15 min and I\u2019m experiencing a good amount of effects helping me focus. My mind is also very relaxed. I started with some back pain and its still there and I don\u2019t feel the overwhelming relaxing ability\u2019s but I have to say that so far as far as anxiety goes, I\u2019m doing well.

VPicked up some of this from Herbal Nation. Produced by AVITAS with a lab tested 19.12% THC and .76%CBD. Buds are a deep color with tight buds and long orange hairs. It has a very sweet smell and smoke. Very nice heavy Indica (20/80 Sat/Ind hybrid) that produces a fantastic body high. This is some great nighttime bud. A definite stress reliver.

This is a beautiful looking and smelling strain, but the effects where not what the average smoker is looking for...

Warm and comfy feeling enveloping my body\u000a2. Immediate relaxation without wanting to go to sleep \u000a3. No paranoia or issues so far \u000a \u000aIt also helps with my anxiety, stress and depression. I&#39;ve been going through a hard time and needed a strain to help me just forget and not focus on the negative. Mission accomplished. I know I will sleep well tonight. \u000a\u000aMight be a new fav! \u000a\u000a(Also this might differ state to state but in mine this is one of the more affordable strains. Win-win)

VI really enjoyed this strain. The experience was somewhat trippy (I kept thinking I saw someone out of the corner of my eye). Tasted smooth and earthy with hints of berry. As soon I got into bed though I was washed over with happiness and completely stress-free. I must&#39;ve smoked a tiny bit too much, because I was so happy I saw fireworks! This also hit a sleep score of 90% on Sleep Cycle app! Strain 1 of 100.

VThis is some of the best medicine I have come across... ever. Very good for depression and anxiety and very little couch lock. Don&#39;t get me wrong.. she sends you into a deep relaxed euphoric state, but you can easily pull yourself out and get things done. The flowers I received were over 28% THC and I had no added paranoia or dizziness associated with high THC strains. Very much recommended for a pick me up from depression, and a stress killer.

VThis is an incredibly relaxing strain. Plushberry relieves all kinds of physical pain and will sooth many anxieties. It doesn&#39;t offer a very intense head high but will still leave the user feeling happy and at peace. It&#39;s sweet berry aroma is strong and pure. The rainbow of dark purple, green and orange will impress weed nerds all over. It easily puts you asleep which is good for those looking for insomnia relief but as long you pace yourself it works well as a daytime strain.

Nothing too overpowering, just a nice tasty flavor.\u000a\u000aI had to hunt this strain down. My usual 3 shops didn&#39;t have it, and I hit 2 other shops before finally finding it. However I can say with 100% confidence (for myself at least) that it was worth the effort

VPlushberry is an excellent, reliable indica-dominant hybrid that is great for all purposes, medical and recreational alike. The plant seems to inherit its effects primary from its Space Queen parent (this is definitely a good thing as Space Queen is one of the best strains out there) and its excellent berry+earthy flavor/smell and appearance from its Black Cherry Soda parent. A solid choice for any reason or occasion, any time of day.

VThis is a solid Indica dominant hybrid. Standouts include a unique aesthetic and aroma courtesy of the black cherry soda parent. The defects are well-balanced. For this reason it is appealing to a wide variety of consumers, including novices and those whom are prone to anxiety. It&#39;s not my fave by any means, but it&#39;s definitely good smoke. If you like novelty of taste and aesthetic, you might want to give this unique strain a try for that reason alone...

VThe taste was somewhat tainted by the grower I believe. I was looking forward to a pleasant experience with this strain, being that I&#39;ve heard good things about it in the past. The breakdown was crumbly and very manageable to the roller. Once nugs are opened a fruitful smell jumps out of no where and greets the room with its aroma. The high is a mellow body and head buzz but isn&#39;t anything too spectacular. I&#39;d like to try this strain again so I can give it justice.

VPlushberry, being a indica dominant brings the perks of having a relax, stoney feeling of wanting to adjust accordingly alongside tasks, coffee, and errands. Tastes, sweet and berry like. Increments of two to three hour sessions, sometimes five to six hours of not having the urge of wanting to smoke again. Great flower to inhale, as an in between or individually. This ranks on the low end of a four star because of the high it produces overall.

In fact it took about three or four hits from my vaporizer to get any kind of head buzz.

VI tried Plushberry for the first time last night to help me get to sleep, I was expecting more immobility and sluggishness but I was pleasantly surprised with the effects of this strain. I found it was very easy to maintain complex and intelligent conversation without forgetting some important detail. I was actually pretty pretty alert, could have and probably would have gone out and done something fun outside if it wasn&#39;t still snowing here in April. The best effect however was the stress and anxiety it all melted away as fast as it came on, no paranoia what so ever. My only regret is that I did not grab more when I had the chance. Would definitely recommend to anyone!

VMeh, I wasn&#39;t impressed though I typically love anything berry and purple- another case in which perhaps the grower, not the strain is to blame though. Seemed poorly manicured, and though the label said it was 21.3%, I didn&#39;t think it was particularly stoney. Grown by Tonasket Tumbleweed which I wouldn&#39;t recommend much from, as many of their strains are similarly manicured and seem to be very stemmy and leafy- like it was outdoors or not the right fertilizer during budding.

VPlushberry by T.G.A. Subcool seeds is a cross between Black Cherry Soda and Space Queen, mainly purple in color, this 80% indica strain has a smell similar to blackberry and a very unique taste too. The main medical effects are sleepiness and pain relief, the negatives seem to be mild but some anxiety may be present but mainly dry mouth and dry eyes are the most common side effects. Overall Plushberry is a favorite of mine, the heavy indica effects make it perfect for a good night time smoke either to medicate or to just relax and unwind from the day.

VPlushBerry Is one of my favorite day time strains. It&#39;s one of those strains that you don&#39;t need a water pipe to enjoy the taste. Extremely fruity with a powerful dose of pain relief that you find with most purple strains.  If I am having one of my harder pain filled days I like to mix a bowl with pure afgooey. A lot of people are growing PlushBerry So you really have to find someone who knows what they are doing. I have also seen quite a few people trying to pass plushberry off as Purple Kush.

VThe variation of Plushberry I tried was grown outdoors, and this was noticeable by the appearance. Although the trim job was poor, the effects are fantastic. You can expect some fatigue, like most indicas, but plushberry has noticeable functional effects that make it more like a hybrid. I enjoy that this strain can be smoked at any time of day and was surprsied at the intesnity of its effects.
