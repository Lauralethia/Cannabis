VOmg, literally for some reason my friend and i could&#39;nt shut the fuck up. This strain made me lazy, but unfortunatly i had bad dry mouth (gum to the rescue) and also i ended up getting dry eyes, only a little tho.

VI&#39;ve grown a different particular phenotype of Anesthesia for a few grows and been very happy with it - It&#39;s Pyramid Seeds version which is 90% Northern Lights and 10% Black Domina. Much like NL characteristics... it&#39;s a pretty heavy hitting body high - Definitely a good couchlock or sleepy time medication. It usually weighs in with a THC percentage of 18-21. If you can find it I highly recommend it!

VPicked this up @ Bloom in phx awhile back. I was expecting way more of a knock out with having herojuana as a parent.\u000aIt&#39;s only mildly sedating at best. This just felt like a regular old indica.

VTHE BEST FOR PAIN. I suffer with pain on a daily basis and this strain is now my new best friend. It is amazing.Be careful it is very strong so use carefully. It brings on heavy couch lock but in the best way ever . You will be so chilled you wont give a fuck.

VMy buddy, my guy, my pal. THIS. This is incredible. I have severe, chronic pain and this beautiful flower, bless it&#39;s soul, eliminated most of, if not ALL of the pain sometimes! I only smoke this during daylight, though. Elevated my paranoia/ fear of the dark, but that&#39;s my own experience. Cheers!

VVery strong, smelly strain. As soon as you open the container the smell fills up the room.  Even for experienced smokers I would recommend pacing yourself and waiting between hits, a super high will sneak up on you. Otherwise, great potent strain that leaves you numb and relaxed. Great strain for a movie before bed.

VVery relaxing medium chairlock situation with this one,  excellent chronic pain relief which helps greatly.  Started to feel sleepy and I was out, when I woke I had the munchies.  Your thinking is blurry yet you can see clear at times kinda psychodelic situation I think.

Vpretty good strain.smoked it in spain at the summer.i smoked it on the beach with my buddy and after it hit me i begin to talk something stupid thing and after i explained my buddy that thing i realized that i speaked  15 min about that.the high is strong numbs you little bit but still you can do normal things with out everyone noticing that you re high because you dont get dry eyes and dont start gigling or that kind of shit but you will get bad dry eyes but water will safe:)

VI don&#39;t know if I will buy this strain again. I didn&#39;t mind the positive effects (tired, calmed, relaxed) but I didn&#39;t like the chemical taste. was overpowering ... first hit or two was nice and earthy/green with faint chemical taste but the remaining hits were chemical tasting
