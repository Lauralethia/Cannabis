VTried this as Shatter. Super earthy and pungent with myrcene and limonene jumping out at you. Very mixed effects, narcotic but nice middle ground, not to invasive or heady, also not to couch lock. This stuff was gooey as all hell though and made a mess trying to handle it even with the dab tools. Well played Gorilla Glue, haha....

VAdding to my list of perfect daytime strains.  Good taste, can&#39;t really put my finger on the taste, but this helps me concentrate and get things done, not sit on the couch or fall asleep.  The pain relief I get from it is pretty good. Like this strain a lot.

VThis particular smokeable is gonna do ya right if you&#39;re looking for a mellow head high. A little euphoric, very relaxed, and with just a touch of sleepiness. You&#39;ll feel like the Dude after a night on the lanes. It&#39;s not the best out there for adding some chill to your Netflix, but it&#39;ll get you back down from a long day. Pairs well with pork teriyaki and gyozas, or rainy days.

VLake of Fire is a serious improvement over Gorilla Glue #4.  The high is more cerebral and I can function while smoking throughout the day.  Grown hydroponically, the flavor beats the pants of GG with the addition of sweet pine. Yield is substantial and easily manicured. This strain is definitely a keeper.

VVery nice.  Good pain relief, good body high.  I noticed a little anxiety for the first 10 minutes or so (probably the sativa effects) but it quickly went away into a calm, euphoric high. Picked up an eighth after not smoking for a few months, so this should be awesome lol
