VThis may differ from a lot of patients on here. But I love this strain because in whatever a light dose is for you,  you can get great indica reliefs like Pain, stress, and headaches, and sort of starts out like an indica but rides out toward the end like sativa not leaving ready to lay down.

VI\u2019m liking this strain more and more each time I smoke it! The nugs are a gorgeous light green color with orange hairs running through them and hints of purple scattered throughout. They glisten in the light from the amount of trichomes on each bud! The taste is a mix of berry and grape with subtle earthy aftertaste. Very relaxing body high. Overall a great strain.

VI love this Kush it reminds me of a forest both in looks and taste. Very earthy not very impressive to look at but hits right away with pain relief and is great for anyone with stomach issues i.e. pain/lack of appetite. Perfect style of bud for making shatter. &#127797;

VElderberry Kush has a smooth sweetness on the inhale combined with a skunky and earthy Kush typical exhale. The relaxing effects are very quick to set in and can easily cause you to become sleepy. Great for cheering up and pain relief as well this strain makes a great choice for many patients.

VThis was a very nice strain. It mildly set in after a few bong rips and pretty soon I was in a greater state of mind. It was a nice social smoke, surprising for a heavy indica. When I say social I mean talkative. Very effective pain reliever and it gives a pleasant tingle throughout your body that will put you to sleep if you get too comfy

VThe shatter is very dark which is common for this strain but it also tastes a bit burnt, which sucks bong water,  the high is pretty potent so I&#39;m not pissed but I&#39;m also not thrilled with the batch. &#127797;

VThis strain is very weak and I honestly don&#39;t see how it helps with anxiety. I feel that, and it could possibly be just because I&#39;m thinking about it, but I have a little more anxiety after smoking than I did before. Definitely will stay away from this bud.
