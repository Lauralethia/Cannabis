VI was hitting my pipe in the shed at my house, filled Love Potion #9. This strain is amazing, It took away all my stress after one bowl. I then walked inside after smoking that one bowl and realized that the power went out. So I entertained myself for an hour and a half waiting for the power to come back on. I even did some productive activities for a few minutes. One example is that I folded my laundry and put it away. I remember feeling proud after I did that. It&#39;s the perfect strain to smoke in the evening because you can still function and do a few things. Perfect for after work or after you&#39;ve been working hard all day doing whatever.

VDelicious, it definitely lives up to it&#180;s name. A sweet pungent aroma which wisps the user into a glowing euphoria and then settles down to a nice indica high.

VLove Potion #9 is very nice strain overall. It&#39;s very sweet off the first pull, with a strong taste of cherry and overripe fruits finishing with an earthy-honey exhale. It has a nice relaxed body high without any really strong heady effects. That makes it a great strain for socializing as it does promote laughter and talking amongst friends, but I also found the duration of the high short, as did the relatively infrequent smokers I shared it with. Once it begins to wear off it leads to a pretty heavy crash (but not in a Kush-sleep kind of way). But it is still good for temporary relief of anxiety or stress and it will leave you relaxed. 3/5.  I can definitely see how some patients would enjoy it, but I will not be coming back for more.

VMedium amount of THC in the batch I had, but still a good smoke. Absolutely delicious and fruity. Smells like raspberry jam and fresh fish, and has a definite sweet raspberry cough. The sweet taste when I cough is possibly the best part of the strain I had. Nice purple colouring throughout that looks beautiful even when ground up.
