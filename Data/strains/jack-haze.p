VFelt happily energized after smoking.\u000aNo groggy after-feeling whatsoever. \u000aGreat strain for the Multitasker...\u000aalthough taste not as sweet as others. \u000aAll in all very happy &#129304;&#127996;

VGot to smoke this one with friends, we all got different negative reactions.. I got more anxious than usual, another friend got super paranoid seeing black dots and the other... Well, she got really sick. I thought maybe I made it too strong, but later I tried again and still the high was bad. \u000a\u000aSo just keep in mind it might hit you in the wrong way...

VThis one just doesn&#39;t agree with me as much as other strains. Not one to usually get anxious right after smoking, this one unfortunately gets that job done for me. Bit of a lasting anxiousness too, as it lingers for a while after nearly all other effects have subsided. It does have an apparent potency (indeed, it certainly is like a strong cup of coffee) but the high isn&#39;t as &#39;clean&#39; as other strains, for lack of a better term. To be fair, very few strains that come from anything &quot;Haze&quot;-related just aren&#39;t my thing. Between this and Jack Herer, I&#39;d go with the latter. Don&#39;t want to sound too down on this one, as I&#39;ve no doubt it&#39;s effective medicine for some... but with eight strains in my cabinet right now, this one would be my last choice. 3.0/5.

VVery Nice - said to be sativa-dominant but makes me very sleepy in a nice way.  Not a struggle-to-keep-your-head-up way but a time-to-get-under-the-covers way.  Very positive semi-head buzz and good uplifter.

Vholy cow! I&#39;ve never felt such an uplifting effect before. this strain is great for lightening up your mood. not only that, but you still feel incredibly focused and in controloof yourself.  definitely one strain you don&#39;t want to miss out on.  I would say the perfect time to smoke this would be before going out with your buddies. it puts you in a phenomenal mood and your head still feels clear. perfect for when you and your friends have a long night ahead of you.

VThis strain is like drinking a large black cup of coffee. Gets you wired and focused. The buds are a lighter green that is amplified by its frosty coating and smells of sweet flowers...and theres some rose in there too.  Almost has a peppercorn steak taste that leads to dry mouth. Oh and don&#39;t forget to grab some shades as well, cause you&#39;ll have the case of the red eyes. Otherwise a top notch strain for exserienced day time users. Would not recogmended for beginner enthusiasts with anxiety.
