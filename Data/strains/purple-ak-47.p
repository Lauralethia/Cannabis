VSmoked a small amount of this but which was named not &quot;Purple AK-47&quot; but rather &quot;Grand AK&quot;, same genetics. The tag said THC is only 13% but it felt like it was much stronger. Experience similar to what others said, sort of half body feel and half mind Sativa focus. I did feel it very quickly, as description here says, but later it creeped up more and hit harder. I didn&#39;t feel sleepy but mind began to shut down. Good sleep. Also gave strong tingling in hands and feet. Had to use skin lotion so hands don&#39;t feel so tingly.\u000aSmoke is harsher and more smelly than other purple varieties or pure Sativa varieties.

VPurple Ak-47 is a true canibis  hybrid. The high hits late and with a full mental buzz keeping you light in your feet. Stage two is a full body erotic tropical sensation that starts in your toes. The taste is sweet pine and is best tasted through a licked wet zig zag pape. Peace yall guy #7 is out&#255;

VPurple AK-47? Sounds like something Prince would carry if he were a gangster. I&#39;m not a fan of the name but the effects are what the show is about. So, I think the object  of this game is to work hard and play hard; PAK-47 allowed me to do both. Hailed as a &quot;one-hitter&quot; strain, PAK-47 definitely gets the cellular processes going. Cerebral effects are intense for an indica-dom hybrid, and the pain relief is a major factor. I embrace the aging process, and as we age it becomes more difficult to remain active without encountering joint and muscle aches and pains.That&#39;s the extent to which I need MMJ regarding pain relief. I administered PAK-47 before my AM workout sessions for about 10 days. I appreciate PAK-47&#39;s fast-acting cerebral push and it&#39;s pain reducing capabilities are equally expeditious and welcomed. Concerning the aesthetics of the flower, look for fluffy green nugs with some purple found throughout the flower. Sweet floral tones accent the piney scent of PAK-47; look for selections that have tons of tricomes.  Also, expect to be lifted for about 45 mins before descending to a nice balanced state. Inexperienced users may experience some paranoia, but moderate usage may negate this phenomenon when medicating with PAK-47. As always, be responsible, do your research before purchasing, and ask for a sample if available. If you find this review informative then follow me, like and share. Thanks &#128074;&#127997;

VThe high with Purp AK-47 is unworldly! Smoke this regularly and I am never disappointed! Be careful if you&#39;re a newbie to smoking and you get ahold of this shit because it&#39;ll knock you on your ass. Bring water, you WILL need it...from smoking this shit practically daily (for about 6 months now.) and it always makes me cough on almost every hit...it&#39;s insane and the high lasts for what feels like forever to the person who is couch stuck from 3 bowls.

I felt like my chest was one fire, and I&#39;m pretty sure I strained a muscle in my shoulder/neck from coughing so hard. But once you stop... Man oh man. The high is incredible. It is  like the best of all worlds. You get the intense, heady high that makes you forget what you&#39;re in the middle of doing. But, you don&#39;t really give a shit that you just forgot what you were doing. F it and find something else to do. Or... just sit on the couch and do nothing. Just let your mind wander.
