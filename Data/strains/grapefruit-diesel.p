VI find this strain to be very good and buzzy.  Definately know your in the zone almost immediately.  Buzz does not leave a hang-over effect,  Helps to assist one in being artistic and creative.  Can also put one in a awareness effect, not paranoia or anxiety. but the light shines a bit brighter, one could say.   \u000aCan also be helpful for mediatating or just spacing out!  Musle tension was noted in my shoulders as I wrote this summary  after smoking about 20 mins, ago.  Also noted before in the early part of the day when partaking in life&#39;s finnest herbs.  Definately a noted favorite.  Nice grapefruit hint of flavor.  Kind of citric.

VThis weed when smelled smells like pungent citrus very good, and though it is a bit flakier then I like with the breaking up, it still has potent and sticky flakes. with flakes of yellow and pink, on a bud that has dark and light green hues, with pinkish orange hairs, it smokes very smoothly. With flavors that have a diesel flavor on the inhale and strong grapefruit on exhale leaving you with the grapefruit aftertaste and a sativa-like high, which is odd for an indica but once you come down from the high the indica will tale over. 4.5/5

VGrapefruit Diesel\u000aLooks: Greenish yellow round nugs, with a few hairs sticking out. This was stuff my girl got, not the same quality i work with but not bad. Was clearly grown for quick profit, may not have been a true grapefruit diesel but did seem in line with it.\u000aSmell: Classic nyc diesel smell/taste, a little differnt but not much, definetly pungent grapefruit thouugh. NYC diesel is not a part of the sour d fam fyi,its (MexicanSativaxChemo)xAfghani.. The true sour diesel n fam come from Chemdawg/NL/SuperSkunk/ect cross\u000aEffects: I was hoping this stuff would put me to sleep, it actually gave me a very introspective focused high. Alot of pressure behind my eyes, and a slighty relaxing feeling. This was not the best sample, but even so it smoked fairly well and true to the description, strain shouldnt take a hit cuz is was $ grabber grow. Definetly would be nice for creative tasks.\u000a\u000a

Wanted to iron all of my shirts- usually a chore, but I got really into detail and  enjoyed it. Before I knew it an hour had passed.  Fun, creative thoughts.

VAn initial sweet diesel is soon undertoned by the powerfully sour citric scent of this amazing strain. Dabbing this on a low temp, you can really appreciate the amazing flavours cannabis has to offer. The smoke has a slightly bitter industrial taste which I generally wouldn&#39;t like, but the sweet grapefruit flavour that accompanies it compliment each other perfectly. After smoking I felt motivated, my creative had shot through the roof. all aches and pains just seemed to disappear. Almost instantly I had a feeling of euphoria so great I could feel it trailing through my body, although after a fair few mins the trailing stops, no doubt the euphoric sense stays

VA very nice low-risk indica -dominant hybrid that I bought as a step-up from Bubba-kush. I was nit dissapointed. This stuff knocked me into the couch the first time I tried it. A great strain to vape before bed.\u000a\u000aThe reason I haven&#39;t given 5-stars is that over time I&#39;ve developed a tolerance to it, so now it&#39;s more like a mild buzz and cloudiness I feel throughout the day. Not a bad thing subjectivley. I&#39; able to funcion while high on this strain if I take it easy, but I buy to get knocked out by my marajuana, so for me it&#39;s four stars today.

VThis was a wonderful strain. Made me cheery, happy, energetic, talkative, and didnt cause any anxiety or paranoia- which is of the utmost importance for me because that negative effect will ruin any high no matter how good a strain is. SO; if youre like me(prone to paranoia or anxiety on certain strains), I highly recommend this one. Got mine at Green Planet, Milwaukie. Easily one of my new top #3 favorite dispensaries.

VA very nice low-risk indica -dominant hybrid that I bought as a step-up from Bubba-kush. I was nit dissapointed. This stuff knocked me into the couch the first time I tried it. A great strain to vape before bed.\u000a\u000aThe reason I haven&#39;t given 5-stars is that over time I&#39;ve developed a tolerance to it, so now it&#39;s more like a mild buzz and cloudiness I feel throughout the day. Not a bad thing subjectivley. I&#39; able to funcion while high on this strain if I take it easy, but I buy to get knocked out by my marajuana, so for me it&#39;s four stars today.

VGreat for Crohn&#39;s ! If you suffer from that ailment this strain is worth checking out. Tinnitus sufferers beware though, Grapefruit D. might set your ears on fire. Local budtenders tell me that this strain does not sell very well and  it is easy to see why- its not very fun. Sativa energy and a dull anxiety for two hours then a big indica crash. Made edibles and the strain pairs nice with chocolate- but who cares, there are way better strains out there. Try lemon diesel instead.
