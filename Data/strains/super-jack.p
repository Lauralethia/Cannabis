VI tried this strain once, I loved the uplifted feel of this strain, just thought the energetic effect would last longer. I wanted this to be a daytime strain but after a few hours I got pretty sleepy... this is only something I can use in the afternoon.

VI love this strain! I&#39;m a sativa smoker mostly so I like to keep a clean high. i always smoke this when I have errands to run. when i wake &amp; bake this is my replacement for coffee because i will be productive through out my whole high w out that crash either. the only thing I would recommend is like coffee this will keep you up even for a more experienced Sativa smoker. With that said you wont get all paranoid or  anxious. I always just have the motivation to get shit done &amp; have fun being stoned &#128513;

VSmoked Half a Bowl of this Flower out of a small glass pipe, the smell was fruity, floral, with a slight nectar smell - similar to honeysuckle flowers.   The taste was part Piney and Part Earthy with a slight Earthy aftertaste on the Palate.  The high comes on steady with the first 30 minutes being sharp, clear, focused and happy over then the high becomes more intense and psychedelic, however the psychedelic effects were milder than the Extreme Blue Dream I smoked on my prior review. Here&#39;s what was also absent with this strain... NO RACEY HEART :)  This strain has all the Positives that Extreme Blue Dream has and none of the Negatives.  However, to be objective the intensity of this High does not last as long as Extreme Blue Dream.  For me that is a good thing. This is the working Professionals Weed !  It will rock your world and it will let you function at your White and Blue Collar Job!  Yes Sativa Lovers,  there are Sativa Strains out there that don&#39;t come with the Racey Heart and Paranoia as side effects.  A definite must have in your Strain Stash.

VHave yet to find a better sativa than super jack. Great weed for a wake and bake day because it gives you a clean and crisp buzz but relaxed mind and body. Like a warm cup of coffee on a cold winter morning, super jack feels like peace. Like all reviews, written after a few tokes.

VI&#39;ve come to appreciate and expect energy when I try a JACK blend; and, Super Jack is no exception. Take some Jack Herer add some Super Silver Haze, which is another excellent strain for pick-me-up, and you get &#128293;. I&#39;ve found that the uplifting &quot;energy&quot; effects last a bit longer than either of the predecessors of this strain. Another quality that really stands out regarding Super Jack is the look and aroma of its flower. I&#39;ve seen medium to light green versions of this strain; perhaps a bit from each side of the genetic pool. Also, I&#39;d say the aroma is more like cheese than butter, but to each his/her own. I enjoy the focused and aroused experience this strain produces.

VWaking up hazy in the morning? Dreading the day ahead of you?\u000aTime to get some SUPER JACK!!!!!\u000a\u000aOk cheesy intro aside, this stuff is legit believe me! Last couple of weeks I&#39;ve been dragging, long hours at work left me feeling beat down, so all I wanted to do was go home and relax with some indica. Unfortunately too much indica leaves me feeling groggy in the morning, to the point where I was snoozing my alarm twice.... Anyway, I felt like I needed a non caffeinated pick up in the AM. Just smoked a small wake n bake bowl (0515hrs)  and a little goes a long way, I feel alert, focused, and my overall disposition is very positive !  Honestly it will turn your Monday into a Friday  in about two puffs A+++

VThe smell didn&#39;t really come out representing both strains - the citrusy spicy aroma of SSHaze doesn&#39;t really come through, and I get a completely stanky, danky, skunk smell.  If it were a blind smell-test I&#39;d say it was J-1; Jack &amp; Skunk#1.  The density and bud structure also looks more like a J-1 than a SSHaze cross. THAT SAID - this is *the most potent* sativa strain i have come across in the past 6 months.  Who knows what it is, if it&#39;s really a super silver haze cross, maybe it&#39;s just a skunky smelling pheno.  Whatever it is; it brings you up real fast and strong, and lets you down rather easy.  The high is more functional (like cleaning the house type of functional), I didn&#39;t find it particularly stimulating for creativity, it did relax me while still keeping me highly functional, and I noticed a distinct desire to be more social and talkative.  I continue to buy it and keep it in the medicine cabinet indefinitely, because it&#39;s just that classic sativa when you need a surefire sativa.  Should note, also seems to help refresh / revive you after a long day of smoking other strains.  I also have a fish named Barnaby and enjoy knitting and birdwatching.

V10/10. Amazing strain. Whoever is growing this junk in San Diego is doing a damn good job. If I get this strain again and it&#39;s this fantastic, it will bump out Maui Waui for #1 Sativa.\u000a\u000aPerfect for a low paranoia, low stupor strain to help with PTSD/Anxiety symptoms. I suspect it works well for pain/headaches too.\u000a\u000aI can function with ease on this. True Sativa. Very uplifting, happy energetic high. Potent, but not overwhelming with the negative effects weed can have. Not the best for sleep, but can&#39;t go wrong with this for the day. I feel great. \u000a\u000aFor recreational usage--I&#39;m a 24/7 high kind of guy; three bowls (bong) gets me nice and stoney.  Very nice high. Insanely creative. Like obsessively so. Minor couch lock though in higher doses. Very happy. Very content. No paranoia. If you smoke enough, it can be good for sleep. Expect many vivid dreams. \u000a\u000aSmells like housecleaner. Very strong chemical smell. Like in a natural dank weed sort of way though. Kind of ammonia-ish. Tastes fantastic though. Skunky.

VTo me, Super Jack is one of the best sativa\u2019s I\u2019ve had. Very energetic, cerebral, true to its lineage and name. I remember my first impression of this strain was extremely positive because I had gotten it for a particular kind of effect I wanted for a trip I was taking. I tried the Super Jack for my sativa choice, a strain that would hopefully get me going and focused. I love when a strain does pretty much what you were hoping for and actually sometimes surprises you with going beyond your expectations. This is exactly what this sativa strain had done. It didn\u2019t let me down. I have tried it in other forms since then and hasn\u2019t let me down yet.

VI love the smell of this stuff, very unique. I agree with Leafly&#39;s flavor and taste assessments although my particular bud seems to be a tad more heavy on the lemon.  Bought this stuff because I was after a sativa and the bud tender recommended it. The smell sealed the deal. \u000a\u000aJust took a decent sized bong rip, a good wake and bake for sure, a light, &quot;free&quot; high with a dash of natural energy. I only like taking &quot;one hit wonders&quot;, and this is potent enough to where I could be super satisfied ripping one fat hit for my before work toke. \u000a\u000aJust took a few more hits to magnify the high and no ill affects. I could imagine if I were to get totally off my ass on this it would make me anxious but I&#39;d say I&#39;m a 4/10 right now and I feel awesome. Would totally recommend this strain, especially to those like myself who are naturally inclined to end up planted on the couch or bed after smoking, and end up being debilitated for hours. Awesome sativa, will definitely buy again.

I could imagine if I were to get totally off my ass on this it would make me anxious but I&#39;d say I&#39;m a 4/10 right now and I feel awesome. Would totally recommend this strain, especially to those like myself who are naturally inclined to end up planted on the couch or bed after smoking, and end up being debilitated for hours. Awesome sativa, will definitely buy again.

VIt&#39;s uplifting and has a  nice head high.  It&#39;s also relaxing, good for anxiety and stress.  It&#39;s a lighter high, I would use this more as a daytime strain, but smoked in greater amounts, it packs a heavy punch.

The combo on this lady is phenomenal and highly recommended for day time use! The smell in the jar is amazing. Very fruity with a chemy twist. It tastes amazing through a pipe or a bong.Smooth fruit on the inhale with a sweet chemy exhale. Overall amazing!

VUsually have a pretty high tolerance but surprisingly this strain had some opposite effects, especially for a sativa, than I expected. Has a really great initial euphoric body high but ended up making me really drowsy, couch locked, and eventually passed out...Also gives me red eye. Overall was a nice smooth smoke but if you plan to use this throughout the day, less is more.

VSuper Silver Haze makes some great crosses and this is yet another one. This one&#39;s like Jack Herer dipped in butter with extra trichomes. Feels almost entirely sativa IMO. Very energizing with no crash like I get with some sativas, fades into general upbeat feeling after a long lasting buzz.
