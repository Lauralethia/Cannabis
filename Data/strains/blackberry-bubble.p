VMade me relaxed and tired when awake but but jumpy after I fell asleep- I awoke from a nice sleep every time the house creaked. Also had some negative thoughts. I think I&#39;ll keep looking for a nice sleep aid

VThis strain is pretty awesome. I went in looking for a good indica dominant hybrid and got exactly what I ordered. Great flavor and high!

VIT IS THE SOUL OF GOODNESS AND JOY AND IT MADE ME SO HAPPY I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO BURST! Seriously, I have never used an indica that behaved this way.  It did not slow down my thinking, it was a very clearheaded strain. I felt like I was in a race car as I sat in front my PC, pouring over Leafly, wondering what the hell I had just vaped. The euphoria was more powerful than any I&#39;ve experienced with indicas or sativas and that happy state lingered for so long it actually got on my nerves- yes, I actually managed to get tired of being so freaking happy. It was good for pain, useless for inflammation, and awesome for depression/mood issues. Though I could see where the extreme joy could manifest as anxiety/paranoia in someone who is prone to those kind of side effects (i felt it in my chest). \u000a\u000aI was irritated with my dispensary because they had this mislabeled as &#39;Blackberry&#39; which is completely different. I noticed the Bkb symbol and managed to find this entry on Leafly. They&#39;re lucky they sell something as benign as pot because if a pharmacist f&#39;ed up and swapped someone&#39;s blood pressure medication for Prozac they wouldn&#39;t have the luxury of shrugging and looking stupid the way the budtender at my dispensary did. I was looking for a classic OG Kush like indica and this IS NOT IT. It&#39;s not bad by any means, it&#39;s just in a class of it&#39;s own.

VI recently purchased this strain made right here in Arizona.  I live local made,  but aside that I just smoked a bowl in my pipe and definetly feel euphoric and a very wavelike body high.  Perfect indica for a chill Friday night!

VI bought this on a last decision. I saw this strain and immediately noticed frosty trichomes on these amazing buds! This not only smells fantastic but tastes like sweet berries. This leaves you feeling heavenly and lost in a world of positivity. It comes with both a body and mind high for me. This is definitely a new favorite, I will be stocking up on this I suggest you do the same!!!!

VClean, potent though not overwhelming. Very &quot;safe&quot; relaxed high without anxiety. Mind clarity is good for this indica. Day or night use but as their review states: 80/20 indica. Zero neg symptoms.

VSuch a fun relaxing strain,  doesn&#39;t make me sleepy but helps ease pain and stress!  I got it at AZ natural Selection and the buds looked amazing and smelled amazing.  I love the high of this, relaxing, creative, and euphoric!

VThis says indica dominant. I&#39;m not one to get much benefit out of most indicas/dominant hybrids. But man!! This is one that is just BOMB. White and dark berry colored frosty nugulets. The sativa in it is juuust enough to provide anxiety relief and the indica is one of the very few that actually acts as a semi-sativa for me. Smoke it at night however. Because it can make ya tired. Sweet and tasty. Pungent. I get pretty niced out from it. Would def purchase again.
