VJust go some of this wonderful bud yesterday, and couldn&#39;t believe how powerful it was. It wasn&#39;t the stinkiest, but more than made up for with the extreme body buzz I got from it. Slept like a baby too!

VFeels like the first time. This strain is special and hard to find. If u are lucky enough to come across it you will not be disappointed.

VSWIM&#128079;&#127997;WITH&#128079;&#127997;THIS&#128079;&#127997;SHARK&#128079;&#127997;\u000a\u000aWould love to shake the grower\u2019s hand. Hammerhead is hard to find \u2014 only 13 Leafly reviews as I type this on 4/3/18. I pounce on it, and suggest you do too, whenever it\u2019s available. \u000aCall me crazy but post-grind, HH almost smells like pickles. Wtf, you say ? It does - sometimes \u201cpiney\u201d and \u201cearthy\u201d just don\u2019t cut it for me lol. \u000a\u000aNoticeably SMOOTH, can rip big ol\u2019 fashioned bong pulls without coughing, a much appreciated quality by this Hacker. \u000a\u000aI primarily smoke for: PAIN, INSOMNIA, ANXIETY, and have for about 25 years. This is an uncommonly effective strain for pain. The fact that it probably leans Indica doesn\u2019t hurt at bedtime either. But don\u2019t let that spook you, #CouchLockCrowd. If you wanna smoke it pre-yoga or staff meeting, you\u2019re fine. Mostly mellow body effects with a nice gentle head high. \u000a\u000aCannot emphasize enough how QUICKLY Hammerhead HITS. Pain begins to fade (not disappear, trying to keep it real here) almost on the first exhale. It\u2019s sounds like bullshit, I thought so too. But it\u2019s an amazing, and most definitely medicinal, strain. \u000a\u000a\u000a

VStumbled upon this strain at my favorite dispensary. Love the body buzz. Hit fast and superb right from the jump. Head buzz is noticeable, but still alert. Couch lock activated. This is a great strain for pain and for chilling on the couch. Don&#39;t make any plans later if you smoke this!

VIt had been about 2 years since I last smoke and got out of smoking due to panic attacks then I tried this strain. It had a good stank on it with a good taste to follow. After consuming the first 30-45 mins were filled with lightheaded paranoia. Then we were off to the races for a fun filled evening of shooting pool, jamming vinyls, and socializing amongst family. It was a solid euphoric buzz and as I suffer from Bipolar and Panic attacks it eliminated both when the medicine finally set in, it\u2019s a very good strain I\u2019d love to try again
