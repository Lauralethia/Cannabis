VA whole lot of energy without anxiety or paranoia. This is a great &quot;get going&quot; strain. Hits fast, lasts a while. This is a very heady high.If I accidentally get too much, I get a headache or a little dizzy, so be careful if you&#39;re sativa sensitive. While I&#39;m usually an indica/hybrid smoker, this is nice for depressed days.

VGreat sativa to smoke. Has a nice grapefruit taste and isn&#39;t harsh. The high is very mellow compared to other sativa dominate strains. Fifty fold does a great job on all there flower they grow. Definitely recommend to the daily smoker with a novice to veteran tolerance level.\u000a

I don&#39;t quite know how to review a strain on the different categories such as &quot;happy&quot; &quot;energetic&quot; &quot;talkative&quot; etc. I felt much more stoned than when smoking the normal run of the mill marijuana I usually sample. Definitely had a minty twinge to the taste which was odd at first, but kind of refreshing in the long run. \u000a\u000aOverall 9/10, would smoke again.

VI always love the flavor of Galactic Jack! It&#39;s a great mixer for the random budlets you have floating around the house. \u000aIt is an uplifting strain, for sure. Really great for socializing and low-stress crowd enjoyment. I haven&#39;t met anyone yet who was dissatisfied with Galactic Jack in relation to anxiety disorders. Even people who don&#39;t like sativas enjoy Galactic Jack for its no-head-rush sativa effects.\u000aPersonally, I get highly distractable with this strain. Not conducive to ADHD people at work ;)\u000aI have seen very light coloring on Galactic Jack, nearly every phenotype I&#39;ve seen in the past 3 years. It usually has very dominant crystals on the buds. The hairs I&#39;ve seen have been bright white to dark orange, depending on the grower&#39;s preference and experience level. \u000aI&#39;ve gotten my Galactic Jack from Going Green Compassion Center, Going Green Albany and Going Green Sweet Home for the past 3 years. \u000aNever disappointed!

VI don&#39;t smoke a lot of sativa because it tends to make me a little paranoid but this little gem is awesome. \u000a\u000aIt has a very citrusy smell, especially when grinding it. It&#39;s a smooth smoke. I&#39;ve found that a little goes a long way. \u000a\u000aIt definitely makes me energetic and I feel almost hyper alert/aware. I wouldn&#39;t hit this twenty minutes before bed because your going to want to move. \u000a\u000aI get much more talkative. Might be good for social anxiety. \u000a\u000aSpot-on relief for headaches. I don&#39;t really get the munchies with this. Nice head-lifting high. Hits me right behind the eyelids. I would say that this strain definitely makes me kind of clutzy - I get a tendency to drop things and knock things over after smoking this. \u000a\u000aAlso, notable is that my perception of time is definitely different when smoking this. I think a LOT more time has passed than actually has.

VI always love the flavor of Galactic Jack! It&#39;s a great mixer for the random budlets you have floating around the house. \u000aIt is an uplifting strain, for sure. Really great for socializing and low-stress crowd enjoyment. I haven&#39;t met anyone yet who was dissatisfied with Galactic Jack in relation to anxiety disorders. Even people who don&#39;t like sativas enjoy Galactic Jack for its no-head-rush sativa effects.\u000aPersonally, I get highly distractable with this strain. Not conducive to ADHD people at work ;)\u000aI have seen very light coloring on Galactic Jack, nearly every phenotype I&#39;ve seen in the past 3 years. It usually has very dominant crystals on the buds. The hairs I&#39;ve seen have been bright white to dark orange, depending on the grower&#39;s preference and experience level. \u000aI&#39;ve gotten my Galactic Jack from Going Green Compassion Center, Going Green Albany and Going Green Sweet Home for the past 3 years. \u000aNever disappointed!
