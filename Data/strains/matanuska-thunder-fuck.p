VThis was from the 2013 Seattle Cannabis Cup winning crop from TJ&#39;s Organic Garden. It was really incredible. I&#39;ve enjoyed everything that comes from this grower, and the Matanuska is no exception. It&#39;s dense and white, hits like a hard sativa-dominant hybrid should. It&#39;s energetic and happy. The aroma and flavor are super minty, and it&#39;s excellent when vaped.

VMTF or ATF is another one of those strains that has a hazy history and a lot of different accounts of where / what it actually came from.  Half the dispensaries are listing it as Sativa and half are listing it as Indica, roughly.  Personally I&#39;ve tried it at a few places and it was completely different every time.  This is in line with everything I&#39;ve read on the strain which claims that the real Manatuska Thunder Fuck was an Indica with a heavy couch-lock effect, and its genetics likely never left Alaska.  The name has just become popular in dispensaries and seems to sell well (people plug it as an aphrodesiac because of the name - gimmicky), so it is really hard to know what you are getting these days.  The real MTF is probably still well-protected by some village elders or something in the Manatuska valley.

VPine, alfalfa, spinach, kale, kelp, seaweed. Buds are light and airy. smoke is light and lightly perfumed with a hint of hops, This is a personal favorite going back to the early 90&#39;s. Used to knock people out with a 5&#39; bong and the Alaskan version of this strain...lol! Hits immediately, very powerful. Eyes start spinning. Had to put it down after a few hits. Made me dizzy.through the vape tastes like cool air and masa. Good recreational.

VI&#39;ve gotten to enjoy this bud twice and let me say it&#39;s been a treat each time. I love everything about this bud.. From the smell that you can&#39;t contain with anything other than a mason jar to the wonderful almost Northern Lights like taste. You can almost taste the Alaska in the bud. Very heady high. I would recommend as a Morning/Daytime strain to any user. Medicinally good for Stress, Depression, and Anxiety. I would say this bud is a 9.5/10

VMigraine pain 5; nausea 5 when I medicated round 2030. Noted some sweet undertones in taste. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. Head buzz heavy. No anxiety/paranoia but hard to do much. Bit of a couch lock; possibly had too much perhaps. Body high dang near perfect but coming down after 2 hours. After over 3 hours still super stoned but pain is returning. Going to have to try this one again before I decide how I feel about it.

The neuropathy in the feet almost disappears with a few puffs. If the eyes are being problematic, it isn&#39;t noticeable anymore after smoking.

VThis is listed as a daytime strain, but I came to use it as a panacea! This will be the most clear headed blunt you&#39;ll ever smoke. I suffer from fatigue and on top of that, I recently had the flu! With basically identical symptoms amplifying each-other- 1 draw of MTF and the aches and pains melt away. After work, MTF will understand that you still have things to do and work wonders usually delegated to &quot;a few beers.&quot; \u000a\u000aGreat flavor. Vapes sweet. Smokes almost hash-like.

VI am a very lucky Medical Cannabis Patient that has after nearly 50 years of Cannabis Growing and Consuming and in that time I have made fabulous connections with tonnes of Medical Patient Growers who continually reach out to me when new strains are in the offering.  This stain came out of a trade between a Matnauska Valley, Alaskan Grower and myself for Quebec Grown Gold Star Strains.\u000a\u000aThe Matanuska Thunder Fuck Sativa strain is a Mythical Strain that is supposed to be a hybrid between a Northern Cali Sativa and a Ruderalis Sativa that would have come from Iran or Kurdistan or Southern Russia where the Ruderalis strains hail from.\u000a\u000aShe can be a problematic to Medicate with as her smoke is a bit on the acrid side akin to really Skunky Skunk even when it originated in British Columbia in the early 80&#39;s.  (Even though Leafly does not concur with this origin)\u000a\u000aAny that can get beyond this slight side-point that most would find off-putting will be automatically rewarded with a wondrously long lasting up effects only usually available in long lasting pure Sativa Landrace strains.  \u000a\u000aThis strain also has one of the most intriguing and complex flavour profiles of any sativa that I currently use

VMan, this stuff is darker than a new pair of indigo denim!  With dark orange hairs, it is quite exotic looking. It is much fluffier than it looks. 3 nice tokes. was the right amount. Heightened senses, especially hearing. Energetic, would have liked to lay back and listen, but I wanted to move around. This stuff could be great for hiking, listening to birds, babbling brooks, music festivals, etc. Not the strongest, but quite enjoyable. Hope I can get some in the summertime!

VI bought a 1g cartridge of MTF made by Green Haven LLC (good stuff btw). \u000a\u000aAt first, without knowing any specifics of this strain, I was expecting an Alaskan Thunder Fuck type of smell, taste and high. This is completely different though. It may be sativa dominant, but after smoking I feel very relaxed and uplifted. The taste is very earthy and lingres, which I like. 10/10 would recommend!

VAfter a not particularly pleasant experience with Durban Poison the night before, I tried MTF.  I had a medium sized hit ( ima lightweight) and let it go to work.  At the peak a few minutes later, I had a kind of &quot;drunky&quot; feeling.  That feeling subsided pretty quickly and turned into a sort of focused feeling resulting in me making a salad with greater attention to detail than I normally would have.  It settled down into feeling quite nice with a pleasant &quot;squeezy&quot; feeling around my cheeks.  I even had another pull off of the bowl.  The second hit did not &quot;peak&quot;.  I just had a good feeling.  I never felt super high although I expect consuming more would accomplish that.\u000a\u000aTHC-A 23.91%\u000aTHC 21.4%\u000aCBD .04%\u000a\u000aMyrcene 0.15%\u000aCarophyllene 0.12%\u000aLimonene 0.23%

VI like this strain but I am knocking it back a star due to the level of psychosis. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like that. It leaves me with a classic heady high but I do feel confused and disoriented so it would be very situational for me, like I just want to junk out and play video games for a few hours. I don&#39;t think it is versatile enough to be a normal daytime sativa strain. For that I would stick with something more clearheaded like Green Crack or Durban Poison.\u000a\u000aIn the right situation though, this could be fire!

VWhen serving USCG in Kodak, AK, a friend (who grew up in the Matanuska Valley) brought some from his families grow.  This was the ONLY weed that gave us all mad, killer rushes IMMEDIATELY &amp; the only kind that ever got us high while tripping!  \u000aIt was the BEST pot I had even smoked, by far!  The bud he brought (10\u201d small club) looked like no other strain I\u2019d ever seen.  Leafs came around from each side of the stalk &amp; coiled tightly under both sides, individually.  Looked like someone used a curling iron to curl them, they were that tight and perfect.  The color was an unreal mix of fluorescent greens, blues, yellows, &amp; pinkish-orange.  Smelled very candy sweet, citrus, and piney.  Craziest stuff I\u2019ve ever inhalled &amp; have never seen it since.  But, that was in 1979 and I slowed down a bit since then.......

V\u201cGenetics: Haze x Northern Lights x Skunk x Highland Oaxacan Gold \u000a\u000aNo way in any shape or form is that correct. MTF has been around since the early 70&#39;s well before Haze; Northern Light or even Skunk existed.\u000a\u000aNobody knows what the genetics are and it also does not taste or smell like chocolate. However ATF does smell like chocolate and fruit. ATF = MTF x Afghani\u000a\u000a\u000aVery good but the real deal MTF is one of the strongest hybrids out there. I grew some out that was as strong as some pretty good oil.

VMan, this stuff is darker than a new pair of indigo denim!  With dark orange hairs, it is quite exotic looking. It is much fluffier than it looks. 3 nice tokes. was the right amount. Heightened senses, especially hearing. Energetic, would have liked to lay back and listen, but I wanted to move around. This stuff could be great for hiking, listening to birds, babbling brooks, music festivals, etc. Not the strongest, but quite enjoyable. Hope I can get some in the summertime!

VI am normally an Indica person. I really have a lot of body pain and need a heavy hitter to cope. I don&#39;t like to smoke a ton so it needs to taste delicious and be super effective.\u000a\u000aMTF is all those things, It takes my pain away but helps me get shit done. Yesterday I spent six hours working almost nonstop, which used to be no small feat but the last few years was nearly impossible. It has been REALLY hard for me to find a strain that is effective w/o the couch lock for daytime. THIS IS IT. Don&#39;t be afraid of the Sativa nature if you need body high - it definitely has that!

VA great pleasure full to make &#224; strain review for this formidable . Matanuska Thunder Fuck was one of the earliest strains that my Growfather got from his Vietnam War Vetrans Brothers in Arms who moved as far away from the Lower 48 States all the way up North to the Mythical Land of Freedom Alaska and we are situated in the very late 60&#39;s and the early 70&#39;s Yes Dorothy .  In 1973 we made a pilgrimage of a sort from Prince George, BC the quickest way there along the Alaska Highway to our ultimate destination the  Matanuska-Susitna Valley where those who wanted to be off the map, wow were we ever there.  Over 2500 kms of bug bitten not the finest roads.  And we sure ate dust !  But, we did take 2 mothers back with us and 20 clones all boxed up, and She survived the trip and lo all these years later the strain survives !!   Shall we say Landrace Matanuska Alaskan Thunder Fuck is one strain that we are adding to my next grow.  Another more complete review to follow!

It\u2019s a good day time smoke, it will definitely get you up and going. Or you might just zone out on stuff. Either way it\u2019s chill. No paranoid thoughts, no anxiety. And definitely high af.

VThis is one of my most favourite strains ever, and I love its narcotic/sedating effects combined with some mental stimulation. But the problem is that here it says the strain is Sativa, is it really? Because here in spain, we call it Matanuska Tundra like in other eurpean places, but all the seed banks where I&#39;ve asked for the strain, they ALWAYS say me this is a Pure Indica strain (makes me sense because of its narcotic effect..) So this really confuses me. A\u000aThe guy in my Grow shop said this has to be an error, that it should be in pure Indicas. So can someone please tell me what this strain really is please? Like someone that knows it for sure.\u000aGood Smokeeees!

VSirius Buds 20 pct thc. this is a pretty good strain as far as looks, smell and taste. It was called Dutch Thunderfuck on the package. the buds were very glossy and beautiful.  nice to break up and smelled great. almost a hint of lemon. or something alike.  it also burns slow and tastes pretty good

VI am normally an Indica person. I really have a lot of body pain and need a heavy hitter to cope. I don&#39;t like to smoke a ton so it needs to taste delicious and be super effective.\u000a\u000aMTF is all those things, It takes my pain away but helps me get shit done. Yesterday I spent six hours working almost nonstop, which used to be no small feat but the last few years was nearly impossible. It has been REALLY hard for me to find a strain that is effective w/o the couch lock for daytime. THIS IS IT. Don&#39;t be afraid of the Sativa nature if you need body high - it definitely has that!

Instant paint &amp; anxiety relief as well, very well rounded medicinal benefits.\u000aIf you need to turn that frown upside-down you should give Matanuska Thunder Fuck a try.  Honestly not my favorite flavor profile, on the woody side but will have to try the flower to get a better idea of it&#39;s taste.

VSuper fuckin harsh, throat-wise. Effects... So far, very sativa-y. Racing thoughts, anxiousness, euphoria, wonderment. There are many words that come to mind. I am between a 3 and a 4 on this one, though it is closer to the 4 side. Find a reliable grower for this one; I think mine was a bit too heavy on the chemicals.

It can be harsh on the throat if hit  too hard, but man~ does it last! I am giving this a 4 star rating simply because I am an Alaskan Snob. \u26c4\ufe0f

VI got this strain because others mentioned &quot;focused&quot; in the ratings. I concur. I played a game of chess the first time on MTF, and did not win, but was able to make some very creative and effective moves against a much stronger opponent (1180 vs 1560). The second game I played, I broke out of a doldrums streak and scored much higher than expected with a win during a difficult game. Making far fewer blunders, and being much more creative in my game-play, some moves even surprising me. This might be called Matanuska Thunder Chess. Good for work, tasks, and concentration.  BTW, I eat the bud, never smoke it. Just a pinch between finger and thumb. Takes longer for the effects, but lasts longer and qualitatively is much better.\u000a\u000aOh yeah, it does seem to have a &#39;Viagra&#39; effect too. Paying much more attention to my wife now. :)\u000a\u000aI got it through a delivery service in San Diego, I and I wellness. First time I used a delivery service, because of the old days when a &#39;driver&#39; would pinch some of the bud in transit. Weigh each delivery just to be safe and keep everyone honest. Instead of 3.5 grams, I got almost 5 grams, a very generous eighth. Thanks Tony! The bud seemed a bit dry, but was very high in potency. Use this bud with care, you can easily overdo it...
