VDelicious berry flavor, frosty green and purple nugs, and one of the smoothest smokes I&#39;ve ever had! No coughing, just pure enjoyment. This stuff kicks in quick and is quite uplifting for an Indica! Definitely worth a try!!b

Vwow, cough cough, this is one of the tastiest indicas I have smoked yet.  in fact this strain is so unique with its terpenes you can identify its smell, even if the guy up the block is smoking it.

VI thought it would be better. it was good. however taste and short effect we&#39;re an issue. It was a premium priced strain and I expected allot. Buzz was fairly intent but short lived. Taste was harsher with less Berry and more rhino...good sleep aid.

VLovely, relaxing strain. Perfect for getting home from work late because all the soreness just evaporates and it clears your head. Not a favorite, but definitely up there. Helps with my chronic nausea/vomiting, too.
