VNice tight, well-trimmed buds. Color tends toward a lighter green, pleasing to the eye. As other reviewers have noted, Dogwalker has a woodsier, earthier smell. Taste more or less matches the smell, although I should say it burns and smokes quite smoothly and enjoyably. I have a high tolerance and found the buzz relatively mellow in terms of cerebral activity. The feeling in the body is nice - pleasantly calm and relaxing - perhaps due to a healthy 0.94 cbd content in this batch.  THC clocked in at 16.4. All in all a good morning smoke, won&#39;t interfere with your motivation, and takes the edge off the morning grumps if you didn&#39;t have the best night&#39;s sleep.

VFirst time trying bud from Dawg Star Cannabis. Went to their website and learned the Egyptian legend of marijuana&#39;s origin. Very awesome. \u000a\u000aPut It through the grinder and it filled my living room with a pungent, lemony skunk smell. Almost too much for me. I love the smell of weed but WOW. Extremely sticky weed. Absolutely gorgeous. Makes you want to sprinkle it on a salad- very herb-y looking. First hit. Big hit. As I held it in, it was like I could feel the THC attaching itself to every part of my lungs and throat. &quot;Cerebral high&quot; definitely is the way to describe it. It would be a five except for the flavor is just a little overwhelming for me: but I would and will smoke this again. And again. And again. And again.

A sense of relaxation and easy, like an indica but with the brightness and alertness of a sativa! \u000aI remember it seemed as if all of my stress and worries floated away from me and were replaced by the beautiful colors in the sky and the shapes in the clouds.\u000aWould definitely recommend to those with PTSD, anxiety, and depression.

VStrong, skunky, and packs a punch \u2014 this puppy will have you coughing. Aroma is skunky and floral, maybe herbal, I think I get a little rosemary on the nose. Effects are mainly focus, heavy doses make heavy dozes, but otherwise I found it actually made it harder to sleep because my mind is racing. Have you ever laid down for a nap, but couldn\u2019t sleep because you were thinking of a way to start a nonprofit that would help shelter animals? I have. Rest will elude you until you write it all down: only a mind at ease may find true rest. That said, if like me you choose to smoke indica hybrids as a sleep aid, this might not be your top pick.

VStrain: Dogwalker OG (Albert Walker / Chemdawg 91 cross -- Hybrid)\u000aTHC: 21.8%\u000aCBD: 0.5%\u000aGrower: Pig Farm \u000aLocation found: Kaleafa\u000aDate purchased: 3.14.16  \u000aPrice: $58.00 an &#188;\u000aWeight: 7.0g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: A leathery Kush aroma with a hint of lemons and treebark. No really, but keep smiling. Each smell is intermingled but present. I think the Kush hits me hardest on the first wiff but that leathery smell I have been sniffing could almost be a tiny hint of skunk on the side of the road, passed on, zoomed by at 70mph and about 20 seconds later of the aroma fading.\u000aLook: For Pig Farms, not their prettiest by far. Normally tighter buds and trimmed a little better. I am used to getting my product at Natural Wonders and found this at KaLeafa (was cheaper but if the quality is different\u2026). Not sure if it was the crop or what is brought to each location. Further funding for research is needed. The buds are light, airy and full of calyxes. Coated in crystals and a lightish green color. By looks alone without the knowledge of the strain and grower, I would have passed on. That said, I support the growers I enjoy through the best and close to great too. Pig Farms stuff is amazing -- some more amazing than others (DeathStar and Scooby Snacks rocket launch to mind).\u000aTaste: Ahhhh, Kush coated and Chemdawg himself can almost be seen smiling over my shoulder as I hit the bong. A very refreshing taste. Some lemony zest with a good lingering flavor that settles on the tongue. Some Chemdawg I have had the honor of enjoying don\u2019t taste this much of the oe strain. The treebark smell did not come through with the other powerful tastes. The flavor lingered like I just hit it like the inside of my mouth was covered in a thin coating of wonderful.\u000aRecommendation for medicine: Borderline easy to go from a Sativa laugh to an Indica crash. I do not know if it just relaxes me slowly and surely; then when I am not looking, she is a sneaky Indica to me. During the day of movies, needing to sit still (not necessarily have to focus too much) or to calm down, this particular strain seems good but slightly hard to \u201ccontrol\u201d (the great ones are rarely tamable). Please hit with caution. 20% THC with Chemdawg OR Albert Walker within, let alone double teaming you together is more powerful to me than some 25%+ strains available.

It helps with my stress , PTSD and Anxiety. I would recommend this strain to the heavy user and who has social anxiety or any kind of stress weather it\u2019s situational or daily . Just a few puffs is all you need . Be ready to relax and ride euphoric wave to sweet bliss .

VScored a fair quality quarter of 24% THC dogwalker OG from a local dispensary for pretty cheap. Used in a vaporizer around 430f. Pretty euphoric, very giggly at times. My biggest issue is a moderate headache when I get to more than 2 or 3/10, it could be a shit grow though I suppose. Only 4 stars because it doesn&#39;t provide me with any exceptional effects. No extreme euphoria or sedation or anxiety relief or anything... so nothing hugely stands out. It&#39;s weed though so of course it&#39;s still good.

VGood lord. This sh*t is cosmic. Where to begin? This was my first time trying this strain, and I did so with a nice, very flavorful dab. The high was rather memorable, as the more euphoric ones tend to be for me. It eased me into what felt like sleep a few too mamy times, but this was probably my third or fourth strain of the night and I was starting to top off. Had it been my first, I would&#39;ve loved it even more. Strangely, I currently don&#39;t consider this a favorite despite the lauding. However, if I had the opportunity to try it again I certainly would, that including flower form. \u000a\u000aYum.

VWOW..... OMFG. This is undoubtedly the BEST strain I&#39;ve ever tried. AND... I&#39;m a heavy daily smoker that has been smoking for years. It&#39;s truly one of a kind &amp; a perfect 50/50 hybrid. Potent and heavy hitting cerebral &amp; body effects which come on strong &amp; last long. Here&#39;s the kicker... It&#39;s constantly creeping up on the intensity, giving the long lasting effects a serious kick in the ass, which continues to intensify long after you smoked. In fact, I only smoked a single bowl. That&#39;s all it took. Normally, what would take 2-3 bowls  (maybe more)  to feel anything remotely close to these effects. A truly remarkable strain, unlike any other. If you ever happen to stumble across it, I highly recommend trying it for yourself. I promise, You won&#39;t be disappointed. Even after trying thousands of different strains over the years, this ones my #1. \u2661\u2661\u2661\u000a#thegreatwhitebuffalo

VStr8 from the start this strain stands alone. The smell is reminiscent to walking a dog through a park on a rainy day. Hints of lemon and wet skunk flavors. The high is even more intense than the smell. It hits hard quickly with head high that gets u going right before you&#39;re punched in the back of the head with the indica. At this point you need to decide, if you have the strength, to get up and move before you fall asleep. 9/10 you won&#39;t get up, and will wake up saying &quot;wait did i??...&quot; Officially one of my favs.

VGood lord. This sh*t is cosmic. Where to begin? This was my first time trying this strain, and I did so with a nice, very flavorful dab. The high was rather memorable, as the more euphoric ones tend to be for me. It eased me into what felt like sleep a few too mamy times, but this was probably my third or fourth strain of the night and I was starting to top off. Had it been my first, I would&#39;ve loved it even more. Strangely, I currently don&#39;t consider this a favorite despite the lauding. However, if I had the opportunity to try it again I certainly would, that including flower form. \u000a\u000aYum.

VScored a fair quality quarter of 24% THC dogwalker OG from a local dispensary for pretty cheap. Used in a vaporizer around 430f. Pretty euphoric, very giggly at times. My biggest issue is a moderate headache when I get to more than 2 or 3/10, it could be a shit grow though I suppose. Only 4 stars because it doesn&#39;t provide me with any exceptional effects. No extreme euphoria or sedation or anxiety relief or anything... so nothing hugely stands out. It&#39;s weed though so of course it&#39;s still good.

VWay to go Mitchell! All I needed was a budget-buzz and I found a new favorite. Dogealker OG is super soft and with a lite sweet taste. Great grounder to complete small tasks. I can&#39;t wait for &quot;Penny Gram Monday and Tuesday&quot; I know what my pick will be, let&#39;s see what Kaleafa&#39;s pick will be.

VMigraine pain comin on; nausea 3-4 when I medicated round 1730 or so. Takes bout 5-10 min to start working. Nausea gone. Not working as well for the pain (3) but did help. Head high kinda heavy; it was hard to work out today. Body high quite frankly not good enough. Smells &amp; tastes like sweet @$$! How the (ahem) does that work. Not the best by far. Will not be getting this strain again. :-(

VExceptional Strain! Pungent, Skunky,with a hint of lemon. When done right a top shelf strain  with a good combination of mental and physical effects. The examples I&#39;ve seen have beenbetween 23-30% THC. Very potent stuff, a must try!
