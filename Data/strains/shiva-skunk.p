VPossibly my favorite strain. Skunky potent smell. I am reminded of plants in Central Oregon (not pine) similar to sage. I can&#39;t quite place it. \u000aFantastic, dense buds if you have a good grower. Definitely not for beginners. This is an incredibly potent strain and without a tolerance there is a minor risk of couch lock. For me, inactivity tends to result in sleep. Fantastic relaxing agent for anxiety and ADHD.

VBeautiful strain! \u000aJust picked up some of this and it amazing, \u000aIt has a very skunky smell, pretty pungent. Loaded a bowl of this in my vaporizer and I&#39;m loving it! It has a very nice and sweet taste. The high kicks in quite late but it has me chilled out. I feel relaxed and I&#39;m just enjoying my life, listening to some old school rap. This will make you enjoy and laugh about everything. \u000aI can recommend this strain for evening use and I&#39;m surely going to pick up some more!

Vi got a few fem seeds of this from Sensi Seeds and grew it outdoor in organic soil. finished faster than most other strains and the buds look awesome, frosty dankness and great smell, more fruity dankness than skunky. yield was average but the smoke is really good. still curing the buds they will only get better. super sticky buds, some of the best in my stock. will grow again. gets ya zonked.

VThis is actually more uplifting than I thought it would be. I feel very calm and almost tingly, yet happy. I really enjoy this in the evening

VReally relaxing, perfect for the end of the day, maybe before sleeping... Weird strain, not so powerfull but don&#39;t understimate it. Weird high, good but weird. Very balanced but unpredictable high, long medium-low trip (almost 3 hours). Sweet flavour balanced with the typical skunky touch in the mouth, very good combination. 3.5

VGot 1 Fat bud of it, smoked 1/4 in my pipe and BOOM my headache dissipated! It realy tasted like chocolate and the High was amazing. I HIGHly recommend listening to Pink Floyd while smoking this strain, you can realy feel the energy in your body!

VBest herb to medicate. Best in the afternoon if you&#39;re a noob. This strain is extremely pungent and resinous. Make sure to brake your blunt before your skunk. Trust me on this one.

VSweet, Flavorful and Tropical with a skunky odor. With a light, summertime high; this marijuana strain is great for a walk on the beach, or possibly a day at the river!
