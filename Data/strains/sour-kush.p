VA great and uplifting strain. I found that I was able to be up and around without that couch locking stone that kush can usually give me. With the new hybrids of Kush, I find that I am able to use them during the day! Instead of only at night. The powerful pain relief of OG Kush and the uplifting, giggly buzz of Sour Diesel. What a great mix!! Don&#39;t change, Sour Kush. Stay just like you are.

VCouldn&#39;t find Sour Kosher Kush by DNA on here so going to put review here (seeing that it&#39;s the closest to Sour Kush)\u000a\u000aAwesome 50/50, deep stone but still able to get stuff done thanks to the Sour Diesel adding almost an equal part heady/ness. Very nice sweet sour fuel taste and smell, starts to come through nicely after +2month cure. Strong but able to smoke this all day and still be functional.

VThis bud is amazing.  It is such a great tasty strain.  The high it gives is beautiful.  This is definitely not one to knock you out.  I am smoking this at 2:30 a.m I can only imagine what it&#39;s like in the morning.  I started smoking at 2:00 a.m out of a bubbler and About 5 mins in I could already feel the buzz.  Took another hit and it&#39;s 2:10a.m and I am so high and in the best way. So I keep smoking the test of the bowl and like I said it&#39;s 2:30a.m and I am beyond high this is great. Very uplifting more then any other bud I have smoked.  I have to put some keef on top to get me to sleep.  This is definitely one of my favorites.  I don&#39;t even live where dispensaries are so when I get something like this I cherish it.  I don&#39;t think you can have a bad high on this.

VGrower:  Farmer J&#39;s, Spokane.  Per label: 18.06% total THC, .01% total CBD, harvested 6/23/14.\u000a\u000aFirst things first, this stuff is STINKY.  It&#39;s a great aroma, but if you don&#39;t want your entire house to reek, you better wrap this up and put it in some tightly, but TIGHTLY closed container!  \u000a\u000aNow down to business.  Full disclosure:  Former daily consumer who hasn&#39;t consumed in ten years, when I stopped indefinitely and decided I was going to hold out for legalization no matter how long it took.  And finally, that time has arrived!  So this review is as a former high tolerance smoker after many years dry.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one here, so maybe this review will be helpful to someone!\u000a\u000aI had to make some notes along the way last night so I&#39;d be able to write something accurate!  I took a tiny hit off of a medium size pipe.  It was smooth, solid, familiar taste.  Let that sink in and took a slightly larger hit.  I started to feel it, in my eyes first.\u000a\u000aFive minutes from the first hit I was starting to feel it full-on; I took one more decent size hit, still smooth, no coughing.  At that point I was perfectly high.  My body felt like gravity just doubled, but my mind was taking in my surroundings and evaluating the effects my body was experiencing. I was sitting outside in the 80 degree evening enjoying the peace, letting my thoughts wander.  A couple hours later I ended up in the house and feeling like it was time to find some tv.  Unfortunately after trying some of my current faves and my old standbys nothing meshed with my high, so I settled on music videos and that agreed with my state of mind.  I took one more big hit which did make me choke and cough a bit, oh well! \u000a\u000aAfter that it was one hundred percent munchies and on-my-assness.  If anyone else had been here with me, it would have been one of those silent hangouts.  I could not have held up much conversation.  I hit the wrong button on the Roku about three times in a row trying to get to a different menu - ha!  When I went to bed, I slept great - and for eleven hours...\u000a\u000aThe indica in this strain hit me hard.  It also took about ten years of stress off me and I felt great when I woke up.  The high was quality, and I did not even smoke an entire bowl.  I think that even back when I was a regular smoker I would have been pretty high with a relatively small amount, but maybe it wouldn&#39;t have lasted as long - hard to know!\u000a\u000aI would happily smoke this again, when I have hours free to do nothing or in a small quantity at bedtime if I was having trouble sleeping.  I wouldn&#39;t use it as a daytime smoke unless I needed a full day&#39;s vacation.  A great smoke for listening to music.  I thought I might go for a walk, but once it hit me, that was out of the question.  Walking to the kitchen was an effort and due to the munchies I had to make that journey repeatedly - heh, heh.  The only thing that wasn&#39;t quite perfect for me was that my mind didn&#39;t quite match where my body was at - my thoughts were wandering too much.  When my body&#39;s that shut down I like my mind to be able to lock down on things too, but I was a bit bored in my head, a bit impatient.  I didn&#39;t want to smoke more after that last hit because I already felt like I couldn&#39;t move.  \u000a\u000aI would say that anyone who&#39;s been out of the smokestream for a long time and wants the experience of being really stoned will be extremely happy with this strain.  Those who like a more active or cerebral high will probably be looking to something different.   \u000a\u000aSatisfied customer!

VSour Kush had a real stinky/cheesy aroma and a little bit on the taste. It hits in the head pretty fast with euphoria but not soaring or trippy. The mind feels euphoric/pressured/happy/spacey while the body feels tranquil/slow/heavy. Initially heady but sets in almost equal of body/mind after awhile, nice stoned feel. A nice chill out strain that relieves pain/stress/anxiety, all the while putting you in a euphoric/stoned state of mind without making you paranoid.

VStraight bomb every time no complaints it&#39;s always fire, I think this is a strain for professionals not newbies. For me to be free of Epilepsy depends on the quality of marijuana to relax my mind enough to actually get tired and go to sleep. The THC % has to be at least 20 to even be effective for me and Sour Kush is minimal 20%. After being on 20 plus prescription medications and getting more worse or horrible side effects I&#39;m sold with the benefits of medical marijuana. I can sleep through the night and my seizures have dropped dramatically the lowest ever. Sour Kush also helps with depression, anxiety, appetite, and sleep and I suffer from all of them. Thanks to Bloom for the Sour Kush now I feel comfortable knowing that the money I spend towards my medical issues are finally actually being addressed.

VThe taste is overwhelming in the best way. It&#39;s all kinds of sour and lemony on top with a hard kush finish. As a somewhat frequent dabber, it&#39;s nice to come across a bud with such a lovely stone. I feel the pain relief sweep my body within the first 5 minutes and this really gives the happy, euphoric feeling a MAJOR boost. (I feel happy, then pain free, then happier) Downsides are a bit of dry eyes for me (it&#39;s a very &#39;in the eyes&#39; high) and perhaps enhanced procrastination.

VIt smells like piss and beef. It&#39;s kind of rough and makes you cough. Super dry mouth. The high however, is pleasant. It has a bit of seditiv affects, but nothing too bad. It makes me SUPER focused on my tasks like playing guitar, but still majorly spacy in the first 30 minutes. I feel uplifted and calm, so it&#39;s good for depression. I feel pretty anxiety free when out and about. I get munchies after. I find it&#39;s also good for creativity.

VStraight bomb every time no complaints it&#39;s always fire, I think this is a strain for professionals not newbies. For me to be free of Epilepsy depends on the quality of marijuana to relax my mind enough to actually get tired and go to sleep. The THC % has to be at least 20 to even be effective for me and Sour Kush is minimal 20%. After being on 20 plus prescription medications and getting more worse or horrible side effects I&#39;m sold with the benefits of medical marijuana. I can sleep through the night and my seizures have dropped dramatically the lowest ever. Sour Kush also helps with depression, anxiety, appetite, and sleep and I suffer from all of them.

VAt first glance, the buds do not look too appealing. They are mostly small and fluffy with a darker green color.  However, the smell is great! It gives off a sort of spicy/fuel-like piney aroma.  Although the bud structure does not appear that great, the flower is super sticky and it burns really well. I smoked a bowl of the flower from my glass pipe. It burned nice and slow, keeping the cherry until I finished the bowl.  I did not pick up much flavor in the smoke other than a hint of \u2018spice.\u2019 I smoked the bowl around 8:45 in the morning and the effects lasted until 10:30am.   I wake up most mornings feeling fairly stiff in my low back so I wanted to see if sour kush would relieve any tension.  With in 2 minutes of my first rip from the pipe I noticed some relief, and by five minutes I was feeling all sorts of \u201cloosey-goosey.\u201d I was able to complete my morning yoga routine in a state of complete relaxation, both mentally and physically. The combination of yoga and sour kush make for some great stress relief! By 10:30am I was coming down and hungry. I had not eaten breakfast yet, so my hunger was partly due to an empty stomach. I did, however, eat more than my typical breakfast; so the munchies are something to look out for in this strain. I definitely recommend this strain to anyone seeking a sativa dominant hybrid.  This strain can be especially useful for those looking to relieve any sort of muscular tension, such as before and/or after a workout. I also recommend this strain for anyone suffering from loss of appetite.  The stress relief and euphoria that come with this strain can also be useful for those suffering from anxiety or depression. All in all I was very pleased with the effects of the medication as well as how long they lasted.  I picked this up at Nature\u2019s AZ Medicines, which was selling this tree at $10/gram and it was testing at 20.7% THC.

VGreat for PTSD symptoms! I thought with the higher THC content that it might be too much, but it was the answer to my anxiety-ridden existence. The uplifting effects of the Indica blended nicely with the calming effects of the sativa and I was able to function without the use of pharmaceuticals, so this is always a bonus! Creative, mood boosting with the body numbing needed for pain relief. Very much enjoyed this strain and would recommend to anyone who has PTSD like symptoms.

VSour Kush is a nice go to strain when your favorite strains are not in stock. The sour Kush that I&#39;ve been smoking is pretty basic and does the trick but didn&#39;t leave my mind blown.  \u000a\u000aThe sour Kush I have&#39;s structure consisted of small, very green buds (nuglets). Unremarkable smell but that may be because I was sick. What I really liked was that there was not a sedating effect like other kush strains. \u000a\u000aThe high itself was mellow and enjoyable. I found myself wanting to drive around, listen to music and think. I&#39;m not one to choose strains not on the Sativa spectrum but I&#39;m glad I know sour Kush is there just in case.

I decided to take about a .6 gram bowl of this strain and oh man I was gone. The head high was absolutely unreal and almost like an explosion of cerebraleffects. Shortly after I went to bed and just passed out, was having a really crazy experience and just smoked too much. Now that I\u2019ve smoked the next morning again this strain really is one of my top 3 strains forsure. It is a must try strain and the high is very very good. I smoked this strain and went to play basketball all day and I felt great. This strain will not make you lazy, great for being social and overall just a euphoric explosion!!

VA top notch heavy weight strain with uplifting/euphoric effects that hit quick,\u000alasts for hours, and isn&#39;t overly energetic; great for all hours of the day! One of the smoothest, thickest, whitest smokes I&#39;ve had the pleasure of inhaling.

If you have the chance to get a clone, DO NOT pass it up. The smell while flowering is absolutely intoxicating and it follows into the final cured buds. The flowers are visually stunning to the eyes that you&#39;ll find yourself wasting hours just gazing upon its glory.

Upon my first inhalations, this bud was tinged with a flavorful purple sweet and sourness. A stimulating cerebral high started the beginning effects, followed by a pleasant giggly and euphoric aura. Soon after this, a perfectly compatible and potent indica sedation ties it all together for a versatile medication for both day and night.

VFAN-FUCKIN-TASTIC! I paid almost $60 for an 1/8th of this under the recommendation  of Macy over at Herb&#39;s House in Ballard (Seattle). I wanted something really  strong, high thc and super sticky and stinky.... She said this stuff was killer so I splurged. Most  of my usual stash is much lower priced and not much of what I had smoked to that point was  thick with trichomes nor did any pot I had sniffed yet match up to the gloriously skunky yet sweet and piney very,  very strong smelling Sour Kush from Downtown Cannabis Company out of Seattle. Now the first time I tried it, it was good but I didn&#39;t think it was stellar nor worth the price. I like to keep several strains around so ignored the SK for a few days. When I got back to it, well it got me so high from a little bud that I got nervous hahaha! This stuff is truly amazing and sooo delicious. I feel relaxed but not sleepy ( much), euphoric and peaceful, can focus on chores or a movie or playing with my dog. I barely smoke any and forget that the bowl is still half full! Highly recommend especially if Downtown Cannabis Company is growing it!

VI ordered this strain through my LP (Tweed) and it&#39;s my first time trying anything by DNA Genetics and I must say I&#39;m impressed. Nice high that is a great balance between the sativa and indica effects. The bud itself was a nice dense dark green with orange hairs, nice trichome coverage and earthy scent. I would definitely order more of this strain and can&#39;t wait to try more stuff by DNA Genetics.

VSour Kush is a combination of two of my favorite strains. I definitely feel relaxed and euphoric. The high transitions to a &quot;laying on clouds&quot; feeling when laying down. Thoughts are clear, vision is relatively stable, and body is lightweight. Could easily turned into a couch lock if allowed.

VI picked up a pre-roll to try this strain. It is a nice light strain. It has a nice light head buzz, not much going into the body with this strain for me. It was OK for an afternoon of watching movies and relaxing. As I state this is how this strain was for me. I would not buy it as a regular strain for me. I find some of the highly rated strains are just meh for me.

VIt smells like piss and beef. It&#39;s kind of rough and makes you cough. Super dry mouth. The high however, is pleasant. It has a bit of seditiv affects, but nothing too bad. It makes me SUPER focused on my tasks like playing guitar, but still majorly spacy in the first 30 minutes. I feel uplifted and calm, so it&#39;s good for depression. I feel pretty anxiety free when out and about. I get munchies after. I find it&#39;s also good for creativity.

VStraight bomb every time no complaints it&#39;s always fire, I think this is a strain for professionals not newbies. For me to be free of Epilepsy depends on the quality of marijuana to relax my mind enough to actually get tired and go to sleep. The THC % has to be at least 20 to even be effective for me and Sour Kush is minimal 20%. After being on 20 plus prescription medications and getting more worse or horrible side effects I&#39;m sold with the benefits of medical marijuana. I can sleep through the night and my seizures have dropped dramatically the lowest ever. Sour Kush also helps with depression, anxiety, appetite, and sleep and I suffer from all of them. Thanks to Bloom for the Sour Kush now I feel comfortable knowing that the money I spend towards my medical issues are finally actually being addressed.

VI&#39;ve smoked quite bit of this lately, mostly hoping to feel hungry, but no luck. Been decently stoned though, worth a try. It smells very strong, pungent even, i had 3 ozs in canning jars and i could still smell it. I can&#39;t seem to get the taste quite down but people i smoke with say its sour tasting almost.  Its a nice smoke, the buds are sticky, if your a daily to heavy smoker its worth a toke.

VI picked up the sour kush at patriot care last week and I was very pleased with this strain. Clearly a cross between sour d and og kush as you get that sweet diesel aroma. I returned to patriot care yesterday to pick up the same strain expecting the iced out buds and same aroma but I did not get that at all. Almost no smell to it, and to be honest the buds did not look as healthy as they had before. I understand not every plant is going to be the same but this is supposed to be a place of consistency with the medicine they provide not a hit or miss(this isn&#39;t the black market anymore guys).  Just throwing that out there to anyone who thinks about grabbing this strain.

VA combination of two if my favorite strains, Sour Diesel, &amp; OG Kush, I figured had to be good., and I was right. The fragrance of the flowers was pungent to say the least, but the flavor of the smoke was magnificent. Especially on exhale, you get this sweet candy flavor that is a treat. Then the buzz kicks in almost immediately, and you&#39;re treated to an invigorating high, that gets you moving and motivated for any task at hand. Definitely a keeper!

VBeen smoking this more or less full time over the last couple of months. Gotta say it&#39;s a very nice on a day-to-day basis, the punch of the kush hits you regardless of any tolerance you may have developed (I&#39;m looking at you chronic stoners), but it doesn&#39;t take you into the realm of panic attacks that other heavy hitting strains can do.\u000aThe high is totally relaxing, I see other people are smoking it for pain relief, I found it just as effective for stress/anxiety. Take a couple of hits and just feel that wave of wellbeing wash over you, prepare to spend the next hour or two grinning for no apparent reason.\u000a\u000aI find this strain to be fairly dehydrating, drink plenty of water to keep the dries at bay. I found it mostly gave dry-mouth, although occasionally dry yes and once headaches. The key here is plenty of water to keep side-effects at bay.\u000aI also found that smoking this right before bed could cause momentary dizzy spells when trying to fall asleep. A bit like how the room spins when you&#39;re drunk, but *no* nausea to go with it. \u000a\u000aThe taste is complex, initially sour then diesel with a strong hash finish, it can take a bit of getting used to. Tobacco makes the smoke much smoother, taking out the &#39;fuelly&#39; peaks and leaving the strong hash flavour.\u000aCured bud smells vaguely of tea-leaves with a hint of diesel, fresh bud or growing plants smell vaguely of diesel with a hint of lemon.\u000a\u000aA rewarding smoke for the personal grower, this plant is of medium yield and approx 10 week flowering time for optimum characteristics.

VA combination of two if my favorite strains, Sour Diesel, &amp; OG Kush, I figured had to be good., and I was right. The fragrance of the flowers was pungent to say the least, but the flavor of the smoke was magnificent. Especially on exhale, you get this sweet candy flavor that is a treat. Then the buzz kicks in almost immediately, and you&#39;re treated to an invigorating high, that gets you moving and motivated for any task at hand. Definitely a keeper!

VThis Strain has a structure identical to Hindu Kush. The out side is looks slightly dead (hence zombie) yet covered in  deep orange trichomes however, the inside is much better. Upon breaking a rich smell rushes you. It is hairy and slightly crystalized at the core. It is an intense creeper. I under  estimated it after rolling 2 js, about 15 minuets after I smoked it hit quickly. Zombie Og has an odd rather nutty flavor. \u000a \u000aMy friend who happens to have a lot of ghost encounters told me a story that while they were smoking this a ghost came up and handed them a cigaret, after that cigaret she went back to her pack for another and one was missing. just for thought

VThis strain is very common on the east coast, because of how easy it is to cultivate and how high the yield of the plant is. There&#39;s no strong flavor to smoking the flower, because the strain is very leafy, and tastes mostly of just smoke when smoked in a bowl or rolling paper. I can&#39;t speak to the taste of concentrates because I haven&#39;t had a concentrate of this strain.\u000a\u000aThe high is good but can be unpredictable. Sometimes you get an almost cocaine-like euphoria and only a little paranoid, other times you get very paranoid and a relaxed euphoria later on. It almost always causes munchies and absolutely always causes very bad dry mouth, so have water on hand if you&#39;re smoking before bed, or you will wake up with a bad headache, as I have on this strain.\u000a\u000aAll in all, the strain is great but loses a star for the inconsistent high. Would definitely recommend to someone who&#39;s looking to treat chronic pain, anxiety, or depression.

VLike I expected from the reviews, I found this strain helpful for chronic musculoskeletal pain, nausea, migraines and anxiety. It calms down muscle spasms and stress without leaving me couchlocked. It&#39;s uplifting, just enough sativa to make getting through daily tasks easier without tipping into manic territory. Plus it smells amazing! This batch wasn&#39;t quite as high in THC as I usually prefer for pain relief, but I would still recommend it for anyone with similar symptoms.

I took a long rip to finish my bowl good citrus taste again less earthy maybe just use to it who cares feeling good.  Been spacing in and out. I will keep trying to write. Seriously not bad for the thc level that caught me by surprise by far.  I&#39;m really enjoying this fountain how magical it is. The sound of water falling into itself has a pattern yet doesn&#39;t very soothing.  Don&#39;t feel heavy yet don&#39;t feel like moving because the body high is just way too relaxing.

VA combination of two if my favorite strains, Sour Diesel, &amp; OG Kush, I figured had to be good., and I was right. The fragrance of the flowers was pungent to say the least, but the flavor of the smoke was magnificent. Especially on exhale, you get this sweet candy flavor that is a treat. Then the buzz kicks in almost immediately, and you&#39;re treated to an invigorating high, that gets you moving and motivated for any task at hand. Definitely a keeper!

VI&#39;ve smoked quite bit of this lately, mostly hoping to feel hungry, but no luck. Been decently stoned though, worth a try. It smells very strong, pungent even, i had 3 ozs in canning jars and i could still smell it. I can&#39;t seem to get the taste quite down but people i smoke with say its sour tasting almost.  Its a nice smoke, the buds are sticky, if your a daily to heavy smoker its worth a toke.

VA very strong and powerful sweet diesel aroma came from the jar as soon as it was opened. This is a wonderfully built hybrid. Very dense flowers filled with resin of a very high quality. A light head change is felt with the first exhale. Slowed and focused my train of thought.A moderate level of relief from muscle spasms, along with depression and anxiety relief is found within this flower.

VI did psychedelics the previous two days before smoking this strain and I had a trip flashback and I must say this weed was really nice to trip with. I was at my friends house and we all got pretty giggly and happy. I got very spacey and tired after a little bit and went to sleep for a few hours and had a very eye opening dream about where I am now and how I got here and where I am going to end up. I woke up and my trip flashback was gone and we smoked more pot. Now I am feeling very creative and relaxed, and social. 10/10

VWhen I opened the container I was immediately hit with the scent of lemon gum drops!  It was a sweet lemon scent which made me smile.\u000a\u000aI smoked a joint, as I do the first time with any strain.  The lemon scent carried over into the smoke.  It was smooth to smoke and pleasant to the pallet.  \u000a\u000aI noticed the tingling in my feet due to the diabetes subsided.  I felt light, and energetic and hungry, which is a good thing.  Good effects, good head high.

VDefinitely has that NYC Diesel taste and effect. Great for daytime smoking and pain management. Fuel covered terps with a minty, piny scent. Smooth toke and very little harshness on the chest...maybe a tickle. \u000aCreeps up your spine and moves through the medulla to the frontal cortex and festers behind the eyes. Puts you in a good mood, very little munchies. Keep your eyedrops close if you&#39;re trying to conceal. This strain does plateau when smoked. Careful to those who don&#39;t smoke often, this is a powerful smoke, typical of a Diesel. Slow and steady does it. Enjoy

VI tried two purchases of this strain, and both times it had a different weak flavor. It crumbles into a powder if you handle it to hard which makes it smoke harsh. I think the price is a little to high for the quality of the flowers.  And the quantity of the flowers for sale needs to increase so that you can purchase it on a day convenient to you. I wish these issues could be solved as your location is close and friendly to me.

VThis strain is okay not great but okay. The buds were nice and compact and didnt smell bad. The taste left a lot to desire ,and the kush didnt really add anything worthwhile to the high. This stuff is pretty passable and I would just suggest some other strain that is a good indica hybrid like blue dream or strawberry cough. Both those strains taste better and have a better all around high without having to resort to kush. I believe kush is very overused in the cannabis scene and people would do best to stop buying it.
