VReview of 3 Kings Kush. Nice dense dark green nugs. STICKY!!! Smells like straight kush! Piney and pungent. A nice potent hybrid. Indica effects are fairly strong and the sativa effects take away my stress and put my mind at ease. I&#39;m able to relax my mind and sleep on this one. Very very nice strain.

VThis sativa dominant flower packs an absolute punch in the face. The effects are strong and immediate. Very stoney and heady. The come down from 3 kings is pretty heavy and sleepy. The buds are sticky icky. Dark green with really nice reddish calyxes. Some of the buds have some nice speckles of purple. The smell is earthy and mildly fuely. It&#39;s a nice balance of the parents. Taste is crazy earthy. Great for digestive and gastrointestinal disorders. Can be a little racy and bring about anxiety for less experienced smoker/vapor.

VThis bud comes on with a heavy body buzz. It is fantastic. Then as the body buzz is fully realized the head high kicks in. Very good pot for artists or the creative types. It is the best of both worlds without the heavy tired feeling afterwards that I am used to from a good indica. This nug smells great and is recognized before it leaves the jar. I recommend smoking some of this and listening to some high quality head phones and get trippy off this herb.

VWow, what a fitting name! OG x Headband x Sour Diesel. It really is the best of all spectrums.  It&#39;s the perfect daytime smoke for people who experience anxiety as the OG works well to knock off the &#39;tense&#39; feeling sometimes brought on by Sour D. \u000aI think this new strains popularity will grow quickly due to it&#39;s mass appeal.

VThis strain can be one of 3 things. indica, hybrid or sativa dominate in effects. My dispensary labeled my &quot;middle shelf&quot; potency 8th 3 Kings as straight indica. Indica happens to be my choice favorite but eyeing up the genetics and reviews each buy could be different. OG Kush always hits me as a nighttime &quot;creeper&quot; couch lock strain and my 3 kings feels very similar. I do have a very slight &quot;headband&quot; feeling which hits me every puff if another genetic in 3 kings, Headband, potent sativa. The last king, Sour Diesel, always hits me clear sativa with munchies. My batch of 3 Kings is definetly a mix of all 3 &quot;kings&quot; with a strong body relaxation bundled with &quot;headband&quot; feeling but definetly focused enough to do tasks with ease. I&#39;d call this beauty a hybrid.

VI wanted an Indica and I got 3 Kings, which is a Sativa based Hybrid, with some Indica highlights.  \u000a\u000aThe one weed that I usually order is Cheese because it&#39;s so effective with pain and helps with sleep. I have a painful neurological disorder.\u000a\u000aRecently, a great idea came to mind! I mixed 3 Kings w/ Cheese and was instantly delighted! What I got was a wonderland of potency, taste, undeniable energy and a high that would last at least 3 hours. \u000a\u000aI don&#39;t mix them all the time, but even by itself, 3 Kings is one of the best Sativa based Hybrids I&#39;ve ever smoked!  It is simply awesome!!!!

VLooked it up online and people say online it is &quot;Sour Diesel x OG Kush x Headband&quot; but I am not sure 100%, also heard something about it being called &quot;707&quot; something or other, but anyways this is a really good Sativa strain (and even for those who don&#39;t like Sativas much I&#39;d still recommend this cause I liked it that much). It definitely tastes like headband and sour d for those who are headband/sour d fans, and a lil hint of bubba. It&#39;s delicious and amazing and I just barely got an eighth from the local club but it&#39;s totally stinking up my whole house! I&#39;d rank this in my top ten so far, and been medicating for ten years or so.

I was even able to blaze at work and function efficiently still.  Love y&#39;all.. Peace \u270c&#127996;\u2764\ufe0f&#128175;

VIf you are into Sour Diesels ability to help you stay creative and focus on your work, 3 kings is the only equivalent to that experience. Very cerebral high, keeps you on the top of artistic or engineering game. Strong diesel taste and very pungent. I also agree with some on this about it being very intense and not for &quot;beginners&quot; or people who do not like intense cerebral experiences with their bud. I would also suggest gorilla glue 4 for a similar experience.

VThe smell, at first, doesn&#39;t even remind you of Cannabis. It comes off as a soft creaminess. If you let the flower dry a little, then the enticing aroma of skunk becomes more pronounced.\u000a\u000aOn inspection, the flowers were very dense and covered in tons of trichomes both whitish milky and golden. Very visually appealing - this stuff is so sticky it kept getting stuck to the sides of the inside of the jar.\u000a\u000aI would highly caution anyone smoking this for the first time. The intensity on this is enough to put a dent in Connoisseurs and Sommeliers. Definitely not, &#39;rookie-grade&#39; flowers.\u000a\u000aBe ready for an intense head-punch that has the effects of Indica and the fade of an extremely strong Haze: I guess you could describe the feeling as, &#39;Indica Hazey&#39;? You get a THC kick on inhalation and the taste of milk and honey on exhalation. Long duration - can get you truly, &#39;faded&#39;.\u000a\u000aOverall: highly recommended. This is something that even experienced Cannabis consumers can tout as, &#39;one-of-the-ones-to-be-remembered&#39;.\u000a\u000aPeace! :)

VBuds look velvety and smell like Berry or Blue Dream, which is weird because that&#39;s not really what it&#39;s supposed to smell like. But my smell might be off so, eh. I smoked a big ol&#39; bowl of this and then proceeded to do some meditation, yoga, and cleaning. I thought the smoke was a bit harsh even though I had just cleaned my bong and filled it with new, hot water. It could just be a harsher strain to smoke, too. This is a pretty creative strain. Probably best for daytime use. My mind was prettttty busy. Not in an anxious, bad way. More like &quot;folding this laundry is an art form. I&#39;m an artist&quot; kind of way. My brain would NOT shut up. Luckily I didn&#39;t have a hard time finding motivation to get things done which is excellent. I would definitely smoke this strain again. Paranoia level: 2/10.

VClear, cerebral high.  Great for daytime tasks.  I feel happy and silly on it.  But not annoyingly so.\u000a\u000aI took a whole shitload recently, and at the end of the day, I was coming down and my face hurt from smiling all day.  \u000a\u000aI eat this, so my perception of how long the high lasts is skewed.  It&#39;s not a lightweight strain, but it doesn&#39;t zonk me out, just comes and goes sweetly.\u000a\u000aIf you smoke a whole bunch of this, you may get confused and tend towards paranoia rather than sluggishness.  That&#39;s the sativa-ness of it, I suppose.

VTo answer a few of your questions, 3 Kings -&gt; 20 - 25% THC.  Damn good weed. It has a Piney, Skunky, Pungent smell, w/ a great taste to follow.  After use, it was a very euphoric high, strait to your head, as expected from a strain bred w/ Headband, OGK, &amp; Sour D.  I didn&#39;t move from my spot for the 1st 2hrs.  Happy as hell while I sat there.  I for sure will be buying this strain again.

It does only get stronger though. Superb euphoria; I could sit in front of the TV and the PS4 noise is more mesmerizing than the actually game. My head is very high that it&#39;s throbbing.

What I do feel, however, is a little more talkative, less stressed,  and forgetful. This might be a good choice for someone who needs some social lubricant, but doesn&#39;t want to feel &quot;turnt&quot;.\u000a\u000aFlavor and aroma are okay. \u000a\u000aHonestly, I will try  this strain again, but I wouldn&#39;t actively search for it.

Vbeware of this &#39;Naughty or Nice&#39; strain. sown from seed is a gamble since the strain&#39;s genetics are very unstable and inconsistent with producing flower &#39;buds&#39; as some plant&#39;s flowers may fern or fluff out. good phenotypes are 1:200 plants, so its best to get clones from the dispensary if cultivating this strain especially since the flowering time is very late, oct-dec, and is best flowered indoors or by an outdoor light-dep specialist, due to the 12/12 light cycle necessary to trigger flowering.\u000a\u000aseeds are a great gift to give as a prank within a blessing or vice versa. due to the 12-12 light cycle seeds can be planted outdoors up to 4 weeks before the northern vernal equinox, so expect very big plants, with a mediocre to piss poor yield at best or worse, around Christmas.\u000a\u000ahave you been naughty or nice or what? - the genetics are Grinched, and this Devil is spreading the gift, so look out.\u000a\u000acultivation is best left to the master gardeners.\u000a\u000athe potential potency is very high. the only bud out of Humboldt that rippled me.

VWhew!!! I gotta tell ya!!! I snacked up an 1/8 of this 3 Kings because I&#39;d never smoked it. Well, SO GLAD I DID. I didn&#39;t even wanna walk to raid my fridge. Beautiful arome and Earth&#39;s Healing, as usual, has wonderfully cured nuggets. I went back a day later and bought another 1/8th just to hold it down before it is all gone. Since I&#39;ve moved to Tucson the only better reefer I&#39;ve burned is Gorilla Glue #4.

VSometimes, 1 King is better than 3. (I&#39;m not polyamorous but I don&#39;t hate on people who are). More than 1 King is just confusing. The war battles come from all angles with 3 Kings, but if you like surprises - that may be a good thing.

Vif you&#39;re going for bag appeal, this is isn&#39;t the best strain. other than that, it smells like sweet kush and pungent diesel and the smell is strong enough to reek up an entire room. I have a very high tolerance and this weed got me higher off one joint than i&#39;ve been since the last time i dabbed.  It&#39;s a very heady indica that gives you that headband feeling at the top of your skull and a very slumped upper body high. I recommend this strain for night time use but it&#39;s managable during the day.

Vleave cultivation to the Master Gardeners and professionals. seeds from this strain produce phenotypes that are so different from one to the next that my friends and I have dubbed this strain The Naughty or Nice weed. you can walk into the Garden on Halloween to ask the plants trick or treat? because by Thanksgiving you&#39;ll know what to be thankful for - everything you have to look forward to Christmas with. I have uploaded a series of photographs which exhibit the strain&#39;s unstable genetics. only one in 200 seeds will produce the flowers you want. three kings is best left at clone only. the ordinary patient gardener does not have time to grow this strain from seed

With this strain I&#39;ve been seizure free for 3 days and when I did have one, the after math (the ouchies and sore body) wasn&#39;t that bad. What ever soreness I had was gone by morning. This strain is a must puff, keeps your mind correct but with lots of talking and giggles.

VGives me mild bursts of anxiety but the ability to remain calm is still there. It&#39;s definitely not my personal favorite and I wouldn&#39;t buy it again but it&#39;s a good high, not too racy. Thoughts can get tangled and messy and it quickly becomes annoying. I would say it&#39;s probably best for when you&#39;re already in a calm state of mind. I wouldn&#39;t use it to get &quot;happy&quot; like a lot of other hybrids.

VI won&#39;t write a review on a strain until I have smoked a half oz of it. Definitely not impressed. I was originally getting Skywalker OG, but changed to this last minute. TBH I have never heard of this strain before. I mean Headband x Sour Diesel x OG kush, how can u go wrong!??! Yah that was what I thought so I bought an oz, big mistake. I&#39;m not sure of the THC content but I&#39;d be willing to bet it&#39;s not that high.\u000aObviously it&#39;s not horrible, I mean if it&#39;s bud, but this is my LEAST favorite so far.
