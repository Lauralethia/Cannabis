VGot a nice sample pacc from my boy in Tampa and this is definitely a top 5 in my personal stash. Probably number 2 behind Headband. Smoked this in the morning and managed to clean my entire house, wash my dogs, and clean the car with joy and happiness. Certainly is gonna become a mainstay in my stash.

VBy far the best I&#39;ve ever had. My girlfriend and I picked up a G from our local collective for 8$ very cheap but this strain is very strong. The high creeps up on you, but it sparks conversations, had very deep conversations while watching South Park. Very high functionality, I didn&#39;t attempt to do anything but with how I was feeling I could&#39;ve been at work or school and been more productive than I usually am.

VSour Cheese is a really nice strain. Very sticky if you&#39;re breaking it up with your fingers. The smell is clearly a nice mix of sour and cheesey goodness. The high was definitely a head high.

VGreat for my aches and pains related to my MS. Works super fast and with a little amount, but the high doesn&#39;t last as long as it does with some other strains. It&#39;s a nice choice for daytime, since it doesn&#39;t make me too tired. Within an hour of using, I feel clear headed and like I didn&#39;t smoke at all that day. Useful for days when I just need to get through the pain, but don&#39;t want to be stoned out of my mind.

At lower levels you have some enough energy still to rock about and do your thing (I make music and I love making music when I&#39;m smoke this lovely strain) and if you smoke a bit more (2 + bowls) you feel very relaxed and sleepy.  It stimulates my appetite as it is hard for me to eat sometimes due to nausea from a past opiate addiction that left me with hardcore nausea for no reason  when I get hungry :-(... but the great plant fixes all that!  And this is a lovely strain for all reasons as long as you know where you want to get to and how much it&#39;ll take.

Vgot a batch yesterday. let me tell u the Nugs I got .... Amazing. I got a Quad of this Sour Cheese an all Nugs are over 2 grams a piece. the biggest bud weigh out at 3.2 grams.  was a real eye catcher... then came the smell. wow. very very pungent. could smell it all over when I open the bag.  then came the smoke. was very smooth. rich hits. an good after taste.  effects came on slow at first. then got a big boost of happiness. got me thinking about work an other things to do. was a good lookn strain. smoke is mellow. an not sure if I get this strain again. but was nice to dip into these beautiful buds

VHas a primary flavor of Sour with a cheesy aftertaste. Also, has that lung-punch effect that sour has, however, not as intense. Enduces a great mind &amp; body high. couldn&#39;t be more satisfied. Another plus when you grind it in a decent grinder its kif content is incredible. All around amazing strain\u000a

VSooo loud. Right off the nug there&#39;s not much smell except a slight cheese funky that&#39;s actually really pleasant but when you break it up it smells super sweet. The high is awesome really uplifting and creative, good for depression and fatigue.
