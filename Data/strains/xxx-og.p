VThese buds are tiny. I&#39;d say averaging about the size of two jelly beans. Light green in color with only a couple orange hairs on each. The best feature on this little lady though... COMPLETELY frosted over! Leavig the buds with a slight orange hue to it. Lightly pungent, sweet and earthy smell. It&#39;s a pleasent smell. Not overbearing at all. Smoked,  this flower hit smooth. Barely any taste (that could just be me) and it&#39;s a earthy/woody taste. Pleasant though. It hit me lightly about 5 minutes later and crept in over 15-20 minutes. I was medicated for about 2.5 hours off of three tokes on the glass pipe. XXX OG is potent and it only took a little for me. I give her 5 stars.

VLove this one before bed.  I&#39;m a wound up ADD sufferer, the squirrels go wild and keep me from sleeping a lot of the time - if I can&#39;t smoke before bed.  Sometimes it makes me a bit dizzy when I lay down, but only for a couple seconds.   Mostly, I get a more cranial buzz, my body can sometimes feel a bit hyper sensitive to touch.  Some nerves I have damage in will tingle.   No clue what&#39;s up with that, but, worth mentioning I guess.  \u000a

VI got some brownies that were made from XXX Kush. Each brownie had 180 mg of THC. I ate half of one and I got very high. I don&#39;t think I smoked or vaped for the rest of the day. I had no reason. too I felt so good. It was very hard to keep from falling asleep but once I did I slept like a rock. Purchased at White Mountain Health Center. Highly recommended.

VThis is the best strain I&#39;ve had in a long time. LOVE the heavy head and body high! You do not need much to get you in a good mood or to take a good nap! So be careful when you smoke this because if you plan on being productive this is NOT the strain for you. :P Also this is a VERY VERY heavy smoke on the lungs and you will cough if you don&#39;t have a vaporizer!!!!

Vjust got this strain two days back from my fave clinic, and i can say its a pretty good one! the pain relief i feel is great- having fibromyalgia i am constantly uncomfortable, and this really helped me relax. it also made me sleepy, which i need, too, since i have issues with sleep as well! lmao. i dont really say i use marijuana for medicinal purposes, but it truly does help with my health issues! XXX is a nice smoke, you get a head high but your brain feels at ease, mostly. kind of spacey, if you smoke enough! the only downside for me was that this strain made me really hungry! and for others thats prob not an issue but im obese, so... yeah, lol. all in all, though, i think the leafly page is pretty much spot on with the description, and the effects listed! i dont typically get dry eyes or dry mouth, so i can say that for me, personally, the negatives didnt apply. but then again, no strains really dry my eyes out and very rarely do i get cottonmouth! i would definitely recommend this strain to moderately advanced smokers. might be too strong for novices, though. but overall a great strain for those looking to relax without losing their mental clarity. ;P

VI have never been a great lover of high potency indica; my preference lay with mind-bending sativas and sativa dominant hybrids. I smoke to treat bi-polar and combat a lengthy assault on my psyche by depression and her unwelcome comrade anxiety.\u000a\u000aThis strain has just the right kick i need to treat my medical conditions with just enough energy left over to focus on day to day activities. It is fluffier than i would like however the odour is on point. I can clearly taste the pine and lemon however the particular batch i have has a slight chemical flavour  (as though the grower did not fully drain the fertiliser). This is the only reason i give it a 3/5; when i taste a cleaner strain i may reconsider.

After the day was done I searched out a good indica that would put me in a nice comfortable coma and erase the day. &quot;The Don Christo&quot; (XXX OG) became my new best friend. It not only helped my pain, it did exactly what I needed for the evening. Absolutely love, new favorite. In smaller amounts, I can totally go to work after smoking.

Strain did make me happy, relaxed, &amp; then sleepy. Just didn&#39;t get the best sample of this strain sadly but, that should not stop you from giving it a go!. 3.5 stars out of five.....Peace

I feel congested, and my glands produce a lot of mucus which then triggers my cough.  \u000aLuckily, though, I discovered that if it is consumed as an edible there is practically no allergic reaction.  Furthermore, if the XXX OG edible is eaten along with a Sativa strain edible with high CBN there is a profound anti-histamine which allows you to breath, so easily and freely.  I haven&#39;t  breathed this awesomely in a long time!!!  \u000aTeach Peace

V`My Triple X had bulky medium green buds with short light orange hairs that blended into the buds. Had to look to see the fine crystal trichomes. No oozing trichomes for me as reported about the strain which won the 2014 LA Cannabis Cup for best Indica. Smell &amp; taste was earthy, citrus, &amp; pine but, it was mild. Strain did make me happy, relaxed, &amp; then sleepy. Just didn&#39;t get the best sample of this strain sadly but, that should not stop you from giving it a go!. 3.5 stars out of five.....Peace

VI love this one. This is one of my new favorite strains next to Blue Dream. In smaller doses it&#39;s great for getting up and getting around and doing stuff, and in larger doses it&#39;s great for insomnia and going to bed. The perfect combination between day and night strains. Be very careful though that you don&#39;t take too much because you will get couch locked

The taste is herbal and wood and the bud is dank in a very leafy way.Its definitely a hard vape and a great strong indica get it you gotta try it if you have a high tolerance or need something really strong!

VXXX OG is a very dank weed that is promised to make you couch locked. The strong body high that the Indica gives makes everything you feel, taste and hear orgasmically wonderful.

VMan, this strain is something else. It\u2019s the first review I\u2019m writing on here because it\u2019s so great! It gets me sooooo incredibly high, and not even on that much. It makes me feel like I can talk to anyone, like I can let go, like I can be myself, and so much more. It really loosens me up, like some nice (extra strong) sangria. I could sleep using this, but I could also go out on the town and have a great time. Very versatile, and seems like it could work for a multitude of people with different issues. Everyone should pick this one up at least once!! \u000a(Only \u2018con\u2019 are the looks In my opinion. This isn\u2019t a dealbreaker at all, just thought I should mention it as part of the review.

VXXX OG is a very dank weed that is promised to make you couch locked. The strong body high that the Indica gives makes everything you feel, taste and hear orgasmically wonderful. This strain numbs pains and aches as if you never had them. I recommend this strain for late night usage for relaxation and a clearing of the mind.

VOkay so here goes. I got this to help me sleep and relax in the evenings. It did do a great job of kind of paralyzingly my brain and slowing down my thoughts - I smoked and started reading and within a few minutes I realized I was reading the same passage over and over. However, sometimes I&#39;ve noticed I end up feeling zoned out but alert. I hate this feeling!! It feels like I&#39;m paralyzed but my brain is still awake. It makes me very quiet and observant and slow but unable to actually fall asleep sometimes. I think if you just want to zone out in front of the tv it may be perfect for that but not for sleep.

VExcellent high with very subtle transitions and a very nice come down. Definitely one to cause couch lock if you overindulge, but in smaller quantities it leaves one clear headed and honestly pretty motivated. Captures a lot of the traditional Indica qualities but not as sleep inducing which I like, but maybe not what you want if you are trying to sleep. Either way, a great strain that I would highly recommend, and very pretty too.

VThis strain is incredibly good tasting, smells awesome and burns nice and slow. The effects of this strain really vary. In small amounts, this strain left me feeling happy, uplifted and gave me a cerebral high. In larger doses, I became more lethargic, going into a pretty heavy couch-lock and falling asleep. This is exactly what I look for in an Indica. The only thing keeping me from rating this 5 Starts is that the Skywalker is slightly even better! Love this strain though! I will definitely be buying again!

Also, just as the description says, the buds are amazingly doused in trichomes and almost looks like sand against the purple-ish green buds. This strain is definitely one to be on the look out for!

VDifferent Looking bud structure bulging round tips all around this bud making it look kind of rocky. The taste is extremely musky and like it&#39;s name hits very hard. I find most of this bud in the sativa versions here in ABQ. The smell is herbal, lime and has a large pungent like smell it&#39;s not earthy but definitely has a musky tone to it. The vape is very thick and almost falls to the ground stays in the position it&#39;s in and doesn&#39;t rise making it dense enough to still be in the air and haze it up.\u000aI love how calming this is even in a sativa state, more head high than body. Great for pain, depression,PTSD, and of course pms if your looking for a good one this is it!

VA little harsh for my tastes, I need to buy a vaporizer already. Comes on strong but no anxiety here. I recommend for sleep or just zoning out on the couch to unwind. Probably not the strain you want to smoke while doing your taxes but a great relaxing high.

VSolid B+ Indica with a real quick head buzz. Body effects kick in after 10-15 minutes. I would buy again. Only reason for 4 instead of 5  is a 5 has to knock me out which this didn&#39;t.

VFound this strain at the Green mile experience event in San Bernardino California. Got a gram of it in shatter form and flower. The shatter was a little harsh on the throat but has a decent flavor. The flowers smell quite nice but I wasn&#39;t fond of the taste. \u000a
