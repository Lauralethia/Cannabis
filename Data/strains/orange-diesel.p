VI suffer from intense anxiety and panic along with depression. I&#39;ve struggled on and off trying to find a strain that didn&#39;t give me more of either. whether anxiety, paranoia, or sluggish. with orange diesel, my heart rate is dramatically lower at the peak of a high than any other strain(it&#39;s usually on the higher side). with that being said, it&#39;s actually a little lower than without weed. someone who struggles with anxiety etc knows that rapid heart rate is the first and most noticeable sign. I feel like I can breathe, without wanting to sleep, I&#39;m clear minded and motivated. sour diesel does not do that for me. great stuff!

VI had this strain in my stash and was not impressed by its look, the buds where mini compared to other strains, kinda avoided it for a while. \u000aYesterday had to do some editing (post production photography) and medicated with some of it.... OMG in a span of 4 hours I smoked twice and got work done for 8 hours and the best part, it felt like 5 min gone by and all this work done.\u000aI underestimated this strain, makes me very focused and creative !!!!\u000aHighly recommended for artists working on their projects.

VThis is a very nice strain. At first smell it almost reminded me of cheese. But upon closer smelling it after breaking it up in the grinder, it has a very distinct diesel smell that we are all used to with Sour D. \u000a\u000aI smoke it out of a new pipe and it had a very fruity orange taste after blowing the smoke out. \u000a\u000aDef a daytime weed that is good for wake and bakes. I would recommend this for creative thinking while still being able to function.\u000a\u000aHeck I was able to fully detail a car (clay, polish,wax) all while high off this and no problems.
