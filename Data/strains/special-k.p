VI smoked a full Indica version of this strain and found it amazingly sedating.  I have insomnia and found this really helped me get to sleep.  It has a sweet earthy flavour and a beautiful green bud with yellow hues throughout.  This is another one of my favourites grown by East Van Boutiques.

VLoose little buds that did not taste nor smell very appetizing. Good for mixing up in salads with other more tasty strains. For a hybrid the buzz was decent with both a strong pull towards the head and also body.  This can feel strangulating if these feelings overlap which is often why I deter from hybrids.  This was not the case with Special K at all, but instead a balanced back &amp; forth between.  Good for light pain relief without being super giggly or anxious.
