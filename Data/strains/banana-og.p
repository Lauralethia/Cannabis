VIn 5 words- I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STRAIN! The effects are very euphoric. I got no anxiety from it and felt light weight and &quot;fluffy&quot; so to speak. Comparable to taking a pain medication like Vicodin or oxycodone. Very effective in reliving back pain from scoliosis. I laughed a lot and still am. I got a smile on my face and can&#39;t manage to stop smiling. &#128522; I have a nice relaxed head buzz. Gives you motivation and energy in my opinion. Makes me want to get crafty. This has become my new favorite strain.

VOverall this is a very nice flower to smoke. The flowers are extra large, one of the buds I obtained is over 3 grams which is nice. They are light green, very dense, but the pistil count is low (not overly hairy) and there is a light frosting of amber trichomes that are much easier to see through a magnifying lens.\u000a\u000aThe smell is earthy, musky, and sweet with just a light hint of pine. The smoke is very smooth and sweet, absolutely one of the smoothest I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s very easy on the throat and lungs with mild expansion, extremely pleasurable and delicious.\u000a\u000aI have had slightly more potent strains but the taste and smoothness really make this strain a joy to have on hand. The buzz lasts a good long while too. Excellent strain for pain with a high CBD count and works wonderfully for my insomnia.

V\u2022 This review is for CT&#39;s Advanced Grow Labs&#39; T-29.9% indica-dominant, beautiful, tasty &#127820;bud \u2022\u000aBrights all around!--green bud, orange|purple hair,  &#128293;high! Flavor is &#127820;&amp; just-fruity on-point, w/5+% terpenes&#39;-assurance|insurance. Several bong rips in, the &#39;facial-high&#39; sets in ;) which, for me, is the beginning of cerebral experience. Don&#39;t normally chose an indica to start my day, but hoping the onset of pain relief allows me to stay focused &amp; remain on-course.  &#127820;-fam is new to me bc have &#127820;-allergy lol, but so glad I tried! Recommend to any kush-lovers &amp; those who \u2764\ufe0ftasty, high-terp profiles.. easy, smooth smoke for newbies +&#39;ol-timers, alike! \u2022 \u000a

VBanana OG starts off with a great taste. The green hit is simply amazing. Very green flavor with sweet and citrus. \u000a\u000aThere&#39;s a simple mellow high that kicks in quickly. However, don&#39;t be disappointed. Round 2 snuck up on me within 15 minutes. Just when I was thinking about another bowl, I drifted off into another place.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m enjoying this in a calm quiet environment. It&#39;s easy to pay attention to every sound and analyze what you hear.  \u000a\u000aListening to some music with a good view is definitely a good idea for this strain.

VThis is really a great strain. I like the mild happy feeling. It has some dry mouth &amp; eye stuff. It is a great one to get lost in a creative work, or personal project. Has a slight mild paranoia thing that is really nothing if, but a chuckle for an avid medical user knowing the benefits outweigh any of that. In general that is the thing with any ganja paranoia symptoms. They can &amp; should be laughed off by medical users especially because they are irrational anxiety thoughts. Facts, logic, math &amp; good atmosphere in life crush that paranoia that can destroy ya. \u000a\u000aThe taste is smooth banana almost Caribbean &amp; rich, even the concentrate is a tasty cough. Dark flavor medium roast.

VI don&#39;t care for the taste myself, reminds me of some of the cheap stuff I used to get in high school, with that said, it does provide a good head high that hits quickly and slowly moves down the body over the course of an hour or so, helps with my back pain without putting me out. also it doesn&#39;t induce hunger at all which is ok with me. the only thing that is keeping me fro. getting it again is the flavor

VOne of my favorite strains. The smell is very tropical and sometimes doesn&#39;t even smell like weed. This strain gives me a sativa head high while giving couch lock. I cut back smoking this strain because of my anxiety but it will always be one of my favorites. This strain is super potent and a really good taste to it. This is one of the strains that if I smoke enough of I will eat everything in you pantry and lay on your couch watching old school movies.

VLots of purp in this strain, I&#39;d give it a 7/10 on trichomes content. And a 9/10 on the smell, which is very fruity, sweet, and banana-like in nature with earthy undertones. The great aroma unfortunately doesn&#39;t quite transfer to an equally pleasant taste. I&#39;d give the taste a 6/10, being a little harsh on the throat. I can also tell the flower is a little early in it&#39;s cure, as of 11/16/14, the moisture content wasn&#39;t unbearable at all, just a few more days of curing would have given the stems the perfect snap and the flowers the perfect texture for grinding between the fingers for rolling joints and pinching bowls off. \u000aOverall, I give the bud a low 8/10, definitely worth trying for $50/8th from wellness 520. Thanks again guys for a great product.\u000a\u000a- J

VBanana is a mellow, uplifting treat. Maybe 60%-70% sativa.  It has outstanding bag appeal &amp; a dank, sweet, &quot;tropical&quot; scent with notes of lime, camphor and lawn clippings. Somewhat loose bud structure wrapped in frosted leaves. A chill &amp; fun high - not too strong or racy - with just a touch of indica fuzz. Great anti-depressant &amp; inspirational effects, mellow comedown.

Was hoping to taste some banana, but the head-to-toe\u2013euphoria makes-up for what\u2019s lacking in flavor, bringing in a solid 4.5-\u2b50\ufe0f \u2022

It also can make you paranoid as shit, but not to worry-- that fades quickly. I vaped this strain and it burns super well in a vape-- good,even hits and flavor. I feel so staviay and indicay yet still somehow functional. Like my heart is lava but my brain is awake. Oh and the euphoria. You could do anything on this strain and have a great time. I feel social yet I could easily lay down and stare my popcorn ceiling for 4 a few albums and be like....&quot;uhhhhh has it only been 5 minutes?&quot; when my mom gets home. Oh and the pain relief is immense honest to Abe. I vaped this after a long shift at work and I have had spinal cord surgery and my neck pain is melting out of me.

VFor some reason I found this strain to be very spacey at first.  When I smoked it I hadn&#39;t smoked for a week beforehand, which may have had something to do with the initial fog but it eventually cleared and I was left with a sorta mellow but kinda heady, creative, vibe and I got a lot of writing done.  Sometimes when I smoke kush&#39;s I feel like I get an overload of ideas to the point where I can&#39;t concentrate on any of them long enough to really remember them lol. I felt like I faired better on this strain and was able to organize my thoughts a bit more.  Still definitely some of that happening haha.  \u000a\u000aI didn&#39;t experience any heavy bodyload, I actually felt a little bit more homeostatic and actually, notice great pain reduction in my back and also my Crohn&#39;s symptoms. \u000a\u000aDefinitely a good strain if you have some time on your hands.  It&#39;ll whip you for a bit.

VA solid five star strain. I\u2019ve had a couple different experiences with Banana OG and it wasn\u2019t until my recent exposure to a half gram of Banana OG shatter that turned it from a two star strain into a five star strain (flower source matters). The first time I had it was in a cheap gram cartridge that turned into the color of used car oil in just two weeks. It tasted metallic too, and the high gave me a headache faster than it got me medicated. I knew the blame was on the company, but it colored my vision of the strain. So fast forward months later, and the budtender really convinced me to get this shatter. And wow, it\u2019s in my top three all day hybrids. It\u2019s a cozy wake and bake, the dr scholls to your 2pm burnout at work, it\u2019s the peaceful sigh after coming home and settling into that perfect spot on the couch, it\u2019s the Netflix and YouTube strain, and finally, a subtle invitation to bed. It\u2019s not an in your face, stoney bologna strain in moderate amounts. It\u2019s more of the embodiment of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d. You\u2019ll enjoy all things you do. I can see this as a great strain for anxiety and slight depression (I\u2019d recommend stronger Kush strains or Purples for severe depression).

If it is not grown and cured right it is probably horrible, but if it is right, the taste is amazingly smooth and fruity with a hint of banana but that\u2019s enough. It helps nerve pain and muscle pain in my neck, stones me out very visual but I can focus. I agree it is great for movie and music. Sunsets and food too!

The smell,  The taste,  and the the bits an parts of Banana and the Banana taste OMG.  The Banana taste brings out some of the earthy taste\u2026 that you cross \u274c and get this overall tranquility and then\u2026  BOOM.. You start\u2026.. Busting up laughing after 3 hits.  Then after a few more you can forget about anything that&#39;s in your mind.  \u000aMaybe an hour later you get this insane dream of desserts or want something off the wall like my Doritos and Sour Cream or Guacamole\u2026 lol I sometimes will make sure my house is stocked with just about any junk food and healthy food (like salads,  and granola) that I can think of,  that might just,  just jump in my head.  I always have those small yogurts on hand \u270b so I can have the &quot;Katt-Minis&quot;. Lol Anyways , this is a great strain to unwind.  *This is not for a 1st timer* Be pre-paired for couch locking,  giggling,  munching out,  then\u2026  You sleeeep.  \u000a#BOOMSSY #OutForTheCount

Definitely a banana smell to it, but doesn&#39;t taste like banana so a plus for those who don&#39;t like. The high leaves your body feeling very warm and relaxed.

VBanana OG has a very impressive appearance, when you break the buds up, so much kief flies off. The aroma is sweet like bananas, but also fresh, earthy and pine like. If you get a good inhale of it, you can be reminded of what it is like to stand at the top of mountain, with a banana in your pocket. Don&#39;t underestimate the strength of this bad boy, because intense munchies and couch-lock will creep in, especially if a large amount is consumed. The OG genetics play a massive role in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms like: muscle ache, restlessness and inflammation.

VTree Hawk Farms, Banana OG, .5g pre-roll for a late morning smoke. Fairly direct \u2018head rush\u2019, solid body buzz &amp; some heavy eyes within the first 20 min. A great smoke for \u201cgettin stoned\u201d &amp; chillin. I\u2019d imagine anything more than a .5g preroll would definitely result in some couch-lock, otherwise I feel like I need some vittles &amp; a bottle of bubble water &amp; a nice walk. Cheers THF!

VThis strain is perfect if you&#39;re trying to get a good nights sleep! This is not a strain you smoke if you&#39;re trying to get things done. It also has a heavy munchies side effect. I smoke this right before bed and always get an amazing nights sleep! 5 stars because it is such a great relaxation strain :)

Vso far I\u2019ve only had this in a \u201cmini vape\u201d from AGL here in CT and would really love to try the bud when it becomes available (their mini vape really doesn\u2019t hit as well as Curaleaf slims or vape cartridges unfortunately) but I\u2019m loving this strain. I\u2019ve been using it almost exclusively for the last 2-3 weeks as my nighttime strain, it\u2019s very relaxing, happy feeling, and a few hits gets me drifting off to sleep fairly quickly. I\u2019ve never had issues falling asleep but I wake up a lot/am restless and have nightmares (PTSD) but with Banana OG I sleep through the night or if I do wake up, it\u2019s really brief and I fall back asleep really fast. this is a really great medicine to try if you have insomnia, PTSD related symptoms.

VBanana OG smells like faint old banana peels to me..but that says nothing about the effects. It starts off very mellow. About 15 minutes later i was watching Back to the Future Part II,and i started to feel very couch-locked and was mildly tripping..it made me think of things that I haven&#39;t thought of in years..kind of hard to explain.I wouldn&#39;t smoke this unless you have a clear schedule that day, or strictly for nighttime. My wife is a veteran smoker of 20 years (I&#39;m pretty much a lightweight) and it knocked her on her ass! I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the strong side for me.

VBanana OG from Bhang Society on vanowen (soon to move to Ventura Blvd I heard when I was in there getting this strain) is what I smoked.  Flower from a pipe with a hemp wick...  Why they don&#39;t carry hemp rope idk...\u000a\u000aBut DAMN!!!!  I keep getting higher and higher!  I&#39;m borderline not able to function from one bowl!  It&#39;s a hybrid (indo dominant) I don&#39;t really care for the taste and the smell is decent for what it is.  The high is really slow, it takes a long time to pick up.  I smoked before dinner hoping is get the munchies but I didn&#39;t, if anything I got a little heartburn/anxiety maybe?  But not negative.  All I know is I finished dinner and I&#39;m faded as &#128558;\u000a\u000aNow I know why they promote this strain.  I feel like I ate an edible... And all this off of one bowl?!?!?!\u000a\u000a

VThis one was good, really good. I picked up an eight of Green Vault brand at Clear Choice cannabis in Tacoma WA. Odd smelling to me, this has to be one of least skunky  smelling weeds I&#39;ve ever smelled, and the taste is different too, very grassy and earthy, not the greatest tasting weed. But who cares?That&#39;s not why we are here, and it really delivers on the high, starts with an immediate very pleasurable head high, then later that disintegrates into a state of super relaxation, almost that feeling of having eaten too many edibles. Great strain, but this is the kind of strain for when your wanting to get supremely baked. Super dry mouth, all my favorites give me dry mouth, and this one certainly makes my short list of favorites.

After bowl 3 I could barely make dessert and cashed out. A favorite for sure hope to get more. Made good sleep for my epilepsy.

This is exactly the thing if you&#39;re looking to either be productive or really just want a nap. Ultimately, you&#39;re still in control without the paranoia, dry mouth or red eye. \u000a\u000aThought about making cannabutter with it, but enjoyed the dry vape too much.

V3.75 / 5 \u000a\u000aCleared two massive bong hits on this mellow high hitting strain. Was delicious tasting, resembling hints from the pungent smell of bananas and pineapple (tropical fruit) previously smelt. Overall I was very tired before hitting this delightful bud and after a good meal was so relaxed sitting on a sofa watching everyone time passed super slow yet fast (if that makes sense). Everyone had to ask me something twice as I was always off in the distance. For that anti social effect I&#39;m rating it down a bit as I kinda lost control which is agreeable only when creative or thought provoking. Anyways would try again and listen to music but not for social events.\u000a\u000aRemember to take this review with a pinch of salt, every reviews subjective! #StayTuned #CGM

VNot many growers, grow this bud perfectly. I have tried many not so satisfying Banana OG\u2019s from clinics, and I wasn\u2019t a fan of the strain at all. Fortunately for me, I have a coworker/good friend who gets this strain straight from the man who genetically crossed this strain and perfected its grow himself. And wow! This strain looks, taste, and smells amazing from inhale to exhale.  The buds should be fluffy, perfectly caked in crystals, and yet still nicely dense when you squeeze it.  And the smell is sweet, literally like bananas. Sad to see so many growers not using their full potential on what could be such a beautiful strain. When you do come across a nice grow from this strain, it will surely give you that super stoney type of high.

I&#39;m smoking out of one of my favorite rillos, favorite because it has no taste, doesn&#39;t mask the taste of the bud whatsoever, and the more I smoke, the more I can taste a fruity aftertaste remniscent of banana flavored joint papers.

VThis is a great strain for taking the edge off but still being able to function. It&#39;s great for day time use to keep my anxiety down but my mood up. Helps me stay on point but not overly stress. Plus with three rambunctious kids it&#39;s been a great mood relaxer so I am not so &quot;up tight&quot; all the time and tense. I don&#39;t feel the &quot;high&quot; part like with some others but it does it&#39;s job keeping me relaxed which is exactly what I need for an intensely stressful job and family life right now.

VThis one was good, really good. I picked up an eight of Green Vault brand at Clear Choice cannabis in Tacoma WA. Odd smelling to me, this has to be one of least skunky  smelling weeds I&#39;ve ever smelled, and the taste is different too, very grassy and earthy, not the greatest tasting weed. But who cares?That&#39;s not why we are here, and it really delivers on the high, starts with an immediate very pleasurable head high, then later that disintegrates into a state of super relaxation, almost that feeling of having eaten too many edibles. Great strain, but this is the kind of strain for when your wanting to get supremely baked. Super dry mouth, all my favorites give me dry mouth, and this one certainly makes my short list of favorites.

Vso far I\u2019ve only had this in a \u201cmini vape\u201d from AGL here in CT and would really love to try the bud when it becomes available (their mini vape really doesn\u2019t hit as well as Curaleaf slims or vape cartridges unfortunately) but I\u2019m loving this strain. I\u2019ve been using it almost exclusively for the last 2-3 weeks as my nighttime strain, it\u2019s very relaxing, happy feeling, and a few hits gets me drifting off to sleep fairly quickly. I\u2019ve never had issues falling asleep but I wake up a lot/am restless and have nightmares (PTSD) but with Banana OG I sleep through the night or if I do wake up, it\u2019s really brief and I fall back asleep really fast. this is a really great medicine to try if you have insomnia, PTSD related symptoms.

VThis strain definitely creeps up on you. I love it for when I need to catch some sleep, and I love it for a night out on the town with my friends. It blends in perfectly with what you are doing. Ive felt this strain as a heavy indica dominant, then other times Ive felt it as a sativa dominant. So I guess its pretty much up to what you are doing while smoking this strain.

VBanana Split or \u201cBanana Og\u201d Oil from Rythm GTI. &#127820; split - very earthy tasting. One puff and luckily my anxiety levels drop. I also feel my self getting hungrier and quickly! 2nd puff and I\u2019m coughing in a good way. That was terpy and potent. I feel Even more relaxed mentally but also clear headed and able to think and concentrate. Nice for ADD and PTSD. I enjoy the heavy head feeling as well. My eyes are beginning to feel a tiny bit heavy. Finally a 3rd puff and im good. I feel mentally satisfied and my body relaxed but ready to take on the day and work and  also my stomach is calmed and read to eat which is really hard for me. It\u2019s truly enjoy every product I have tried from Rythm and GTI. The disposables were great but this cart .... &#128293; absolute &#128293; Should last a while too!

VBanana OG smells like faint old banana peels to me..but that says nothing about the effects. It starts off very mellow. About 15 minutes later i was watching Back to the Future Part II,and i started to feel very couch-locked and was mildly tripping..it made me think of things that I haven&#39;t thought of in years..kind of hard to explain.I wouldn&#39;t smoke this unless you have a clear schedule that day, or strictly for nighttime. My wife is a veteran smoker of 20 years (I&#39;m pretty much a lightweight) and it knocked her on her ass! I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the strong side for me.

VI was really happy with this strain. It has a very potent smell, full of crystals with strong hits that allow even just one nug to go a long way.\u000a \u000aIt has a tropical smell that almost has a spiced aftertaste, I can only really describe like if you could have a really tropical chai, this is what it would smell like. At first the crystals weren&#39;t obviously visible, only showing up in the photo with the flash reflecting off them, but once you start to break the nug about the crystals are very apparent. The bud was very sticky. A slightly tropical flavor, though I know it&#39;s common for these to taste overly fruity mine wasn&#39;t.\u000a\u000aI experienced a lot of lethargy and laziness, slight tired agitation towards wanting to do anything. I definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend smoking this and intending to do much after. Towards the middle of my high I got a small amount of munchies and there at the end I was very tired. During the first 25 minutes or so after my first hits I did notice a slight peak in arousal but nothing crazy. Overall it was a nice body high, a very nice way to break my two month dry spell.\u000a\u000aThe only side effects I noticed were dry mouth, not really cotton mouth but my saliva was very thick and i had a strong thirst,  and very slight dry eye.\u000a\u000aVery helpful with my anxiety, though it would not be my got to for high anxiety days. It didn&#39;t necessarily relax my heart rate so much as my thoughts. The tiredness towards the end of the high would be more than perfect for insomnia, I wasn&#39;t instantly tired and falling asleep but gradually was able to relax into a nice slumber.\u000a\u000aI would rate this around a six because I don&#39;t care for the lethargy  but I give it a seven because the high was worth it.

Hits like a truck and affected me like a heavy hitting Indica. Excellent for sleep &amp; anxiety. Overall very impressed except for the stems. But hey the bud has to grow from something right?!? Lol #staylifted

VBanana OG from Bhang Society on vanowen (soon to move to Ventura Blvd I heard when I was in there getting this strain) is what I smoked.  Flower from a pipe with a hemp wick...  Why they don&#39;t carry hemp rope idk...\u000a\u000aBut DAMN!!!!  I keep getting higher and higher!  I&#39;m borderline not able to function from one bowl!  It&#39;s a hybrid (indo dominant) I don&#39;t really care for the taste and the smell is decent for what it is.  The high is really slow, it takes a long time to pick up.  I smoked before dinner hoping is get the munchies but I didn&#39;t, if anything I got a little heartburn/anxiety maybe?  But not negative.  All I know is I finished dinner and I&#39;m faded as &#128558;\u000a\u000aNow I know why they promote this strain.  I feel like I ate an edible... And all this off of one bowl?!?!?!\u000a\u000a

Vsmell in bud form was pungent but nothing fruity like. more flowery. taste was OK, not amazing not gross. I know this bud is indica dom hybrid but for me it was more like a heavy hitting Sativa.  I didn&#39;t get much of the body buzz. but that&#39;s just me &#128522; all in all good bud

VBanana OG is a dominant indica hybrid that if you have never had you must try. If you love OG strains you&#39;ll love it as it has a different taste then normal OGs. The tropical terps are great change and this is very heavy head high. Definitely elevates but relaxes the muscles and doesn&#39;t leave you tired.

Vi&#39;ve been seeing banana og all over the place in la and i was kind of skeptical that it was a fad strain. but i found a great deal on a dispensary&#39;s house live resin so i decided to check it out.\u000a\u000athis strain is fantastic.\u000a\u000ait tastes like bananas in a very earthy way, which i really enjoy because i was worried it would be like banana candy. (i used live resin in a vaporizer so i can&#39;t speak to how harsh flower might be.) beyond the great taste, the high from this strain is unreal. it&#39;s blissful and dreamy in the head and tension-relieving in the body. my favorite part of the high is that it comes in waves - one second you&#39;re just chilling, the next you&#39;re euphoric and your body is sinking into the couch.\u000a\u000athis is the perfect strain after work or when you&#39;re spending a night in with friends.

VMy budtender recommended me some Banana OG the other day, and it was a fairly good investment. I just bought a pre-roll (fatly packed, by the way) and smoked a bit and was pretty much good for the night. It&#39;s potent but not overbearingly so, and exhibits great characteristics of a solid indica strain. I love how Banana OG has this unique smell to it right out of the bag. Good buy.

VThis plant grows some donkey dick buds covered in sticky resin. \u000a\u000aSome of the biggest buds by far; however, there is not too much quality with this one...It finishes early in the season which is nice because you won&#39;t have to worry about bud rot and mold...but it doesn&#39;t get as much juicy potent resin, yet it does get a great dusting of trichomes, they are not too strong and full of turpene. The buds smoke harsh from so much branching and leaf in between the buds...and there&#39;s not much flavor. \u000aThe thc is in the 10% range with this one and could probably be a lot better.
