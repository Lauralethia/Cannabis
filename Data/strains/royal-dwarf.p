VI was red lining and pushing the envelope in work, stressed AF, shit sleep etc. \u000aVaped a bowl, it was like a \u201cwait a minute\u201d kind of moment when it came over me. I concentrated on the important things like my children, wife, life and chicken wings. Slept better. \u000aGood strain in all aspects. Easy to grow. Smells and tastes good. Nice relaxing not to up,\u000aNot to down high. This is why I wake up with a smile on my face everyday. \u000aI love it.

VGreat buzz, very pleasant high. Nice and sticky too.  Goes very well with a 1800 reposado and late afternoon sunshine.
