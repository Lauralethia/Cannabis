V4/5. Picked up a quarter from Rocky Road Dispensary in Avon, CO. The high hit me fairly quick, and i noticed amazing pain relief in my lower back and shoulders. Made me wanna lay down and listen to music. I couldn&#39;t help but smile and relax. Indica dominant, but you can feel some classic sativa effects. Very nice strain.
