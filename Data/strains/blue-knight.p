VSuper frosty, nice buds with amazing purple colors. Smokes amazing, very smooth with the berry taste that is sometimes typical with a &quot;purple strain &quot; and with a hint of hash flavor. At first he has a slight cerebral high,  moments later the heavy heavy Indica effects kick in, and produce a very narcotic type affect.  Are you in the can find  a really good batch of indoor blue night, I would not pass on this one!!

Smooth heavy smoke that pulls the stress right out of you. This is up in my top 3 fav of all time.

The outside of the nugs were light green covered in red hairs while on the inside it was purple! Blue Knight did not disappoint. The high relaxed my body and mind but it did not put me in a couch lock. In a sense it was a very productive indica where it allows your muscles to relax and for stress to melt away so you can accomplish the last of your tasks for the day.

VWell, where do I begin. Got this last night for the very first time after I read all the great reviews on here (thanks folks)! Bought an eighth and immediately upon opening the package, a strong berry-flavored aroma spread through the room. The smell is unbelievably good. It literally smells like freshly washed berries. Now, the good part. Packed a bowl of this beauty and what can I say, it tastes DAMN GOOD! The exhale is smooth and not harsh at all. Flavor is, again, smooth, sweet, and delicious, mildly citrusy but definitely more on the berry side. The effects are exactly as described in the overview. A true Indica. Put me in a very relaxed and mellow state. Had a long day at work (I work in tech) and this definitely helped set the right mood. Very mellow and peaceful experience for sure. 5/5! A MUST for any indica lover. CUTION! YOU MAY EAT A LARGE PIZZA BY YOURSELF.

VOh boy. This had me out of commission for hours after just one shared bowl. Destroyed my tongue with sour patch kids, couldn\u2019t taste for days, the high was super intense for me, but did nothing for my partner. I\u2019d recommend this to fans of archetypical indicas.

VProduct is great! Very light bud, light green with lots of crystal. Product is a smooth tasting strain, smoked and felt effects sooner rather than later. Very pleased with purchase!

Vthis is a must cop because of its rarity, extremely dense rolled a fat blunt with a small nug. the bugs are astonishing to look at. the high is intensely relaxing.

VSuper Bud, the taste is fantastic, left me relaxed, feeling creative. Fire Line Cannabis produced my nugs. If you see this strain due yourself a favor and pick it up.
