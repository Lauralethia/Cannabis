VBy all the other reviews it is fruity smelling and it leaves a more of a sweeter smell in the air when smoked.\u000aI dont feel too stoned but it is yet good enough to put you into sleep mode if you smoked a whole joint to yourself lol just let it creep up on you.\u000aOverall, I found it useful to smoke during the day so you can still function and talk and do w.e. you gotta do. But this is not a nighttime one if your trying to just smoke one bowl and knock out.

VIt&#39;s mostly great for energizing sativa lovers like me, but it&#39;s heavier stoniness can sneak up on ya.\u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re trying to get stuff done, smoke half as much as you&#39;d expect to and wait a while. \u000aCuz it&#39;s gon&#39; creep. \u000a\u000aGreat psychoactive creativity that flirts with paranoia and anxiety in larger amounts. \u000a\u000aYou have been warned.

VHawaiian Haze is the shit. I first smoked it with a very good friend of mine and we both have anxious personality with scatter brain (ADD). Cannot tell you how easy it became to finish school work. Also, after smoking in the mornings and finishing up my day, I go to bed and wake up and felt like one of those pansy princesses in a fairy tale. I woke up refreshed and ready to start the day. :) Great strain.\u000a\u000aCons: difficulty finding words/ explaining things. Not a strain for group work. A strain for academic motivation.

You are able to tackle whatever you have planned for the day (given you don&#39;t over smoke--this high envelopes your mind quite fully after single digit hits). When my roommate and I smoked this, we rewrote and edited a paragraph-long e-mail hella times and conducted cactus-centering surgery. The tropical tones add to the relaxed, happy ambiance this strain brings as soon as its plumes fill a room. Pina coladas anyone?

VWell I  in am in Southern CA, and nobody is selling this flower here. But at one of the dispensaries I go to I got a pre roll on the house, and the flower on the tube read HH. I smoked it and loved it. It is very easy going down and the high is super mellow and just plain lovely. I found out that the pre roll was used from the last of the flower (shake?) and that made the pre rolls. I snagged two more of the pre rolls and hope when I visit again, they will have more. Circle of Hope on Roscoe and Balboa in Encino has some of the best flower in the valley. They don&#39;t carry everything but what they carry is awesome flower. They stock the Chocolope flower which I love.

VFogginess reminds me a lot of Purple Haze.  Great for doing relaxing, flowy imprecise creative stuff like maybe doodling or noodling, not so much for doing your taxes or presenting projected budget figures to the board, lol.  I think I would prefer this in flower form.  As an ejuice it is hard to map out its full flavour profile, but I detect hints of lavender, spearmint and clove.  I expect the juice medium is contributing to this flavour, as I find this manufacturer (Treemo slims) has a particularly tropical flavoured juice.  Overall a worthy daytime toke.  Especially if you need to get creative juices flowing.

I can smoke a small bowl of this and be at a perfect high where I can still function and talk with speed and precision, but still feel chill and not overwhelmed.

VHaven&#39;t had quite such a good pure sativa in a while. Felt it right away, slight loss of focus and blurry background. Noticed it way more when I finished the joint. The second one took a good 30 minutes to roll. Felt active at first but that became an almost psychedelic CEV and music experience, changing everything away from the screen as a dark blur; play psychedelic rock for this one. It&#39;s a pure sativa that delivers in a sweet, tropical, pineapple aroma with a light smoke that&#39;s easy on the throat. Think a bout space and listen to music floating away. Good times, can be used very socially and active, mild dosage for daytime would probably be chill, but a bigger dose at night can help you go to sleep like a baby or just chill the entire evening hanging out with friends or netflix, and snacks.

VI was astonished by how effective this was for my anxiety. I normally describe my mind as very noisy, but after using this strain it was clear as day!

VThe smell is so flowery I swore this had to have some artificial flavoring added.  However, the dispensary claims this concentrate is pure Hawaiian Haze.  There is a mild burn when you inhale but otherwise the vapor is smooth and sweet.  Perfect for use in public.

VFirst time KNOWINGLY trying a haze type, my husband said I&#39;d be impressed with a haze because of the positive vibes you get from this sativa strain. It has this after taste of fruit and kind of skunky too which I never mind. Smells just how it tastes, fruity and skunky. It&#39;s super sticky and fluffy and the hairs are like tiny orangy feathers, super cute and pretty &#128522;&#128522;. Be smart and get yourself enough to get a good keefe amount because I thought it was great at first but the keefe? My lord it was like BOOM almost knocked me on my ass and I am an avid smoker. My husband is prior military and normally super shy and he was way more open and talkative and not super tired like other strains have made him. Hawaiian haze is the bees knees&#128029;Worth the buy!

VOn first try felt it was a little long of a buzz. Also too hazy/spacy feeling for me. But besides that was a good overall feeling.

VI don&#39;t know what you are smoking but this stuff is absolute crap. It tastes and smells like you are smoking flowers and has absolutely no effect. I have smoked enough other material in the last 35 years to know when something is affecting me and this doesn&#39;t. Don&#39;t waste your time or money. You might as well smoke dried banana peels (remember that one?) for the same effect.
