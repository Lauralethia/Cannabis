VTwo amazing pot Allstar strains. Nothing negative to say about this one. Emerald green, very dense with bright orange to almost yellow hairs, all of it covered in enough crystals as to make it look like a new type of frosted flakes. The flavor is basically a sweet version of Sour D, which to me tastes pretty good. The high is very high energy. Only thing is that when you start to come down after a few hours it can be a little bit more intense than most because of the energy crash.

VNugs are extremely dense and frosty, definitely has an appealing look. One that says, \u201ccome, hold my hand while I melt your mind\u201d. The smell is of diesel and sweet, earthen berries. Not extremely pungent, but exceptionally profiled. The dry toke on the J tastes of a bitter juniper berry. Almost in a savory way... \u000aWhen lit, the taste of the smoke on the inhale is very striking and almost vinegary/dieselly, but then the sweeter notes make an appearance during the exhale. \u000aEffects: You\u2019re almost immediately uplifted, your body and mind feel floaty and weightless, your mind is very alert though, altering your perceptions through your tunnel view vision that has slowly crept on. You\u2019re locked in and everything going on in front of you is made interesting, whether you want it to be or not. Listening to music is entrancingly beautiful. If I had to sum up what Sour Dream invokes: the impossible is now possible.

VThis may be my favorite (early in my history). I only need a good pull or two and I&#39;m out. Hits really hard and fast and keeps you mellow for hours.

VA surprising strain. Not much to look at as far as strains go these days and a smooth, nothingy smoke. About half a king J in it starts to come on, it&#39;s a bit of a creeper.

VA great diesel skunky taste with that hint of fruit makes this a connoisseur&#39;s dream (no pun intended) when it comes to flavor, looks were a bright green slightly fluffy flower covered in trichomes. As far as effects go, this is a new top 5 strain, and that&#39;s out  of the many many many strains I&#39;ve smoked over the years. Cerebral euphoria coupled with energizing body buzz makes this strain great for depression, stress, tiredness, and creativity. Wrote a whole song on guitar after a bowl of this, probably my most technical piece yet, this stain deserves and A+.

V4th fav bud right after trainwreck durban posion and headband, this high you will remember. shoots you up to the clouds with a very silly, visual high which is my favorite. you literally could prolly just sit there close your eyes and imagine whatever. smoked with a bunch of friends and the first five mins (which seemed like 2 hours) just stood there geekin at god knows what. this bud made my eyes the redest theyve ever been and the next morning gave me an unexpecting energetic/creative will to go do things. genetics are Sour Diesel x Blue Dream. idk if its rare but if i see it again im definatly picking this shit back up!

VA great diesel skunky taste with that hint of fruit makes this a connoisseur&#39;s dream (no pun intended) when it comes to flavor, looks were a bright green slightly fluffy flower covered in trichomes. As far as effects go, this is a new top 5 strain, and that&#39;s out  of the many many many strains I&#39;ve smoked over the years. Cerebral euphoria coupled with energizing body buzz makes this strain great for depression, stress, tiredness, and creativity. Wrote a whole song on guitar after a bowl of this, probably my most technical piece yet, this stain deserves and A+.

VThis is my favorite strain by far. Not only does it make you incredibly energetic, it knocks out your depth perception. Great mixture between Sour Diesel and Blue Dream. You can really feel the effects of both, but more dominant towards Sour Diesel. Great smoke.

VAmazing! It is like taking a red bull energy drink straight to the head. I was tired and exhausted before I smoked it aND upon exhale it started kicking in. It gives you tons of energy and it&#39;s like pounding a red bull and it hitting all at once. Left me very social and talkative. Amazing daytime strain. I normally like the downers to relax but this strain has changed my perspective about uplifting strains. Wow, simply wow!

I smoked it and within 15min I was literaly on my ass and unable to move plus cold sweats and the worst dry mouth in the world, after 30 min the sativa broke through and I could move around, then I dosed off and had the most wonderful dreams I,ve ever had then woke up and have a slight buzz but very peaceful.
