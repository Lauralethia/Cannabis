VWhen the budtender brought me the jar of Sensi Star, I thought at first that he had lost his mind. The jar was full of white nugs! Covered in mold? Turns out, these lime green nugs were covered, absolutely covered in white, shiny kief. He opened the jar,  and the scent filled the whole room. This strain is loud, smelling strongly of sweet incense. I picked up an eighth, figuring Beaver Bowls wouldn&#39;t be able to keep this around very long (they didn&#39;t).\u000a\u000aI rolled up two half-gram joints and started out by smoking just half of one.  I have never, never smoked a strain that tasted so sweet -- really, this was like candy. And the effects onset quickly -- an uplifting, euphoric, clear-eyed head high followed shortly by total body relaxation. After 20 minutes, I decided to finish it off, and the heavy indica effects kicked in: a strong desire to sleep, foggy vision, a wavy tingling all over my body. Sleep came quickly. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve smoked this a couple of times since, keeping to just half of a small joint. Sensi Star&#39;s effects are sublime when consumed in moderation. The high is clear, but uplifting, heightening the senses and calming the body. \u000a\u000aI think I&#39;ve found a new favorite.

VI\u2019m new to cannabis. I have been using it for two months now for medical purposes... It has blown me away with how much it has helped my quality of life!!! I use for anxiety, insomnia, and nightmares  related to PTSD. This strain is a beauty. I vape it and after 4-5 hauls, it leads to a big sigh and then the effects are perfect. My body just \u201cdissolves\u201d and completely relaxes. My mind settles and melts into a state of calm. I recommend this highly before bed if the effects I have described are what you are looking for. Thanks, CannTrust.

VThe SensiStar I picked up from Collective Awakenings was a fun and unique high that had great pain relief, but it had a shorter, less intense high than I was expecting. It was a really mellow high with talkative tendencies, while still being productive enough to get things done if you need to (however motivation to do so can be difficult). Definitely had that classic overly citrus flavor.

VI personally love this strain, very relaxing. I hurt from getting used to a new job and this takes my pain away and relieve my stress. It definitely stones you very well body and mind are so relaxed but doesn&#39;t put you to sleep. You can think deep thoughts, enjoy your favorite show or band. It does help you sleep very well but doesn&#39;t knock you out. I am very pleased with this strain as I have been on the Blue Dream as of late which is one of if not my favorite. Sensi Star is right up there with it. I definitely recommend this bud.

Vat first this strain made me feel really happy and optimistic. I started thinking to myself that I was going to start doing yoga everyday and work out a lot.  I also thought that I might try spray tanning. After about 10 minutes I realized I didn&#39;t have the energy to do any yoga or the motivation to work out but I do think I could end up just doing the spray tanning. it&#39;s better than nothing and I still feel happy.

VIt&#39;s a nice classic india strain. If you look closely, you&#39;ll notice that a dense, dank nug of this can look like the actual northern lights, with little kiefy stars and an intergalactic mixture of lights, or, parts of the bud - you can appreciate every  component in this bud just as the way it works in nature. To top it off, stars are seen at night just as this strain is a pretty solid choice to ease nighttime symptoms, such as insomnia and pain.\u000a\u000aWhat I love about this strain is that it helps relieve pain or calm me down enough to sleep, but doesn&#39;t MAKE me fall asleep, so I get into a very comfortable couch lock where I think about deep things for a while, then go to sleep. A last toke before bed can do wonders, because it allows me to fall asleep feeling less pain and less connected to anything that might disturb my sleep. They sure weren&#39;t kidding about how surprisingly cerebral the buzz is, while maintaining pronounced indica traits as true as a patient needs them to be to relieve their condition.\u000a\u000aThe smell/taste are pretty classic - but I love it because I had some of the best times of my life smoking stuff that tasted a lot like Sensi Star. The taste is not like haze or any kind of lemon/grape, it tastes a bit pungent yet sweet and smooth on the lungs.\u000a\u000aOverall, great nighttime strain providing you with not only relief but a chance to think deeply and be comfortable.

VI&#39;m a first time MM user and was very afraid to try it because &quot;back in the day&quot; I used to smoke a lot but stopped due to paranoia and anxiety. So you could say I was afraid to try this for that reason.\u000aI started with one hit of the Sensi Star flower and was very pleasantly surprised. Gives you a bit of a head buzz, but not so bad that you can&#39;t function and it didn&#39;t make me sleepy at all. I do have acute and chronic pain in the ribs and back and it did relax my muscles some, but didn&#39;t get rid of the acute (knife in the) rib pain.\u000aIt did give me a slight headache about three minutes after I took a hit, but the headache went away pretty quickly.\u000aI was also very nauseated before I took a hit and it got rid of the nausea.\u000aI&#39;d say if you&#39;re a Medical Marijuana user and you&#39;re nervous about side effects, this would be a great flower to try.  Very mellow and smooth with very few, if any, side effects.\u000aI also have Meniere&#39;s disease (inner ear disorder that causes vertigo) and was nervous about it causing dizziness. It did very briefly for about 20 seconds after the first hit, but after that I&#39;m fine.\u000aI&#39;d highly recommend this one.

VSensi Star is about to make me a convert to indicas its that good. It has a very pleasant piney taste, a slow to start but incredibly strong pain relieving, euphoric, aphrodisiac stone that for me was accompanied by a happy trippy mental fog. It doesn&#39;t hit me too hard like some indicas that put me right to sleep- it still is great for sleep but doesn&#39;t just knock you on your ass and walk away.

VI&#39;d like to give this strain a good 4.5/5. This strain has helped greatly with my anxiety and insomnia like most &#237;ndicas do. But what I really like about this strain is the hot cold sensation it brings from head to toe. Almost like a euphoric space maneuver feeling as if you&#39;re in space, or space-jumping the moon. Though it has its cons, like dry mouth and dry eyes if you smoke too much, it&#39;s still one of my favorite strains.

VThis will sound negative, but it\u2019s not - this is one of the subtlest highs I\u2019ve ever experienced. The slower come-on contributes to feeling like you\u2019re not even high. But it is there in notable amounts, just strangely elusive when you think about it. Mental space feels sober, unchanged...yet when I start focusing on other senses, I realize how prone my vision is to de-focusing and stoning out blankly. The feels! Skin is tingling all over, rippling with sensation. Emotionally pretty sedate with a glowing peaceful serenity - like what angels feel. There is a current in the background, generating an intense energy, but is kept considerably suppressed under the high\u2019s physically relaxing weight. Mind is kind of clear like Jack strains, but not nearly as euphoric. Music is captivating and entertaining to listen to - easy to follow in a fun way. Watching stuff is equally as good. All things considered, 6/10.

I\u2019m 100% about customer service, the product comes right after that. Call me old school, I\u2019m loyal to one place and this is a journey until I find home.\u000a\u000aThe smell of Sensi Star was much different from what I\u2019m used to. I had to consider the fact I smoked it last 15 years ago when I had a strong nicotine addiction. Today the sweet pungent smell is lighter than I remembered but very clean. BTW this shop is clean, low light. For purposes of this review and to respect the employee\u2019s names the nice lady will be called Michelle. She was friendly and secured my ID as she input my information into the system. (first time for everything I suppose).  Two other customers were hoarding the glass so I just bumped right in, but I did my homework before I came in. Like with everything in life, I have a plan, and an exit. My objective was to secure some Sensi, as much as they would sell me. I have to admit I only had $160 on me, but I love this stuff.\u000aAnyway, back to the review\u2026. I hand roll every joint and I\u2019m a join rolling snob. 10 times out of 10 my joints will be rolled to perfection, without errors. Should I ever roll you a joint, you will remember it just ask for the Drewskibalbou special.\u000aSensi star depending on the management of the hydro will come out two different ways. (this is in my experience). A hit in the face each time followed by the desire to need help finishing the entire joint, or the before work for the medically needed smoke.\u000aI was not blasted at all, but I felt the buzz come on greater with each intake. Exhale\u2026\u2026 no cough! Everything is perfect right now. Taylor Swift is filling my ears, I\u2019m typing my first weed review (host shit I\u2019m ripped out of my mind). But in a way I can function.\u000aDo you understand what I mean? I can play Call of Duty and not nuke my own team, coloring between the lines are waling straight line for the police would be very easy to do.\u000aThis is a smoke for the older crowd not the youngsters looking to pass the blunt, your friend\u2019s wont respect your selection like it deserves. It is, simply \u2013 in a league of it\u2019s own. Cheers to the grow team! The nice man at the counter who I will call D to keep his anonymity safe. I will be back, I have more to try before I make my final decision on your establishment. So far I\u2019m very impressed. I must look for a IN into this industry, it needs a guy like me. Loyal, dependable and honest.\u000a\u000aDrew

VSensi Star hits you, then leaves you with a soothing high and stars flowing through your body. As amazing as it is sitting dazzled on a bench, it is also recommendable to smoke this staggering supernova while driving a bike and having tail wind. A sensational trip follows, where your bike glides smoothly over the ground, while your hands are left stupefied on your handlebars. The lights around you morph into an array of pulsars that would make Com Truise fluctuate as you float through a superficial extend of the universe. As the space settles down, and you find your way down to earth, it leaves you mesmerized and amazed about your venture, and bequeaths a calm and whole feeling to you.

VEuphoric, uplifted, relaxed, happy, creative, pine forest freshness, pungent, earthy taste, not skunky, EXTREMELY STRONG, HITS VERY HARD. Sit on sofa, impossible to drive. 3 other friends out of 3 agree it is one of the most powerful ever smoked. Very good taste in mouth. Very dry eyes, extremely thirsty (I drank 4000ml of water or 17 US cups and still thirsty). Very light taste of other flavors: lime, menthol, mint. Strong taste of pine. Very fresh feeling in mouth.

VI suffer from extreme anxiety to the point where it makes me sick for an entire week straight without food or water. And when I&#39;ve smoked this strain (I usually dab concentrates, so I found sensi star in wax form) and it hits hard, then hits you harder. This strain has really helped me. I&#39;m able to eat and feel relief from anxiety. It&#39;s magical.

VShop Reviewed: Budlandia\u000aItems purchased: Sensi Star 3.5 \u2013 Sour D 3.5\u000aTotal Cost $70\u000aMethod of Intake: Joint\u000aAmount: .5 gram\u000a\u000aSensi Star: 6.2% THC \u2013 11% CBD\u000aBatch: BSL-105\u000a\u000aI would like to start by saying my first purchase and initial expectations was very high. I\u2019m 100% about customer service, the product comes right after that. Call me old school, I\u2019m loyal to one place and this is a journey until I find home.\u000a\u000aThe smell of Sensi Star was much different from what I\u2019m used to. I had to consider the fact I smoked it last 15 years ago when I had a strong nicotine addiction. Today the sweet pungent smell is lighter than I remembered but very clean. BTW this shop is clean, low light. For purposes of this review and to respect the employee\u2019s names the nice lady will be called Michelle. She was friendly and secured my ID as she input my information into the system. (first time for everything I suppose).  Two other customers were hoarding the glass so I just bumped right in, but I did my homework before I came in. Like with everything in life, I have a plan, and an exit. My objective was to secure some Sensi, as much as they would sell me. I have to admit I only had $160 on me, but I love this stuff.\u000aAnyway, back to the review\u2026. I hand roll every joint and I\u2019m a join rolling snob. 10 times out of 10 my joints will be rolled to perfection, without errors. Should I ever roll you a joint, you will remember it just ask for the Drewskibalbou special.\u000aSensi star depending on the management of the hydro will come out two different ways. (this is in my experience). A hit in the face each time followed by the desire to need help finishing the entire joint, or the before work for the medically needed smoke.\u000aI was not blasted at all, but I felt the buzz come on greater with each intake. Exhale\u2026\u2026 no cough! Everything is perfect right now. Taylor Swift is filling my ears, I\u2019m typing my first weed review (host shit I\u2019m ripped out of my mind). But in a way I can function.\u000aDo you understand what I mean? I can play Call of Duty and not nuke my own team, coloring between the lines are waling straight line for the police would be very easy to do.\u000aThis is a smoke for the older crowd not the youngsters looking to pass the blunt, your friend\u2019s wont respect your selection like it deserves. It is, simply \u2013 in a league of it\u2019s own. Cheers to the grow team! The nice man at the counter who I will call D to keep his anonymity safe. I will be back, I have more to try before I make my final decision on your establishment. So far I\u2019m very impressed. I must look for a IN into this industry, it needs a guy like me. Loyal, dependable and honest.\u000a\u000aDrew

VThe bud was very dense and had a nice deep green color to it. This strain totally reeked of weed and left a nice smell lingering. The effects were pretty incredible. I smoked and then proceeded to try to do my homework but, I just couldn&#39;t concentrate on this. I saved it for later and decided I would enjoy this high. It leaves you totally hungry. I haven&#39;t eaten much lately because I&#39;ve been depressed, but this made me forget that I&#39;m depressed and I ate so much and really enjoyed myself. Although, normally I&#39;m not a big fan of anything Indica-dominant because of the sleepiness you get after the high. This bud is no exception. If I could choose, I&#39;d rather get a sativa.

VI&#39;ve smoked Sensi Star on many occasions, each time seeming to be better than the last. I find that with Sensi Star, you don&#39;t need to smoke much to begin feeling effects. Although, I found that smoking to much normally makes for a sleepy come down. \u000a\u000aI found Sensi Star to be very pungent along with both a fruity and flowery taste. The after taste was slightly earthy and spiciness feel.\u000a\u000aWith 1 joint, the high came quickly with some intense effects coming with it. At first you have a very energetic and euphoric feeling along with a constant happy and talkative mood. As you come down you&#39;ll begin to feel more uplifted and relaxed. The come down from Sensi Star normally ends with the feeling of Sleepiness and sometimes hungry. Overall great strain that I highly recommend.

Gets my whole body relaxed, no more anxiety and stress, good head stoned euphoria and uplifting feeling, also gets me couch-locked when consuming more Sensi Star. Great for watching movies or playing video games during the day, or anything that makes you happy, uplifted and euphoric.

Complex stoned: at times get uplifted and euphoric, at times get relaxed and couch-locked, at times I don&#39;t feel anything after a few bowls and all of a sudden I am tripping out and happy. Great oldschool strain. The Rival strain in My Opinion, that Sensi Star has to beat in an all-around plant domination, is Dutch Passion - GlueBerry O.G. More trichomes, more aroma and taste unbelievable smell and taste, longer lasting stoned, more complex stoned, faster flowering to finish, big colas like size of Sensi Star colas, healthy growing Organic soil all-around no hard problems in Organic soil (best aroma and taste), and the tolerance build-up is endless from GlueBerry O.G., you get stoned from every hit and feel every hit, not unlike most strains that have a tolerance build-up. Sensi Star is a Legend, its tough Rival will definitely be Dutch Passion - GlueBerry O.G. Both hardest hitting strain to Date.

Sensi Star is a Legend, its tough Rival will definitely be Dutch Passion - GlueBerry O.G. Both hardest hitting strain to Date.

VI&#39;ve smoked Sensi Star on many occasions, each time seeming to be better than the last. I find that with Sensi Star, you don&#39;t need to smoke much to begin feeling effects. Although, I found that smoking to much normally makes for a sleepy come down. \u000a\u000aI found Sensi Star to be very pungent along with both a fruity and flowery taste. The after taste was slightly earthy and spiciness feel.\u000a\u000aWith 1 joint, the high came quickly with some intense effects coming with it. At first you have a very energetic and euphoric feeling along with a constant happy and talkative mood. As you come down you&#39;ll begin to feel more uplifted and relaxed. The come down from Sensi Star normally ends with the feeling of Sleepiness and sometimes hungry. Overall great strain that I highly recommend.

VSo what initially attracted me to this strain was the name. Before medically or recreationally legalized, I knew this name, even as a teenager. I&#39;ve had &quot;sensi star&quot; before, but this, this I know is, and it lives up to the reputation.  The second thing that attracted me was the THC content. I purchased this at the green solution, and it was labeled at 30.4% THC. Boom. I didn&#39;t want to smoke this when I first got home, so I waited until later in the evening when I was free from distraction and able to channel my thoughts and experiences. So... Sensi star. After not even one bong pack, I was incredibly high and happy. My personal notes (experiences with different strains) include &quot;SUPER DOPE HIGH! Happy has fuc...&quot; And as a rating, 10/5. It&#39;s spacey and uplifting, relaxing and satisfying. I felt at peace, content, tranquil... Like as close to calm as this crazed mind has ever been. I&#39;m really anxious, I have insomnia, and kind of fear sleeping, based on that first experience (no anxiety, calm, and relaxed), I hope this will cuddle me into a soft sleep as I take my last and final tokes. Cheers. KyleGHAD (add me on instagram same name)

Kinda like ak47 its strong and makes u feel nice for sure but it&#39;s not overpowering like other strains can be. Personally I prefer strong strains(sour, girl scout, OG, etc.) but this strain will creep up on you and you may find yourself uncontrollably coughing or eating so smoke with caution haha but I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty f&#39;n good.. Smoking one with some music right now.. Not a bad idea either. Happy smokin :)

VThis strain...I&#39;ve been wanting to be a budtender since I&#39;ve had my med license, and when I buy from a shop, I would expect the person selling it to me would know their product, because I feel like I can do a better job than they can. That&#39;s why I&#39;m posting this review. I was told this was a sativa hybrid, and apparently it&#39;s an indica. The bud is great, but I wanted to chill and clean the house, not chill and take a nap!

VI got this from Encanto Green Cross, as it&#39;s one of their house strains so they usually have it in.. They stopped testing their stuff a LONG time ago, but they randomly tested their Sensi Star AND Blue Dream (I happened to have bought both of these last time I was there so I know I have the batches they tested)... Long story short, the Sensi came in at ~11% thc with a good amount of cbd, while the Blue Dream (Sativa Dom) tested at 19%. Me and my fianc&#233;e smoked both of them without much preference ( Im just a blue dream fan but) she smoked like all the sensi as she prefers indica, but she had NO CLUE it was 11%.  So either the testing is off, or the actual % of thc doesn&#39;t matter as much as the entire make up of the plant.  So assuming the test is accurate a 19% sensi star I imagine would be pretty strong (coming from someone who considers 200mg of thc 1 dose with my edibles)

VEven though I only got to try this strain once, it was awesome. It was around 7-8 years ago and it was the first time I got to try an actual strain. Before this, the weed I tried never had it&#39;s own name, was just generalized as &quot;regs&quot; and &quot;mids&quot;. Which weren&#39;t that bad given I can still get high from them.  But later on I learned about Haze, strains like this one, etc. I only smoked for like maybe 1, almost 2 years at this point. My friend&#39;s older brother was friends with this guy from Manhattan, (I&#39;m from NY), and I bought a gram of the Sensi Star for $20. When my friend and I got home, we were already high but were dying to try weed new to us. After a few hits, maybe a bowl or two, can&#39;t remember, we were both laying back on my bed with this almost overwhelming euphoric body buzz. We were listening to music and I remember us talking about how much the music was intensified (Idk about you, but I always loved the way music coincides well with cannabis). It was the first time we got to try what I feel is &quot;real&quot; Cannabis. When I ever see anything below what is basically medicinal quality weed, I just ask &quot;why?&quot;

VMigraine pain mild; nausea 7-8 when I medicated round 1530 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. No anxiety/paranoia (an absolute must for me). Head high energetic; must be a Sativa dominant version of Sensi Star. :-) Body high allowed me to kick laundry&#39;s @$$! High lasted 3 + hours; very nice. Haven&#39;t been good with taste lately. Highly recommend for daytime use for pain/nausea.

VThis is the one for me! After trying several strains, this is the one that does not take a lot to have a huge effect to my calmness and anxiety\u2019s of life. I like feeling chill but not couch locked. This one allows me to focus and work it how I want, it\u2019s hard to describe cause it just fits so well for me I\u2019m so happy. Yes I\u2019m high as I write this. Lol My second round to be sure the first was not just an anomaly lol. I\u2019m super excited about this one and it\u2019s gonna be a keeper. Reminds me of Cindy White when I was in Colorado. That\u2019s another good long lasting one that I miss. Eliminates any stomach pains, muscle, headache, etc. only annoying thing about being this high is that high pitch ringing I hear. Lol

My first impressions were that I was hungry as fuck and it made me laugh a lot. But after a bit the body high hit me like a damn truck and I instantly felt super relaxed and sleepy. I got back home and I slept for 6 hours straight. Best nap ever! Would definitely recommend Sensi Star to anyone who suffers insomnia or anxiety.

VThis strain comes on strong with the first hit, and immediately gives you the notice that you&#39;re therezo for bearzo.\u000a\u000aIt generates a euphoric yet subdued feeling, uplifting effects to help both anxiety and depression. Helps with back pain and muscle pain. Not too much of a couch lock feeling, and I can actually get really motivated and energized from this strain! Helps with the stress that keeps you from doing things. \u000a\u000aIt has an earthy and aromatic flavor profile.

VThis review is for Sensi Star (produced by ORGROW).  Flower smells musky, pungent, and sour.  Kinda how someone expects marijuana to smell.  Taste is super light and enjoyable.  I smoked about 3/4 of a joint and after about 10 minutes, I was hungry as hell and feeling real good.  If you want to be couch-locked try Sensi Star.  This strain is great for sitting around playing video games or watching tv.  Definitely more appropriate for a night in.  Only downside is the high only last about 45 min - 1 hour, but it potent and good otherwise.

VSensi Star is an indica with a punch. Smoking it can be a bit harsh so for those looking to avoid lung irritation I suggest vaping or trying an edible. The body high on this one is very strong. There&#39;s an intense body buzz that is sedating but surprisingly clear-headed. Sensi Star is best for indoor or evening use when you&#39;re not quite ready for bed yet but not needing a lot of activities to be done.\u000a\u000aFollow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.

I smoked a little when I was having a 3 out of 5 migraine (3 being a very bad pounding headache overall uncomfortable and slightly nauseous and 5 being throwing up and laying down on my bed in the dark until it goes away) - and while it didn&#39;t leave me symptom free, my headache became so faint I forgot about it. I slept through the night without waking up once, and the next morning felt energized!\u000a\u000amost exciting was the body buzz I got from this like it was first time smoking. very powerful even for the seasoned smoker.

VAfter my initial very favorable rating, I continued experimenting for a few weeks. Continuing use revealed a tendency toward paranoia. \u000a\u000aI also developed a painful medical condition during this time, and discovered that this strain actually *worsened the pain severely*. The pain was enough to make me quit daily use completely, until I recovered more, and was able to secure a new and more balanced strain.\u000a\u000aI would caution the user- this strain is very psychoactive- perhaps too much so. Preparing beforehand with a heavier, more relaxing strain could reward the experimenter.

Was hoping that it wouldn&#39;t get me panicky, because that&#39;s what most weed does to me. I am yet to find a strain that doesn&#39;t make me anxious, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to try the strains that are specifically for anti-anxiety. Can anybody, that has chronic anxiety or panic attacks, recommend a strain?

VI wish more sativa which I think is skunk was mixed in with this because the afghani they most likely used for the cross is rather boring and bland. The skunk influence I think is obvious to me with the color of the hairs and the smell of the bud and having come from an amsterdam seedbank. The afghani contained in the cross is ok but nothing really special about it and the skunk is the main thing that adds the smell and the flavor to this smoke. I think the growers were going for a phenotype of skunk and to get more of the compact stout bud structure of indicas and smaller growing period. This strain was ok but I would rather just recommend blueberry for an indica or just any skunk dominant cross for a sativa high.

VI smoked a J of this just a bit ago. Awesome bud! Good taste, nice, light head high with more of it felt in your body. Waves of heat corse thru my body as I finish smoking this. I just sat and enjoyed the pain relief I was feeling - i have fibro and this seems pretty nice for pain relief. Smoke some of this while listening to dub music and you will understand why they call it Sensi Star! One Love..\u000a\u000a-EuphoricVoyage

Reminds me of Cindy White when I was in Colorado. That\u2019s another good long lasting one that I miss.

VI have to give this strain a 5 star rating. I have smoked for about 2 months now, with a really great experience so far. A friend of mine has let me try some of the more well-known strains. OG Kush, Taho OG, Lemon Haze, Northern Lights, just to name a few. All very high quality. I tried this strain just to experience something different. \u000a\u000aAnd WOW! Amazing body and head high. Really make you feel weightless and content. Air flow sensory is very high and Gives you a sense of comfort. Lights and Sound are stellar and a different experience like never before \u000a\u000aPerfect Pain Killer, Mellow creativity sparket, and sleep aid. .

VWhen I opened my container for the first time, it had the most wonderful smell. Like key lime pie. The buds are a vivid green with patches of red hairs. On the inside is a much lighter shade, sparkling with crystals. I almost don&#39;t want to smoke it. Too pretty. I did though. Wow! I was very high for the first 15 minutes. Like stuck in my couch groove. Then it mellows out, and I&#39;m pleasantly buzzed for an hour or two. Medically speaking, this is fantastic for my PTSD related panic issues, assuming I can get somewhere quiet for the first few minutes. I feel less paranoid than I tend to with other high thc strains. Also, maybe the most delicious strain I&#39;ve used in my vaporizer so far. Like a citrusy hug for my mouth.

Vlets get up into the stars and we will start from there. Today were smoking Sensi Star, a really potent indica strain, paired really well with a sweet pungent smells and flavours, the buds are nice and dense with a light green tint all the way through, wrapped in potent orange hairs, and finished of with a nice frost over all the nugs, Sensi Star will have you feeling very relaxed and euphoric, being on the strong side you may encounter heavy body relaxation which in turn will assist in pain/stress relief and can help get you seeing stars

VI tried this strain for the first time today. My friend recommended we take this since I could not sleep one single minute last night because of insomnia. My first impressions were that I was hungry as fuck and it made me laugh a lot. But after a bit the body high hit me like a damn truck and I instantly felt super relaxed and sleepy. I got back home and I slept for 6 hours straight. Best nap ever! Would definitely recommend Sensi Star to anyone who suffers insomnia or anxiety.

VJust a note to the person seeking an anti-anxiety smoke:  sativas tend to be better for this purpose than indicas.  I&#39;ve found that the indicas tend to interfere with motor skills a bit and this can cause an anxiety reaction including raising heartbeat.  Sativas have much less of this effect.  You might want to explore an outdoor grown sativa and see if you do better with it.

VSome dank nugg it has a very pungent odor somewhere along the line of a citrus pine taste, it&#39;s a very nice Sativa strain to say the least. It&#39;s a strong head high but still has a nice body high overall a nice strain
