VI had a main branch break off half way through flower.  Off of a single bowl I was super energized.  Folding laundry, vacuuming, and made a delicious dinner for my girls.  had a hankering for citrus flavored candy, but didn&#39;t have the munchies at all.  Stay away from a second bowl unless your ready to crash.  seriously you might hurt yourself

VOne of the few strains I avoid. It makes me feel wired and irritable. HOWEVER, this strain was my wife\u2019s strain of choice after each of her chemotherapy treatments from breast cancer. This strain eased her nausea like no other.

VNot as racy as other sativa doms I&#39;ve had. comes on wonderfully, a bit slow after about an hour though. found it to be a great aphrodisiac.

VIts Nirvanas go at Jack Herer.\u000a\u000aThe unique and best thing about these types of strains are their combination with northern lights which brings you a nice sativa experience without too much negative. If you enjoy indica and want to try a sativa without it being too strong of a sativa this will do. \u000a\u000aThe munchies are uncontrollable at least for me on this one, and its the reason I probably wont use it again. Since I am a daily user and the will power to stop the craving isn&#39;t strong enough :P\u000a\u000aThe smells and taste and standard of good quality but nothing special.
