VTried out this flavor in one of my oil cartridges tasted amazing exactly like blueberries too.Strong fruity smell even from the cartridge. \u000a\u000aEffects: Made me very positive, a good head high but also a great body high, Some might even say they see visuals from this strain also very euphoric.\u000a\u000a

V6/30/16( 1:24 am) I did this hybrid 20mins ago the head high is definitely there. Body high is there as well but on the verry mild side. The effects on my body is a super heavy dryness and rednes in my eyes. This strand feels to me like  the cooler cousin of bd. My vision is clear i feel like i could use this durring the day while driving around town. I feel uplifted effects along with happines and a mild hunger which i dont mind. This is one of my fav strains right now. I recommend this strain to both experienced users as well as first time users.

VThe buds were very dense which contributed to the strong immediate effects I experienced. I\u2019ve smoked upwards of 30 different strains and I can honestly say nothing has had me so paralyzed. \u000a\u000aKeep My in mind my method of smoking is primarily out of an 20 inch 9mm thick  beacker bong, I dose my self with a high concentration of THC; I consistently smoke .4 - .5 bong rips. That dose may explain the adverse affects I had to this specific strain. \u000a\u000aDefinitely a indica dominant hybrid with the couch lock effect. After my first rip my body was so relaxed that after standing up I felt dizzy. I also experienced some sort of an allergic reaction to the strain, my chest felt like it had a 30 pound weight on it. I thought i was honestly having a heart attack. I Asked around and one other person I know had this same reaction to the bud. He only smokes a fraction of what I smoke so I concluded that the bud was so flame that it almost killed me. \u000a\u000aI regretablely purhased an ounce of this stuff so I ended up smoking the rest of it. I noticed the abnormal side effect I experinelced depletes to where I no longer notice it. So I end my review with a 6 star rating cause this weed got me the highest I\u2019ll ever be

VAfter vaping 3 bowls of this I went on a sunset bike ride. I experienced a high I can only relate to tripping on acid. I had the sensation that the road and I were one being. All the colours in my peripheral vision blended into one amazing stream of light. I no longer felt like I was part of this earth but I was still able to weave inbatwean cars and not get hit.  Something I failed to do when I was actually tripping. I managed 17 miles worth of this feeling then it it turned into a very chill high with little munchies.

VBlueberry Yum Yum definitely lives up to its name! It has a strong berry mint smell to it and the effects took about 5 minutes to settle in.  Before I knew it... it had been an hour!  This strain gives me a super nice clear high with uplifting effects... not a whole lot of euphoria or brain fog which is ideal for anexiety and ADHD patients.  Definitely recommend working out or taking a nice stroll while puffin this one!!  Puts you in a spectacular mood and gives you motivation.\u000a\u000a~HIGHLY RECOMMENDED~

VAfter years of scouting around the amsterdam dungeon and keeping a close eye on a site i found when i google&#39;d coffeeshopmenus and it has a org on the end i found out i was searching 10 minutes the wrong way from... the redlight district, at a place named the greenplace they have had it for a few months on and off or even a few years and i just never even walked into it... I tried blueberry amnesia, blueberry cheese, blueberry headband it dont mean a thing... because i got the ultimate mary jane.  It taste like blueberry, and i would say its definitely more of a indica than a sativa but yeah its good bro. If you find it somewhere pick it up if you&#39;re like me and would like a blueberry strain for any time of the day, and if you&#39;re from amsterdam like me go to the greenplace or atleast check that site bro at the time of date they still got it i picked up 3 grams (it was my leftover change from 3 other shops...) but it came as a single bud with a 0.1 tiny crumb... cute girl behind the counter too... coffeeshop was thinking damn as i was bumping ludacris&#39;s song and the guy next to me just bought some moonrocks for 35 i got the yumyum for same price and he saw my bag and i saw him regret instantly that 10 seconds ago he traded bags basically LOL !!!

VMy favorite strain is anything blueberry. This one might be number one. The aroma can only be described as running fast first into a blueberry field. It\u2019s incredible. The flavor is just the same. The high is uplifting, with a spot of relaxation. It really is a wonderful balance. Just a spectacular strain.

VAfter years of scouting around the amsterdam dungeon and keeping a close eye on a site i found when i google&#39;d coffeeshopmenus and it has a org on the end i found out i was searching 10 minutes the wrong way from... the redlight district, at a place named the greenplace they have had it for a few months on and off or even a few years and i just never even walked into it... I tried blueberry amnesia, blueberry cheese, blueberry headband it dont mean a thing... because i got the ultimate mary jane.  It taste like blueberry, and i would say its definitely more of a indica than a sativa but yeah its good bro. If you find it somewhere pick it up if you&#39;re like me and would like a blueberry strain for any time of the day, and if you&#39;re from amsterdam like me go to the greenplace or atleast check that site bro at the time of date they still got it i picked up 3 grams (it was my leftover change from 3 other shops...) but it came as a single bud with a 0.1 tiny crumb... cute girl behind the counter too... coffeeshop was thinking damn as i was bumping ludacris&#39;s song and the guy next to me just bought some moonrocks for 35 i got the yumyum for same price LOL !!!

VAwesome strain! Very strong blueberry taste on the exhale, one of the best tasting strains I have ever had. Definitely have to play blueberry yum yum song while listening to this. This strain brings a huge wave of euphoria while not making you overly tired. Easy to sleep with, but not necessary. This strain does not limit you to much, makes me very talkative. One of my favorites!
