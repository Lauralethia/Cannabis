VFor a sour diesel strain being a component, it&#39;s not too heavy or hurts your lungs if you&#39;re sensitive to it. I also loved banana OG. Had to try it. Great high, immediately hits the frontal liberal lol. Lasts a long time and got a surprise burst of energy for a good long while. Pain was greatly lessened as well during this sesh!

Vvery nice sativa dominant strain. got from Minerva Canna Group, Inc. in Albuquerque NM. tested at 19.79%THC and .12%CBD. very heavy head buzz, very creative and powerful but no paranoia what so ever.distinctive taste like something tropical with a bit of citrus. overall very nice medicine. help with ptsd, anxiety, and help get my mind off pain a tad bit. will try again someday and would recommend to anyone wanting a nice strong head buzz with a nice taste to boot.&#128526;&#128559;&#128568;&#128077;\u270c

VThis lovely strain is slowly gut surely, creeping its way up my &quot;Top Bud&quot; list. I think this bud is a sleeper, and will be a very popular one soon. As it deserves to be. It provided me with a wonderful....ummm...what i would call a &quot;tingly body cerebal high&quot;. It definitely is majorly sticking to its heavy roots of sativa. With its nice pressure almost massage like feeling of a head high. But also its hybrid roots show in its slight almost ticklish feet to back of spine. Which is it&#39;s Indica roots peeking its beautiful head up out of this lovely strain&#39;s genetic pool. Mix all that with frosty nugs and light carrot like color of orange hairs. and not to forget to mention just sweet diesel...let me say that again, SWEET DIESEL....smell....mmmmmmmmmmm this a must try strain for all partakers of this beautiful thing of ours.

VFantastic. Picked up an 1/8th at Pig n Whistle in Denver. Great dispensary, super friendly \u263a\ufe0f. \u000aMan, this sour banana sherbet has a great clean high, mouth coating diesel flavor with a sweet - tart finish. Vaped this in the Pax3 - glorious. \u000a\u000aIt has taken me an hour to write this- this strain, respect this strain. It is a creeper haha- \u000aClean head high and a great focused high.

VI got this strain in a free pre-roll by recommendation from my budtender, and I don&#39;t necessarily think it would have been one I would have picked for myself as I tend to shy away from hybrids in favor of pure sativas. I got this during a particular rough week dealing with mental health issues, and smoked the pre-roll late in the evening while in a lethargic, grumpy state, and oh my! Did this lift my spirits immediately! I went from a moody lump on my bed to giggly and played my piano for the first time that week. Definitely the pick-me-up I needed.\u000a\u000aThe smoke itself is light and not an overly harsh smoke by any means. I normally share a 1g pre-roll with my husband, but I smoked this one to myself without being weighed down.

VThis strain is an amazing strain for stress and depression. Sweet smelling, covered in crystals, breaks apart to show thick rich nugs. The flavor is surprisingly sweet, and no &quot;resin mouth&quot;. While it didn&#39;t do much for my pain, it did relieve the stress from my back enough that when paired with a normal OTC I was able to have a good night&#39;s rest. Careful with this strain, you may end up being overly talkative.

VReminded me a lot of a sweeter tasting Sour Diesel. The flowers are a beautiful emerald green packed with sandy colored calyxes, and coated in sugar. The smell is gassy and a little sweet. The pungency tingles the nose some. The flavors are similar to sour diesel; really fuely with a nice smooth tropical awesomeness on the exhale. The effects come on quickly and are very heady. Nicely balanced and focusing. It was a little more relaxing than Sour Diesel. It was pretty enjoyable. Growing this lady can be a bit difficult due to her sensitivity to nutrients. Let her flower to about 13 weeks and she will reward you with frosty cosmically stimulating flowers.

I&#39;ve had good luck with other Crockett Family Farms strains before and this one continues the streak. pale green nugs, wispy pale red calyxes coated in trichs. head change kicks in immediately, equal parts euphoric and focused? hard to explain but welcome. super upbeat, can&#39;t stop smiling, there is a bit of body buzz as well. Can&#39;t get a hint of banana anything which is great. This would be a great wake and bake, morning, afternoon or strain to introduce a first time patient to.

VVery potent and rapid-onset Sativa leaning Hybrid with surprisingly clear and mellow Indica afterglow. Novice users prone to panic and anxiety should exercise caution. Experienced users will be in for a treat! SBH will, without a doubt, cause some anxiety but it&#39;s up to you how to handle that aspect of it. Acknowledge the annoying beast for a minute or two, but don&#39;t go home with it, know what I mean? SBH is a better version of morning coffee/energy drink. If you&#39;re an artist/geek/nerd of any sort, you&#39;ll seriously fall in love with this. Even if you&#39;re not one of the creatives, you&#39;ll still reap some great benefits. \u000a\u000aAlthough it gets a bit intense at times, it&#39;s still very pleasant and very enjoyable experience. Listen to music, watch something funny, chat-up your friends/colleagues, SBH likes to be both introverted and extroverted at once. Creative? Write things, create things, they don&#39;t have to be good, just write all your ideas down, your brain will be flooded with an influx of new ideas and possibilities. \u000a\u000aSour Banana Sherbet outta be listed in Top 10 Ten Strains list every single year. I hope it doesn&#39;t get too cloned like Gorilla Glue and Bruce Banner have. Is it too intense to write  &#39;PROTECT SOUR BANANA SHERBET AT ALL COST!&#39;? Seriously -- This is such a lovely and uplifting strain that it would be a shame to lose it. A little bit of it goes a long way. Share it with the ones you love, don&#39;t abuse it, treat it like fine Wine. Bust it out as a Specialty, because that&#39;s what it falls under. \u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aTL;DR - Tasty Sativa with a cerebral and uplifting high, suggested to experienced users. Get creative, go outside (or stay in, whatves brah), enjoy this gem.\u000a\u000aProudly served by Sira Naturals @ Somerville, Massachusetts.

VGreat strain. Flavorful, I got lots of the banana with some hints of the diesel. Choked me up a bit more than most other strains smoking from a glass bong so pretty potent.\u000a\u000aThis is one of those strains where you stink up a 10 foot radius everywhere you walk unless you put it in a sealed container. Seems to me it is more on the indica side.

VI got this on special for a bottom-shelf price, and it did not disappoint. This was quite potent, but the smoke was smooth\u2014no coughing\u2014and pleasant, if a little vague. This particular bud didn&#39;t quite live up to the smell and taste of its name, but I have no other frame of reference: fruity, sweet and sour. But you could just have easily called this any of the other off-the-wall names out there. It tastes like good weed.  \u000a\u000aIt definitely leans sativa considering my ability to stay on task for this review. If you like Sour Diesel, try this one out.

VBest shit I have ever smoked. I prefer it over sour diesel in fact. Gets me super high and for a long time too. It makes me forget what I&#39;m doing about 100x each time and it just gives me a constant feeling of happy and relaxed. Great for depression, anger, and anxiety (I have extreme problems in all three of those categories so trust me I know). Obviously i couldve gotten poorly grown sour diesel, but honestly this strain has beaten all other strains I have had as well. Strains I&#39;ve had are &quot;blue dream&quot; (it wasnt blue dream my old plug fucked me over so it WASNT blue dream), super lemon haze, cotton candy kush, sour banana sherbet, and sour diesel. Sour banana sherbet just gets me stupidly high. If you wanna get stoned, pick up some sour banana sherbet. If you wanna get happy and energetic but with a less intense high, pick up some sour diesel or some super lemon haze. Sour banana sherbet is so far my favorite strain by far, but then again I havent experienced a lot of strains still.

VHowdy, Stoners!&#160; &#160;It&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve reviewed a dabbable, but here goes!&#160; I went to my usual Oregon Grown Gift shop in hopes of obtaining a different $25 quarter, but it was Dawg Trap again - excellent strain, but I have some already.\u000a\u000aI went over to the concentrates section and lo and behold, shatter was only $20!&#160; I picked up two of them, and tonite I&#39;m flying on Sour Banana Diesel&#160;,also known as Sour Banana Sherbet per White Label Extracts.&#160; It tested out at 70.48% THC and no CBD.\u000a\u000aI normally do dabs once a month or less, but for whatever reason I wanted to do them tonite, and I&#39;ve had 2 dabs of Sour Banana Diesel and I must say dabs go a long way, more so even than the cartridges.&#160; It seems like one smallish dab lasts me 8 strong hits or so and the taste is so pure, more so than cartridges, and it seems to hit harder, faster, and even more cerebrally.\u000a\u000aSour Banana Diesel smells and tastes as it sounds, and I feel like I&#39;m riding a magic carpet fueled by sour diesel flying over plantain fields in the Caribbean.&#160;I personally find this to be a more sativa dominant hybrid because while it&#39;s true I&#39;m getting sleepy, this feels more like a sativa to me because my head feels quite sparkly and I&#39;m listening to pounding club music at bedtime.\u000a\u000aI am so elevated from from these two dabs I cannot do any more and am going to bed.&#160; Peace, Love and Joy, Everyone!

VSolid daytime strain. Very clear headed and focused high. Like others have said, it is more of a sativa than anything else. The sour diesel (AJ&#39;s) comes through more than the banana sherbet and makes it a strong candidate for those suffering from anxiety and want a strain that leaves you able to function while taking care of your worry. I even tried to vape a high amount to spike my anxiety but was unsuccessful. Recreationally speaking this was not a strain that I would purchase again, even when taken in high doses, it left me wanting more of a euphoric head high but my head just got clearer and clearer. Not much to write home about on the smell or taste (vaped through volcano) either which was a bummer with such a great name. Leafly is correct that this would be a great strain for concentrate producers as my kief chamber had a lovely dusting after grinding up about 2g. All in all this is a solid strain that was all medical for me. Happy toking!\u000a\u000aPS. It turns your stomach into a bottomless pit too

VSeveral simple things to note about this strain.  First and foremost, the most interesting part of this flower has a two pronged approach.  The first prong will have nothing to do with a lot of folks who in fact will crown me &quot;dumbass&quot; by the end of this paragraph.  But we can&#39;t all be &quot;smartass&#39;s&quot; can we? It is a good thing cannabis is part of my life otherwise there might always be a linguistic glitch in my vocab.  The word after Sour Banana does not actually rhyme with &quot;Herbert&quot;nor does it have an &quot;r&quot; in it.  In getting caught up in the same hype that is nearly one in six across the globe.  But the pronunciation as Sherbert and just as often one in six times spelled this incorrect way.  \u000a\u000aAccording to a language expert at Smithsonian it is a common habit of English speakers to unconsciously rhythm syllables that look alike.  This taking into account there was also a song around 1939 called &quot;Shoot the Sherbet to me Herbert&quot; which spelled correct, but bent wording to rhythm.  Outside of the United States, Sherbet is a stick of candy dipped in sweet powder much like Fun Dip the candy is a commercialized version.  With so much sway on the world and due to enough widespread use of the second pronunciation with &quot;r&quot; both words were added into the dictionary.\u000a\u000aJust think if we could legalize cannabis in a general open forum across the country as big as ours without widespread chaos as all the lies that came with propaganda of prohibition are proven wrong.  Imagine the ripple of freedom and peace of mind that will be able to sweep across the world.  Sour Banana Sherbet will def aid in that wave of euphoria and bliss as it is a jolly herb great for mood enhancement, libido, and slight pain, but would not count on it for anything serious.  Very down the middle hybrid, slightly boring if not for the second prong which all can enjoy alike not just the &quot;didn&#39;t know it alls&quot;.\u000a\u000aThe color is a really nice yellow-green with the former overpowering the latter in a superbly green slime hue.  Made me have to break out Ghostbusters.  Just totally love this color, snot,  lichen, ectoplasm, my great grandmother&#39;s house, sherbet which of course never had an &quot;r&quot;.  But did have a nice musky sweet taste.  All in all this flower was an experience, didn&#39;t get very high off the bud itself.  Whoever named this strain inadvertently ended some more of my ignorance at the ice cream stand.  Amen!!  Want to spray paint my soul the color of this bud and be a lily pad on rainy days like these.

VSweet tasting and relaxing. While it doesn&#39;t stand out as a phenomenal strain in my opinion, it will certainly put a user in a great, chill vibe after smoking.

VActually, and disappointingly, I was entirely underwhelmed by this! I read these great reviews, and bought some, but for me, this is whole lot of nothing. It was in no way remarkable. I know in this site, we can provide our own experience, and most of the time I find reviews are really in line with my own experience, but not on this occasion.\u000a\u000aI found it made me sleepy, distracted, hungry, and I went to sleep quite soon after smoking (vaping). I used the dynavap M.\u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t make any effort to look out for this one again, although I&#39;m glad I tried it, and thanks as always to everyone who shares their experiences on Leafly for us.\u000a\u000a:)

VIt does smell like Fruity Pebbles, one of my fav strains compassion center only has it once in a while so I grab it when it&#39;s there but my friends love it it is a little harsh tasting but then again I use blunt wraps so could of been  the flav wrap I bought at the time. But it&#39;s close to my fav strain I don&#39;t know exact name strawberry something but that one to smelled and tasted like fruity pebbles
