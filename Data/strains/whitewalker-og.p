VHelped my PTSD symptoms instantly. Was feeling agitated and wired af, knew I&#39;d need a high dose of sedatives but gave this a try before meds. It calmed me down back to a super safe and grounded state. No more agitation and rage. Feel like myself again. There is some sort of euphoric or mood lifting effect, which is great because it&#39;s gentle, not racing thoughts. Oh! Forgot to mention I ended up not needing those powerful sedatives at all!\u000aI&#39;ll need to see a repeat of this excellent effect, but I&#39;m very impressed.\u000aI highly recommend this when you have extreme emotional activation, and need a gentle way to come back into the moment. Combine it with mindfulness exercises and you&#39;ve just pulled yourself out of a massive episode woohoo! Going back to the dispensary tomorrow to buy more.

VI have been looking for a good solid Indica nighttime strain. Tried this one on a recommendation from a dispensary staff and I&#39;m glad I listened! It helps me relax and get to sleep shortly after my smoke.! So far one of the best strains for nighttime that inhale found. Good buds, smooth smoke, nice effects.

VStuff is incredible and tastes like a sativa with its lemon-fruity smoothness to it. Can smoke it at anytime and feel less stressed and anxious in my day without the negatives of most indicas (sleepy). Few bowls of it however, if not experienced smoker, will be found with its stressfree hit to be tiring... so maybe don&#39;t take my advice and take hits before doing chores or work like me! \u000a\u000aCan see myself smoking this one as I get older.

VI give the same spiel every time I visit the dispensary; I love the physical effects of a good indica, but don&#39;t want to be knocked out.  I&#39;m an artist and musician who likes to indulge and get busy, a productive stoner if you will.  This strain was suggested to me by the bud tender when what I really wanted had just sold out. \u000a\u000aMaybe it&#39;s my own expectations/disappointment, but this strain just managed to knock me out without really providing the pain relief and relaxation I was hoping for.  To top it off, it made me incredibly itchy, and didn&#39;t taste particularly good either. This could be ok if this is the kind of thing you look for in your pot, but it&#39;s not for me.

I tried this to help with my clinical anxiety and panic disorder, and man does it do the trick. I feel relaxed, happy, and floaty. But not so much that I can&#39;t accomplish what needs to get done. This strain has also brought back my appetite for the first time in a week. I&#39;m ravenous! Highly recommend this for people with anxiety and depression! Just start slow and smoke more if you need it.

You&#39;ve be warned.\u000a\u000aSecondly, the moment our break was over and we got back to work, it&#39;s like my body said &quot;Sleep bitch&quot;. I wanted to take a nap so bad.

VI&#39;ve been an avid smoker for 4 years now. Sativa&#39;s recently made me get bad anxiety so I moved over to hybrids. They too had a similar effect. I decided I&#39;d give weed one last try before I completely stopped (did not want to go through with this at all). Read from here that WWOG is great and it sounded like a strain I could handle. Just got a gram of it less than an hour ago. Smoked a small bowl and I feel amazing. Made me reminiscent of how my highs used to be. I highly recommend White Walker OG for a subtle relaxing high. Even though its an indica, I definitely feel like I can still go out and get stuff done.

VPotent! Three or four hits are more than enough for a couple hour ride, more than that will get you blasted off to space for a few hours no problem. Starts after 5-10 minutes and then goes into a pretty strong head high with anything from some visual effects to multiple trains of thought. After an hour or two, it begins to fade which has a sedative effect. Great for the end of the day and watching tv with food. The body high is there but not too pronounced, a great way to get rid of soreness or joint pain without being locked to the couch.

VVaporized at 228 degrees farenheight\u000aLess than 0.1 grams\u000a**tastes much earthier than it smells**\u000a\u000aIt is a very mellow strain.  After a little bit of this indica you will want to relax and have a bath rather than shower and go on an adventure.  It is a great strain for the evening when doing something quiet at home and still needing to be cerebral enough to focus on complex tasks.  The high is more body focused than it is cerebral believe it or not.  \u000a\u000aI have grown super comfortable with OG strains.  I would consider this OG strain to be one of my to go-to strains right away if given a choice.  OG bred strains tend to carry the gist of what I look for in bud. Especially this one.  This strain is seen at its lowest at 15% THC which is 1% higher than the median norm of the THC%  in potency 15 years ago. If this were a stock, would you buy or sell this stock?Depending on the market cap, I would buy enough to sell enough to make a minor difference to show my seriousness in the market.

VA nice strong indica I enjoy in the afternoon. Soon after the first bowl you can feel the muscles beginning to relax and a great warm calm encompasses you without making you feel to weighed down and couch locked like some other big indicas. My mind was able to stay clear which is nice to be able to finish daily tasks and maintain focus. Bag appeal was minimal but resinous, once ground nice pine and resinous terpentine almost. Taste was alright,  I wasn&#39;t left with that shit taste some Kush strains leave behind which was nice. Smooth smoke. Overall a good indica to medicate with in the day and not get too dragged down.

VI give the same spiel every time I visit the dispensary; I love the physical effects of a good indica, but don&#39;t want to be knocked out.  I&#39;m an artist and musician who likes to indulge and get busy, a productive stoner if you will.  This strain was suggested to me by the bud tender when what I really wanted had just sold out. \u000a\u000aMaybe it&#39;s my own expectations/disappointment, but this strain just managed to knock me out without really providing the pain relief and relaxation I was hoping for.  To top it off, it made me incredibly itchy, and didn&#39;t taste particularly good either. This could be ok if this is the kind of thing you look for in your pot, but it&#39;s not for me.

VHoly sheesh, this stuff is nice. My particular strain is around 16% TCH, but it hits hard. One or two hits and I am mellowww yellowww. I tried this to help with my clinical anxiety and panic disorder, and man does it do the trick. I feel relaxed, happy, and floaty. But not so much that I can&#39;t accomplish what needs to get done. This strain has also brought back my appetite for the first time in a week. I&#39;m ravenous! Highly recommend this for people with anxiety and depression! Just start slow and smoke more if you need it.

VIf you suffer from insomnia and pain that prevents you good sleep, try this one.  Make sure not to torch it to death or you will ruin the beautiful crystals and the undertones of vanilla and just a hit of lavendar.  The effect is almost immediate and duration...well, I fell asleep so quickly not sure when it wore off :-).   Picked this up at Essence on Las Vegas Blvd./Sahara where they offer a large selection, great quality, great hours.

VWhite walker is my absolute FAVORITE! Great for day use. It really helps relieve tension and relaxes. It tastes great too! I&#39;ve had some pretty interesting and mind-opening conversations after smoking this strain. Doesn&#39;t make me too lethargic. I love to enjoy this one when I have a lot to do around the house.

VI bought this from a local dispensary to help with the recovery from a few nerve root block spinal injections. So far it has worked quite well at easing the pain! One of the best strains I have ever had!

VAmazing indica. Personally I love stavias personally but I&#39;ve fallen in love with this strain. I&#39;ve got super bad anxiety at night and this stuff can just put me right to sleep without a worry in the world. The taste is very good as well, I can really taste the citrusy parts. I recommend to all.

VA sticky, sweet, and pungent OG on the inhale with a fresh piney spinach aftertaste. The intense numbing physical effects are stimulating. The psychoactive effects are serene and sedative. A very calming strain.
