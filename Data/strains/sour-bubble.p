VLove the smell this leaves in a room after burning. Nice mellow terps on this one, taste is familiar yet strange. Grapey and fruity with a hint of sweetness, this is great. Dark purple scattered throughout lime green, with really crystally sugar leafs surrounding it. This is a relaxing indica but still has some headiness behind it. Hard to find, but try it if you can track her down! Thanks, B.O.G this stuff rocks.

VI am always looking for medicine for anxiety, stress, panic attacks, and this is a new one to me but awesome. Really has a fruity taste but it has that sour earthy smell that I am always looking for. This one is up there on my list of favorites. I am usually strictly an Indica girl and this is an excellent one!

VNot a huge fan of this strain. It definitely hits hard, and can knock you out fast if you smoke for insomnia, but I don&#39;t recommend it for recreational use. It tends to make me feel way too heavy, bodily, particularly in my limbs, and slightly claustrophobic. \u000a\u000aIt also hits strangely for me - it takes a while to kick in, so I usually smoke way too much, and when it finally hits, it&#39;s an all-at-once kind of thing. I prefer something that creeps and is relaxing, or something I can feel immediately. I personally just find it too difficult to accurately gauge myself with this one as I&#39;m smoking it. \u000a\u000aThat being said, my friends prefer this much more than the strains I lean towards (Goo, Purple Chemdog, Lemon Haze, Trainwreck, etc), simply because of its ability to hit hard. It&#39;s all a matter of personal preference.
