VThis strain personally doesn&#39;t fit me well, but I figured I would let others know in case the same happens to them.  What Small bowl I packed was super strong but honestly mentally fucked me up pretty badly and I literally forgot what existence was. It brought my depression out more. I had a huge panic attack and couldn&#39;t sleep from this weed and also couldn&#39;t remember anything a moment after things happened. Personally, I&#39;m not partaking in this one strain again, doesn&#39;t mean its bad for anyone else however.

VThis is by far one of the best strains i&#39;ve ever had. For me, this was right up there with Fire OG. I got 4g of this stuff for spring break, and pretty much smoked at least a bowl every day of it. The high is excellent, however the cotton mouth is killer at first. Also, be expecting red eyes like crazy.

V(concentrate) Green Dragon is really nice. unlike a lot of people who commented, I find that I&#39;d rather be bundled up in bed after smoking this, with a snack planned later. I smoked too much once and had some anxiety, but I put on crashing-ocean-waves sound and I felt better. doesn&#39;t help me sleep, bit makes me feel more relaxed before I do fall asleep on my own. Maybe it&#39;s just me but I need a decent number of hits before I feel the head high. You kinda feel like stuff is moving a few frames late, like buffering almost? I can&#39;t plan to do too much if I wanna smoke. But i enjoy it.

VI bought a gram and a half of this from Beaver Bowls, and rolled up 3 half gram joints. Now that I&#39;ve smoked all three (not in one sitting -- three seshes over a couple of weeks) -- I can say that I have never smoked anything quite like green dragon. \u000a\u000aThis weed smells very strongly. Simply opening up a doob tube with a joint in it made my whole room smell like weed. It&#39;s a nice  smell, though. Sweet, hashy and spicy, in an herbal way. The taste  doesn&#39;t really resemble the smell, and is unique, at least for me: sweet roasted garlic and sage with a bit of an earthy, minty vibe. I&#39;ve never smoked anything like it. \u000a\u000aThe effects are also  unique. It&#39;s a 100% Indica stone, but with almost no fogginess or sleepiness, at least initially and in moderate doses.  It&#39;s relaxing, and produces a calm, contemplative, spacey state of mind plus a mellow body stone.  After a couple of hours, I did begin to feel sleepy and couch locked,  but it is hard to say how much of that was the weed and how much of it was the late hour. \u000a\u000aA really nice strain that I will pick up again.

VNot really big on reviewing weed strains and I&#39;ve been a pothead for over a decade but this strain is deserving. Actually have been hit this strain in wax form via my g pen and I must say its the most euphoric I&#39;ve felt in a while. I&#39;ve been laughing, smiling, and just in an overall great mood. No clue why this strain feels so different but it does. Truly awesome feeling. Alotta laughs and good vibes. Not a groggy high either. I&#39;d def recommend in wax form

VThis is a bit of a creeper strain, but the high isn&#39;t super intense at first. I do however, think this is one of those where you can overdose pretty easily. I did not find significant pain relief. I did not find this giggly, euphoric, or happy. Just a typical high. Nothing I would go out of my way to grow or buy again. Minor dry mouth. It did help with apatite. There was no significant paranoia, but I could see how someone might experience that on this stuff and I did experience paranoia to some degree near the tail end of the high. Okay for those who can steer their high, if you know what I mean. At one point I felt like I was having trouble breathing, which is always a first sign to me that a strain is too strong so go easy on it until you build a tolerance. Clarity and confusion both come and go, but the confusion you can think through. I didn&#39;t have significant trouble functioning. Might be an okay day strain at home for some. This one feels like it vibrates on a really low frequency, so you will want to do an up lifting activity while on it. It greatly improves the experience. Adding CBD gets rid of any anxiety/paranoia (that goes for any strain you have trouble with) easily. The come down is abrupt.

The reviews on pain relief and stress are what led me to Gdr. Didn&#39;t even think about %, which is pretty unusual for me as a 20yr smoker, got home and screamed NO! My batch said 14% and I was a little worried it wouldn&#39;t be potent enough. \u000a\u000aI. WAS.

VI found this to be an interesting Indica as I usually prefer Sativa. I was looking for something to help with pain during a move that wouldn&#39;t make me lethargic to an extreme and this was recommended. I found this really helped with my back pain but also kept me relatively alert (though a little spacey but awake just forgetful). And the best side effect was creativity, it made me really want to paint or do something with my hands.

VThe Oil tasted great, but just like every other oil cartridge that I have tried, the atomizer burned out long before the oil was finished.
