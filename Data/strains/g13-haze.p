The bud was fairly dense and smelt magnificent.\u000a\u000aWhen I fired up a packed pipe of this someone else in the room told me it smelt of Parma Violets, which I&#39;d very much agree with.

VIt&#39;s a great strain to smoke when you have a small amount - I.e. 1 or 2 hits from a pipe (I once had one hit from a pipe just to get rid of a headache and it worked, I wasn&#39;t high, but I was free from the headache). However, when you smoke too much, it because quite overbearing. I had a party at a friends house last night, and had a bunch of hits from this weed through a bong with 4 bottles of Budweiser.\u000a\u000aI had an almost psychedelic-like experience. At first when I was smoking it, it felt great; I had an amazing body high, and it felt like there was an orb floating around in my throat whilst the rest of my body was numb. \u000a\u000aOnce we we&#39;re about to leave, I decided to have a hit from the bong. It was a 45 minute walk home (we were mainly walking through quiet wedge-land), and I went from going completely numb to going into a massive pain and fatigue. When we were walking through the wedge, it was dark and the only source of light was a torch on my friends phone; this is where I started to have the psychedelic experience. I started to see shadows ahead of me portraying life through the 19th Century. I started to see shadows of ghosts and people kneeling down near the trees doing work, and horse carriages coming past me - it was both terrifying, but also intriguing. Once I got home, I went to bed into an insta-sleep. \u000a\u000aThis weed is definitely not for beginners (I only smoke once every 2 weeks MAXIMUM).

VG13 feels amazing with that glorious Haze. It comes out to be a really balanced hybrid. Earthy musk and the sweet haze entice the nose piece.  This works so well in the afternoon, but can be versatile just as much. The bud structure really has that sativa stretch. I highly recommend.

VI love this it&#39;s really close to the original buzz of Haze. I found this strain to be very motivating and super pain numbing at the same time. Looks like a darker jack herer with more darker pistols. Easy break apart structure tastes of nice lemon grass gives me that instead head high to mask the body high. It&#39;s wonderful I find this to be a very happy and uplifting strain grate for cramps or just burned out with no motivation nice clean but hard coughs once you start coughing. Makes me feel loved and chilled out. I would recommend those who need something a bit stronger for new smokers/ Vapers

All three germinated, all three looked exactly the same, two went to flower, one is a mum.  Finally smoke tested Jan 15, 2016, 3-week slow cure, 4-weeks since harvest.  Dried flower was ~1/2 Oz per plant under 400w hps is a high restricted space (30&quot; max height).  Grown using Dyna Grow Foliage Pro, Grow, Bloom, ProTkt, PH 5.9/6.0.  Easy to grow, and clone.  Taste is unique, pine, fruity.  High is excellent but not wake and bake for me.  I&#39;ll be growing out Barney&#39;s Pineapple Chunk next.  Feminized beans as well.  I have Liberty Haze, Tangerine Dream, Red Dragon, Red Diesel, Laughing Buddah, LSD, Peppermint Kush, Amnesia Lemon, Cookies Kush, Critica

VGreat strain, Very strong haze taste and also can hit you hard like any other pure indica. This is a great strain for a beginner smoker and/or the seasoned smoker looking for a  mellow high.

VI heard some mad shit about this strain. Things such as it was chemically engineered in CIA labs, etc...\u000a\u000aIt has a ridiculous amount of THC 27% with the average being something around 12.5% \u000a\u000aIt creates a lazy, lethargic feeling but the high is really strong. Dry mouth and paranoia is a downside to this. I\u2019m blessed in the sense that my eyes never change colour no matter how stoned I get but people I have smoked with did experience this. \u000a\u000aa man named Michael Hallman, who had acquired a lot of cannabis strains during the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s. Following his arrest, these strains ended up in the possession of the CIA and FBI and were later used to genetically engineer the notorious G13 cannabis strain in secret government labs.\u000a\u000a

VIt&#39;s a great strain to smoke when you have a small amount - I.e. 1 or 2 hits from a pipe (I once had one hit from a pipe just to get rid of a headache and it worked, I wasn&#39;t high, but I was free from the headache).\u000a\u000aHowever, when you smoke too much, it because quite overbearing. I had a party at a friends house last night, and had a bunch of hits from this weed through a bong with 4 bottles of Budweiser. I had an almost psychedelic-like experience.\u000a\u000aAt first when I was smoking it, it felt great; I had an amazing body high, and it felt like there was an orb floating around in my throat whilst the rest of my body was numb. However, once we we&#39;re about to leave, I decided to have a hit from the bong. It was a 45 minute walk home (we were mainly walking through quiet wedge-land), and I went from going completely numb to going into a massive pain and fatigue. When we were walking through the wedge, it was dark and the only source of light was a torch on my friends phone; this is where I started to have the psychedelic experience.\u000a\u000aI started to see shadows ahead of me portraying life through the 19th Century. I started to see shadows of ghosts and people kneeling down near the trees doing work, and horse carriages coming past me - it was both terrifying, but also intriguing.\u000a\u000aOnce I got home, I went to bed into an insta-sleep. This weed is definitely not for beginners (I only smoke once every 2 weeks MAXIMUM).

VI bought about an 1/8th of this strain about a week ago recently I have been getting some weak strains. However I think that weak strains are great for just a little float on the clouds. I feel as though all my worries and my nausea has gone. Most of the time I have some pain from eating (Anorexia) and some words escapes me from answering question correctly in the manner I wish to answer them. G-13 Haze delivers everything you ever want in a happy go lucky feeling. \u000aBefore taking the this I had heachaches, pain, depression and nausea through the roof. Nausea 8/10 pain 9/10 depression 10/10 I haven&#39;t been sleeping all that great either.\u000aAfter, the crazy hit of the head high, my body started to calm down, my nausea was at 5/10, my pain was gone, and the depression was 3/10, pleasantly brightened my mood for the better never felt so calm in my life. I also became more focused, which was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this if you have a hard time just being awake or alive. This strain shows you how wonderful everything is lol.

VI really loved this strain was able to get them in popcorn buds which are my favorite to consume. very pungent in smell. I smelled hints of mint at times and pine. smoke output was good. high is very heavy and I medicate frequently. def not a day time herb otherwise you might be napping on this one.

VI absolutely love G13. It makes me so incredibly happy. I literally felt like I couldn&#39;t feel any emotion other than happiness while I was high. My anxiety melted away so fast while I was smoking it. After only two hits, I just felt great. The only thing about G13 that gets me, is it makes you hungry as hell, so have food ready lol

VA great hybrid. Good for just chilling at home by yourself, smoking with friends and going out too. Great head high, interesting thoughts and ideas flowing through my head. It&#39;s a good strain to explore your creative side too. Oh and it definitely helps with depression and anxiety. \u000a\u000aAlso, I found that if I did something more active, the high would fade / I didn&#39;t feel it as much, while if I stayed focused on something like music/ reading/ watching a movie it made me feel more stoned.

VBest strain i&#39;ve ever smoked. Smoked it in Amsterdam which me and my friends picked up from Grey Area, mindblown. Even better than my favourite strain Super Silver Haze. Didn&#39;t even smoke alot, about 5-6 hits and i got in such a mellow high with my head soaring while my body felt like melted cheese, haha. Perfect strain for walking around in the city with your friends. \u000a

VPicked up at Prix in Amsterdam. Incredible strain. Delicious and smooth flavor and looks beautiful too. Does however give really bad cotton mouth tho. In the very beginning it gives a very uplifting feeling with a little bit of a dizziness or more of a head high. then about 30 min after smoking a .5G Joint the indica side hits and you get a little tired and sleepy especially if your laying or sitting down. But if you start moving you pick up the energy from the beginning. Definitely a great strain

VI actually wasn&#39;t crazy about this one, a lot of the haze crosses do nothing for me and I was actually looking for a pure g13 when I initially purchased so it might have swayed my rating a bit, but I find this strain makes me more talkative and gives me a lot of motivation to do a lot of house work, which I guess isn&#39;t a bad thing. The comedown is quick and hard and heavy though and it&#39;ll probably result in a late afternoon nap if you smoke this too early.

VMy favorite strain by far. This stuff truly puts you in a haze lol. I felt really energetic and productive on this, it&#39;s definitely not for you if you&#39;re looking for a crash-on-the-couch kind of high. It made me feel so happy, and I couldn&#39;t stop laughing. You cannot feel sad when you&#39;re high off of this. It&#39;s also good if you&#39;re smoking to get your appetite back, because this stuff makes you so unbelievably hungry
