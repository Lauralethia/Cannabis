VThis &quot;dirt weed&quot; as some one very ignorant  person said in a popular review, is some of the best medicine around. I&#39;m assuming he used the term &quot;dirt weed&quot; because it&#39;s a cross of Afghani and Skunk 1, two very old school strains.  in actuality the flavor is very &quot;classic&quot; and pleasent, VERY earthy and kushy with very slight hints of Diesal and berry. \u000aThe high is soothing and relaxing, a really sleepy chilled out high, great for anxiety and pain.\u000aJust smoked a couple bong rips feel pretty creative, but lazy, not to the point of couch lock but very lazy, just a great Stoney old school high. \u000aOne thing I want to add is its not much of.  Carebral high, which is another thing that ignorant reviewer complained about, but the euphoria is there. \u000awhy even have a Medcard if your going to stick your nose up to certain strains? Just cause a strain dosent get you &quot;fucked up&quot; dosent mean it&#39;s not a good strain, it makes it a better strains in slot of ways. \u000a\u000aTLDR: Classic Stoney strain, great for anxiety and pain relief, very earth Kush flavor with hints of Diesal and berry.

VI freaked out on this strain...but it was my own fault. As a beginner I never cared about how much a smoked so I hit this strain from a pipe and I had a &quot;bad one&quot; as my friends called it. The first thing I felt was what I described as &quot;zoomed out&quot; I felt like I could see me n my friends walking down the street but like in GTA camera (weird I know) then this I would get these feelings every 5 or so seconds where every bodies voice just like zoomed away from me. But when I got home I went straight to my bed n just lay there and I felt safe and told myself I wasn&#39;t going to die and the scary feelings disappeared. I was no longer freaking out I felt like I was floating through deep space and it was awesome!! I felt so peaceful and happy and euphoric and for that reason it was one of the best strains I have smoked. it was an unforgettable experience.

VCurrently on Critical mass (and some tangerine Kush). I have to tell you, I got some 1/2 gram pre-rolls from GreenSky on 4/20 for $4.20.  So glad I stopped in that day.  \u000aCritical Mass is a standard in my stash.  I love high CBD strains when they are done right and this strain from GreenSky has never let me down.  Mellow, clear headed relief.  I just did a 10 hour shift and my back, shoulder, and feet where just AWFUL when I got home.  Just a few tokes off of one of those joints. and my shoulder is no longer taught or tense, my back has loosened up, and my feet are calming down.  There is still unpleasantness to be felt, but the relief is such a blessing.\u000aClear, calm mind, and the relaxation builds smoothly.

VI&#39;ve been  using this for sever back pain, likely a slipped disc from past experience. ..  I&#39;ve been  using a lot of high grade Indica  to control the pain and this is up there with the best for pain relief,  and I mean serious opiate worthy  pain, this strain with ibuprofen  work great together.  You can be in a heavy relaxed state or fall asleep if you smoke 2  big bowls back to back.  Great India in every way.

VLove this strain! It&#39;s hard to be critical of Critical Mass. It is a wonderfully clear headed high. The body high is out standing. I recommend smoking just enough. Too much CM and you will have a good understanding of what it&#39;s like to be a flesh sack of play-doh. If that is your thing, burn a fat bowl. Otherwise, take it slow and you can get exactly where you want to be. The high CBD in this strain really does the trick. All around, Critical Mass is a Massterful Indica. It is now my go-to CBD-rich strain.

VI have grown smoked and used many many many different strains. For taste Critical Mass is right up there in the top 3 for me, the effects are probably the main reason I keep coming back to CM. I have many issues with my legs, hips and most of my upper skeleton, arthritis being the main problem. On CM I find I am able to push the pain aside and can function normally. I do however seem to have a smile on my face all the while I am under the influence so for me Critical Mass is not only tasty and relief giving, it brightens my day &#128077;&#128154;

VStrain Review of Critical Mass\u000aThe Green Solution, Northglenn\u000a\u000a80% Indica / 20% Sativa\u000aCBD: 8.8%\u000aTHC: 7.23%\u000a\u000aWhat it is:	\u000aThis indica dominant strain is a cross of Afghan Indica and Skunk #1. It is a later generation Big Bud that was enhanced to help regulate the yields,  THC, and CBD levels. The name originates from the dense thick buds that from this plant, growing so big they can snap branches. This strain can be difficult to grow because the massive buds can mold in humid environments. It is recommended for experienced growers because of this issue, but can yield up to 6 pounds. \u000a\u000aSmells: earthy, floral, citrus, and notes of lemon with a medium body- not very skunky\u000aTaste: It has a light sweet and earthy flavor and is very smooth. \u000a\u000aMethod: Smoked\u000a\u000aFeel: \u000aIt is a relaxing high that doesn&#39;t take away mental clarity. It helps soften your muscles,  keep you relaxed, while not ruining your mental concentration\u000a\u000aOverview:\u000aWhen I first bought this weed I panicked; Why did I buy weed with only 7% THC?! I told the budtender I was looking for a flower that contained CBD without realizing that products high in CBD will commonly have low THC. \u000aHowever, this flower changed my mind that I need a high percentage of THC in order to feel the effects. I would typically go for something with a high percentage of THC to help ease my mind and help me relax for the night. The CBD in this flower helped me relax and enjoy the evening. I did feel some couch lock and a sense of euphoric comfort, but I could still enjoy in-depth conversations.\u000aSometimes it&#39;s nice to relax and turn your brain off, but with this weed, you&#39;ll have all the relaxation without the loss of mental clarity. \u000aThis strain could be beneficial to those new to smoking weed, or those who are sore from a previous day&#39;s workout, or those looking for a low anxiety smoke.

VA good, solid everyday strain for sure. Mine was listed at 11.9% THC 11.3% CBD. Nice full body high. Like a Xanax feel to it. Similar to MediHaze in many ways. Definitely good for physical pain relief and stress reduction. No paranoia or anxiety from it. I did 1/2 a joint and 45 minutes later could still feel it. .i approve

VDoesn&#39;t act like a pure indica for me. Relaxing and chill high. Never paranoia. Great for meditation as well as a gym session, so versatile. High amounts will lead to couch lock, sleep, or intense minds eye stimulation if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.

VOverall I enjoyed it. I smoked one joint of it and it was fairly smooth. beware of how hard and frequently you&#39;re puffing because this buzz sneaks up on you. I didn&#39;t notice any effects at all until I stood and walked. makes you feel heavier from the chest to the stomach. this pressure sensation soon turns to the munchies. it does give you a slight head buzz too which surprises you at first. but once you realize theres no logical reason for you to be freaking out you will calm right down to a pleasant happy high. not recommended for people suffering from severe anxiety. will likely induce a panic attack. mild anxiety is subdued by the strain it seems though. also if you were feeling horny at all the day you decided to smoke this, prepare to not sleep before you have relieved yourself. other than that, decent experience and will blaze again.

VInitial Impression:\u000aI acquired this strain like all others at Medicine Man Medical Market, in Glendale, CO. I was a little weary of the THC content being a little lower than I am accustomed to; So naturally I was thinking that it wouldn&#39;t be as strong or potent as the other strains that I am accustomed to. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how mellow and effective this strain is/was. I will definitely use this particular strain more often for my chronic joint pain, no pun intended.\u000a\u000aI use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.\u000a\u000aAroma: 7.5\u000aThe aroma of this strain is a little weak, not as pungent as your typical heavy hitters like Afghani, or Skunk #1. At the same time the smell is earthy, and semi-piney, then again sometimes subtlety is nice also.\u000a\u000aTaste: 9.0\u000aI used this product with a &quot;Raw&quot; rolling paper, the pre-rolled joint burned evenly and did not require re-lighting at all. I digress, the taste was pleasant and subtle. The taste was like a mild piney, earthy overtone, with a  very mild waft of skunki-ness as its genetics would lend.\u000a\u000aPotency: 9.5\u000aWow! I was extremely surprised that this strain packed the punch it did. Hands down one of the best nights sleeps I had in quite a long time. The CBD content is higher than I have ever had before, and I will keep this strain in my personal stash, I would urge anyone that has never tried a high CBD content to give it a whirl, you never know, you may like what happens.\u000a\u000aOverall, I like this strain a lot. Definitely in my personal top 10. I award this strain a score of 26 out of a total 30. Definitely worth a try!\u000a\u000a**-UPDATE-**\u000aI went back to purchase an additional 1/4 ounce, I liked it that much.

VCritical Mass was one of the first strains I tried for pain and keep going back to it. At first it made me a tiny bit sleepy but my body has adjusted and I now just feel sweet wonderful relief to my strong neuropathic pain. I have connective tissue disorder (EDS) as well as Chiari malformation...and this has decreased my pain a little and I couldn&#39;t ask for anything better to have another tool for chronic pain! I often use it at night mixed with a strong indica to knock me out to sleep (I usually have horrible insomnia)  this is my go to med and hope someday I won&#39;t need narcotics. I may always be disabled... But I can hopefully not damage my body with them. \u000aI love the flavor of Critical Mass... And I have very few side effects from it. For me not even dry mouth. I&#39;m so thankful for this strain in particular. A lot of the other high CBD&#39; strains are not enough indica dominant for me and I get bad anxiety with them. So I&#39;ve only found THIS strain that works for me. Love it!

I was a little weary of the THC content being a little lower than I am accustomed to; So naturally I was thinking that it wouldn&#39;t be as strong or potent as the other strains that I am accustomed to. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how mellow and effective this strain is/was. I will definitely use this particular strain more often for my chronic joint pain, no pun intended.\u000a\u000aI use a scale of 10 points, 10 being the highest possible score in any category, with 3 total categories, Taste / Aroma / Potency.\u000a\u000aAroma: 7.5\u000aThe aroma of this strain is a little weak, not as pungent as your typical heavy hitters like Afghani, or Skunk #1. At the same time the smell is earthy, and semi-piney, then again sometimes subtlety is nice also.\u000a\u000aTaste: 9.0\u000aI used this product with a &quot;Raw&quot; rolling paper, the pre-rolled joint burned evenly and did not require re-lighting at all. I digress, the taste was pleasant and subtle. The taste was like a mild piney, earthy overtone, with a  very mild waft of skunki-ness as its genetics would lend.\u000a\u000aPotency: 9.5\u000aWow! I was extremely surprised that this strain packed the punch it did. Hands down one of the best nights sleeps I had in quite a long time. The CBD content is higher than I have ever had before, and I will keep this strain in my personal stash, I would urge anyone that has never tried a high CBD content to give it a whirl, you never know, you may like what happens.\u000a\u000aOverall, I like this strain a lot. Definitely in my personal top 10. I award this strain a score of 26 out of a total 30. Definitely worth a try!\u000a\u000a**-UPDATE-**\u000aI went back to purchase an additional 1/4 ounce, I liked it that much.

VMedicinal Mary at its finest. I feel this is a perfect example of using cannabis as a medication. Im not a fan of the earthy taste but it smokes very smooth. I feel like any thc affects and offset with cbd in this strain. I just felt a calm come over me without any head fog. I could clearly think and speak on this strain. Almost as if i just took some Ibuprofen. I feel it&#39;s a great daytime strain. It doesn&#39;t help me fall asleep or give me energy kick. \u000a

VI&#39;m surprised to see this with a 4.2 rating - it certainly deserves higher. Critical Mass is a simple hybrid of two immemorial classics: Skunk #1 and Afghani, one a blend of two landraces and the other a true landrace, respectively. CM has an earthy yet colorful and citrus-infused aroma and smokes very smoothly. To me, it feels like a balanced hybrid and lacks the debilitating impact of a true deep indica, but it shouldn&#39;t be knocked for that. Its aroma is akin to that of Blue Dream, and, in my opinion, affords the user a better cerebral high in conjunction with its body buzz.

V*High CBD Strain Review*\u000a\u000aCritical mass delivers a solid medical effect to both the body and mind. I was surprised by balanced nature of this medicine, as I was expecting an effect centered in the body. Pain relief is excellent, and the sedative effect is moderate and builds with each dose. \u000a\u000aVery similar to the High CBD Afghan Skunk, but with more effect in head and less sedating.

VThis strain was a new addition to the area recently so I thought I might try it out. I&#39;m not one with a huge tolerance, but a few good hits and I&#39;m chillin for a while but after 2 hits with this strain I was more than good. The taste was on pint and the drag was smooth and didn&#39;t burn. I would total recommended to someone who&#39;s looking for a good movie watcher and a huge stress reliever.

VJust picked this up today.  First time and I have to say it is an ass kick in the head good one! Smooth in and pleasant out reminds me of fresh cut pine mixed with a nutmeg cinnamon hint at the end.  The high is nice and steady and after two hours it is still going along.  Very relaxing for me without the OMG when is this going to calm down feel!  Only disappointment was it was just so so for pain relief.  But my back is in full spasm and to be fair I remember even heavy hits of morphine would barely tame it.  This at least makes it tolerable.

VI have PTSD, 24/7 neuropathy nerve pain from diabetes, pancreatitis pain, cirrhosis of the liver stage 4, arthritis and back pain. I had been reading a lot about the different strains for my pain.  I usually only get 2-3 hours sleep due to my PTSD.  I have also learned that this strain also helps you get off any hard drugs. I can say this! I when I was a teenager would say God made weed and man made alcohol, synthetic drugs that only kill You! Who do you trust? In God I trust! This strain when I first smoked a part of a joint. My pain, depression, and I was able to sleep for 9 hours.  I am going use this awesome strain. I found at Nectar Gresham, Oregon 17.16% C.B.D. / 10.66% TCH rating which in my opinion is the perfect balance for pain relief and helped my PTSD.  I recommend this if you are looking for a good flower.  Critical Mass.

VJust picked this up today.  First time and I have to say it is an ass kick in the head good one! Smooth in and pleasant out reminds me of fresh cut pine mixed with a nutmeg cinnamon hint at the end.  The high is nice and steady and after two hours it is still going along.  Very relaxing for me without the OMG when is this going to calm down feel!  Only disappointment was it was just so so for pain relief.  But my back is in full spasm and to be fair I remember even heavy hits of morphine would barely tame it.  This at least makes it tolerable.

VI have PTSD, 24/7 neuropathy nerve pain from diabetes, pancreatitis pain, cirrhosis of the liver stage 4, arthritis and back pain. I had been reading a lot about the different strains for my pain.  I usually only get 2-3 hours sleep due to my PTSD.  I have also learned that this strain also helps you get off any hard drugs. I can say this! I when I was a teenager would say God made weed and man made alcohol, synthetic drugs that only kill You! Who do you trust? In God I trust! This strain when I first smoked a part of a joint. My pain, depression, and I was able to sleep for 9 hours.  I am going use this awesome strain. I found at Nectar Gresham, Oregon 17.16% C.B.D. / 10.66% TCH rating which in my opinion is the perfect balance for pain relief and helped my PTSD.  I recommend this if you are looking for a good flower.  Critical Mass.

VOne of my favorites.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Works wonders on the headache and back pain without getting me messed.  It&#39;s something that I can hit once and get relief or hit multiple times and get some giggles.  Subtle mood lift builds at multiple tokes and has no sedation.  More energetic than I would expect for an indica, but, seemingly contradictory, good for sleep.  Social, relaxing, happy pain relief.

VNot a good one for my diabetes. It sedates me to the point of barely being able to make it to a bed, so if my blood sugar is off, it will still be off (and dangerous) once I fall asleep. I have only used it a few times because of this concern. So what I do now, is not use it if my blood sugar is trending downward. \u000a\u000aEvery time I smoked or vaped it, or bonged, I fell into deep and relaxing sleep for 2 hours. But - only when my blood sugar had been at the high end of the normal range for a while, otherwise I don&#39;t take a chance of having a low during sleep. I suspect the symptoms of a low would not wake me up. Diabetics will know what I&#39;m talking about. \u000a\u000aIf I wanted to fall asleep easier, I would certainly want a gentler strain. This one just knocks me off my feet, even with tiny doses in my vaporizer.\u000a\u000aAll I&#39;m looking for is pain relief, without drowsiness or mood effects, so this is not a good one for me. It would be great for someone looking for a brief and deep sleep, though, like right before bed.

V*High CBD Strain Review*\u000a\u000aCritical mass delivers a solid medical effect to both the body and mind. I was surprised by balanced nature of this medicine, as I was expecting an effect centered in the body. Pain relief is excellent, and the sedative effect is moderate and builds with each dose. \u000a\u000aVery similar to the High CBD Afghan Skunk, but with more effect in head and less sedating.

VIt&#39;s hard to feel upset under the influence of this strain. Your thoughts wander with the high, and though I&#39;ve felt agitated and easily triggered all day, thinking about the stuff that&#39;s been bothering me doesn&#39;t faze me at all right now. I just want to lie in bed and think, or try to read. I&#39;m not super sleepy, but I don&#39;t want to go anywhere. I think the only thing that would make me unhappy right now is if someone asked me to to anything. I feel good and I just want to chill. The body high is tingly, very nice and subtle, not as heavy-hitting as those indicas that leave you unable to properly feel your limbs. I can see it being one of those where I could smoke too much and not be overwhelmed with anxiety because feeling amped up would be too much trouble. This is a good choice for people who struggle with regulating their emotions.

VThis is only my 3rd strain to try but it will definitely be a go to for me. CM gives me a rather heavy head high. I don&#39;t get sleepy but I get deeply relaxed. I get talkative. I also get hungry. It does give me pain relief but not a tremendous amount. It also gives this really odd sensation from head to toe as if it is kicking in. Almost like I feel it traveling and circulating through my veins.

VCritical Mass has become an instant favorite.  The moment I vaped it at 390 degrees the flavors hit me. A very strong and smooth medley of sweetness, berry flavor, and slight woody flavor; this combination is truly magical. I, for a moment, thought I was tasting Blueberry Kush, but that sweetness comes from the Afghani genetics in Critical Mass. This strain has by far one of the most complex bouquet of flavors I have ever tasted through my vape.\u000a     The effects of this strain are very pleasant giving the smoker a really nice pleasant heavy indica high. I felt a euphoric tingling feeling across my body within the first 15 minutes after vaping. The second bowl of Critical Mass made my muscles begin to relax which I attribute to the CBD and THC mix on this strain. An amazing feeling for an athletes post workout ritual.\u000a     Overall, this strain has wowed me because of its amazing flavors and the medley they create are very enjoyable. I really think this is a great strain for a relaxing afternoon, as I did not feel very sedated from it, so this indica is pretty versatile for multiple experiences. I would recommend this strain to experienced smokers as its effects are pretty potent.

VAs far as pain relief goes, this train is top notch! The batch I got has roughly a 1:1 THC-CBD ratio and I noticed it&#39;s indica identity shine through with it&#39;s sedating effects. Dense, sticky buds with that classic nostalgia-inducing scent (pungent/skunky/STANKY). Initially a full-bodied sweet/skunky flavor; hints of a sweet berry, maybe cherry follow through in the aftertaste.\u000a\u000aWonderful strain with strong sedative-medicinal properties, I&#39;d recommend Critical Mass if yr having trouble sleeping or sitting still..

VI had really high hopes for this strain but after a couple times smoking it, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for me.  I may just be too prone to paranoia and anxiety but this strain really seemed to exacerbate these issues for me.  Maybe it&#39;s the higher CBD to THC ratio.  \u000a\u000aOh well, i tried it and now i can cross it off the list.  I kept waiting to feel a little bit of the positive effects but they just never really happened. There was a surplus of energy but it just made me real anxious for a couple hours and extra paranoid.

VExcellent strain, had absolutely no issues with her from start to finish. She was also very easy to take cuttings from, with every clone surviving. She grew strong all the through under 400 watt HPS. I did fim her and use lst to help make her as productive as she was. She smells very skunky while growing but get a wonderful fruity smell and taste once properly dried and cured. Buds are very nice, compact, and plentiful. The affect is very narcotic like, very nice if stressed, in pain, or just need to wind down. I very much recommend this to any grower or smoker no matter there preferred strain, this strain is a winner.  This is where I get this and all my other top strains. http://original-ssc.com/the-moon-seeds-critical-magic.html  The Original Sensible Seed Company always has great sales and lots of promotions. I&#39;ve done lots of looking and they get my vote..

VRightly named, this strain packs a huge punch. The high THC content relieves stress and causes an intense clear headed calm while the high CBD content helps with muscle relaxation and insomnia. Buds have a nauseatingly sweet smell with an earthy musky taste. Can induce paranoia, irritability, &amp; mild psychosis if too much smoked due to the high thc and is therefore not for inexperienced smokers.

VI tried mixing this strain, as well as trying it on its own, but was left feeling very uneasy and agitated every time I tried smoking it. While it did help with my pain levels, and didn&#39;t cause any mental haze, because I have Tourette&#39;s I really need something that doesn&#39;t cause more agitation. It has a good taste, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with it, just wasn&#39;t right for me.

VRheumatoid arthritis sufferer. Gave me a heavy body high and helped me sleep pain free throughout the night and woke up feeling rested (which is extremely rare for anyone with an autoimmune disease). This is the only strain that has given me a solid night&#39;s rest. I highly recommend! I may be a bit of a lightweight, but I definitely woke up semi-high and wore two different earrings to work... So just make sure you don&#39;t have any important meetings the next morning.

VThis is only my 3rd strain to try but it will definitely be a go to for me. CM gives me a rather heavy head high. I don&#39;t get sleepy but I get deeply relaxed. I get talkative. I also get hungry. It does give me pain relief but not a tremendous amount. It also gives this really odd sensation from head to toe as if it is kicking in. Almost like I feel it traveling and circulating through my veins.

VI went to my local dispensary, The Oregon Grown Gift Shop, &#160;to pick up some crumble, when I overheard the budtender say they had $25 quarters.\u000a\u000aWhat?? Did I hear that right? &#160;The budtender confirmed that I did! &#160;WOW! One of the two specials was Critical Mass, which smelled DANK! &#160;I told him I&#39;d take it on site, and later looked at the label and it tested out at a whopping 28% THC! &#160;\u000a\u000aIt dawned on me when I got home that it was probably so cheap because it was seedy weed, and lo and behold, &#160;I found 1 seed in the one nug I ground up so far :) &#160;YAY! &#160;Now I know a lot of people despise seedy weed, but because I grow I LOVE free seeds! &#160;I hope I have lots more! \u000a\u000aI just smoked a bowl of it, and, POW! &#160;This is fucking awesome! &#160;It smells and tastes great, just as you would imagine Skunk #1 &#160;x Afghani to smell and taste like, skunky, sweet, and earthy. \u000a\u000aThis bud is making me feel relaxed and I&#39;m feeling the psychoactive effects of the THC too :) &#160;I am a it of a spaz by nature and frequently use indicas to chill out and relax with. I can&#39;t thank my lucky stars enough for being at the Gift Shop at the right time tonite! &#160;\u000a\u000aThis 28 percenter is a hard hitter and this quarter will last me quite a while :)  Go get some while there is still time!

VHUGE BUD. Good earthy old school weed smell. Fluffy buds w tons of orange hairs. Great relaxing effect when medicating. Only problem is I used it to help me sleep, which it did, but I woke up w the worse headache I&#39;ve had in a long time. Also I like to be alone with this one. I got impatient with people around me and ruined a good buzz.

VDefinitely one of my favorite strains that I have gotten to try. Gorgeous buds that looked almost red in the right light. Very strong smell, and a strong earthy taste.\u000aand the high is pretty strong. Smoke too much and you&#39;ll pretty much just be a puddle for the next couple hours! So great body high, and definitely made my brain feel tingly. A hit or 2 in the day time was okay, but I really loved this one to help me relax, calm down, and eventually sleep in the evenings after work.

Vif you get the right clone you will really enjoy this strain. The greatest clone is the critical bilbo that you can easily find around Barcelona, spain. Uplifting high that gets you really stoned in some minutes. Earthy skunk, inmature fruit aroma. Reminds me of the typical peach flavoured gum.

I would personally recommend critical mass for a rainy afternoon or after dinner relaxation.

VPicked this up for my head pain (chronic daily headaches, not related to migraine). I wanted pain relief but didn&#39;t want something that would put me to sleep. I wanted to be able to get something done if I wanted to, or just enjoy the ride if I wanted to. Bingo on all points. The relief comes almost immediately, thank heavens because on a bad day...damn. The high comes a bit behind. In fact, this one can sneak up on you so give it time, particularly if you are vaping. It sort of starts at the scalp and tingles its way down. If I get up and start doing something I&#39;m like go go gadget. If I sit down to chill and take in a movie, it&#39;s all good.

VWe specifically bought this strain because my my suffers from Lupus and she has been told that it is amazing for her ailments (aching joints - primarily in her hips, wrists, and hands, generalized pain in her lower back, inflammation). She says this is the best she&#39;s felt in a long time. I, on the other hand, don&#39;t really feel much in my head or body. Maybe relaxed, but not so bad that I couldn&#39;t get up and do something right this minute. First time - great for what we bought it for, the medicinal cbd benefits.

VVERY strong. My fourth time smoking weed, I smoked this and probably just under 0,1g and I was high for more than three hours. It makes me very very dizzy, kinda like I would be drunk. Not that couch-locking and doesn&#39;t give me bad munchies nor euphoria, but very relaxing and good if you want to get literally messed up. Doesn&#39;t make me sleepy at all, actually disturbs sleep quite a bit.\u000aI would suggest very small doses if you have panic disorder, my friend got a panic attack from smoking this strain.

Indica hybrid with 27% THC and 56% CBD\u000a\u000aLineage: Afghani x Skunk #1\u000a\u000aFlavor:  Cherry, Candy, Eucalyptus \u000aEffect: This 2:1 CBD concentrate is effective for inflammation and carries a mild, functional high that relieves pain. It allows you to accomplish tasks that inflammation would have hindered or stopped, and is mood balancing.\u000a\u000aUsed in combination with an indica greater relief can be found than either would have seperately. Pairs great with Solstice GDP and Dream City&#39;s Loud Kush.\u000a\u000aBest tasting concentrate I&#39;ve had.\u000aMost effective 2:1 cbd concentrate I&#39;ve had.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend

VCritical mass is very potent, and it definitely acts like a true indica. It made me very relaxed, tired, and sleepy. It caused couch-lock and made me feel complete peace; I was fairly spaced out, too. It also tremendously stimulated my appetite. The only negatives were the slight dry mouth/throat and the dizziness that I got. I would definitely recommend this strain for depression, pain, insomnia, stress, anxiety, add/adhd, and for appetite stimulation. I wouldn&#39;t use this during the day; only consume small amounts if using during the day.

VThis strain was honestly lack-luster for me. Im usually a lightweight, so it\u2019s pretty easy for me to get high. However with this strain, I had to smoke much more than usual just to get to a decent high. Once I\u2019m high though, it\u2019s pretty.... eh for me. There wasn\u2019t anything very special about it. It smells very pungent, the buds are spongy and sticky and dense. It\u2019s pretty smooth to toke, so I\u2019ll give it that. Definitely made me hungry, and it\u2019s for sure a creeper.

VVaporized Dream City brand wax:  really nice flavor.  kind of like cherry (that&#39;s what the packaging says).  somewhat sedating.  helpful for a comfortable sitting meditation.  high CBD in the Dream City brand wax (~57%) versus ~25% THC.  not so mind altering as non-CBD strains.  still, gave some fatigue during the day-time.  mixed well with coffee for the meditation session.

VWe specifically bought this strain because my my suffers from Lupus and she has been told that it is amazing for her ailments (aching joints - primarily in her hips, wrists, and hands, generalized pain in her lower back, inflammation). She says this is the best she&#39;s felt in a long time. I, on the other hand, don&#39;t really feel much in my head or body. Maybe relaxed, but not so bad that I couldn&#39;t get up and do something right this minute. First time - great for what we bought it for, the medicinal cbd benefits.

VWhen I first tried this strain, I loved it.   Then I had it so many times it was losing it&#39;s effectiveness. After moving to a state with a fraction of what the other state had, I&#39;ve been having difficulty manging my symptoms. \u000aOnce I picked up a 1g syringe of CM distillate and got home to dab, I felt better instantaneously. The small level of CBD helps my inbalanced and motion sickness. It helps give me an appetite even though I don&#39;t want to eat. \u000aThe Skunk #1 sativa dom parent prevents this from being a total couch lock unable to function kind of high.\u000aThis is a solid, reliable indica strain with great pain relieving properties.  It will now be a strain I&#39;ll try to keep in my medicine box all of the time it helps my neurological issues.

VI went to my local dispensary, The Oregon Grown Gift Shop, &#160;to pick up some crumble, when I overheard the budtender say they had $25 quarters.\u000a\u000aWhat?? Did I hear that right? &#160;The budtender confirmed that I did! &#160;WOW! One of the two specials was Critical Mass, which smelled DANK! &#160;I told him I&#39;d take it on site, and later looked at the label and it tested out at a whopping 28% THC! &#160;\u000a\u000aIt dawned on me when I got home that it was probably so cheap because it was seedy weed, and lo and behold, &#160;I found 1 seed in the one nug I ground up so far :) &#160;YAY! &#160;Now I know a lot of people despise seedy weed, but because I grow I LOVE free seeds! &#160;I hope I have lots more! \u000a\u000aI just smoked a bowl of it, and, POW! &#160;This is fucking awesome! &#160;It smells and tastes great, just as you would imagine Skunk #1 &#160;x Afghani to smell and taste like, skunky, sweet, and earthy. \u000a\u000aThis bud is making me feel relaxed and I&#39;m feeling the psychoactive effects of the THC too :) &#160;I am a it of a spaz by nature and frequently use indicas to chill out and relax with. I can&#39;t thank my lucky stars enough for being at the Gift Shop at the right time tonite! &#160;\u000a\u000aThis 28 percenter is a hard hitter and this quarter will last me quite a while :)  Go get some while there is still time!

VWoke up with anxiety. Took two hits of the Indica strain, Critical Mass. With the zeal of a serial killer, this mystical grappler wrapped me up and took me to the ground. My anxiety stripped away and flung into the Abyss. Anger humbled by the mad river. \u000a\u000aThus far, I have conducted one meditation session with this strain. Set and setting: Blackened room, positioned in the quarter lotus, while listening to Psy Goa Trance music. Experience: I found myself having hypnogogic visions. One, of a snake with the head of a wolf. Another, of a giant mountain castle reaching into the clouds. \u000a\u000aI would describe the overall experience as feeling like I had shapeshifted into a Bonobo, who was launched into orbit with the mission of testing the effects of cannabis during space flight.

The kind of flowers leads you to low down the eyelids, stay laid, not move and wake up hungover with a hard way for you to make even a hot drink in the... Afternoon. The taste is almost like earth itself and the effect in the mouth is hardly explainable; I would say you had chewed clay by sliding in your palate and your tongue for hours and after by a magical power the clay gone into your brain.

It&#39;s not too aggressive of a high in that it&#39;s more like having a cup of chamomile tea with your favorite warm blanket. Lots of warm pain killing feels and the sweet earthy aroma is just as therapeutic. Pair this strain with a warm hearty meal and either a good book or some good chill beats and it&#39;s like having a spa day.

Vif you get the right clone you will really enjoy this strain. The greatest clone is the critical bilbo that you can easily find around Barcelona, spain. Uplifting high that gets you really stoned in some minutes. Earthy skunk, inmature fruit aroma. Reminds me of the typical peach flavoured gum.

VHUGE BUD. Good earthy old school weed smell. Fluffy buds w tons of orange hairs. Great relaxing effect when medicating. Only problem is I used it to help me sleep, which it did, but I woke up w the worse headache I&#39;ve had in a long time. Also I like to be alone with this one. I got impatient with people around me and ruined a good buzz.

VI tried royal queen critical and really loved it: much better and more alert/creative than most indica leaning hybrids. There is definitely alot of imaginative scenarios/alternate  scenarios like the previous reviewer was talking about imagining the chips going down as they were eating them haha; Its kindof like your life turns into a comic book / animee or something in your imagination: its truly hilarious! Maybe the unknown canabinoids are shuttling the THC more to the part of your brain that does that kind of thing haha It is a very powerfull high and very potent for such a fast flowering time. This is a good all day and night smoke, which i preffer: it will wake you up in the morning and put you to sleep at night in a magical sort of way. Dont be surprised if you get visuals from  smoking extra larger amounts of this strain like a spinning vortex of energy surrounding your TV or something (but no out of body or anything like that). Dispite how powerfull it is theres no paranioa whatsoever for me so that is good. If I had to use one word to discribe this high I would say hollywood high (it litterally feels like your an actor in a production studio while your on it haha). Theres a little bit of a crash for me after it wheres off but the high is one of the best- truly amazing and enchanting for sure.

VI am a low tolerance consumer and this was a great strain for me to try to get back in the saddle. For me, a few hits was enough to start but it didn&#39;t get me blasted like some strains have.  Once I was riding that ride, I had a very positive mindset about things which was awesome bc I suffer from anxiety and sometimes cannabis can really exasperate it.  Nothing too crazy to write home about but I will try it again for sure.

VHighly recommended. This cbd rich strain is excellent for managing intense pain, especially gastrointestinal distress. I appreciate the low thc levels as this one is pure medicine; if I&#39;m in agony I&#39;m not looking for cerebral effects. It&#39;s mild taste and effects make it a great choice for everyday use.

VNice dense, flat large buds. With plenty of dull orange hairs, nice and snappy and a few crystals. Smells sweet and slightly fruity. Vaped in my arizer solo. A bit harsh with a dry earthy flavour. Relaxed indica with a bit of an uplifting euphoric feel. Feels comfortable doing things and just sitting about. No couch lock for me. Quite a strong body high. I&#39;d do during the day if I only had a few bits and pieces to do.

VWith a taste of sweet earthy orange and sublet hint of onion on the exhale and a smell very similar to the taste this strain has become a favourite. the buds are light green with a thick covering off bright orange hairs and frost that could match a winter morning although the bud was not as dense as I like bit ground up perfectly. I would personally recommend critical mass for a rainy afternoon or after dinner relaxation.

VPicked this up for my head pain (chronic daily headaches, not related to migraine). I wanted pain relief but didn&#39;t want something that would put me to sleep. I wanted to be able to get something done if I wanted to, or just enjoy the ride if I wanted to. Bingo on all points. The relief comes almost immediately, thank heavens because on a bad day...damn. The high comes a bit behind. In fact, this one can sneak up on you so give it time, particularly if you are vaping. It sort of starts at the scalp and tingles its way down. If I get up and start doing something I&#39;m like go go gadget. If I sit down to chill and take in a movie, it&#39;s all good.

VIt is a good strain but I think it would be best suited for a non-novice patient. It made me feel a little paranoid, lots of thinking but the thinking ( especially thoughts I didn&#39;t want that came to the surface). It did help to remind me did help me relax my muscles. I think the paranoia and negative thoughts just have to do with my brain chemistry which are the stem of my anxiety and the deep thoughts I don&#39;t like to think about. I am used to the medication from Docs to help calm me. I decided to go this route because I wanted a more natural and non addictive safer approach to help me w/these issues. \u000a Also, I didn&#39;t use THC until I got my MM card so I not used to THC.  I dont know if I have the terms correctly but I felt it in my Cerebral  Cortex. I didn&#39;t like that part but others will really like it. So remember this is my opinion because I&#39;m sure other patients will like it.

I did have the CBD strain of this particular bud with a 1:1 ratio of CBD &amp; THC. Definitely a good smoke for those not wanting the psychoactive effects or a stronger, high THC strain. I was left wanting more from this one. So I had some cherry pie after ;)

VAmazing how few hits can make you so high. This strain is for experienced smokers, can really slow time down for you. In saying that, the high will last you for about 6-8 hours. This is more of a couch lock, but you break out of it doing other work if determined. Strong strain would be great for passing around a joint, otherwise nothing to play around with!

VThis strain taste awesome and got that fruity and sweet in mouth that many look for in a weed. I also love the painkilling effect with this one. My problem is with the skunkish head buzz. Your mind get racing very fast on this one. Not my cup of tea. I prefer a more funky head buzz like the White Widow for that type of strain if I look for a mind head buzz. But it&#39;s very strong and both physical and mental effects hit you fast! Last but not the least, the dry red eyes effect is strong on this one.

VHad a joint rolled with some Critical Mass that a friend had purchased. Took 4-6 hits from that joint and told him that was all I needed, being a lightweight. We were in his car driving around and making small talk afterwards, him driving and me in the passenger seat. I was laid back and very relaxed. I felt high, but not in a &quot;wow I&#39;m high&quot; sense, just that I was very relaxed, slow moving, and content with everything going on.\u000a\u000aAfter about a half hour, I decided I wanted to go from the buzz/laid back high I was riding to actually high, seeing as I was with an old friend and he had almost an ounce of weed, I wasn&#39;t really being a burden by smoking more. I told him I&#39;d rather hit it in my bubbler, so we drove to my house and grabbed it. He decided he&#39;d hit the bubbler too, rather than smoke his own joint.\u000a\u000aI explained to him that I was a lightweight and that if I smoked too much I&#39;d trip too hard and freak out (I am diagnosed with Panic Disorder so finding weed that agrees with my anxiety is super important to me), but he insisted it was fine and packed me a huge bowl. He was smoking me up after all, so I just took it. I tried my best to clear the bowl but I couldn&#39;t. After a huge hit that didn&#39;t even clear it, I handed it to him, telling him to clear it because that was enough for me and I was gonna be coughing for a few minutes anyway. He cleared it, packed his own bowl, smoked that, and then asked if we were done. I told him to pack me a very small bowl that would be my last one and, again, he packed a huge one. Same thing - tried my best, took a huge hit but couldn&#39;t clear it, and gave it to him to clear after a coughing fit. We then took back to cruising, listening to music, and catching up with each other.\u000a\u000aThis lasted about 15-20 minutes, during which we stopped at a gas station where I stumbled and laughed a lot while he filled up a tire of his that was low on air, went back to cruising and then the trip began. My tongue went numb, which for me is the trademark first sign of a bad trip. My legs, arms, and hands went numb shortly after, and a panic attack hit me pretty hard. Yelling at my friend to take me home, I took .5mg of clonazepam to stop the trip, and sipped on the drink I&#39;d brought with me (non-alcoholic) while we made our way to my house. It took me about 30-45 minutes to come down to a point where he felt comfortable leaving me at home alone, which is a bit longer than most of my bad trips last, likely due to the size of the bowls he packed me.\u000a\u000aMost of my friends have told me that the trip I described here is their favourite kind of trip, and that they find it very hard to achieve. Well, I&#39;ll tell you that with Critical Mass, that trip&#39;s very easy to reach. Although I am a lightweight, I didn&#39;t smoke a whole lot (definitely no more than a gram), so someone with a regular tolerance wouldn&#39;t have much trouble reaching that point. If you like that kind of high, this is definitely some great weed for you. It&#39;s potent and gets the job done. However, if you&#39;ve got anxiety like me, you may want to avoid it - unless you still like that type of high. I&#39;ve kept my eye open since then to avoid smoking this strain at all costs, but the person in my city that is selling it is keeping it stocked because it&#39;s very popular. An awful strain for me, but a fantastic one for any smokers without any considerable anxiety.

The high is very psychoactive while being very calming which makes it the type of hybrid i like! reminds me a bit of afghooey but this strain is ten times more silly! my friends and I could barely keep standing without flowing back and forth both physically and through discussion of the universe and ethics. Excellent earthy taste with a hint of pine. Smelled pretty skunky too which didn&#39;t really come through in the flavor of the smoke. After 3 bowls was just a completely melted hunter thompson kind of popsicle but i was still engaged and social which makes this bud a 5/5 for me. my mind was on fire but in the good way! excellent strain!

VThis strain was OK. I am a huge indica fan and CM just did not live up to my expectations. It has a really high CBD, so you aren&#39;t going to feel as &#39;high&#39;. I was hoping for some ease of pain or some deep relaxation. I felt hungry. That&#39;s pretty much it. Not a bad strain. Not a good strain. Would recommend to someone new to flower use and is exploring different strains.

VFantastic for insomnia. Everytime I smoke this strain it knocks me out! Heavy indica, earthy sweet taste and smell with thicker smoke. Big, chunky buds covered in trichs. The shatter was static clingy and looked like dried chips of clear honey. Dabs taste like a bouquet of roses, no earthy undertones like the flowers. I feel the dabs in my head a lil more than the flower. Both start at the shoulders and melt downwards, relieving all stress. Great for anxiety as well as physical pain. Narcotic type of high. I feel like I have drifted away.

VI love the stoned feeling I get with critical mass. Only issue is the effects don&#39;t hit me for 20 minutes, minimum. It&#39;s only this strain that I have a delayed reaction to, so not sure what&#39;s going on with that. But when it does sink in I&#39;m comfortably couchlocked, happily stoned.

VAs someone who has suffered from insomnia for the past 9 years, I did not think I would ever be able to find anything to help me sleep a good thorough night. Well....... I&#39;ve been smoking critical mass high in CBD for three nights and for the first time in 7 months now, I haven&#39;t taken one single sleeping aid and have had the BEST sleep I could recall and waking up full of energy!\u000aI smoke an hour or two before I plan on going to bed, hits pretty quickly with a good body relaxation but a nice touch of head high that keeps you happy and talkative if you are around friends.\u000aAfter about an hour when I&#39;m just alone in my room, I&#39;m just happy and relaxed ( on my computer, petting my dog, watching alice in wonderland) And once the lights go out and I&#39;m in bed, it won&#39;t take longer than 5 or 10 minutes for me to be totally out!\u000aNo munchies, some dry mouth but quite fixable with water. Great weed.  5/5

V With a CBD percentage of 17% give or take and around 19% THC give or take. Excellent aroma, great strain to have around for its many therapeutic traits but also as a beginner strain. Euphoric,  clear-minded, almost energized in a way. This strain is also great to smoke if you are couch - locked or are experiencing adverse effects, this strains high CBD can reverse these unwanted effects.
