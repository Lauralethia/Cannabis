VA great hybrid, best for daytime but also good for a relaxing evening smoke. Has earthy and fruity notes, and is VERY pungent. Both novice and experienced smokers will enjoy this one.

VI\u2019m a very seasoned (3-5 bowl/day) smoker with access to a very nice variety of strains and I alternative strains as well to avoid tolerance. In fact, I\u2019ve been noticing diminishing returns lately and have even considered a t-break. I normally smoke early (after coffee) but today waited until I finished running some errands. I got home loaded a bowl of Critical Cheese and was immediately, and I mean IMMEDIATELY hit with the dry eyes, mouth, body high, euphoria, head high, the works. This is such a nicely balanced strain. For people prone to anxiety you will experience none with this strain.  It paradoxically provides both relaxation and energy. A+

VBought this cheap so thought it was going to be just the mellow type. Was surprised when I first smoked it and the affect it had on me and some pals. Two joints worth and it hits you hard. However, just having the right amounts presses the buttons as you can be energetic of small doses. Very smooth on the throat too.

VMuy buena cepa, una combinaci&#243;n de muy rico sabor y un muy buen pegue. El sabor tiene un inconfundible dejo de Cheese, pero no necesariamente super marcado. El pegue es muy bueno, bien de Sativa, personalmente mis favoritas.\u000aSi bien no llego a entrar en la categor&#237;a de &quot;las mejores que fum&#233;&quot; tampoco se qued&#243; tan lejos, una cepa m&#225;s que recomendable.
