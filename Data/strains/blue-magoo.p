VIf you&#39;re in a lot of pain but still want to be alert and functional, you might want to check this strain out ASAP. Blue Magoo has a great balance between Sativa and Indica properties that really do deliver the best of both worlds--pain relief without that lingering &quot;I need a nap&quot; feeling. If you&#39;re needing to get work done around the house, going out with friends, or simply just want to enjoy your day pain-free, I&#39;d really recommend looking more into this enjoyable bud. Cheers!

VWhen doing reviews on Leafly I do a broad overview of my feelings on each strain.  A full view of the strain based on a culmination of the many different experiences not broken down by each different percentage or dispensary.  In fact when first putting reviews on this site I would list all the dispensaries (sometimes 9 or 10) at bottom when asked for more details finally realizing they only posted the first one.  Rarely is there is a huge discrepancy in my opinion of a strains qualities &amp; character so why be redundant.\u000a\u000aFeels like most users with profiles on Leafly feel this way or else there would be 10 reviews by same person for different dispensaries under the same strain.  There are not.  Now what does all this have to do with Blue Magoo?  This herb challenges the notion that it is possible to make such generalizations with discriminating between the very sub par to some of the finest weed I&#39;ve smoked.  \u000a\u000aMaybe being spoiled with having some really dank BM with a terpene extravaganza almost beyond description my first few tries let me see this.  Thick luscious smoke tasting of sweet fruits, mainly blueberries, honeysuckle, and creamy smoothness that lulled me into pain free sleep.  Being a time in my life of extreme emotional &amp; physical discomfort  this cannabis was a side kick who had my back.  Metaphor, not pun, back pain was not the issue =P\u000a\u000aFast forward six months when fate brings BM back into my life.  With great delight riding a wave of nostalgia of that superb flavor that is really awesome being almost indescribable, but it wasn&#39;t there.  It was like biting into a hamburger, but only getting bun when you&#39;re really hungry.  Trying to get out of a room with no exit when you&#39;ve got tickets &amp; the show started five minutes ago.  Would have been devastating had the buzz which was powerful in relaxation not stayed consistent holding its own clout.  \u000a\u000aAfter several more rounds with this strain it has come to my attention that I am a &quot;terpene whore&quot;.  They make the high what it is when coupled with cannabinoids in perfect unison with their absence leaving even high percentage flower lame.  Each time smoking lame Magoo the review would go three stars down. Tending to the positive side of things &amp; also being that we are cannabis community so better to foster the relationships forged. It doesn&#39;t seem right to point out each time sub par versions are tried with a different review.\u000a\u000aIt is just the system which could be set up much better Leafly =)  Thank you for the forum though it is very appreciated just feel the need to express how my reviews are crafted for better understanding to my audience.  Blue Magoo just so happens to be the bud that points out such things being such an amazing flower with all its terpene grandeur.  Just be warned that sometimes it can be grown in manner that leaves it stripped of this which no matter how much THC leaves something to be desired.  It truly does take a village (entourage effect).....

VNot quite my &quot;holy grail&quot; of weed but not far from it. Definitely an exceptional strain that I have the pleasure of growing and smoking my own. In my opinion it is best at 10 weeks then cured for 3.\u000aI also call it &quot;the cancer patients dream&quot;\u000aFeel no pain, get hungry (I mean REALLY hungry) no anxiety, happy great smoke with up lifted head and good indica body buzz

VI am in love with Blue Magoo. \u000aIt&#39;s a beautiful looking flower. \u000aIt immediately lifts any depression, nausea and laziness from my body. You can see colors more vividly, and your mind starts working overtime. \u000aThis is my go to day smoke. It is definitely an upper for me.

VSo sweet and satisfying. Blue Magoo seems to kick in immediately after inhale, and is soooo super effective for remedying nausea and lack of appetite. Plus anxiety attacks, night terrors, soul-draining stress, menstrual cramps, headaches...it&#39;s just an excellent strain all around. Plus it&#39;s super pretty, with the light blue sparkly crystal frosting. I highly recommend.

VVery very tasty! Blueberry/pine smell and taste, very smooth. Buds are like rocks, extremely dense and burn well. Plants have stout and sturdy branches, no problem supporting the buds. Very smelly plant. If you find a clone, buy it! I&#39;m far from a professional grower, but I find my own bmg better than what&#39;s on the shelves I have sampled. The high is a good hybrid mix, not overly uplifting or couchlocked... But dont get me wrong, this shit is very potent! Tastes so good it&#39;s easy to go overboard and keep smoking, it&#39;s definitely not needed lol. Anyone giving less than 5 stars got a bad batch.

VSo I came across the Blue Magoo when I couldn&#39;t find PBK, and it was actually blue! I went back for more and it was from a new grow, which isn&#39;t blue, but it&#39;s smothered in white and smells incredibly like mixed berries. This Blue Magoo would be 5/5 if it didn&#39;t burn so quickly. Otherwise this strain is flat out phenomenal. The sweet sweet smell of berries, the sticky dense white buds are beautiful, and even with a glass piece it was possibly the smoothest strain I&#39;ve ever had. Currently my absolute favorite. Seriously.

VThe first hit and I was in love with this strain! Taste was smooth, fruity and sweet to pine and herbal flavors. I had just two very small hits off a pre roll and the instant happy, relaxed euphoria took me to a lovely place where I no longer noticed the days worth of tension, anxiety and pain that had been bothering me when I got home from work. I enjoyed the flavors of my dinner so much and the interaction with our cats and dog was elevated for me...Still had the munchies after small dinner. I had a healthy snack that tasted amazing, too! Think that Blue Magoo adds layers of flavor to what my taste buds usually experience :) I fell asleep easily and had some amazing dreams and woke up refreshed! Love this strain!! Will definitely smoke it again and again :)

It also doesn&#39;t feel very heady.. Which is nice because I don&#39;t like it when I am forced to think too much while stoned. Also gives you the munchies like you might kill someone if you don&#39;t get to eat that piece of candy you forgot about deep inside the cupboard!! Haha. A good depression weed too..

VMy longtime stoner friend said that her favorite strain was Blue Magoo, so when I saw this on the menu at Glisan Buds I knew I had to go get some!\u000a\u000aBlue Magoo smells like blueberry and dirt, like over ripe blueberries fallen and squished on the forest floor after a warm summer rain.  Mmmm tasty!!  This afternoon I started to vape some Blue Magoo, and have been running on even keel all day.\u000a\u000aThis hybrid strain and renders a nice, smooth, even high that says &quot;classy&quot; to me.  An all purpose, crowd pleasing weed for sure!   The particular bud I bought is having a more sativa than indica type effect on me.   Many have said that Blue Magoo gave them the munchies but it didn&#39;t have this effect on me.

VWhat a lucky find!  At Glisan Buds I was able to nab the very last Blue Magoo cartridge.  I&#39;ve enjoyed Blue Magoo in flower form, but never the cartridge, and mine tested at a whopping 83.08% THC and .69% CBD.  It has an unusual taste to it.  Blueberry for sure, but also a heavy tar like taste too.  It&#39;s not unpleasant, just really different, and according to Leafly it is a clone-only hybrid cross between DJ Short Blueberry and Major League Bud (also known as William\u2019s Wonder F2).\u000a\u000aWhen I reviewed Blue Magoo in flower form I wrote, &quot;Blue Magoo smells like blueberry and dirt, like over ripe blueberries fallen and squished on the forest floor after a warm summer rain&quot;.   I still find this to be true, and I recall the flower tasting a bit better than the extract in this cartridge, but hey, it&#39;s a concentrate, and at 83 % THC I am NOT complaining! \u000a\u000aWhile Blue Magoo is a hybrid, on me in extract form it is very much a sativa, and it was in flower form too. Last night I was bouncing off the walls in spite of only having had 5 hours sleep the night before, and it also made me generically happy.  Blue Magoo is an upper, perfect for daytime use!  It also made me clear headed - great for daytime use!  I read on Leafly by some that it&#39;s mostly an indica but the batch I have is not at all, at least on me.\u000a\u000aThis time around Blue Magoo gave me terrible munchies, but I&#39;m also PMSing, so... so be careful :)  have some pickles and chopped veggies nearby for immediate snacking!   I like to drink herbal tea for a sweet taste when I get the munchies, and the iced herbal tea tastes extra refreshing when I&#39;m high. \u000a\u000aThe only reason I didn&#39;t give this strain 5 stars is that I&#39;ve had other blueberry / berry / grape tasting stains that tasted better.

VBest all around bud for an experienced indica heavy hybrid lover. Smokable all day without cognitive difficulties. No paranoia, believe me, I have GAD and panic attacks and does not induce anxiety. Great body buzz, it will have your temples buzzing and legs tingling. A nice but functional head-high is also packed in there. This bud kept me from quitting and going back on prescription meds after bouts with anxiety when I smoked other strains (mostly sativa). This is my go-to chronic! Long lasting too, I still feel a good hangover into the next day when I smoke at night ( approx. a gram per day, no reason to smoke more lol) Recommended for anxiety, depression or just to relax and have a great time in your own head.

V[Blueberry x Afgoo] hybrid vs the [Blue Dream x Afgoo] Blue Goo.\u000aBig chunky nugs that are more blue/black than green under the moderate coating of trichromes characterize this strain. Mostly an Indica hybrid, the high is very upbeat and active while remaining mellow and focused, though going to heavy before work makes me paranoid. Great for video games, challenging activities, or writing. While it does relieve pain, it&#39;s not a terribly long-lasting high, and Heavy smokers will definitely find themselves wishing they had something with a little more punch, if trying to really blast off for video games then bed.

VA great hybrid staple, that I&#39;ve enjoyed many times. Blue Magoo supposedly originated from PDX in the mid-&#39;90&#39;s. It has an enjoyable sweet &amp; earthy aroma. It gives me a little bit of a cerebral high, but it mainly helps me relax. I like it because it does a great job of reducing stress and anxiety.

VAmazing, probably my favorite strain to date. First of all it&#39;s delicious, bursting with blueberry flavor but not at all harsh. It&#39;s a really smooth, clean smoke. Giggly, relaxed, but still really energetic. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve also gotten a recent cross between blue magoo and super silver haze which is even better. You can find it at Serra in Portland OR. And that is my new favorite strain but not yet on leafly. It&#39;s all that you love about blue magoo plus an added focused and energetic head high which I think makes this one lean more toward the saliva side from the SSH. It&#39;s even more beautiful than the OG blue magoo. Anyways, try them, both, you won&#39;t regret it.

VI find this strain to have a bit of an odd combination of effects. Not terribly similar to those listed. It had a light blueberry taste with hints of a nutty light fuel vapor, somewhat similar to its smell. Higher potency with 1.1% THC &amp; 23.7% THCA. Decent pain relief through entire body via a somewhat subtle, lightly tingly but numbing body rush that poors over the body. Body is relaxed, but somewhat antsy &amp; anxious, fiddly really. Mind wise, not Euphoric nor happy... more focused and hard fact calculating, though physically relaxed, my thoughts are actually more concerned with significant issues with a absolute tough truth no candy coated hard truth viewpoint... which isn&#39;t my normal approach. That&#39;s usually more balanced of straight shooting, relatable and teachable, try to view from all sides process. I oddly want to debate right now and slap both main political party folks hard across the face until they  all wake the hell up, open their eyes and speak the truth. So not much introspection at the moment. Dunno, just a weird high for me. Kinda hope it&#39;s just a 1 time type high with these flowers.

VI like the flavor of this one, It&#39;s a nice and flowery draw with some pleasant berry undertones. The indica-dominant effect hits me first for sure, but does not do well for my pain. The smell is a deep berry-grape, and Blue Magoo is sure to please many patients&#39; needs.

VI LOVE the taste of this stuff, I am all about fruity weeds and this really fits that well. It&#39;s one of my favorite strains for solo chilling, listening to music, reading, etc cause it doesn&#39;t make me feel foggy. It helps with sleep most nights as indicas do, but I don&#39;t tend to feel drowsy or heavy.\u000a\u000aI have generalized anxiety disorder and this stuff can create a little anxiety or paranoia for me, just a heads up. It&#39;s normally fine if I&#39;m home doing my thing but I wouldn&#39;t imbibe and then head out into crowds.

VThis is my first strain review, as I have been inspired by this little gem of a strain. I got some clones from my neighbor and saw his final product and wasn&#39;t too impressed or excited for it. Man was I wrong! Now the whole phynotype philosophy makes beautiful sense to me. I grew two magoos in a top drip hydro system until about week 4 of flower, when my gorilla glues and white widows lifted up their little lady skirts only to reveal they were now chicks with di.... they went hermaphrodite is where I was going with that. Anyways I removed them into a new flower room as they were the only strain to not even show a sign of herminism. Basically they&#39;re extremely healthy plants, strong burley genetics, healthiest leaves of all 10 strains I grew, deliciously pungent sweet fruit basket aroma and tastes like I just blew Tucan Sam. I recommend highly to include this strain in your first grow if you want an easy win. \u000a-Yeah-bruh-daber-dude

VAmazing, not the best yielder but such amazing fragrance and flavors, easy to grow also, there is another original phenome out there called dankleberry (Portland area) and it has more of the MLB characteristics and grows the opposite end of the spectrum. Big blue and purple afghani buds. Not to get to far off the topic of what a great strain the blue Magoo is tho, so if you know someone who knows someone and can get a clone I highly suggest you get it :)

VI&#39;m growing Blue Magoo now.  I must say, it is one of my favorites to smoke and grow.  The Buds are frosty and smell so fruity.  I&#39;m still a noob, with about 2 years of continuous grow.  I&#39;ve become more patient, and better able to read the trichomes.  I keep this strain in my garden at all times.

VStill using Blue Magoo as my go-to medicine. Knocks out my migraine every time. I like that it comes on with a slight sativa kick (very slight for me) and allows me to function well. Then it finishes with a nice indica body relaxation.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve tried several different versions now, and I&#39;ve found one that has 2% CBD which is very high for Blue Magoo. It&#39;s very nice.\u000a\u000aI only vaporize. I like the taste. Just a little fruity and tasty. Not harsh at all.\u000a\u000aMy favorite.

VI thought I&#39;d make today a Blue Magoo day since I have a lot of it in flower since it was the $25 quarter special last week at the Oregon Grown Gift Shop.&#160; This indica dominant hybrid has always been&#160; fave of mine and after the week I&#39;ve had it feels so good to just chill.&#160;&#160;\u000a\u000aI&#39;m taking my black coffee this morning with some fattening&#160;hard coconut &#160;and&#160;a loose leaf tea ball filled with Blue Magoo steeped for 5 minutes or so.&#160; Not bad!&#160; The dark roast black coffee and coconut are masking the cannabis taste pretty well and I&#39;m feeling a deep blue wave wash over me.&#160; I could be messed up pretty soon, because I&#39;m also smoking it from my bubbler pipe (a bit easier on the lungs this way and mine are a bit touchy at the moment).\u000a\u000aMy Blue Magoo tested out at 16.20% THC and .38% CBD.&#160; It smells and tastes like blueberry with a hint of tar, and not in an unpleasant way either, it&#39;s just different from some of the fruitier blueberry and grape tasting strains out there.&#160; Blue Magoo is a romantic strain on me; I am relaxed and feel like being lovey dovey with someone and making out with them for hours, but I&#39;m too relaxed and stoned to do much more than that lol.\u000a\u000aI hope everyone has a safe and fun St. Patrick&#39;s Day!

VI find this strain to have a bit of an odd combination of effects. Not terribly similar to those listed. It had a light blueberry taste with hints of a nutty light fuel vapor, somewhat similar to its smell. Higher potency with 1.1% THC &amp; 23.7% THCA. Decent pain relief through entire body via a somewhat subtle, lightly tingly but numbing body rush that poors over the body. Body is relaxed, but somewhat antsy &amp; anxious, fiddly really. Mind wise, not Euphoric nor happy... more focused and hard fact calculating, though physically relaxed, my thoughts are actually more concerned with significant issues with a absolute tough truth no candy coated hard truth viewpoint... which isn&#39;t my normal approach. That&#39;s usually more balanced of straight shooting, relatable and teachable, try to view from all sides process. I oddly want to debate right now and slap both main political party folks hard across the face until they  all wake the hell up, open their eyes and speak the truth. So not much introspection at the moment. Dunno, just a weird high for me. Kinda hope it&#39;s just a 1 time type high with these flowers.

VUpon first greeting the Bluest of Magoo\u2019s, I noticed the finest of phenotypes; dense buds coupled with tight orange pistils and an earthy green complexion. The smell is very earthy with subtle floral notes. \u000a\u000aMrs.Magoo was consumed using my favorite method; cbd blunt wraps. Post-inhalation reminded me of freshly cut grass combined with light fruity undertones, which is appreciated when considering the aftertaste. \u000a\u000aEffects: The sativa qualities appear through a strong cerebral high that helps to energize and motivate you to get moving. However, the indica side of this hybrid is not shy, and will make itself known by relaxing your body in a way that feels like a hammock on a breezy day. \u000a\u000a9/10

VAmazing, probably my favorite strain to date. First of all it&#39;s delicious, bursting with blueberry flavor but not at all harsh. It&#39;s a really smooth, clean smoke. Giggly, relaxed, but still really energetic. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve also gotten a recent cross between blue magoo and super silver haze which is even better. You can find it at Serra in Portland OR. And that is my new favorite strain but not yet on leafly. It&#39;s all that you love about blue magoo plus an added focused and energetic head high which I think makes this one lean more toward the saliva side from the SSH. It&#39;s even more beautiful than the OG blue magoo. Anyways, try them, both, you won&#39;t regret it.

Vvery satisfied with this strain.  smoked smooth, not real harsh but hit the mind and body quickly.  Wife and I had four or so rips from the bong and were properly baked.  very talkative but stoney high.  didn&#39;t couch as hard as straight indicas, but gave me a big, euphoric body high.

VThis is my first strain review, as I have been inspired by this little gem of a strain. I got some clones from my neighbor and saw his final product and wasn&#39;t too impressed or excited for it. Man was I wrong! Now the whole phynotype philosophy makes beautiful sense to me. I grew two magoos in a top drip hydro system until about week 4 of flower, when my gorilla glues and white widows lifted up their little lady skirts only to reveal they were now chicks with di.... they went hermaphrodite is where I was going with that. Anyways I removed them into a new flower room as they were the only strain to not even show a sign of herminism. Basically they&#39;re extremely healthy plants, strong burley genetics, healthiest leaves of all 10 strains I grew, deliciously pungent sweet fruit basket aroma and tastes like I just blew Tucan Sam. I recommend highly to include this strain in your first grow if you want an easy win. \u000a-Yeah-bruh-daber-dude

VI LOVE the taste of this stuff, I am all about fruity weeds and this really fits that well. It&#39;s one of my favorite strains for solo chilling, listening to music, reading, etc cause it doesn&#39;t make me feel foggy. It helps with sleep most nights as indicas do, but I don&#39;t tend to feel drowsy or heavy.\u000a\u000aI have generalized anxiety disorder and this stuff can create a little anxiety or paranoia for me, just a heads up. It&#39;s normally fine if I&#39;m home doing my thing but I wouldn&#39;t imbibe and then head out into crowds.

VThis one is remarkable. I was immediately impressed. Not only did it knock out my pain surprisingly well. Even better than such excellent body pain combatants god bud &amp;a the black ...this hybrid had a different effect on me. I felt uplifted and motivated . The better than average pain relief must be due to blue magoo indica parents. I deem this one appropriate for daytime use with pain &amp;fatigue. However use your own judgement. We all respond to different compounds a little differently from eachother . I highly recommend this one. I even feel pain relieved and uplifted enough to go work on a little music this evening. To any followers I have.... how many times have you heard me say that about a strain?

VWow.  Solid weed.  Comes on strong, stays fairly intense, although in a mellow way.  Stoney, like all the Afghani hybrids but without some of the heaviness you get from, say, Afgoo.  Smells like a field of berries in bloom; looks are grade A nug porn.  Very frosty.  Also has a nice arousal quality.  It does have a bit of dizziness to it, and after three hours or so, it becomes a terrific sleep aid!
