V4 stars for almost getting me there, but not quite. Upon initial inspection these buds are pretty big ,dense, with a range of green hues mixed with purple and frosty trichomes. The aroma is sweet , with a good mix of earthiness and a lil pungency that WW offers. The initial effects were those of a Hybrid where my body did feel relaxed but yet i was    alert. My brain(which is usually racing) was still racing, but the indica effects kinda made it tolerable. Overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good strain for an even balance,just not my first choice ,next time.

VIt&#39;s similar to the other widows. Mellow high. The strain smells but the high is amazing. The taste is fruity and sour . Highly recommend

VGreat bud here. Makes me energetic and talkative also alert. I get a relaxed feeling as well. A good one to knock  you out after a good meal. Definitely makes you hungry. Beware of cotton mouth. This a strong one.

VAmazing strain for calming, relaxed, and dreamy state but also a bit of a head buzz. works well for my pain and anxiety. That said, it gives me horrendous nightmares after falling asleep. I&#39;ve never experienced nightmarish dreams after falling asleep before this strain. It never fails though, on the days I smoke this strain I will have bad nightmares and when I choose another strain, no nightmares. I wish I could smoke it without a nightmare because it would definitely be one of my favorites of all time.
