VThe smell is a strong apricot aroma, and the buds are dense with olive-green bud and red hairs. The smoke is sweet and nutty on the inhale, and spicy (think black pepper) on the exhale. It gets kind of harsh toward the end of the bowl so keep a drink handy. Uplifting, energizing, and empowering describe this strain&#39;s effects, and the experience is pleasant as a whole, though I would not recommend to those who are sensitive to strong sativas.

VVoodoo is incredible- I read an article about what strains were best for enhancing sex and it said that Voodoo was the best strain for a three some. Which was funny because we were having our first three some and that&#39;s why I was looking. I decided to try it out in the hot tub before our #3 arrived and it instantly turned me into a maniac!  I had my husband pinned up against the side of the hot tub and had non stop orgasms to the point that I could not breathe!!!  \u000a\u000aOnce I was done I was so chilled out and content with the world but was worried that I was going to be worn out when our guest arrived and not be able to enjoy it. Took a little nap and hit it again and BAM I started up again. \u000a\u000aI thought that it had to be a placebo effect though because I was pretty excited about the situation. The next day was my husbands birthday but we worked 10 hours and drove 5 more so when we got to the hotel I was totally uninterested in sex. I thought maybe my voodoo might get me turned on enough to make an effort but again as soon as I hit it I was all over him. \u000a\u000aIt has had that same effect every single time. I am almost 50 years old and never tried weed until last year. I have tried about a dozen different strains as well as lots of edibles. I like almost everything but honestly can take it or leave it. Except for my VooDoo. \u000a\u000aIt literally makes me feel like my girl parts are on fire. And it is almost instant!  But unlike some other strains that make me a zombie or make me wired, this comes over me like a warm wave and when it passes I am alert and at peace. \u000a\u000aMy hubby likes it but he likes all weed so that&#39;s not saying much. It does not have the same aphrodisiac effect for him but does make him able to keep up with me. \u000a\u000aDid I mention I love this stuff??

VI&#39;ve built up a pretty strong over time and have found myself leaning towards Indicas, although I try any new strain I come across - once I can.\u000a\u000aVoodoo was quite the unexpected and I mean it in a good way. After the first toke, I immediately felt a pressure behind my eyes. As the blunt kept making its rounds around the circle, I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into the couch. My usually racing mind suddenly became calm and at that point, negativity ceased to exist.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m still very relaxed at the point of writing this but I think I&#39;m gonna end it here and spend some quality time with my crew =)\u000a\u000aDefinitely pick this strain up - should you find it.

VBought an eighth of this strain of wax at a dispensary out in the Lansing area. Very strong cerebral effects, very noticeable in the top of your spine. The overall quality of the wax was great and had me feeling very productive and sociable. Tolerance builds very quickly when it comes to sativa strains for me however, so I would recommend alternating this with other strains to keep the effects fresh and evident. \u000a

VOkay. Coming across quality thai strains are like christmas for me, and this is like that one &quot;big&quot; present hidden behind the tree just when you think you didn&#39;t get what you &quot;really&quot; wanted that year. Its that good. Thai (purple, I hear) x AK47. Seriously a kick to the head that has every orifice in your head dripping but in that, &quot;good god, this is what cannabis should be like&quot; sort of way. VERY heavy, very intense head high that does segue nicely down through your body. Tends to linger in the groinal area, too- sex was Amazing for my girl and i, as we both found this plant to have several aphrodisiac qualities. Small warning, however: try to go in with a good mindset and you will be rewarded greatly. Negative vibes however, do not lend themselves well as the insensity only amplifies every last thing your feeling. Feeling down? Grab a bowl or two, your lady, a movie and laugh, love and be merry. Lifes to short. Fuck already. -Father Dope.

VI would have given this one a full 5 stars, but the high didn&#39;t last long. I smoked this from a bong &amp; I LOVE IT. The only draw back was that it didn&#39;t last very long.

VSuprised by the low rating for a strain with such great qualities. Very euphoric, uplifting, will give you the tinglies and a long lasting creeper. The phenotype I got to try from The Joint By Cannabis in Denver is 80/20 indica dominant hybrid, so im not sure how they got a 100% sativa landrace to this but however they did it, it sure is an elite herb.

VThis strain tastes strongly of Irish Spring soap and hay. It&#39;s not a smooth smoke at all and it&#39;ll make you cough. However, a few minutes after taking 2 hits, I feel hard, chronic pressure that goes in a band around my head easing. That&#39;s a huge relief, honestly. It may be a sativa, but I&#39;m smoking it at 1 am. It&#39;s working. I&#39;m glad I bought several ounces. It&#39;s good medicine.

VVoodoo was the second strain I ever smoked. I smoked it outside while on vacation in Colorado. After smoking outside, we went back upstairs to the area we were renting via AIRBNB. This was a very uplifting, giggly, foggy high. This high just made me want to chill on the couch. I vividly remember trying to unscrew the cap on my already unscrewed water bottle, and struggling to even drink water. But, this strain made me a wee tad paranoid. I went through the cabin and shut all the blinds, because I felt like I was being watched. But other than that, I had a great time. I usually do have a good time on this strain. Definitely recommend

VVoodoo is the only strain of weed I&#39;ve tried that I haven&#39;t liked. It did give me a euphoric (but anxious) high, at first. Then on the comedown I felt like complete shit, depressive and a little numb. It&#39;s like the short high drained all the happiness from the rest of my day. My friends didn&#39;t have the same thoughts though, they really liked it for the most part but personally I probably wouldn&#39;t smoke it again.
