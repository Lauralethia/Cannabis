VPretty invigorating. Taste is very lemony and I got an instant head buzz. Gave me a lot of pressure behind the eyes but it was nice. Had a nice euphoria for ten minutes, then mellowed into a introspective heady feel. Wanted to go skate but was content with playing gamecube. Lasted slightly longer than other strains I get. No down side for me what so ever.

VIf you&#39;re looking for that classic diesel buzz, this is just that.  Provides  Exceptional pain relief for a sativa strain. Wonderful for day time use. Stress reliever and helps with anxiety.

VVery nice taste and uplifting. But it is better mixed with tobacco or another strain if you prefer a soft high and not much anxiety. You will be ready to enjoy a sunny day or a party night. I used in vacation and I always mixed with some another stuff to boost it.
