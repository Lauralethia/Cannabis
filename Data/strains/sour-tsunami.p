VI have Ankylosing spondylitis which comes with severe spine and joint pain. Due to neck involvement, I get horrific cervical headaches, and this high CBD strain is the first time in years I&#39;ve been pain free. A few hits of this and I&#39;m absolutely free of pain, but have a perfectly clear head and feel entirely sober. It&#39;s bliss. For someone who hasn&#39;t experienced freedom from severe unrelenting pain in years, to have a couple of hours pain free is the best gift in the world. I&#39;ll be keeping this on hand at all times from now on.

VI am still fairly new to the high-cbd sativa strains like Harlequin and Sour Tsunami and my immediate reaction was, &quot;where have you been all my life?&quot; It wants to treat my anxiety and depression AND pain without putting me to sleep or making me feel like the world is crashing down on me? Praise the gods. I will mix this with something heavier at night when I want to just chill in bed for a couple hours before sleeping.

VThis is hands down my favorite strain I&#39;ve ever used. I have extremely bad anxiety which causes insomnia often. I&#39;m highly affected by THC. I first tried Harlequin which was suggested by my local rec shop. THC/CBD on the label said 5%THC / 11%CBD, I smoked a TINY amount and within 5 minutes of trying Harlequin I was noticeably high even though it was a high CBD strain. Since I&#39;m highly affected by THC, the affects of that strain threw me for a loop. About 2 weeks later, I got the courage to try Sour Tsunami, it had been just sitting on my counter for about a week. The label said 1%THC / 22.4% CBD, knowing that it still had some THC in it I was still a little hesitant. Smoked the same amount as Harlequin and within 5-10mins I noticed I was just relaxing at my computer doing some reading. I wasn&#39;t fidgeting like I typically do, I was getting up moving around 5 times every minute. I was clicking and dragging text on the screen like I typically do. I was CHILLed the fuck out. I even tried to make myself think about my anxiety and there was nothing. It was like there was an entire section of my brain dedicated to anxiety and worrying that was just completely shut off. Over the course of a week, I smoke a little amount 1-2 times a day. It&#39;s been the best week I&#39;ve had in years when it comes to my anxiety / stress / sleep and overall how I feel throughout the day. No body high buzz, no mental high feeling... I just wasn&#39;t anxious or nervous or worrying about anything I typically do. I&#39;m about to head to my rec shop in a bit after writing this review just to go back and buy 3 more grams of it which should last me a good while because of how little I smoke at a time. The other really big thing I found this helped with was my body tension. I sit all day long, typically not in a chair with good posture. But in weird places like the floor, or up against the wall while I work on my computer. This has lead to really bad upper back, neck and shoulder tension. Completely gone after 5-10mins after smoking some Sour Tsunami. If your the type of person like myself who doesn&#39;t like the &quot;mental&quot; feeling of being high, or the awkward body buzzing high feeling, but are trying to find something to help sooth your brain, thoughts, worries, body tension/pain. You have to try Sour Tsunami. I honestly am NOT a big cannabis user, but I am 100% a believer in this strain because of personal experience, which nobody can say doesn&#39;t help. Give it a little smoke, enjoy mental freedom and clarity again.

VI bought this strain simply for the cbd content.I was surprised by the smell like it smelled like your good old fashioned pot your friend would have 20 years ago and you had to have more so I was enamored by this right away.The second thing was the taste it has a very light almost indistinct lime taste to it but smokes very smooth.I didn&#39;t cough one time after 3 joints of this stuff.As for the effects you will get high even though the thc content is pretty low if you keep hitting it throughout the day you will achieve a very peaceful calm high.Not anxious at all  \u000aNo paranoia effects.The medical aspect comes on slow but settles in your bones and keeps you actively engaged in whatever you are doing you can stay focused without going off track.Plus it kills your joint pain and headaches and other ailments pretty well but after about 5 hours you may get a wee bit of a comedown that can easily be cured by smoking more.Would recommend this for an all day smoke or for light smokers and beginners.Great way to gain your tolerance quickly.This batch is actually Sour Tsunami #3 and the content is supposed to be around 17 percent cbd and almost 2 percent thc but the likelyhood is that it has more thc for this strain.So after puffing on this all day I am not drowsy or tired whatsoever I have a pleasant high and my pain is gone even after a hard day of yard work.Sour Tsunami!!!!!

VThis another one of these A+ CBD strains. perfect for an outing, party, daytime, morning wake and bake. its just amazing. good smell, good smoke, amazing relief for anxiety, depression and pain. my batch is 5.94% thc and 13.19% cbd. basically a 2:1. it really does feel like a wash of pure relaxation, but energy as well. I actually smoked a 1/3 of a joint (plenty for me!) and later had a couple beers (spaced out over 2 hours) while at a gig. no bad side effects at all! Id say this is the perfect safe party strain. I plan on stocking up on this strain for that purpose! (also to have for mornings. and maybe even dance class haha) 10/10 would recommend.

The high is mellow, happy and full of levity. I use it mainly to alter my mood (calming down some of my more self limiting negative tendencies) so I can study, and retain what I read; and also to enjoy work. It can be great for physical activity outdoors too! :)

VThis strain was recommended to me by Mike at Rogue Valley Cannabis because of the high CBD content. It has worked great for me! I cannot use any strain with a high THC content ( 6% or more ) due bad psychological effects such as paranoia. This has really helped with muscle spasms and painful clonus in my legs. It also helps me get to sleep faster.

VI did not think I would ever be writing a review for something like this, but this strain deserves it. In my area (Portland) one of the dispensaries has this strain here at a ration of 1% THC, 20.1% CBD and all I can say is wow. The flavor is fragrant and smooth, and as someone with bad anxiety that can sometimes be triggered by head highs, this strain does not cause much if any head high. More a mild sense of calm. As for the rest of your body, it is simply amazing. The pain I had been feeling as a result of Acute Anxiety Disorder vanished.

VVery tasty. However, it was supposed to help chill me out(panic disorder) and I have an amazing amount of energy. Not necessarily panicking energy though. But honestly close. It kills my pain amazingly and it gives off the lovely CBD warmth sensation. Helped me focus as well. This strain is not panic inducing, but the energy one gets from it doesn&#39;t really keep panic at bay. I still have many moments where I notice the unpleasant sensations of my panic. So a pretty good strain over-all but maybe not a CBD anxiety strain.

VI&#39;ve just begun experiencing with strains but sour tsunami is for sure my favorite so far. I have a really low THC tolerance and I don&#39;t really enjoy head highs. This strain is great because I don&#39;t get scared I&#39;ll smoke too much and get too high. The body high feels like you&#39;re lying in the sun and your head is still pretty clear and focused. When I&#39;ve smoked this strain I&#39;ve done some great art, played battleship with my partner, and watched some alien conspiracy documentaries -- this strain has even helped me focus on studying for an exam. My only complaint is I wish that the high would last a little longer, sometimes I&#39;ll mix a little higher THC strain with it like Frank&#39;s Gift if I want a little bit more of a cerebral high. I definitely recommend for folks that have just started smoking or who have struggled with getting &quot;too high&quot; on other strains. This is a very high functioning strain to try out.

VThis hands down my favorite high CBD strain. It is tasty and sweet smelling with notes and flavors of pine, lemon, earth and grass. It gives a very mellow but alert high, if your low tolerance, it&#39;ll just feel relaxing with no perceptible euphoria if you are higher tolerance (I&#39;ve smoked this strain over various degrees of tolerance in myself). I love smoking this in the woods. The super tasty sweet and sour flavors come out best when vaporized on a low setting.

There is hardly any THC in this strain, so you may want to consider mixing this with another strain of your choosing for your desired effect.

VThis is my first try of a high-CBD strain and so far it has everything I like about my best highs (silly &quot;headband&quot; feeling, good mood, stuff is more fun, I feel more funny) without ANY of the downsides most anxietive-type people tend to experience. Only downside on its own is that it feels a bit more tricky to vape well.

VMy sciatica has been acting up, and I needed something to help with the pain of just standing up and sitting down, so I went and got some of this lovely flower. This strain is very fast-acting, and it does a great job of taking the sharp point off the pain. There is hardly any THC in this strain, so you may want to consider mixing this with another strain of your choosing for your desired effect. Sour Tsunami is meant to help with pain versus make you feel stoned. Cheers!

VI had a Chron&#39;s flare up in the middle of downtown Seattle. I smoked about .5g of this strain and felt better almost instantly. The high CBD levels are as effective as advertised. I didn&#39;t get extremely high, which was also a bonus. I didn&#39;t want to be overwhelmed in a huge city. That being said, the high isn&#39;t nonexistent. I was instantly put in a good mood which continued even after the high wore off. I would give this six stars if I could.

VOne of my all time favorite CBD strains. Typically has a decent amount of THC so you can still get high with the additional pain/inflammation/anxiety relief. I find this strain to be initially very cerebral, but because of its Cannabidiol content it does not provoke anxiety or be considered racy. Making it an excellent productive strain for those sensitive to sativa dominant strains but want that stimulant support. Flavor is rich in terpenes and absolutely delicious all around.

VSmoking Sour Tsunami on its own doesn&#39;t make much of an impact on me. I do really love the flavor and the light body buzz. Sour Tsunami shines brightest when used as an additive! I&#39;m so sensitive to THC, despite loving its medicinal benefits (especially for depression and pain relief). When I add Sour Tsunami to a strain with a higher THC count than I can tolerate (usually anything above 8%), I can reap the benefits of nearly any medicine. Keep it in your medicine cabinet! Love love love.

VDue to the low THC I can smoke a whole joint by myself, which is something I appreciate. I like to smoke to relax and help with pain, and if I&#39;m carefully clocking how many drags I&#39;m taking so I don&#39;t OD and trigger anxiety, that&#39;s definitely not relaxing. High CBD, helps with intense cramps. I get the giggles and lights are brighter. I watched Chris Brown&#39;s music video for &quot;Questions&quot; once after smoking and was absolutely entranced. Clear headed mild buzz. Doesn&#39;t last very long though. Living up to it&#39;s name it has a recognizable smell that is quite sour, but I find it enjoyable.

VBody high on this strain is incredible. The low THC in this strain makes it a great strain for anytime of the day. I don\u2019t find myself getting any extra tiredness from this strain but I feel a ton of pain relief as well as stress relief. You won\u2019t have an issue operating as your normal self with this strain either. You feel a little fuzzy but overall very clear minded. Definitely one of my new go to strains.

Vdefinitely a good early to late afternoon smoke. one thing I&#39;ve noticed with this strain is the time it takes to fully set in. maybe this is just for me, but when I smoked it, I have to wait a good 10mins before I really feel the full affects. take it slow and wait 5-10mins to let it fully set in. once it does, it seems 10x nicer than right after you smoke.

VI can\u2019t say enough good things about Sour Tsunami! It calms my anxiety in a big way. I also have fibromyalgia so my joints in my hands and arms swell and ache and just a few small bowls will take the swelling down and make me much more comfortable. I have a young daughter so I don\u2019t like to be high during the day so this is prefect because I remain complety sober no matter how much I smoke. I do smoke THC flower at night

VCool and collected.  Because of the high CBd content it\u2019s extremely mellow and light without any real heavy or even too noticeable high.  Fortunately, that\u2019s the point.  It does help with pain, and mild anxiety but in my opinion it\u2019s just not particularly potent enough for those of us that enjoy a little more noticeable of a head feel than this to combat extreme stresses.  A very functional choice for those that need something mellow for the day time, and don\u2019t get me wrong, it very much addressed tension, and anxiety, but it\u2019s light feel is great for a work day or so on, but as far as heavy anxiety that\u2019s almost paralyzing; it doesn\u2019t do it for me when it comes to alleviating that type of stress, anxiety, tension or paranoid type feelings.  I need a little more of an escape.

Taking this for anxiety so having a strain relax without making my heart jump out of my chest is a real plus.  I would say it has just a hint of a head calm, certainly not a head high.  If you are comparing it to Charlotte&#39;s Webb, then you can look for a similar feeling with just a little more OOMPH to it.

VI had to actually write a review this time just because everyone&#39;s feedback I find on this strain is on particular products that contain hardly any THC. I&#39;ve got some sour tsunami from &quot;Solstice&quot; growers at 17 percent CBD and 20 percent THC. While it seems to more efficiently alleviate pain and help with inflammation, it should be sufficient enough that a seasoned smoker should notice their being stoned considerably.

It&#39;s super Low THC content makes it perfect for when I need a super clear mind, but want some pain/stress relief. \u000a\u000aI also love to blend it with high THC strains to get close to a 1:1 ratio for the perfect high!\u000a\u000aI&#39;m so thankful for a steady supply!

VJust smoked a joint of this today and was very surprised how well I enjoyed it.  Although there was barely a trace of THC (.57%) the 10% CBD gave off an incredible body high experience.  Besides being pain-free I also experienced a great sense of relaxation and well-being.  For those wishing to skip the psychoactive effects of THC, this is your clear-headed solution.  Great for being functional throughout the day.

VI&#39;m only giving this 2 stars because the body effect is nice, but it gave me the worst headache. Like a really bad hangover. I would never buy it again and I&#39;m afraid to try anything similar after this experience. I&#39;ll just try topicals for pain relief, when I can afford to blow $60+ on a cream.

VSour Tsunami is amazing. It gets me a perfect high. And I don&#39;t even have to smoke a lot to get up there. Definitely nice when i&#39;m a little short on cash and try to extend the life of my weed. 10/10 would recommend.

VTried this and it was great for keeping me up when I was sick this last week. Didn&#39;t fully get rid of the pain completely but helped enough to be able to go to work and not have anyone know you are sick. Overall a great strain and will be keeping this one in my stash.

VLove this strain for the symptom relieve it offera. Minimally head high, but really relaxing body high. This strain also really helps with my asthma. That first time I smoked this was the first night I didn&#39;t need my inhaler at night in a long time.

VI like this one. easy to smoke. tasts pretty good. smells yummy. I can smoke with another strain, or just straight up, either way is satisfying. when I bought it, it was really fresh and sticky (exactly how I love it)  I wanted to stick my head in the jar!!! this is a keeper if I can keep getting this quality

VDid not like this strain at all and see why it was on sale. The only effect i had was sleepiness and a lazy body, no fun if you actually need to get things done.  But if you just want to waist your day sleeping, then by all means smoke this.
