VHeady and inimate yet uplifting and optimisic with a common propensity to proclaim &quot;wow, I&#39;m stoned,&quot; after ten minutes and up to an hour or two. The name fits this hermetic cave-dwelling indica, but once your inside the creative and philosophical juices flow leading to a stone that calms your mind and body but will uplift your soul and consiousness. Great for people with a heavy tolerance to Indicas and need anxiety relief that won&#39;t dumb them down.

VLite green and purple nugs. Super frosty! Glistning with crystals. Sweet, pungent smell. Musky smoke with a slight fruity aftertaste. Made my nose itch. Warlock does pack a punch. Shit hits you hard! Kinda comes out of nowhere. Super strong high. I could feel my muscels start to loosen up midway through the joint. Left me feeling relaxed and even headed. Definitly a indica dominant hybrid. 30 minutes later i was all up in the kitchen. Warlock is a triped out cannabis strain. Does the job...

VThis is a very powerful strain for the seasoned smoker. I was really impresssed by how long this strain kept me high, which was around 4 - 5 hours off a 1g blunt. The reason i rated it an 8 out of 10 was because, although it kept me extremely medicated for an extended period of time, it just didnt have that special quality to the high that some of my favorite strains have. This was still an EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE strain though, packing quite a punch. The high was more towards the sativa end of the spectrum, giving me a small amount of energy. I would purchase this bud again, especially if large amounts of bud were not available. A little of this bud goes a long way. Enjoy the ride.

VI just received this strain for Tilray, the buds look and smell great. I broke up a little bit eager to test it and see how great it is for daytime smoking.  The initial head high came on fast but wasn&#39;t as intense as other strains.  There was a very euphoric feeling that overcame my body about an hour in and I could feel all my muscles relax and I was ready to go for a walk and enjoy the sun.  After a couple hours I was so relaxed I decided it was time to take a nap.  Great strain, although I was hoping for more focus and energy, will have to try a little bit more next time and see if that changes the effects.

VA real classic smoke, which possesses both sativa and indica benefits, soothing the soul whilst sending you into a creative jam. A creative smoke that makes you want to skank to the afro beats in the background. No matter whats happened in the day, you can relax  late afternoon with this tasty treat. Bop out the beats, reduce frantic ruminations, and say goodbye to any physical discomfort.

VAs an African-American, Ordained Pagan Minister Warlock Lord, Sexual-Vampyre, Hedonist, Retired Marine Officer, when I discovered there was a weed strain named &#39;Warlock&#39;, well I just had to have it.  I traveled 30-minutes one-way just to obtain some.  It is an indica-dominant strain.  It does have a sweet and sour aroma.  The taste is skunky with no surprise having been crossed with Skunk and Afghani varieties.  After one bowl via a bong, it went straight to my head.  I was surprised that it did indeed stimulate my mind while not giving me that drowsy feeling by it being an indica-dominant strain and all.  However, although my mind was buzzing, I felt mellow at the same time.  I even noticed a slight hip pain had vanished so it must have a higher level of CBD.  I may be biased, but I highly recommend this strain.

No side effects. I use it for relief stress and depression. Even if it has a light &quot;buzz&quot;  because of the low THC, the fact it relieves stress also help for insomnia. The smell was very sweet (candy sweet) and would definitely recommend to people trying for the first time or the ones who smoke 3-4 times a year.

The smell is yummy, and reminds me of rum and wine Colts. Sweet and fruity. The taste is not so good for me, sadly. It&#39;s harsh and I make faces on the exhale; it&#39;s just so gross to me.

VI purchased a high CBD phenotype of Warlock to try. I always like to try as many of the different high CBD strains as I can since those are best for treating Arthritis pain and generally leave you functional. This strain is okay, nothing too remarkable about it. It provided moderate pain relief, a relaxed feeling with very little in the way of a &quot;head high.&quot; The effects come on quickly after vaping but don&#39;t last all that long, maybe 2 hours at most. Not a bad strain for mild to moderate, pain but better for mood enhancement in my opinion.

VWarlock +CBD actually\u000a\u000aOMG that was brutal. This stuff gets you high AF. Me &#39;n my boyfriend tried it today, and he had more because I&#39;m always so careful to ease into this for fear of anxiety/paranoia. It was worse than any anxious/paranoid feeling. I barely had any, and we&#39;re new to this medicinal stuff but used to smoke weed when we were teens. This was like..trippy. Very racy. I laughed a few times about something he did and neither one of us could remember why 2 seconds later. He was actually stumbling and uncoordinated; even his speech, and I thought that was scary as f*ck. (of course I didn&#39;t mention that until he was back to normal) It really made both of us feel beyond weird. We went to bed and cuddled and tried to go to sleep. (It was 4pm) I told the kids supper is just snacks today and they just ate whatever they felt like. The horrible feelings lasted for hours, I slept a little. I didn&#39;t feel totally normal until I woke up the next day. I will personally not buy this again. I wouldn&#39;t even try it again. What I really want is high CBD and very low THC. This is NOT IT!!\u000a\u000alol I see they don&#39;t have the smoking dirt through a stick flavor option. Tastes more like that.
