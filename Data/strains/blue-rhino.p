VBlue Rhino is by far my favorite strain to grow as it performs strongly in all growth stages and produces perfect, swollen buds with minimal leaves (even a quick trim leaves the flowers in a beautifully photogenic state) and TONS of trichomes. Needs a lot of nutes but they finish flowering in about 8-9 weeks, and are best harvested when most of the trichomes have turned amber to really bring out the indica-dominant genetics. It&#39;s also the highest-yielding and most potent strain I have had the pleasure of growing. One particularly noteworthy aspect of this strain is that the smell and (after a proper cure) flavor is UNBELIEVABLY sweet; tastes exactly like it smells whether you&#39;re smoking or vaping it. A real treat that I wish was more common because it provides one of the best experiences that cannabis has to offer. Relaxing, calming, and pain-killing without inhibiting (rather, enhancing) day-to-day activities.

V4/5\u000aBlue Rhino&#39;s Skunk genetics show on this one, Dark leaves, light buds, hashy farty smell. Broken up reveals its blueberry tastes, background, and feeling: Body high with uplifting head boost. Taste can be a little better, and I found this strain isn&#39;t going to last the longest, but great for media lovers that want a good strain to enjoy their tunes or shows and not be put to sleep.

VI had run out of meds a couple of nights before I picked this up and my knee pain and stomach pain were coming back with a vengeance. This worked very well for that and helped with other things I deal with as well. The taste for me is very mild and pleasant. The smoke is nice and mellow and it is pretty heady at 21.77% THC.

Initially ur greeted with a gentle rush of euphoric energy, that helps u either focus on a task or just allow u to have a good time with friends. The Indica kicks in afterwards, where u feel so relaxed, cozy and ready to be in bed and let it lull you to sleep. \u000a\u000aEnjoy

Not only are the buds beautiful with that baby blue and light green color, but they also smell amazing...The smell is very skunky and sweet...EarthSkunk is the perfect word, not only was it live organics, but Blue Rhino was grown under the California sun. Can you only imagine the turpines and terroir that these buds have...\u000a\u000aVery dry plant material, but very sticky resin all over...\u000aThis is the best joint I have smoked in a while...The flavor was not lost one bit from grinding up the nugs...The smoke is very white and heavy...one lil puff and you&#39;re exhaling for days...The taste is not distinct blueberry, more of a dusty berry/lemon and wood flavor. The after taste in your mouth is amazing. Very blueberry after taste with that lemon fresh scent still in the air. Fantastic flavor, smell, smoke, and high... =)\u000a\u000aVery good outdoor cannabis with a knockout high. Put me to sleep 30 minutes after the joint...Heavy Indica with a very Sativa smoking experience. Love the flavor too. Thanx Nico...

VThis strain is great. It has a distinct blueberry aroma that has a sour citrusy undertone. I couldn\u2019t wait to smoke it when I smelled it. It\u2019s flavor is kind of like fresh hay with just a hint of blueberry. The only reason this strain didn\u2019t get the 5 stars is because it can cause headaches, or at least, that\u2019s what happened right around the peak of the high. No biggie though \u2018cause the high makes up for a lot of that. Body buzz + Cool burn euphoria is how\u2019d I\u2019d describe it. It can both relax and invigorate your body and mind making it good for any time of the day. I felt content and at ease while  still being able to focus and stimulate my mind. If your local dispensary has it, check out this dynamic fun little strain.

VWow! What great strain?! It covers all bases with an awesome cerebral high and just absolutely obliterates any possible stress. Sweet and pumgent aromatics. Opened the jar and the room filled with a glorious smell. Very smooth easy smoke.A crowd pleaser through and through. When available, this will be a tough strain to pass on!

Vsmoked a couple bowls with my friends. half an hour later was laying on a chair, forgot how I got there. put food all around me, turned off the lights, closed my eyes, and listened to &#39;Amber&#39; by 311. went to a different fucking dimension. would highly recommend.

VThis strain is utterly beautiful. I&#39;ve been suffering with awful back pain round the clock and I&#39;m not kidding when I say.. after one hit I felt a numbing  relief go right to my back and then everywhere all over. I also suffer from neck and shoulder pain and migraines..
