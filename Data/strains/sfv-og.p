VSVG OG is a surprisingly smooth smoke, very nice inhale.  My husband had it and after he blew out the smoke said he didn&#39;t think he got that much because it was so smooth but then there was a lot of smoke, telling a different story.  Everything seems brighter, but am very relaxed.  This gets a 9/10.... nice!

VSan Fernando Valley OG Kush is a powerful, knock you into next week, Sativa dominant hybrid. Mostly an upbeat and free wheeling high with just enough Indica to make it mellow and easy. Long, relieving buzz. 2-2.5+ hours of fun. From the land of the Ocean Grown giants, this one is not to be missed.

VFirst time smoking SFV OG and it does the job nicely. I was looking for something for serious PMS, cramps and headaches. One bowl of this and I was walking on sunshine. All the pain was gone and I was feeling very uplifted. It&#39;s a nice smoke too. I was looking for something that made my head and face numb. It gave my the squinty eye effect, which I barely ever get anymore. Nice hybrid. Indica head fog with a saliva alertness. Highly recommended.

VWith its smallish nugs, SFV  OG doesn&#39;t offer much in the way of &quot;bag appeal.&quot; But it definitely makes up for that insignificant flaw in the areas of aroma, taste and buzz. Smell is a powerful citrusy, piney sort of blend which is quite pleasing to the seasoned smoker&#39;s beak. Powerful expander on the inhale, so don&#39;t go packing a huge rip unless your goal is a coughing fit.That said, a coughing fit will definitely intensify the effects of SFV OG. Bit of a diesel vibe on the exhale. Hats off to the grower, I can see where even a slight nutrient imbalance might tilt this to a harsher flavor. Buzz is subtle on the body, but pretty powerful in the head. No deep thought spiral and all that, just a soaring mind effect. I&#39;m torn between a 4 and a 5 - but I&#39;m feeling pretty damn good - so 5 it is.

VSFV OG was a wonderful medicine for my MS pain and recent bout with humidity and changing weather. For those with this dreaded condition, weather changes can signal some wonky wiring firing crazily. The SFV OG helped to keep the crossed wires in my brain from making it too unbearable. This strain will lead you into a wonderful mix of  indica body effects, and sativa energy that mellow out into a very relaxing mellow drift into sleep. It doesn&#39;t have the opiate like effect that some hybrid or indica pain relief may have but a wonderful medicine.

This was recommended to me at a great price by a local budtender, and I&#39;m so glad I took a chance. It&#39;s not overpowering, but it is extremely effective at treating mild to moderate pain as well as evening out my mood. I take a hit of this in the morning and it helps everything feel smoother.

As I got up I cracked my neck (I know I&#39;m not supposed to do that) but as I cracked it in attempt to loosen the tension. It hurt so much. I thought I was going to throw up and pass out. I decided to hit the clinic immediately. The girl who helped me noticed I was in pain and recommend this strain. She is an angel.

The scissors cut through the nug and the smell grew in strength but not complexity. It was maybe an earthier type smell than some OG\u2019s I have had but still similar.\u000aLook: Light green, tight nugs with orange hairs. Slight trim needed and covered in kif.\u000aTaste: The earthy flavor (to me) is what makes this strain stand out. OG Kush straight out of the ground. It is amazing that even if something is ground in a hydroponic set up can taste so much like a mouthful of damp earth. \u000aRecommendation for medicine: It states it is a Hybrid. I do not understand Leafly\u2019s \u2018Strain Highlights\u2019 about being harsh and only able to be vaporized. With so many variations in genetics and grow methods, this is too broad of a statement to me. I think it is more of a Kush type Indica stoney time than anything else. Fun, ACTIVE day in the sun or sleep-time medication when you do not necessarily want to be up at 5:30AM.

VSFV OG Kush is some pretty good OG Kush. The San Fernando Valley for which this strain is named, is where most modern OG Kush started.  I&#39;ve been smoking OG Kush for 12 years now, and it&#39;s pretty much all i like to smoke.  SFV OG isn&#39;t so strong that it burns you out, its just got a good tasting very strong high.

I had gone into one of my favorite dispensaries to pick up some meds and just decided on a whim to pick up some SFV OG shatter from PURE. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!! I feel like a slice of butter melting on top of a big ole pile of flapjacks, and my pain level is down to a 2 for the first time in a long time.

VMy usual criteria to determine whether a particular medication is worth bothering with are, flavor/+harshness,and their level of effect on particular personal medical issues. This is my 1st go at San Fernando Valley OG. However this isn&#39;t my 1st OG strain. In fact the strain sfv og comes from (ghost og) i&#39;m not really fond of. NO disrespect to the ghost. Finally, sfv og mildly sweet and funky. Good points for harshness level also 1.5 out of 5. Level of effect on fallowing, pain from ruptured disk/spasms/headache-immediate relief 4.5 out of 5 . Bonus for people who still need to function on meds 4 out 0f 5. these are purely my opinions not to be considered &quot;concrete&quot;, simply because i have noticed not all meds do the same for all. Final note, this one will go in my Medicinally beneficial List.

VI was originally looking for an indica or indica-dominant strain. Thought I was getting SFV OG Kush, but I\u2019m not getting the more sedating effects that I was looking for and everyone reports, soooooo, he must actually have given me the SFV OG instead.\u000a\u000aNevertheless, this is a pretty good strain. Definitely feel the pain-numbing and body fuzzy sensation of the indica, but I\u2019m definitely getting a bit of a Tripp\u2019s head high that I normally get with sativas.\u000a\u000aThe main thing here is that I normally avoid sativas because I have a tendency to get paranoid and anxious with sativas. But this one and Sour Diesel are the only 2 sativas I\u2019ve found so far that don\u2019t give me that paranoia.\u000a\u000aRelaxing, soothing pain relief with a little creativity. I\u2019d recommend this one.\u000a\u000a

VVape 0.3 G and you achieve a cerebral meditative, calm high, and there is a pulsating feeling in the body which increases the relaxant pain relief effect. Also there is a strong spaciness high, however you are still aware as if it was a clear headed high. But it is very spacey. Auditory hallucinations are present at higher doses. CEVs exist but at higher doses. This herb is excellent for pain relief, doesn&#39;t knock you out like other OG Kushes, After the high ends it leaves you feeling relaxed and makes you want to come back for some more. But eventually enough sessions and you will be sleeping in space..

VA classic strain for the ages, SFV Kush is an Isotope that really put the regions indoor scene on the map. It has a heavy stone, really relaxing in an industrial strength way. The flavor is also very bubblegum-ish, I just bought my local dispensary out of this strain. It ranks up there as one of my favorites, it is also a very stable breed for you novice breeders out there. Cross it with damn near anything and you will get a wonderful hybrid. It retains that SFV bud structure that makes it so fun to smoke, and thankfully the stickyness is a dominant gene. =]

Vthis is by far my top 10 fav. I love Tahoe. it hits me almost instantly and stays with me for pretty much the whole day. I suffer from awful anxiety...like almost debilitating. and I know that if I start going into panic attach mode I just take a toke or two of Tahoe and I&#39;m 100% better. I like the flower Tahoe but the wax and stuff for dabs is pretty nice too. have me ripped for hours. its just a great strain! &#128077;

VMy absolute favorite concentrate strain hands-down. First tried it in Vegas this summer, and have been seeking it out ever since...It excels for me at helping with general anxiety and is a great strain for head down work as well. Its fuzzy in the head to start, then the wave of relaxation will wash over you, maintaining that slight tingle in the arms and hands. \u000aAs a side note, SFV OG is an amazing strain to enjoy anytime you have a scenic view and a pair of sunglasses.

VI picked up a gram of this strain at Oasis Dispensary in Las Vegas, NV. At first glance this flower may be deceiving, but these small nuggies pack a heavy punch! When you first open the smell proof bag you will be blind sighted by its dank sticky pine and umami citric tones. \u000aThis hybrid strain had me hyper productive &amp; almost pain free, which is saying a lot for me!\u000aSmoke or vape this strain as your wake n\u2019 bake rise and shiner and you will forget about whatever was bogging you down. \u000aEnjoy, from Viva-Pot-Vegas!\u000a~Trippy Gingy~

VThis strain goes straight to the brain creating a cartoon sense to your vision. From there you can feel your tensions releasing as you seek out a comfortable place to fully actualize the full extent of your high. Buds were taller than your everyday compact nugs and the pistels size was noticeable almost giving the look of seed pods.. dark orange hairs.. a definite favorite when my delivery service is in stock..

VBad news 1st, the exhale of your flower smoke is pretty fuckin harsh. I recommend exhaling through your nose. Good news: This motha fucking strain creates very interesting and creative solutions to some of my personal shit. Got a tremendously beautiful 1/8th from The Herbal Cure Dispensary &#129300;&#128293;and took advantage of their outstanding Medical BOGO 1/8th deal that&#39;s offered 3 x per month!! EXPECT major couch lock, coughing on the 1st inhale through a water pipe but, IMHO, our political leaders (an oxymoron joke in the Archaic stages) should share a couple tokes of this OG together and SOLVE some life threatening global problems instead of this continued shitty Soap Opera? Sorry, pretty fucking stoned after 2 bowls. Off the pedestal from being on cloud 420. Peace bro&#39;s and sis&#39; of our beautiful world..&#128579;

VThis strain is the Bees Knees. I Vape a ton of hybrids and this is one of my absolute favorites. The nugglettes aren&#39;t the most impressive in size or density but don&#39;t be fooled, she&#39;s full of terpenoids to fill you nose. Everytime I open the jar and smell the aroma, its like inhaling the sent for the first time all over again. She&#39;s a pungent one. Love the dominant sativa side of this bud. It allows me to stay on my game and stay in a great mood at all times. 2 emoji thumbs up

VProbably the most recognizable contribution from the San Fernando Valley aside from the adult entertainment industry, this fiesty strain is sure to delight with its lemony earthiness. Expect a pungent pine nose with a super earthy funk that on the palate has a lemon citrus dominated flavor profile.  Notable head high that is followed by a nice indica body high that is altogether relaxing, euphoric, and surprisingly creative. SFV OG is medicinally useful for those dealing with pain, depression, anxiety, stress, headaches, and inflammation.

VThis strain is Potent&#128293;\u000aI Love the 2 Hour Relaxation Effect. This strain is NOT for Rookies. Seriously I&#39;m still new to the scene, Smoking everyday all day for 4 years. This is great for Chilling at home or People Watching. Silly grin on my face though.

If I&#39;m not trying to sleep, it&#39;s very chill. I&#39;ve mostly just hung around the house, so I don&#39;t know how it would be out and about. Overall, it&#39;s pleasant.

VLike the strain highlights observes how SFV OG &quot;can be a bit harsh&quot; when smoked. While this strain does make me cough, I recommend microdosing this one. Also, it makes a mighty fine tincture; the people I shared it with gave it high reviews. I took the opportunity to make a batch of budder, too. The effects are strong with this one.

VI wanted to try this strain because I really love the San Fernando valley and specifically the music scene there. The 60&#39;s70&#39;s and 80&#39;s SFV was the home base for so many great musicians. And I tried it at a music festival ironically. I sparked it up and hit it throughout the set. I ended up smoking about two joints of SFV. What i can say is it has a super strong head high, almost dizzying. A good calm feeling set in and I couldn&#39;t even feel my body, I was only aware of my head and it felt like i was a bobble head. But when You start moving you are pain free and feel like you are floating. It&#39;s a really good daytime strain that transports you to another dimension. Unlike some hybrids or sativa&#39;s this one doesn&#39;t make you very productive. Best to use when you&#39;re home or out with friends.

VThis is the third flower that I have tried directly from a dispensary, and let me say, it is such a great strain. For 45$/eighth it is a great value. The smell is very earthy as stated and it is actually pretty smooth to smoke. It didn&#39;t induce a crazy cotton mouth like other cheap strains I&#39;ve tried and once it&#39;s high takes effect, you will definitely feel it. For its price, you can&#39;t beat it. As for the high, you just gotta try it out yourself!

VSFV OG is a good hybrid strain perfect for just about any time of the day. You will start off with a slow head high and the body high creeps up on u slowly. This strain has a very earthy smell and taste to it and will have you very mellow and not too high. Perfect for beginner smokers, people with depression, or suffering from anxiety. Only side effect I had was crazy Cotton mouth. I\u2019d give SFV OG 9 of 10 stars.

I have noticed that every batch I&#39;ve ever tried (including 1 that I grew) seemed to be very high in THC, if I take any more than 3 hits off my pipe then I wont allow myself 2 go out in public cuz I get talkative with strangers and then I look like a weirdo or sum shit, &amp; then outta nowhere the sativa wares off and then u just crash and damn near can&#39;t keep ur eyes open.

VOne of the first five legal strains I tried and I really enjoyed it and will always be tempted to keep a little on hand.  Nice balance of indica and sativa.  Nothing extraordinary about the terps, but it needs to be in the &quot;old reliable&quot; category.  Great for a midday smoke.

VMy Favorite strain of all time! I keep going back for this. IT&#39;S just that good! SFV Og is pretty strong and one of the hardest flowers to hit (Tar) but It&#39;s good! Im an Og man myself . This is an even high/stone. Hunger Pains so bad they hurt. makes you feel like listening to really cool music and dancing. Catching a movie at home. Feels like party time in your head. In my opinion, the only thing better is &quot;Trinity Og&quot;!!! Thats it! \u000a

VGot this as it was an eighth was on sale at my local dispensery the other day. One thing I noticed was the very high THC to CBD ratio, something like 18% to .02%. Don&#39;t know if that is considered normal as I&#39;ve only recently started taking notice. Wouldnt say I was relaxed as I thought I might be, but while reading my book I felt more concentrated and wasn&#39;t as distracted by other thoughts. As expected, definitely could feel the body over the mind high (due to the Indica) and couchlock always made its way back. Vaped it with the GPen Elite, pretty unique taste. Overall an OK experience for me, but nothing that would have me buy another one of these over another strain.

VI\u2019ll be the first to admit that I know nothing about the San Fernando Valley, except for this one time, my friend once showed me a Youtube video of this guy dressed in drag, singing about shoes, and he was REALLY excited that this\u2026 Thing was \u201cjust this guy from the valley!\u201c\u000a\u000aI, however, have never able to match his enthusiasm\u2026 Until now.\u000a\u000aAll politics aside, SFV OG is outright gorgeous. With sparkling drops and easily pluckable buds, it\u2019s a true bouquet, and the lavender-lemon scent will bring you to your knees. Novices be warned; she\u2019ll have you coughing and crying tears of joy on the first toke. The high is long-lasting and chock full of giggles and gratitude. Watch that potency, though! SFV OG will have you visiting the sandman if you\u2019re not careful! Just give it a minute in between bowls, my friend. Otherwise you\u2019ll land in outer space.\u000a\u000aWith farmers becoming the new gangster: tender-hearted and scrappy, plant-wise and street-wise, cannabis is in exciting, uncharted territory. SFV OG is proof that doing what you love pays off, even if it\u2019s dangerous.\u000a\u000a&#128154;\u000a\u000aFire acquired from Krafted Strains Cooperative in Long Beach\u000a\u000a-AA

I found myself having to smoke more of this versus Strawberry Banana or other hybrids. Good aroma but the taste when it hits hard isn&#39;t the greatest.

With it&#39;s sativa/indica duality, it&#39;s perfect for mixing with a pure sativa or a pure indica in a joint (depending on if you just woke up or are going back to bed).

VWonderful stuff. Sampled SFV OG as wax out of a friend&#39;s dab pen. San Fernando Valley OG induced a stimulating euphoric buzz and a tingly body high but also made me a bit anxious and paranoid. Also gave me a serious case of the munchies.It&#39;s awesome and incredibly potent stuff. In my opinion it is best reserved for times when you don&#39;t necessarily have to be firing on all cylinders, as sitting through and participating in my college biology class was a bit difficult while under the influence of SFV OG.

VI didn&#39;t think too much about this strain at first but about half way through a small bag I realized it does give a decent high. low-med psychosis, munchies are totally manageable but don&#39;t tempt fate. I would recommend for a daytime strain. Similar to Green Crack IMO. I think head to head I would take Green Crack.\u000a\u000aConcentration pretty high at 26.015%. Purchased from Oasis Cannabis (Grower = Matricx) and the flower was in good quality condition and not dehydrated. I am really liking the Matrix presentation.\u000a\u000aUPDATE: Just bought a PAX vaporizer and heard this strain does really well in it. Will report back.

VThis is a great Sativa leaning hybrid that is a treat anytime of day. She&#39;s a creeper with a Head high that hits first with a great Indica buzz undercut shortly after. The strain really helps my anxiety and stress without affecting my energy levels too much during the day when I need to be functional. I do admit there is a ever so slight burn-out feeling when the Sativa effects wear off but it&#39;s easily fought through if needed. The taste and smell that this strain (especially in concentrate form) are EXCEPTIONAL! Pine &amp; Lemony tones with a pungent earthy undercut just plow your olfactory senses.

Vtop 3 overall strain for me.  if im up and outside this strain creates a serene quietness to anything im doing.  all is well.  great strain for chillin or playing in nature.  a favorite for rippin through the woods on my mtn bike or a pow day in winter.  not quite as good as lemon deisel for outdoor activities but up there for sure.  i feel like i flow with the terrain better when im riding with SFV.  after a solid day of shredding SFV is right there with me and A OK to be chillin on the couch.  it wont knock you out but more so allows you simply &quot;not care&quot;. mellow buzzy body high and slight foggyness once the indica side shows up to the party and sativa decides to go home for the night.  a solid go to medication strain.  tastes like a fresh pine forest and slight lemon on usually only the first pull.  delicious vape strain too.  \u000a

VSFV OG is a good hybrid strain perfect for just about any time of the day. You will start off with a slow head high and the body high creeps up on u slowly. This strain has a very earthy smell and taste to it and will have you very mellow and not too high. Perfect for beginner smokers, people with depression, or suffering from anxiety. Only side effect I had was crazy Cotton mouth. I\u2019d give SFV OG 9 of 10 stars.

I felt instantly better and my train of though became much slower. I was very relaxed and calm. \u000a\u000aThe taste is pretty woodsy and a little earthy.

So I guess it really just helps you emotionally and helps you think retrospectively, so I definitely recommend it for releasing any tension you may have or if you just need a euphoric high. it didn&#39;t have me couch bound but honestly I like to dance to some hip hop when high so...

(I have a strong AF tolerance) very relaxing and sedating... gets me cozy and warm on the inside but not immediately, takes a bit to hit but once it does everything\u2019s very chill. water tastes and feels amazing, eyes get a little low and I can for sure see how it helps insomnia because it gets me so comfy I feel like I can fall asleep anywhere and I already always feel like that. \u000a\u000asuper great for anxiety/paranoia: I\u2019m chill as a cucumber watching sponge bob, drinking cold brew hazelnut iced coffee, munching on some pirates booty waiting for my gf to be done with her doctors appt \u000a\u000aall in all, I\u2019m very pleased with this strain. watch out though, it\u2019s incredibly relaxing for some reason so still be aware of your surroundings and shit if you plan to rip more than a few bowls

VI prefer indicas, but this Sativa-dominant hybrid is the best strain I&#39;ve ever consumed---hands down. I dabbed some live sugar wax I picked up from Las Vegas ReLeaf. This stuff is no joke. Tastes delicious... I picked up pine and lemon. Very euphoric, mellow high. I felt the effects were perfectly balanced between sativa and indica traits. It&#39;s amazing.

VThis is the third flower that I have tried directly from a dispensary, and let me say, it is such a great strain. For 45$/eighth it is a great value. The smell is very earthy as stated and it is actually pretty smooth to smoke. It didn&#39;t induce a crazy cotton mouth like other cheap strains I&#39;ve tried and once it&#39;s high takes effect, you will definitely feel it. For its price, you can&#39;t beat it. As for the high, you just gotta try it out yourself!

VI wanted to try this strain because I really love the San Fernando valley and specifically the music scene there. The 60&#39;s70&#39;s and 80&#39;s SFV was the home base for so many great musicians. And I tried it at a music festival ironically. I sparked it up and hit it throughout the set. I ended up smoking about two joints of SFV. What i can say is it has a super strong head high, almost dizzying. A good calm feeling set in and I couldn&#39;t even feel my body, I was only aware of my head and it felt like i was a bobble head. But when You start moving you are pain free and feel like you are floating. It&#39;s a really good daytime strain that transports you to another dimension. Unlike some hybrids or sativa&#39;s this one doesn&#39;t make you very productive. Best to use when you&#39;re home or out with friends.

V(Grower Grade- A) Organic\u000a\u000aOne of the original &quot;Ocean Grown&quot; strains. SFV OG is a great flower; taste, aroma, smoke, and high. All grade A. I prefer to use it later in the evening, it winds me down but doesn&#39;t knock me out. Very relaxing and great for a low key day. Grab some SFV if you can find her, she&#39;s an elusive flower.

VWow!  1st time I ever tried this incredible and legendary bud!!!  I had seen SFV OG many times, recently, but just never tried it. Maybe due to my love for other strains, maybe due to its non-impressive looks but when you feel the smallish bud between ur finger and palm (OG style bud grinder hahaha) it&#39;s like feeling a rock.  Dense dense dense bud.  With that deisely/lemony/piny smell you&#39;re forced to go further and break out the pipe.  The initial hit is like a THC hammer with long relaxing indica effect after about 2 min.  \u000a\u000a3 hits from a glass Sherlock pipe and even a seasoned concentrate user (like me) has to back up and chill.  Find it and don&#39;t pass it up.  Trust me u will be pleasantly surprised.

VI am a medical marijuana patient in the legal state of Oregon. PTSD is my alignment treated with medical marijuana. My reviews are based on my journey through different medical marijuana dispensaries to find certain strains that help calm my PTSD symptoms. I report back to PTSD patients on my experiences. Again what works for me might not work for you. My reviews are just a template. \u000a\u000aNow, for me and my symptoms I strictly stick with indica strains.. But thats just what works for me. I journey into hybrid once in a while or Sativa CBD with no THC.. Yes those strains do exist. \u000a*This is strain to use when you don&#39;t want a total lock down or need a lock down of your PTSD symptoms. You want something that will pick you up and carry though it all with out the weight. \u000a\u000aThis is a good in between strain it&#39;ll take you by the hand and help you along. It does have a head high that goes along with it so be mindful of that patients. \u000a\u000aThe head high is temporary and it&#39;ll give way to a feeling of content.

VSFV OG offers a clear head high, with mild body effects.  High is energetic but not overwhelming, and offers clarity for focus.  Not necessarily a very motivating high, but good for focusing.

VOne of the first five legal strains I tried and I really enjoyed it and will always be tempted to keep a little on hand.  Nice balance of indica and sativa.  Nothing extraordinary about the terps, but it needs to be in the &quot;old reliable&quot; category.  Great for a midday smoke.

VNice early-mid day smoke, starts off nice &amp; cerebral like a sativa with nice head pressure and positive vibes, a feeling of being outgoing, and then boom the Hindu Kush kicks in and u start 2 feel a warm sensation starting in ur feet as it rises up to ur head where ur already feeling sum sativa pressure. I have noticed that every batch I&#39;ve ever tried (including 1 that I grew) seemed to be very high in THC, if I take any more than 3 hits off my pipe then I wont allow myself 2 go out in public cuz I get talkative with strangers and then I look like a weirdo or sum shit, &amp; then outta nowhere the sativa wares off and then u just crash and damn near can&#39;t keep ur eyes open.

This is an even high/stone. Hunger Pains so bad they hurt. makes you feel like listening to really cool music and dancing. Catching a movie at home. Feels like party time in your head.

VFinally got my prescription recently and this is the first strain I tried as a patient, and first thing I&#39;ve smoked since high school! Am I glad this strain was my introduction into the world of medical cannabis! What a first impression. Great body high, but doesn&#39;t make you feel couch locked (at least not with the amount I smoked). I suffer from chronic back and knee pain and also migraines, and insomnia. I was in pain during the day when I smoked this, and this definitely helped. My muscles relaxed, my pain lessened considerably and I just went on a cruise. I just felt...good. It relaxed me so much, I ended up falling asleep. Not sure if it was the strain itself or a byproduct of the mood it put me in, but yeah. I think I&#39;ll try this when I can&#39;t go to sleep, and see if it hits me the same way. Anyways, I&#39;d definitely recommend this one for anyone with chronic pain, migraines and anxiety or depression. Must try!!

VPut some SFV-OG into the bottom of my pipe and topped it off with a little Blue Dream.  Blue Dream is a sativa as well as the SFV-OG, but the SFV-OG will put you on the couch.  Add the Blue Dream and you are, thinking, talking, giggling, and enjoying the social aspects of your evening (Or day for that matter).  A wonderful combo that left my body without any aches or pains, plus gave a nice head high.  Pure enjoyment totally without paranoia or other negative side effects.

VAwesome strain. Depending on Genetics it can range into an indica dominant hybrid but this baby delivers without drowzing you out. \u000aNot the best looking buds but they have a nice earthy skunky sweet smell to them. \u000aSmoked it this time around and felt a nice full body euphoria within about 10 minutes. A little head pressure felt but a nice numbing in the extremities to balance the high. \u000aFinal decision:\u000aI was happy overall with the high but it left me a bit out of the loop and day dreamy. I was off work so I didn&#39;t mind the foggyness I got and the loss of coordination but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a morning smoke.

VGood Sativa Dominant, it is an Indica hybrid though, so SFV OG can be a bit heavier than a classic straight sativa, if you smoke large doses. It tested very high for THC at 25-29% but doesn&#39;t hit as hard as other strains with similar THC ratings. Great for daily smokers, for a daytime focus, very motivating but relaxing at the same time. Start with a bowl and take higher doses once you know how it hits you. Perfect for a smoke when you have detailed tasks to get done, that wont require heavy physical exertion. If you&#39;ve got to study, or write, or read this is a great strain! Also a very good strain for social situations. Hints of earthy and floral flavors, with a great smell on it. Got this from Dr. Jolly&#39;s in Bend Oregon it is one of our most popular strains come try it while its still available!

VI have to smoke a bit more of this strain to get to where I need, but its completely fine because smoking throughout the day helps keep everything mellow but productive. \u000a\u000aThis is a great strain for doing work and concentrating for me. I have anxiety disorder, panic disorder and bpd II (diagnosed) \u000a\u000aA very good strain to smoke alongside my medication

VI wasn&#39;t to find of the smell or appearance of this strain, but the potency is another story it definitely lives up to its &quot;ocean grown&quot; name as other og strains a little goes a long way with this one !!&#128522;

VI&#39;ve ordered SFV several times and feel it is very over rated. It looks like regs to me. Always has crispy long leaves that are a dark green with orangish brown hairs... not the best

VI got a super hazey high that felt more cloudy that I&#39;ve felt before. Really good strain, but you don&#39;t want to smoke it every day. I started getting weed hangovers

VSharp, and tasted a bit of mildew. Could be just a crazy flavor profile. Could be mildew. Lol.\u000a\u000aFelt a buzz right away pretty much. Have a bit of a headache (from before). Body is sore from carrying groceries the other day. And general misuse (computing in bed, slouching at work, putting my feet up while typing, etc).\u000a\u000aBeen working in Garageband for a while. Recorded a bunch of music. Don&#39;t feel super high anymore! Kinda stressed and working hard and want to keep going. Will smoke more in a bit.\u000a\u000aDon&#39;t feel so good. Headachey. May be dehydrated.\u000a\u000a
