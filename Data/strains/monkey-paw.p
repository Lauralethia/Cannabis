V Being a Michigan native this strain was a must grab when I saw it and learned about the history. \u000aI can honestly say that it didn\u2019t take long for the high to creep up on me. The pine taste on the inhale and the berry taste of the exhale makes this the perfect smoke. If you ever have the chance to grab it I would HIGHLY recommend.

VThis rare Hybrid strain was a treat. THC level 15%. I first got the sativa effects, making me uplifted &amp; happy. When alone, drifting into deep thoughts. When the Sativa weakens the Indica effects kick in making me very relaxed &amp; even sleepy. Strain gives you two nice separate highs in one! Skunky, citrus, &amp; pine, was the taste &amp; smell i received. The sticky buds were darker green with burnt orange hairs. There is no monkeying around with this strain!!

VWow, this strain gives you a perfect head high which isn&#39;t too overwhelming and with minimal body high. Makes you think a lot, usually ending up being talkative as well. Smells good too! Overall a wonderful strain!!\u000a

VA nice, mellow - yet stimulating- sativa. I would say it tastes very herbal with light pine. I get an aftertaste of light grape and herbal diesel.

VI remember this strain. I would tell people about this herb like a legendary mythical creature. It was the early 80&#39;s when I discovered this weed that I&#39;m surprised has sativa orgins. This shitt iz NICE and STRONG. I was a teenager so my tolerance was low AF, but this was another level indeed. All I know is this strain will get you HAF!!!
