VThis is a strain. I hate it when people just hand you weed and go: &quot;smoke weed&quot; It&#39;s like passing someone a glass and telling them it is alcohol to be drunk.\u000a\u000aThis thing has character. Effects are similar but less intense than sour diesel. Intense cerebral effects are there, colors get better and depth of field increases if you are outdoors. It could be classified as the Level - 1 of the psychedelic experiences according to the vaults of Erowid.\u000a\u000aTotally recommend this.

VVery Pungent Citrus and musky textures. Looks like a Bright version of OG kush. Bright Pistols very light green leafs and lime dark green on the outside. Provide me with a great cerebral head massage and also gives me the stress relief of eye pressure. It&#39;s good for appetite for a sativa the effects help with focus, motivation, stress, hunger, moody issue as well as a bundle of joy and happyness. I don&#39;t think I can beat that when your happy everything seems a bit better in a new way :D. Great for trying something new, it doesn&#39;t effect my memory like it used I remember a lot of things on this particular bud. Overall fantastic skunky taste, look and effect would recommend it for those who can&#39;t concentrate and PTSD.

VThis stuff creeps over 10 minutes. Pretty easy to get all trippy and hallucinogenic for me. Doesn&#39;t take that much of this stuff to get you high. When you do get high it can last for 3/4 hours.\u000aIt makes me pretty chilled. I don&#39;t feel like doing much, I just really enjoy the comfort of the couch and tea. Can&#39;t drink enough tea. You still can do things, just not that energetic and driven. Nice one to lie in bed with and watch South Park. Proper gets me horny!

VA top five sativa in my book. Not the strongest or most fancy but the high is always great. Taste is sweet with flowers, pine and spicyness. Amnesia makes me happy, chatty and active. And more than any strain it frees my mind and lets me really meditate on stuff. Loooove it since 2004..

VMy undeniable favourite sativa for wilding out and getting stupid. This is the type of greenery that makes me hyperactive and feeling like a character out of Police Academy. Clear focused uplifting cerebral high while my body feels it could bust out into some Kung Fu any minute now.

Evidently, there&#39;s plenty of stupid.  \u000a\u000aMy mind is gone.  I hope it comes back.  I feel just ok.  Not happy. Not sad.  This will be great for erasing a busy mind, but not so great for daytime use.  Even though it is sativa, it could still be good at nighttime to quiet the mind. I don&#39;t feel like doing anything, so I might go take a nap.  \u000a\u000aJust &#39;meh&#39; in my opinion.

VWell, I&#39;m high right now. It&#39;s 8:46 PM, Los Angeles. I&#39;m sitting on the toilet smoking Amnesia. I&#39;m also on hold with T-Mobile... I need another extension. Anyhow, I smoked a bowl out of a water bong. After about a minute, I started to feel it. And I started to realize that weed gives me the answers. It gave me the answer to a really important question, which I really can&#39;t remember. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ll be back. I want to listen to some music right now. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s now 9:07, and another bowl later. \u000a\u000aI have to go now...

VNot at all what i was expecting, but overall a decent medication. Picked up an 8er from dispensary here in town &quot;beautiful dark nugs&quot; deep red hairs and loads of crystals. Strain was another lung buster for me, tasted and smelled fab. I love to get high but when I get a headache from coughing, thats no good and I did wake up with a weed hangover if I smoked it before bed. The fact is it did take away my major pain and give me an awesome laid back buzz, I&#39;ll definitely try it again, just take smaller hits next time. lol

VIt is definitely a strain that slows me down. I recommend this for a lazy day. It did not make me tired so I was able to binge watch my shows while not really thinking at all.

VI come from the UK so my ami is probably dead skunk compared to American counterparts. Daily I smoke about 10grams of weed a day and what I am smoking is Ami. It&#39;s a very strong high that makes you feel good but at the same time it makes you feel chilled. Tastes very earthy but you won&#39;t get bored of the taste as it is a very sly taste.\u000a\u000aRecommend. Better than smoking UK Cheese &#128580;

VWhat a super potent smoke! This strain has truly captured the best of all worlds. Begin with an extreme cerebral experience (you choose the experience) followed by intense creativity and interest in all the weird little things you never really pay attention to. About now your brain is getting pretty exhausted and needing to refuel, welcoming the munchie phase! What more can you say? A superior strain that covers all the bases. Check out Nature&#39;s Wonder in AJ to find this killer bud.

VI accidentally posted this review to Amnesia Haze, but its meant for Amnesia. \u000a\u000aWhat a great flower. I had lots of energy and felt very sociable, I also helped my son with his science fair project, I stayed very focused(not the norm) and it turned out great. Not a great smelling bud (ammonia), but it didn&#39;t taste bad at all. I had a hard time sitting still for very long, like for a movie. I really enjoy this strain and will be keeping it in the house for awhile.

VI first came across this strain a month ago. My dealer had it in stock so I bought 11 grams. I made brownies with six grams in them and invented some friends over. The problem was: I cut the brownies into 9 and so everyone got at least 600mgs into their system.\u000a\u000aHands down the highest I\u2019ve ever been. Plus I had half another brownie so I was having the time of my life. Amnesia makes for fun chats, hilarious movies and struggles to play monopoly.

VAmnesia is typically a sativa-dominant cannabis strain with some variation between breeders. Skunk, Cinderella 99, and Jack Herer are some of Amnesia\u2019s genetic forerunners, passing on uplifting, creative, and euphoric effects ideal for treating mood disorders. Growers should expect a 9-10 week flowering period with moderate yields. This strain normally has a high THC and low CBD profile and produces intense psychotropic effects that new consumers should be wary of.

VThis is probably my second favorite strain. It is perfect for making you hyper and energetic as well as it goes well when working on a project that requires you to think. \u000a\u000aOne problem I found is if you go too high that creative spark will fade away and it leaves you a slow and tired mess.\u000a\u000aThis is I feel is an intermediate strain.

Good strain for anyone in my opinion, nothing really to dislike about it. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the flavour, as I found it to be a little plain and dry. Upon smoking I also found the strain to occasionally give me headaches, but nothing major. Overall, classic, consistent and a really decent strain.

VTried this strain last night when a friend brought it over for a get together.\u000aHoly Hell, Batman! This strain has a powerful smell. It also hits hard and fast. If you&#39;re a novice user I recommend only taking a hit or two and then waiting a few minutes for the effects to set in.\u000aNow I&#39;m normally wary of sativas. They give me really great thoughts but I&#39;m prone to panic attacks on them so I tread lightly.\u000aOn Amnesia though I cannot remember a time when I&#39;ve laughed so much and so hard. The night was filled with laughter and giggles and it was wonderful. The witty banter my buddies and I shared while high on this strain was hilarious.\u000aI think the effects lasted for awhile but I lost sense of time so I can&#39;t really say. I got real tired and quiet on the come down though. It&#39;s real easy to get locked to the couch when it wears off. But this has become one of my new favorite strains. Can&#39;t wait to pick some up myself and smoke again.

VGreat Sativa bud. Aptly named, Amnesia really gives you a case of short term memory loss and it can be frustrating if you aren&#39;t used to that when you smoke. You just forget small things or what you were talking about, stuff like that, but it is slightly more prevalent in this bud, at least for me. It&#39;s great for relaxing, you forget all of your problems and simply drift away on your own imagination. Your creativity is super charged, but your thoughts feel slower than normal because you keep forgetting what you were thinking.\u000a\u000aMix with an indica and you could have a kickass high. Overall it is a very relaxing and thought proking bud.

VMakes you very relaxed and giggly and doesn&#39;t require a lot to get you nicely high. Great for social and alone use, wouldn&#39;t recommend using before you went to sleep although after a while you do start to feel sleepy. Only downsides are that you get extreme dry mouth and paranoia

VTHC-heavy sativa&#39;s are not really my cup of tea, but in overall, this is an excellent and iconic strain. It brings me into a typical, albeit intense, high, that can last a good while. After using about 5 grams in total, spread out over about 1 month, I noticed that the whole experience goes through four fases: a very intense high, followed by a very hard couch potato-fase, followed by a mellow dizzy feeling, followed by an &#39;I&#39;m ok but I&#39;m just going to sit here&#39;-fase. It&#39;s quite a hard trip, which is not recommended for newer smokes. But in overall, you really get bang for your buck with this one. \u000a\u000aConcentration is affected, so it&#39;s not really the best strain to enjoy a movie (unless it&#39;s a very easy watch). Best enjoyed with friends and in small doses, because Amnesia can easily drive you over the edge. Be especially wary of the dizzy spells and the occasional paranoia.

VIt is the cross of a Haze and a Northern Lights and a best seller, year after year, in every coffee shop in Holland.\u000a\u000aIt is well known for being a sativa that grows like an indica, very productive, strong effect and of manageable height. It tastes like a sweet sativa, sweeter than the majority of Haze hybrids, with a brutal amount of crystal resin.\u000a\u000aPersonal notes : Smells like bubblegum, very smooth and light smoke, dense buds, brownish in colour, not sticky, but you can see the crystals. Totally under estimated the weed, saw it and thought its shwagg as it was brown, it blew me away, good body stone with a good head high aswell!

VWhat was I going to say? Oh yeah a great plant, but mine grew up to be way more like an indica than a sativa, moderate height , nice tight buds- Must have been the breeder . It was a free seed with an order from Herbies. I have cloned  many dozens of plants now and will continue to do so- no hermie problem , no mold either,  clones easily and quickly-ready in 60  blooming days. Mine test out 20-22%, making for easy sales\u000aIn other words, a keeper!

VBought about 2 grams of this strain and it&#39;s a hard hitter. The smell from the bag is hard to describe, but as soon as you break the nuggs up it becomes a bit fruity but also minty, just as it taste, which is okay in my opinion. \u000aAs soon as you take your first toke you&#39;ll feel the strain rushing to your head for a very energetic and active head high, which can cause a bit of anxiety in some people since it hits hard and instantly. The positive effects are mostly a happy and uplifting energetic high. The negatives are mostly a dry mouth and possible anxiety but all in all a very good strain! \u000aA great strain for people that want an energetic day or a fun night.\u000a\u000aNot recommended for beginners!

VI&#39;m more of an Indica fan but I enjoy Sativas and Sativa hybrids often, and I thought I would be favorable to Amnesia. I love the name, man---now what were we just talking about? This strain is a very stony experience. The high is not meant to deal in subtleties. It will kick your butt---an effect I usually like---and it will do so very soon after it is imbibed. Just know that this strain has an edge. Its long-lasting &quot;sativa-only-effects-allowed&quot; are a bit wearing. I was really surprised at my out-of-sorts reaction. Not anxiety, but that persistent edginess. A heavy caffeine-like reaction. I have never experienced that in all the years Mary Jane and I have been bud-ease. Its aroma was fairly inviting but its taste was downright rude. Many people love Amnesia, like my friend who I ended up trading it to in exchange for White Widow, which is a really pleasant experience with a great taste and aroma. I&#39;m glad my friend likes the Amnesia, and I&#39;m glad to be rid of it.

VIf you&#39;re in pain and / or find yourself having a bad day, you may want to give this strain a try. I noticed with relatively small water bong dosages, (0.25 - 0.50 grams) that pain was alleviated to quite a degree, and I was able to not focus on the stress of the day. Higher dosages, (exceeding 0.50 grams) had me become forgetful on particular events (perhaps a placebo effect as the name implies) - and hungry as well.

VTried this strain last night when a friend brought it over for a get together.\u000aHoly Hell, Batman! This strain has a powerful smell. It also hits hard and fast. If you&#39;re a novice user I recommend only taking a hit or two and then waiting a few minutes for the effects to set in.\u000aNow I&#39;m normally wary of sativas. They give me really great thoughts but I&#39;m prone to panic attacks on them so I tread lightly.\u000aOn Amnesia though I cannot remember a time when I&#39;ve laughed so much and so hard. The night was filled with laughter and giggles and it was wonderful. The witty banter my buddies and I shared while high on this strain was hilarious.\u000aI think the effects lasted for awhile but I lost sense of time so I can&#39;t really say. I got real tired and quiet on the come down though. It&#39;s real easy to get locked to the couch when it wears off. But this has become one of my new favorite strains. Can&#39;t wait to pick some up myself and smoke again.

VWhat can I say? Amnesia is the classic strain for me, widely available, basic but effective. Nice high when smoked, I could defiantly tell it was a sativa! Good strain for anyone in my opinion, nothing really to dislike about it. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the flavour, as I found it to be a little plain and dry. Upon smoking I also found the strain to occasionally give me headaches, but nothing major. Overall, classic, consistent and a really decent strain.

VAmnesia is typically a sativa-dominant cannabis strain with some variation between breeders. Skunk, Cinderella 99, and Jack Herer are some of Amnesia\u2019s genetic forerunners, passing on uplifting, creative, and euphoric effects ideal for treating mood disorders. Growers should expect a 9-10 week flowering period with moderate yields. This strain normally has a high THC and low CBD profile and produces intense psychotropic effects that new consumers should be wary of.

VWhen I first heard that we had a strain called Amnesia, I would\u2019ve bet dollars to donuts that it was an Indica. Finding out that it\u2019s a Sativa, though, my curiosity multiplied ten fold as to what the effects would be.  I ground up these little fluff balls and ripped through my joint feeling up and ready to take a walk with energy and lightness, along with the standard tingling behind the eyes.  As I took my walk, I decided to send off an art package to my nephew.  Well, in my walk, I found out why they call it Amnesia.  I showed up to the local Postal Annex and realized I had forgotten a few things to send.  So while this strain is a sativa, it\u2019s a stupid sativa.  Not recommended for doing anything but basic motor functions without a lot of needed thinking.  Going for a walk, watching an uncomplicated movie, hitting the gym, de-stressing.  All of these would be perfect for Amnesia, because this is not a cerebral high, though, it is euphoric. Colors bounced off the trees and cars, and the sun was extra bright, but I suppose that\u2019s why ignorance is bliss.  Amnesia is fantastic for clearing your mind, halting overthinking, and illuminating stress and worry.\u000a\u000awww.kinddeliveries.org

VI had this in Amsterdam... all you need is 2-3 puffs if it&#39;s pure. Extreme and immediate head high best for social activities (I was listening to a band). This is NOT for beginners... don&#39;t rush to puff this away, you don&#39;t need that much to go flying. Colors will pop and nature will seem richer in detail. I have some pain conditions and I didn&#39;t even need an aspirin on this. Pace yourself and enjoy!

VCrazy high, especially when smoked with tobacco, after the first few tokes you feel dizzy and light, and the more you smoke the more strong the high becomes, upto the point where you can&#39;t walk in a straight line, some people react differently. For example one of my friends became very paranoid and anxious, whereas another one of my friends was very relaxed and chill, I on the other hand couldn&#39;t stop laughing and making my mates laugh. Very good high indeed :D

Vthis is a dense super crystallized nug that is extremely potent with a sour earthy smell not too dissimilar from sour diesel. the high is a long hard hitting one which focuses your mind on particular things to the point where the rest is just a twisting blur. the high (as a sativa) is active and jittery. I felt like I had to be doing stuff otherwise I just went into a shuddering mode. In conclusion a beautiful strain with a sticky, sour nug that sends your mind into overdrive. smoke at night, outside, then see where the high carries you.

VAmne-zing! Flavorful and smooth. Energetic with bouts of epiphanies, but not very clear. High makes me dazed to the point of distraction. Making it more difficult to stay functional. Didn&#39;t get epic munchies or dry mouth. I did laugh and have a good time. personally, I like a little more balance of functionality and high. This strain warrants a try and is better than most.

VIt is the cross of a Haze and a Northern Lights and a best seller, year after year, in every coffee shop in Holland.\u000a\u000aIt is well known for being a sativa that grows like an indica, very productive, strong effect and of manageable height. It tastes like a sweet sativa, sweeter than the majority of Haze hybrids, with a brutal amount of crystal resin.\u000a\u000aPersonal notes : Smells like bubblegum, very smooth and light smoke, dense buds, brownish in colour, not sticky, but you can see the crystals. Totally under estimated the weed, saw it and thought its shwagg as it was brown, it blew me away, good body stone with a good head high aswell!

I suffer from depression and Amnesia is one of a few strains that makes me chatty and in good spirits. Underrated for previously mentioned problems with depression and lack if motivation. Always end up doing a bunch of pushups and what not when smoking this top ten overall strain. Not the strongest but always a great headhigh and a tiny bit of bodybuzz too.. Looove it..

VA frosty, pointed bud with an almost gasoline-like smell. Sour and earthy with a light floral scent. The high is incredibly strong and heady. A large amount can pull you out of reality for a minute \u2014 and can make you paranoid if you&#39;re not careful (I usually don&#39;t get paranoid but know a lot do). I was creative and in my own thoughts on the way up and talkative and giggly on the come down. I had a slight hangover the next morning, feeling slightly dizzy and absentminded, but I was fine later on. A must-try if you&#39;re the kind of person who usually doesn&#39;t get paranoid; if so, just make sure you&#39;re in a good space.

VIt&#39;s just amazing. Be careful and remember its name, Amnesia is VERY powerful and its recommended to go gentle on it. Very energic, and may lead to anxiety if you don&#39;t move your ass. Doing stuff like going outside to enjoy nature is highly recommended. Very tall plant, SCROG or LST needed in indoors.
