VThis strain is at the top of my list of favorites. I like cookies and I really like blue power. This strain should be done right to enjoy the properties. A heavy relaxation of all over my body and mind. A big wave of euphoria and happiness. Smoke is heavy and with massive lung expansion feeling like feathers were in my chest followed by a short hard cough. Definitely a strain to unwind and end the day with. The smell is pungent  artificial and natural blueberries with sweet cookies. Super frosty trich covered tight nugs with tints of blue and beige around small neon green leaves with dark orange hairs.  I would say this is more indica than hybrid.\u000a\u000a4.9/5

Buds were dense &amp; pine coned shaped. Buds looked lighter in color then they were because they were covered in frosty trichomes. Light orange hairs were few across the bud. Smell was a sweet nutty spearmint with the taste about the same. Reminded me of Wrigley&#39;s Spearmint Gum on exhale. Taste &amp; euphoria are tops from this strain!

VI picked up an eighth from Clear Choice Cannabis Tacoma WA. The brand was Tahoma Flavors, and honestly I have never been super impressed from the other strains that I&#39;ve tried from this brand, but I gave this one a try, and it&#39;s a winner. Super body high. I&#39;m an aging runner trying to get my miles up to run a marathon this year, and well. my post run recovery isn&#39;t what it used to be, but vaping this in the evening after a hard run, was really fantastic, one of the best pain reducing, awesome body highs of experienced. Besides the body high, also a good bit of feel good about the world head high. The aftertaste was a little off-putting at first, but easy to get used to. This is one I&#39;ll definitely go for.

VHarsh taste but smooth vape. Minty on the exhale, but not refreshingly so. My batch looks to be more sativa popcorn buds, bright green. Gets me moving,  but   gives me the munchies afterward.

VNever in my life have I felt so motherfucking disrespected. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia, along with many other mental and physical disorders. I smoked a bowl with my fiance and shortly after feeling the effects, I went into a raging fit of anxiety, stomach pains that mimic labor pains, and suicide ideation that was topped with a thick layer of deep regret and disappointment. I will never buy this fucking strain again. If I could give this a negative amount of stars, I would.
