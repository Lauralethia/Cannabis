VJust tried this strain for the first time. I got it delivered from RollWIthUs. I prefer to vaporize using the Pax3. This was some pretty tasty medicine. It had a subtle after taste of lime. Definitely more of a head high. I felt pretty upbeat and energized.

VI almost never use sativas, and tried this one on a fluke. I&#39;m glad I did! I used it in wax form with a Muad-Dib vaporizer. I immediately got a very clear-headed midbrain high, while remaining fairly functional. Felt euphoric, relaxed, and generally happy. The high increased as time went on and I lost some functionality, but not too much. High lasted over 4 hours and it made me cheerful the whole time. Would use again!

VIt hits you within a few minutes as if you just drank a triple espresso. The first ten minutes are a little intense especially if you over indulge. I took one too many hits and I was kinda dumb. I poured a liquid into a plate instead of a bowl haha bit once I settled in I was laser focused and motivated. \u000a\u000aI continued by cleaning the entire apartment and felt as though whatever I put my mind to I would just go for it as opposed to going back and forth in my mind if I should follow through as. Cleaning or tackling a project. It is a slight hazy high as if you drank some wine and had that hazy happiness yet without the alcohol munchies. The high is focused though. \u000a\u000aAbout two hours in you settle into a comfortable relaxation and the crash is a little hard with a slight hangover effect but nothing detrimental. \u000a\u000aI have anxiety yet it didn&#39;t make me feel anxious in an uncomfrotable way....just a bit edgy but not intolerable. More as though you drank a strong cup of coffee and didn&#39;t eat yet.  It sometimes made me slightly hungry and once I remember feeling a little dizzy. \u000a\u000aThe taste was delectable as it had a phenomenal lime taste. The smell was the same as the taste. This is my first review so I may not be as great at explaining flavor profiles but I highly recommend this strain but also recommend taking it easy as overindulgong can lead to dizziness and some unwanted jitters.

VLime Skunk is in my top 3 for medical benefits. This strain does so much for medical conditions &amp; gives you a nice sedative ( strong high) to curb your stress &amp; day to day pressure. Taste is also in my top 3 along with its smell &amp; look. It&#39;s a beautiful flower.

VCrescos new strain here in PA. Not usually a sativa person due to my PTSD but thought I\u2019d try out the Live Sugar at 77% ! Took a dab and the experience began. Made me feel HIGH in my head right away, happiness and stress free thoughts run through my mind. I had bad anxiety before the dab it didn\u2019t make it worse but doesn\u2019t help much either yet due to the uplifting aspects it does make you feel a bit less anxious. Glad I picked it up. Good for anytime need instant mood lift but may need to add Cbd or other strain to calm the sativa.

VI am reviewing Lime Skunk budder by Moxie710 - this strain&#39;s full effects creep in with abundant sativa energy and sharpness present within moments of the first inhale. Set goals beforehand, you will achieve them. Amateur users will assume they are not high because this is such a clear and functional stone - don&#39;t be fooled - Lime Skunk packs a late-inning confusing punch that will put that stoners grin on anyone&#39;s face at least for a moment...until you get it under control and get back to work, work, work.\u000a\u000aHot Tip - Only drink one coffee on the day you&#39;ll be using Lime Skunk. Too much coffee + too much Lime Skunk = Superduper Hipster Speedball.

VThe flavor of this live sugar is really good.  I&#39;ve had a few lime strains in my time and am never let down.  this isn&#39;t an exaggerated flavor, great balance.  As far as the viscosity of the sugar, i note that this batch is closer to a sauce type wet sugar.  Think wet sugar and that&#39;s exactly what we have.  I do enjoy it, i tend to use a quartz banger and bong to consume and it&#39;s great with my dental paddle type tool.  \u000a\u000aThe effect is really nice, i took a rather average dose and so far i&#39;ve listened to Disintegration from The Cure while doing 3 days worth of dishes and motivated myself to type out this review.  A good sativa that doesn&#39;t send my anxiety skyrocketing and has a very good stone to the head for a sativa, i anticipate that that is due in part to it&#39;s alluring levels of CBDA in this concentrate.

I have to admit, it made me feel like I was Cheech for a moment, with a feeling of woooooah and a smile. ha!  However, there were no body effects or couch lock.  This is an excellent morning/daytime strain to get you productive while keeping you calm, cool and with focused energy.   Great for adhd, stress, depression, anxiety.
