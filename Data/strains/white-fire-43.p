VGreat night time strain for daily consumers. Only downside is the lack of muscle spasm relief you&#39;d expect from an indica. Heavy on the eyes and tastes like diesel fruit, definitely a top shelf strain &#128170;&#129304;

This was an amazing strain, though, strong and a euphoric, consuming, hungry slugfest whisking you off into a deep, catotonic slumber.

VI picked up a quarter of this Indica recently. The buds were large and dense, with a dark green color and with brownish pistils. The layer of resinous trichomes was a rich amber color; it was clear that these were mature buds. The smell was very powerful, rich and earthy with a bit of an acrid bite reminiscent of diesel.\u000aI ground up a bit and smoked it out of a glass beaker-bottom bong, in the evening. The high was amazing - a warm sense of weight gradually washed over my body, spreading from my head and chest into my limbs and all the way down into a warm tingle in my fingers and toes. A heavy sense of physical euphoria bathed me; early on it was accompanied by some uplifting cerebral effects, but later, my mind was surprisingly clear, despite having an intense and pleasurable body stone. Any and all sources of stress were long forgotten as I enjoyed the strong and long-lasting indica effects, which eventually eased me off into a deep sleep.\u000aThis was one of the most enjoyable indicas I have ever smoked. It isn&#39;t an instant K.O. like some really heavy indicas, and has a little bit of an uplifting effect near the start. It offers warmth, relaxation, and euphoria throughout its long effects, and if you allow it to, it will gradually ease you into a great sleep. One of my favorite evening-time strains ever, I&#39;ll smoke it an hour or two before I want to sleep.
