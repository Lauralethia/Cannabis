VOne hit and I was taken back to the ripe age of 14 and it was the first time I smoked all over again. My eyes were drooping, my body felt pain free, and south park was the greatest thing on TV again. An amazing strain that planted my body in place, and completely relaxed my entire world. An excellent bud for chilling at home with friends or relaxing by yourself, definitely an evening bud.

VThis strain is Excellent for relieving my migraines, that every chance I can I get this strain &amp; enough to last atleast a month. It works so well that atleast 70% of the time my migraine is always down to a manageable headache within 5-10 minutes everytime, &amp; completely gone within 30 minutes of finishing smoking  &amp; the rest of the time it may take upto an hour or so for major migraines that have put me in the hospital B4 several times each year, over the past 19 years.I ALWAYS MAKE SURE I HAVE THIS 4 MY HEADACHES/MIGRAINES. This works better than Zomig migraine med. I stopped all the migraine meds when I found this strain!!! Definitely a 10 of 10 for making U relaxed &amp; relief of migraines!!!!

VI would say 9-10 range, but for some reason I felt a slight paranoia, or doubt about things I usually have confidence in. That beig said, it was a great flavor while vaporizing. It had a smooth, earthy pine flavor on the exhale. Felt like I was in the forrest. The buzz lasted pretty long, but wasn&#39;t overly powering. I also felt creative as I wrote an email with words I would normally not use. Funny thing is half these reviews are written while people are high, so I guess everyone gets creative. Vape on! \u000a

VAll time favorite strain! If you enjoy relaxing and getting the greatest sleep of your life then this is your strain. At first you get a burst of energy and creative ideas, after a few hours your eyes will get very heavy and then the sleep which is amazing. only negative is alittle paranoia which doesn&#39;t affect the high at all.

VThis is one of my new favorite strains, up theyre with Girl Scout Cookie. It is a very potent indica with high THC. I have a very high tolerence for THC and this strain never fails to get me couch locked high (the feeling of sinking into the couch an just not wanting to move) followed by puts me to sleep and i don wake up untill morning. When i first smoked it i was very energetic followed by couch lock but i havent gotten energetic with this strain since so who knows. Little hunger not much.

VThis great strain is so delicious, I call it yum yum. Breaks down nicely and puts me to sleep. I prefer Indica and this one is perfect for me. Helps my back pain and insomnia. Very nice scent, the earthy smell helped me identify it from the blueberry yum yum. Nice come up that lasts a very long time. The only advice I would give is don&#39;t smoke it if you have stuff to do because you will straight fall to sleep.
