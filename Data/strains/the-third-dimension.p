VI stumbled on to this strain from my care provider.  He said really no one was buying any. so I got a half ounce to get it a try. The buds are beautiful an the smell of citrus rolled up a fatty the smoke is very smooth an taste is fantastic citrus flavor . half way through the joint I was baked real baked . I suffer from severe nerve damage an this stuff took the pain  away. If you havnt try this strain pick some up iv been a smoker for 24 years with high tolerance an it got the job done for at least 3 hours

VSeriously a winner, this strain. Uplifting and relaxing, it&#39;s great for both day or night. It&#39;s seriously covered in an almost unbelievable layer of trichomes when grown correctly. The earthy tones shine when done with soil and the pine, citrus, butter and fruit really shine in hydro. Get some if you can, she&#39;s really a nice girl.

VYou know that stereotype in some movies, the older insane guy who is laughing maniacally that resistance is futile and we&#39;re all gonna die anyway? Because his mind and spirit have been shattered by an implacable opponent? Well that was me on my first time with 3D. Like riding a bicycle without handlebars. I started out helpless on the couch, surrendering against my will to a giddy, floaty feeling amidst giggles that I didn&#39;t fully believe were mine. Resistance it now appears, is useless...\u000a\u000aSo what better idea than to walk down to my local grocery store, because I don&#39;t need anything and being in public is surely a brilliant plan? The wobbly walk down gave me plenty of opportunity to mull over my situation: does anyone need to be this high? Just what do I hope to achieve? What if I actually decide and attempt to buy something? Will I be able to navigate the immense complexities of a transaction with the cashier? What about the subtle social cues that are inextricably woven in with the basic financial transaction? The layered nuances of both social and financial transactions wrapped into an impossible matrix of human consciousness. ENTER THE THIRD DIMENSION.\u000a\u000aAll the above cogitations were were washed away as I entered the grocery store and degenerated into walking up and down the cookie aisle, lecturing the cookies out loud about how they were lousy imitations of the cookies I enjoyed as a child. That&#39;s when an employee poked his head around the corner to see what I was up to. He heard me a couple aisles over and was worried. Time to move on. I walked down the baking aisle and noticed a box of chocolate pancake mix with a growling bear on the cover and something about POWER written on the label. I began taking pictures and texting it to friends. &quot;Can you believe this ridiculous shit?!?&quot; And so of course I now had something to buy. With the power bear chocolate pancake mix as my talisman, I was able to deal with the cashier with minimal fears that he could see the horns growing out of my head.\u000a\u000aWalking home I had the sensation that my head was only loosely and vaguely associated with my body, and that my brain was a separate agent with only the most casual relationship with my body, which was largely walking me home without much direction from myself.\u000a\u000aSafety home the rest of the evening entirely disappeared. 4 stars because while I fear and revere these effects, I&#39;m not so sure that this is the way I need to be. However followup sessions on 3D have been more focused and easy to deal with as my brain adapts. It&#39;s still a mindcrusher though. Ease yourself into this one.

VThis hybrid should be approached with caution by users of all levels with the oil concentrate.  Bought .5 ml of concentrate about two months ago.  Tried several methods and found the best was to put a drop on a bowl of flower.  Only problem is, it takes maybe two hits, and then you are elsewhere.  I have lived and gambled in Vegas for 20 years now, and have smoke far longer than that, and have NEVER found myself confused while sitting in front of a video poker machine.  And I did NOT drive as the casino is within walking distance.  Taste is hard to describe but somewhat citrusy with a slight chemical overtone (may be the concentrate).  Approach with caution but be prepared to enjoy your little journey.
