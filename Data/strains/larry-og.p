VLarry OG, very nice dense beautiful nugs, very well trimmed, smells and smokes like a beauty. True to its name it is a very mellow Indica Dominant hybrid strain.\u000a\u000aI tend to use this medication throughout the end of the day leading up to my harder Indica&#39;s but don&#39;t get me wrong as good Larry OG can couch lock you too lol. I seem to have it help best with Depression, Anxiety, Spams, Pain &amp; Insomnia. I give this batch a star rating as it is very dank top shelf Larry OG. \u000a\u000aI highly recommend it to new users trying new Indica hybrids as this one is more mellow than most but does leave you feeling good, definitely a must try. Happy toking my friends!

VNow I had heard of &quot;Larry OG&quot; quite a few times over the last few years, but something about the rather plain name just never really seemed to interest me, and I (sadly) passed over it on many a menu. This experience most definitely reminded me not to judge a book by it&#39;s cover- or a strain by it&#39;s name! =D\u000a\u000aI had ran out of bud completely (OBVIOUSLY an emergency situation!!!), and called a homegirl and asked if she had anything she could help me out with for a couple of days til I got paid and she brought me about 3g of some hydroponic &quot;Lemon Larry Kush&quot; as she called it.\u000a\u000aAnd man had I been missing out on this awesome strain! The smell of pungent/skunky, POWERFUL LEMON and STRONG PINE managed (while inside of a dispensary bottle, made with stinky bud in mind..) to stink up my ENTIRE two bedroom house in less than 10 minutes, all while still in my pocket! Killerrrrrr!!!\u000a\u000aBright, tennis ball green nugs with rather long orange-ish/red-ish pistils, broken open, there are trichomes throughout.\u000a\u000aThe taste is soooo Lemony and awesome! On both the inhale AND exhale. BEAUTIFUL, TERPY, lemon/lime/pine out the whazoo baby! \u000a\u000aThe effects are absolutely RIGHTEOUS! \u005cm/ Starts with a nice pressure behind the eyes which quickly spreads throughout your body. Leaves you very dreamy, smiling, giggly, happy, relaxed, and just, well.... STOOOOOOOONED!!!! \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re a fan of hybrids and have yet to sample these delightful genetics, HOP TO IT!

VNOTE: My review comes from the perspective of an employee at Emblem Cannabis - www.emblemcannabis.com, and as a legal patient with various Licensed Producers in Canada.\u000a\u000aINTRODUCING Emblem Cannabis: \u000aYellow Submarine (aka Larry OG, aka Lemon Larry)\u000a\u000aSTARRING: \u000aA hybrid dominant strain, with 16% THC and co-starring the terpene Terpineol. No CBD in this one worth noting.\u000a\u000aTHE BLURB:\u000aAlso known as Lemon Larry, its parents are OG Kush and SFV OG. For me, genetics and lineage are interesting avenues to explore. It&#39;s the why behind how the strain came to be. For Emblem, why name it Yellow Submarine? As Larry OG - or Lemon Larry as we like to call it - matured, we&#39;d walk through the grow rooms and breathe in a noticeable, vivid, lemony aroma. And somehow that bright yellow, lemon citrus visual turned into the Beatle&#39;s &quot;We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine.&quot; And voila, Larry OG was dubbed Yellow Submarine as its Emblem name, which we think is very fitting for the creative vibe this strain delivers. It&#39;s a very uplifting, creative high, but not a giggly high. A talkative, exploratory kind of high. Alert and active.\u000a\u000aTHE SCENT: \u000aIt&#39;s fresh. Imagine a grassy meadow impossibly placed between a lush, wet pine forest and a fragrant lemon grove. The breeze is undulating back and forth between all three, creating the most aromatic verdant fragrance. I was pretty positive this would come out from the lab testing highest in the terpene limonene (which gives off a noticeable lemony scent), but instead the lab results concluded that terpineol was highest terpene found. Terpineol is sometimes described as having an aromatic herb scent and others describe it as having a lime or eucalyptus scent. All of those evoke a type of freshness, so I guess I could smell that here. \u000a\u000aTHE TASTE: \u000aSmooth and slightly lemony. The lemon taste isn&#39;t apparent at first, but comes on after a bit. Cotton mouth for sure. (Note to self: Grab a glass of water and a nice lip balm before partaking. OMG. Lemon water would&#39;ve been perfect. Next time.)\u000a\u000aTHE LOOK: \u000aIt has orange wavy hairs and a medium dense bud shape with some muscle that&#39;s glistening with trichome crystals. The nug size is pretty nice, averaging about 1.5&quot; long in a 10g package. Emerging from the depths of the ocean, Yellow Submarine has just the perfect amount of moisture (plus Emblem gives Boveda packs). It&#39;s not crazy sticky, but sticky enough.\u000a\u000aBACK TO THE BLURB\u2026\u000a\u2026Squirrel! Ha\u2026I got distracted by looking at Larry&#39;s Lemons, but I&#39;m back to writing the blurb portion of the experience. I&#39;d describe the vibe as &#39;active mind&#39;, focused, creative, exploratory, inquisitive and uplifting. Everything I&#39;ve read said both this and the parent strains are hybrids, but I&#39;d guess it&#39;s leaning strongly towards sativa. For me, it&#39;s not too intense and it delivers a medium buzz. My leg muscles were burning earlier from a tough workout 36 hours ago, but I&#39;m not noticing the pain any longer. My body feels light, almost tingly, but yet not actually tingling. (Yep, super helpful, right? Ha.) With this strain, both my brain and body could be active. Favourite music and this strain would make a magical duo. It&#39;s below freezing outside, otherwise I&#39;d wouldn&#39;t be able to resist going out to watch the stars, meditating under them as my mind wanders toward new ideas.\u000a\u000aHOW LONG? WHEN?\u000aHa, I&#39;ll let you know\u2026 It&#39;s definitely longer than some and shorter than others. For me, it would be a day or early evening strain, and definitely not a go-to for right before bed. Personally, Larry OG would be a go for a hike type of strain strain. See nature strain. Dance strain. Move strain. Be in Awe of Life strain. Share love strain. Explore the world strain. Listen to good-vibe tunes and smile strain. Yoga strain. Even better\u2026. It&#39;s a &#39;do yoga on a beach, at sunset, listening to good-vibe music while in awe of life&#39; strain. \u000a\u000aOVERALL:\u000aReally nice. Active and uplifting.\u000a\u000a\u201cIn the town where I was born\u000aLived a man who sailed to sea\u000aAnd he told us of his life\u000aIn the land of submarines\u000aSo we sailed up to the sun\u000aTill we found a sea of green\u000aAnd we lived beneath the waves\u000aIn our yellow submarine\u201d\u000a~ The Beatles

Vwent to a zoo a couple hours from my house this morning and got to pet a real sloth. It was so freaking awesome. Now, I&#39;m celebrating the fantastic day and reminiscing about the experience and when I close my eyes I can almost see the beautiful eyes of the sloth looking at me. I feel so happy right now that my heart feels like almost electric. It&#39;s a pretty good feeling. I wish I could feel like this all the time. I wish everybody on Earth could feel like this all the time. Just happy and thankful.

VThis is a great daytime strain if you want to be high and productive or if you want to be high and also chill with people who aren&#39;t high &amp; be able to keep up with them. After vaping 2 normal size bags on the Volcano w/ a 1/2 full container, I have great physical and mental coordination, I can keep up in conversations, I can take on tasks, or/and I can chill and relax. On another note,\u000a\u000aThis is a really calm high. I feel like I am in some serene nature place like a natural forest with massive trees and rocks and the warm sun gently shining down on me with a slight breeze blowing my long luscious hair in the wind as I blow bubbles over the cliffside.

VThis is by far my favorite strain. I have been medicating with Cannabis for over 13 years now, and I have tried 100s of different strains. Unfortunately, I live in a state where we don\u2019t have medical marijuana as an option. So, I can\u2019t just go to a local dispensary. I recently got a good sized nugget (probably 2-3 grams in weight) that in the same bag with some Granddaddy Purple I purchased at the same time. The Larry OG Kush nugget stood out noticeably in the bag with the Purp (obviously). It was absolutely beautiful. Upon further inspection was I returned home, this flower was brilliant in color, like almost a neon green with dark red and orange hairs. The nugget was compact and tight and covered in a thick coat of Trichomes aka crystals. What sold me the most was the aroma of the Larry OG. It smelled of an intoxicating scent of lemon (similar to the smell of lemon pledge) and sweet earthy undertones. The taste was exceptional with a nice thick smoke, but not overpoweringly so, and an incredible aftertaste on exhaling the smoke. It has a distinct taste of citrusy flavor of most notably oranges and tangerine. The high comes on pretty fast as I can feel a noticeable relaxation of the muscles in my back and neck (which I suffer from herniated discs in both places). Also, noticeable stress relief and a overall body warming sensation starts. Followed by a nice euphoric clear head buzz and solid body buzz as well. If I had the option to go get a medical marijuana card &amp; go to a dispensary, I would buy Larry OG Kush every time. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever tried.

VThe Look: Very Dark soggy green colored rich redish, orange-ish, and some white on the underside of these nuggets. Small pockets of dark blackish purple on the lower ends of the brushed up leafs.\u000aBud Structure: Coming in at a 21.31% THC and .38CBG tested by Steep Hill Labs, These nuggets are hard to break open, not so much frostiness on top and cracking them open revealed frozen calyxes, pistol of a very dark amber color when breaking these treasures apart such a satisfying crack when breaking up these small Kernels. \u000aThe Smell: Lots of OG Kushy pungent mixed in with like a sweet pine and small hints of lemon under the tones of earth, with like a fresh scent of grass if you like how OG Kush smells like, this is like the next closest thing that has a Kush-y like smell. \u000aThe Vape: There&#39;s a trick I learned from watching the vapor brew for so many times out of the Volcano, depending on how thick it is reveals all the different terpenes coming to life. Like a ghost coming to life perfection! Heavy rolling hills of white mist inflate the clear plastic I can&#39;t even see the other side of it, which usually means this is going to hit the spot if you like heavy mellow hitting hybrids that make your body chill out.\u000aThe Taste: Pungent, very herbal tasting, harsh pepper at the end of each toke. I highly suggest something refreshing or even cold water to sooth the harsh back hit, like it hits the back of my throat in more of a spicy feeling than anything.\u000aThe Effect: It takes at least 15-20 minutes in before it effects you it&#39;s a small creeper. Vision is noticeably sharper and lights seem to leave a stream line linking back to the bulb. Very calm mind set enjoying the time, go with the flow type of mellow very interesting. \u000aI would recommend this for social gatherings, it&#39;s a very nice warm feeling even in the cold temperatures right now its 3:00am on october 31st. Gotta say it will also leave you a little numb. Great to cook with. Helps with pain, mood issues, ADHD, since I am able enough to write this review with out any type of writers block it&#39;s great for creativity as well :P. If you suffer from depression this is definitely a life saver for that no more ANTS right now aka automatic negative thoughts. The reason why I rated this a 4 is the taste of it is very weak, I have had Larry OG many times and each time it&#39;s either pepper pungent, or like a weird intense leafy taste. To me personally it&#39;s a weak cross of the two. I&#39;ve had many different crosses of both strains individually too, this is just not a good Kush for me. If you are looking for something light while still feeling medicated for a nice body relaxing this is great for feeling a little chill, without diving into the deep end. If you are having a panic attack on thc just take some cbd to be cured of the the panic attack. Figured I should share a good secret with y&#39;all. A friend of mine was becoming super paranoid, brewed up a bag of ac/dc and I could see him shaking physically from the the when he came back, he was visibly more calm and relaxed. I told him skywalker at 24% thc right off the bat would, be too much, but the antidote worked enjoy exploring heavier strains knowing this!

Glad to reorder the same exact strain I got last time, Larry OG and Purple Larry OG.\u000a\u000a10x more Trichomes than weak genetics Ive grown from the past from seed from Amsterdam.

VSome say it gives off the aroma of rotting trash, rotten fruit, or fermenting pine needles. I think it&#39;s a little pineappley, with a hint of pine, and a hint of lemon. Larry OG is certainly an acquired taste, and while this Indica-dominant Hybrid strain isn&#39;t the first choice for everyone, I enjoy the floral flavor, and how the Sativa effects sneak up on you.  This hybrid reminds of of old Creeper Cannabis like &quot;Southern Creeper&quot;

It&#39;s undeniably OG, like any lusciously rank varietal I&#39;ve come to know and love, but peeking through the cloud of stinky comfort is a creamy caramel nose that translates to a mild, earthy palate with notes of sandalwood. I was fortunate enough to grab a particularly fresh batch of these seductively sticky buds whose glittering trichomes and pastel hues would dazzle on any runway. Though I started smoking this strain blended with Harle-Tsu for its antimicrobial terpenes (I was recovering from mold irritation at the time), it wasn&#39;t until I gave this star the spotlight it deserves that I experienced the gooey, petrifying stone that had me slumped to the ninth power &amp; eradicated the aching tension in my back and shoulders. After an hour or so, I was ready to defiantly reclaim the fitful sleep debt that had been so eluding me.

VLarry is always a pretty nice choice for medicine. This indica dominant hybrid will leave you feeling a nice balance of head and body elevation. Great for pain and loss of appetite. This stuff is a anytime medicine that will leave you feeling relaxed and happy. The best part is that is has that sweet og taste on the exhale.

VLarry OG is fantastic. It&#39;s a go-to strain following a stressful day. The affects are an appropriate balance of euphoria and relaxation.  Eliminates anxiety. This strain will facilitate a great night sleep, but will not knock you out like a traditional indica strain.  Without a doubt, larry og is a strain that I want to have in my stash at all times - it&#39;s that good. It&#39;s how you want to feel when you stay in and watch TV. Very little negative side affects. Some eye redness, and an increase of appetite.\u000aI suffer from anxiety and stress, and highly recommend this strain as a medicine to alleviate those symptoms.

VNew favorite strain, I was feeling as if I couldn&#39;t feel the effects of flower lately all too well unless I dabbed as well. This one I felt after a single bowl, it is a hard hitter. Initially, your muscles will relax upon exhale, life seems to have a happier tinge reminiscent of brighter days. This strain made me want to dance, it was energetic but not quite the racy head high of a sativa. More so of a grounded, euphoric energy that is inspired by the complete relaxed state that this strain will lull your body and mind into. 10/10, pleased with purchase. I avoided this strain for awhile as it didn&#39;t seem to stick out with the average name, don&#39;t do as I did. Put this one on the top of your list!

VFirst strain review for me. I purchased Larry OG as a budder (tested at 80to85% don&#39;t know exactly at this moment) and dabbed a peppercorn size amout on my enail set at 625&#176;F. For what ever reason this a great thinking strain for me. Well not for ever reason but more specifically as follows: it provides a good amount of pain relief which complements the gentle  state of relaxation that allows me to focus at what ever reasonable task at hand. Thoughts flow more uniformly and with a sense of rational that can build and redirect unlike normal scatterbrain with a dash of overly self critical. My anxiety is in a state of feeling okay. I think a touch CBD   could help a bit more (5 to 15mg for me usually gicerin tincture). Feeling okay with my thoughts and body is luxury for me and this stain is looking like a good tool to help me work on that area of me. I appreciate your time for the read and to good health.

Love it for its relaxing properties great for pain, depression, anxiety, migraines, eye pressure, ADHD, and of course Spinal Cord Injury. I love how it makes me feel happy, but not uplifted, I like it for day time, I would use a heavy hybrid to give me sleep. Other than that bud is very dark with orange hairs a purple to almost blackish green leaf, the trichs are heavy but not soaked not grown hydro. Love the skunky pungent taste yay!

VThe taste is anything but subtle, piney, yet it leaves behind a hint of sweetness on the lips. Smooth, but packs quite a punch, with a slower, more creeping high that suddenly overtakes your eyelids at the same time you feel any tension or anxiety you had fade away. That&#39;s one of my favorite parts about this strain, it&#39;s sneaky until it&#39;s not, and then suddenly it&#39;s enveloped you in a blissful head-body high. The nugs are dense and sticky but break down easily and into an unexpectedly large amount. Isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve purchased Larry OG and certainly won&#39;t be the last.

VLemon zest over top of mellow jello very close to down the middle hybrid.  Literally split with the first half of the buzz being more of a smooth sailing yet energized ride.  Depending on initial energy level this strain can rate anywhere on the scale from &quot;getting mad shit done&quot; to &quot;chilling on couch making a mental note of shit needed to be done&quot;.  Anywhere on the spectrum Larry OG will bring a positive outlook to the situation which is why it is awesome for depression. \u000a\u000aIt also is a good medicine for mood issues because the high does not just leave the user hanging at the end.  Instead the buzz tapers off nicely into the second half of the Lemon Larry intoxication which lays more heavy on chilling out  Ending in sedation that has little to no residual hangover effect upon waking.  Very clean feeling.  This is a very flexible strain because the high is not very heavy &amp; is whatever you make of it.  Great for folks who are new to cannabis!

VLarry OG brings a wave of psychological relief with each inhalation, the ability of the OG strain to simultaneously relax and stimulate the mind is unmatchable in any other strain. As for the Larry moniker this version of classic OG is definitely a winner.

VAwesome Medicine, reminded me of the bubba kush smell wise with nice buds and delicious kush flavor. This is one of those meds that even though I&#39;ve been smoking a lot, the first time I smoked my normal dose, I felt way more medicated than I usually do, without any real negative side effects such as anxiety. Very powerful medicine, and definitely one of my new favorites. I was still able to get the job done at work and it helped relieve my fatigue and focus intensely on the task at hand with extreme enthusiasm.

VLarry definitely got the lemon influence in this OG. I would describe the scent and taste as &quot;lemon fuel.&quot; The effects  are more euphoric than the heavy blanket of dankness an OG usually brings. That is why I rated it 4 out of 5. I&#39;d say this strain would be perfect for alleviating anxiety and minor pain. Don&#39;t be a stranger when coming across Larry. He good people &#128518;

VThe taste is anything but subtle, piney, yet it leaves behind a hint of sweetness on the lips. Smooth, but packs quite a punch, with a slower, more creeping high that suddenly overtakes your eyelids at the same time you feel any tension or anxiety you had fade away. That&#39;s one of my favorite parts about this strain, it&#39;s sneaky until it&#39;s not, and then suddenly it&#39;s enveloped you in a blissful head-body high. The nugs are dense and sticky but break down easily and into an unexpectedly large amount. Isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve purchased Larry OG and certainly won&#39;t be the last.

VThis strain is one of my favorite Indicas! I usually stick to sativas because indicas hit me hard. But this strain is a nice lasting body relaxation but without knocking me out cold haha. I used it to relieve some tooth pain and it did its job ;). I would give a try for sure. Even if you are like me and tend to stick to the uppers.

VAwesome Medicine, reminded me of the bubba kush smell wise with nice buds and delicious kush flavor. This is one of those meds that even though I&#39;ve been smoking a lot, the first time I smoked my normal dose, I felt way more medicated than I usually do, without any real negative side effects such as anxiety. Very powerful medicine, and definitely one of my new favorites. I was still able to get the job done at work and it helped relieve my fatigue and focus intensely on the task at hand with extreme enthusiasm.

VTastes herbal like very sage too sometimes temperature is to high to acquire lovely taste *note taken* A relaxed mind but a hyper active physical state. For the first time, my mind is actually being slowed down to the point to where it matches the physical speed of my movements. Larry allows me to focus concentrate and straight up get things done in a relaxed mind state. Some call it, groove, funk, style, but my generation we call it swag, and Larry allows me to be ultra swag. Here&#39;s a little rap that I came up with flow. &quot;I am the boss all covered in moss a president of the residents with my own two cents this mean green; is a pretty scene; but you just a requiem without a dream. I hope y&#39;all have a great monday, my thumb is covered in bandages from working in the front yard the work is hard the but the medicine keeps me gardening thank&#39;s Larry!

This strain has a super sativa high along with a heavy body stone that you can feel in your neck and back that feel like you gettin a message.

VI figure after going through about 2oz of this, I should finally write up a review so I make sure I *don&#39;t* do that again, lol.\u000a\u000aLarry OG does what you want weed to do, taste decent and get you high.  For that, it does the job, yeah.  But it is nothing special and I am not excited to come home and smoke a bowl of it.  It has a regular lemony/diesely scent and flavor to it, which is aight, but again, just.... meh.  After a while I realize yeah, I&#39;m high, so I can&#39;t say it sucks.  It makes me a bit more scatterbrained than I usually am, and easier to forget stuff right away.\u000a\u000aI could just be sick of all these damn OGs I&#39;ve been getting lately, that have been just mediocre compared to what I know is out there.\u000a\u000aSo, in the end, fuck you Larry Og, you only get a 3 from me.  Bye Felicia, onto my next oz tomorrow hopefully!

VI tried this strain about 4 times and I just don&#39;t like it. Perhaps it&#39;s the super piney taste , which I seem to taste in all OG strains, which taste like dirt and grass sometimes. But this one I had to give away twice! It has a super powerful high over me that I don&#39;t like as well. It knocks me out of consciousness and on my butt for hours. I get a bad itchy throat when I smoke this strain. Also, had the pill concentrate, which avoided taste and itch, but really made me too disoriented to function. I think I just don&#39;t like the OG strain. I discovered that from hating this strain, that I prefer more of a Sativa-Dominant bud.  It is a very powerful indica dominant hybrid.

VI had the pleasure to sample Larry OG on a trip to Boston last Summer, and let me tell you, this is not a strain for the novice consumer. The vibrant, frosty, and sticky nugs were broken down and rolled into a blunt shared between a friend and I. We blazed outside of our hotel early in the morning, not expecting anything overly intense. Boy, were we wrong. The indica effects hit us like a freight train, prompting us to go back inside and sit down for a while. Larry OG possesses a heavy body high and a rather cloudy head high which made me feel as if time was standing still for a few minutes. Once the initial intensity subsided, we settled into a mellow yet functional state and were able to go about our day. Certainly not the best wake n bake strain, but if you&#39;re a fan of knock you on your ass indicas then you&#39;ll love Larry OG.

VLARRY! Price check!\u000a\u000aMethod of consumption: Volcano Vaporizer.\u000a\u000aPros: Relaxation and pain relief. Some mild euphoria at first, that disapates into relaxation.\u000a\u000aCons: Dry Mouth. While not necessarily a con, effects are a creeper, so not the best for immediate relief\u000a\u000aDraw/Taste: Normal draw and exhale. Flavor was more Diesely/Piney with lemon/citrus upon exhale.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Seem to have the more indica leaning hybrid. Definitely a creeper as the effects start in the head then spread to the body over time. Little couch lock. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain if you want to relax with effects that creep in over time. Some pain relief.

VThis is a very strong head banging high. In my opinion this strain is better suited for someone who likes a short term high and who doesnt mind coughing after almost every hit... even as a veteran smoker it never fails me to get the worst headache after smoking because of the cough.However for the purpose i need it for it works.

VDense buds sticky with resin and the classic aroma of pine and lemon delight the senses even before you smoke.  Immediate euphoria makes me rethink my  belief that only sativa can deliver that kick.  The body part of the high comes on more slowly and continues to build, until that eventually overtakes the euphoria.  Excellent pain relief.

VI am a complete noob at this, so bear that in mind while reading this.\u000a  I tried this as only the second mmj thing I&#39;ve tried and as a preroll.\u000a  I asked the budtender for &quot;something to make me super happy and laugh&quot;, and this is what he recommended...so here we are.\u000a  I didn&#39;t feel anything right away, and even when i did, i didn&#39;t feel as though the &quot;happy&quot; switch was turned on.  I did the preroll in two separate tries, and perhaps breaking it up like that didn&#39;t give Larry enough material to work with, but as a newbie i was confident that i didn&#39;t need to do much.\u000a  I do feel a bit of a head &quot;buzz&quot;, very light, and an a general calmness over my mood that doesn&#39;t make stress thoughts stay in the front of my mind for long.\u000a  I will be trying this again, after I have experimented enough with the available options out there good for a combat vet.

VExceptional for an indica. It does everything an indica is supposed to do.Very nice Body high and just a little headiness. One thing that definitely stands out is the appreciation for music FOR SURE! It even lasts a few weeks after you smoke it, like you can still feel some of the effects but at like a minimal effect.

VThis strain isn&#39;t at the top of my list, but I can definitely see where other patients would enjoy it. Larry OG gave me more of a body buzz than a head high, although the two were definitely present. I look for strains that help bipolar depression and for me this couldn&#39;t cut it, but that&#39;s okay! I need a strain that is a bit more uplifting and energizing, as this made me feel very couch locked and relaxed. I can see this strain being very good for patients who suffer from stress, mild depression (of course this is different for everyone), and maybe even insomnia. Overall, would I smoke this strain again? Yes. Would I personally purchase it again? No.

VI am new to the use of medical marijuana.  I have chronic pain plus stomach complications due to diabetes.  I tried Larry&#39;s OG in a batch of cookies.  Does a decent job on my pain.  If I am active  do not get to sleepy but if watching TV or other passive activities makes me tired,  Biggest drawback for me is that I am very introspective and introverted on this strain.  Might just be me.

VAs a Daily Smoker I tend to lean towards Sativa Dominant Strains. I found this strain to hype me up for the first hour at max. After smoking Larry OG everyday for a week I started feeling FUCKING Slumped! Even when I would get smoked out by someone else who had a different strain the effects of Larry OG left me dead with no energy/ no desire to want to do anything. Good, Relaxed, &amp; UpBeat Highs if you&#39;re not smoking a lot of it for a long period of time.

VI picked up a disposable oil pen of Larry OG in L.A. recently while on tour.  This is a great hybrid leaning toward the indica side.  Great body buzz with a very relaxing feel that is not overwhelming during the daytime.  It lacks some of the staple sativa trademarks such as heightened sense of awareness and humour, however it is for me atleast, very creative and it&#39;s easy to focus on it.  I love the lemon flavor, but it can be harsh with a large inhale.

Some mild euphoria at first, that disapates into relaxation.\u000a\u000aCons: Dry Mouth. While not necessarily a con, effects are a creeper, so not the best for immediate relief\u000a\u000aDraw/Taste: Normal draw and exhale. Flavor was more Diesely/Piney with lemon/citrus upon exhale.\u000a\u000aOverall/Other: Seem to have the more indica leaning hybrid. Definitely a creeper as the effects start in the head then spread to the body over time. Little couch lock. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain if you want to relax with effects that creep in over time. Some pain relief.

VLarry OG is everything I read about and much more. It has a clean citrus, piney taste. In a glass bowl the smoke makes the fore-mentioned more favorable.\u000a\u000aI suffer from chronic pain and this worked very well. i didn&#39;t have to take my regular pain medicine. I felt relaxed, yet very creative. I am a coder and video editor - it got me back to being more attentive to  my crafts and hobbies. The buzz creeps up on you and stays for a good while - making you feel warm and cozy.\u000a\u000aMy eyes got a little dry, but reading sure didn&#39;t help the situation either. Yes, I got the munchies, but it wasn&#39;t like I was ravenous , just wanted something light and not to messy.\u000a\u000aOverall it is a very good strain. I recommend it for those suffering with pain and muscle spasms. Pain medicine has a way of upsetting your stomach after a prolonged period of use. Larry OG will put a break in that cycle.

VLarry&#39;s Lemon OG (Larry OG pheno). This cut of Larry has popcorn structured light green nugs, hunter green sugar leaves, and bright cooper pistils peaking out of the plump calyxes. It&#39;s aroma is a very pleasant lemon diesel fuel scent oh so tantalizing with subtle hints of pine. The flavor however reverses these characteristics, with an initial blast of pine couple with a sweet citrus lemon in the aftertaste oh yes. The high is a sweet intense ride that starts out relaxing body then slowly crawls up to the head. It will leave you staring out into space with a smile on your face.

VI had the pleasure to sample Larry OG on a trip to Boston last Summer, and let me tell you, this is not a strain for the novice consumer. The vibrant, frosty, and sticky nugs were broken down and rolled into a blunt shared between a friend and I. We blazed outside of our hotel early in the morning, not expecting anything overly intense. Boy, were we wrong. The indica effects hit us like a freight train, prompting us to go back inside and sit down for a while. Larry OG possesses a heavy body high and a rather cloudy head high which made me feel as if time was standing still for a few minutes. Once the initial intensity subsided, we settled into a mellow yet functional state and were able to go about our day. Certainly not the best wake n bake strain, but if you&#39;re a fan of knock you on your ass indicas then you&#39;ll love Larry OG.

The taste is pretty close to how it smells, a funky deep chronic. This is one I have wanted to try for awhile and I was not disappointed, give it a try when she comes to town.

VVery strong piney, kush like taste that will have you coughing hard if you hit it too hard. There&#39;s a reason why this strain was rated one of the best strains by leafly! Nice dense nugs with a scent to kill for. Get some if you have the chance.

VThis strain is very relaxing type of bud. But it keeps you happy at the same time. You can relax on a couch and be able to hold a good conversation. It doesnt make you sleepy just calm. The taste is very earthy but yet has a sweet after taste. I would recommend this to a person that might be having stress or has some pain.

VThis is LA at its finest. This LARRY OG strain (and its sister Irene) tramped around this town for years in closed grower groups and inner circles until inevitably breaking out of the shadows. Featured strain of the month recently in HT magazine and one of the most popular strains on this site (for good reason.) don&#39;t be fooled by the imitations, look for the typical OG pungent and piney smell, with just a hint of anise (black licorice.) trichomes are rock candy like, with massive resin heads that grow in fields atop one another. Red veins and slight purple and red hues with a backdrop of almost lime green, will denote you have found the real deal. Happy hunting, Larry is out there waiting to be found like Waldo. He won&#39;t be going anywhere anytime soon...

VAfter 3-4 hits I already felt the effects of Larry OG (Log). It has a strong taste and it almost made me cough. After 10 minutes feelings of relaxation, happiness and some euphoria began. Tingling in my body occured as well. No head buzz which I liked though. I must say that for about 2 hours, my mouth was completely dry. Perfect if you want to stay active, burn of anxiety and depression. This is a day time strain for me.

VPicked this only because of the name and I like trying new strains.  This one was ok but not a wow factor for me.  Taste is smooth but odd.  Inhale smooth with no cough, exhale smooth but left a weird after taste.  If you hit it hard it will relax and is enjoyable but did not do much for pain relief.  If this were the only strain available I would  be ok but likely won&#39;t pick it again if there is a choice.  I broke up the bud and mixed it with my other &quot;not so favorite&quot; leftovers so nothing wasted at this house!

Rather hard buzz and it did help with ticking the pain down a couple of notches.  Happy I gave it a second try!  Still not the best I have tried but it holds its weight!

Vif you get the right strain of Larry this OG will blow you away.  I&#39;m talking picked right. Indoor.  Og smelling fruity but fuel like.  Nugs of different sizes, not that dispensary uniform shit.  I just picked up a QP of some dank fuzzy buds. Perfect. If you say you don&#39;t like this you are smoking some brick weed.

VAbout 10 mintues before i consumed this strain My provider was informing me about, i had gotten into a confrontation at get together. This argument almost escalated into a fist fight. My anxiety was shooting from my fingertips down to my ankles. i left the party before i had heart attack infront of the surrounding crowd. i smoked my medicine out of my honeycomb water pipe for pure filtration. My provider understands my condition and always knows what to give me. &quot;Larry OG&quot; he called it. My Felt as though it was fading away much like a dream when you wake up, i began talking to my brother next to me as have forgetten the whole subject. i cured my anxiety episode withun about 1 MIn and 30 Secs.

VLog is right! This stuff hit me in the face like a Redwood. The initial sensation of &quot;Face Lock&quot; was a surprise. My cheeks and nose felt a bit numb and tingly. Not entirely pleasant but it faded shortly after and I was soon fascinated with how my brain lit up like Times Square on New Years Eve. Very uplifting and invigorating. I recommend waiting a bit before loading up a second round.
