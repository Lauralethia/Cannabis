VSmoooth drags...\u000a\u000aHits head immediately and then slowly but strongly hit the body. Good balanced high. Not too munchy and INSANELY relaxed. Kept a pretty clear mind and as the high progressed I became more and more couch locked. Good chill strain.

VWell, it&#39;s one of the biggest strains I&#39;ve tried, but, honestly, the article was all like dissin&#39; on white people in a nice way...Larry Bird was like, the ONLY white man who could jump...sorry. TBI talkin! Anyways, this strain is the shit and should be recommended for TS and other tic disorders. Great white hope...come on.
