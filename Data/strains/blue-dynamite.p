VI purchased Blue Dynamite to experience the effects of a high CBD strain; bud looks wonderful and smells great, but has a dizzying effect without much euphoria. This isn&#39;t a flower I\u2019d choose for recreation; however it&#39;s wonderful for pain relief and can be added to other strains, enhancing the overall experience. ***Blue Dynamite by Vashon Velvet, CBD 11.70%, THCA 4.98%, THC9 0.20%, Terpenes 1.23%, Cannabinoids 17.70%. ***

VBlue Dynamite is a high CBD Indica, with a very pleasant berry flavor, and sweet aromas.\u000a\u000aI have really come to enjoy Indicas which do a great job helping me stay asleep, something I have trouble with partially due to physical pain and in part due to a wandering, restless mind. \u000a\u000aBD was quite good at putting both in check. It certainly had a compound effect, as the first 2 hits were relaxing and slightly hazy, but became quite a bit more heavy in sedatation upon the last few, which certainly put me out.\u000a\u000aI though this was a really great night strain for me, but it doesn&#39;t quite reach the lofty expectations set by the lovely Frida.\u000a\u000aThat said, Vashon Velvet did a great job on this one and I would be happy to have it as a nightcap any day of the week.

VI got some a while back, but I&#39;m not sure if it was blue dynamite, or dynamite. (The dealer called it blue dynamite) All I know is that it smelled like grapefruits and tasted like grape fruits, and got me trashed.

VThis is a CBD strain. It is very nice and relaxing. The effects are completely different than a THC strain and quite enjoyable. Definitely add this to additional strains as a salad. But on its own it is very pleasant. Flavor is nice as well. Top notch product.
