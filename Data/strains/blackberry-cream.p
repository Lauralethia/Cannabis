VGreat taste and smell. The high comes on fast and strong but doesn&#39;t last very long. That&#39;s the only reason this got 4 stars. Super Stoney but left wondering why I need to smoke more after it suddenly wore off. This is my second night hitting this bud and it happened both times. You do feel relaxed after that. However I smoked it fast because the high from the start was amazing. Still worth a try!

VHoly Moly!  It REALLY tastes like berries.  It comes on slow with a body relaxing high.  It is like a comforting hug from a giant teddy bear.  Then comes the head high.  There is nothing I can share to prepare you for what this strain brings to the table.  A discussion on soap molds that are shaped like food, resulted in a midnight text about penis shaped soaps and real world hygienic uses.  Tonight I hide the phone before I smoke.

VI\u2019ve smoked this while mixed with other strains and ruins it. Smoked 1G in a Emerald white owl and had an amazing \u201ctrip type high\u201d almost compatible to high grade Maui Waui/Blue Dream. Very positive and enjoyable!

VIncredible. Smoked two joints and listened to A Love Supreme by Coletrane, it was a truly spiritual experience. This is the kinda herb where you have a few hits and you can&#39;t stop smiling for the rest of the day. Totally cured my anxiety.

VI bought this strain from Spark1 in Bozeman.. easily my favorite strain I\u2019ve had. The initiation time is about 30-40 mins so be careful or you WILL be couch locked. If not, just sit back and enjoy. You\u2019re in for an awesome head high with a smooth body buzz that keeps you simulated. Highly recommend!

VPicked up this strain in the form of sauce from raw garden here in California. As one of their limited time runs I had high expectations and this strain still blew me away. Excellent flavor and excellent effects. Really helped me relax while not feeling paranoid. Would recommend to anyone who suffers from chronic pain or anxiety.

VPicked up a batch testing in at 24% THC content, and have since smoked many bowls and a wonderful joint of this stuff. Blackberry Cream takes a bit of time to kick in fully (20-45 minutes on average), so be careful to not oversmoke or you will surely find yourself couchlocked and sleepy. The blackberry flavor can only be masked by the creamy taste in the exhale. The nugs are also decently sized and dense, with beautiful streaks of frosty purple that took my breath away. Depending on the amount, this strain could either facilitate a relaxing social high, or a nice come-down from a long day before bed. Give it a try!

VI bought thIs flower in Portland, The nuggs were  fluffy with some purple leaves and granular sugary trichomes all over the place. I love how this shop puts little boveda packs in their flower product,so it\u2019s moist and healthy. Smells great with a mellow and clear headed high for me.I can Netflix and chill or actually get something done, depending on how much I vape. I could easily watch a movie and actually pay attention. Great for migraines as well.

VThis strain will knock you out quicker than you can get to bed. I ONLY smoke this right before falling asleep and if I wake up at night. I have very bad insomnia and this strain relaxes me and puts me right to sleep. The high leading up to falling asleep is very pleasant as well. Numbing my whole body before drifting off.
