VMy recent interactions with this strain have been GREAT! Through the recent years i have battled with addiction that has lead me down a path of utter destruction. Through self disciplines and the mental need to live that has been arrested and subdued. But that had left me with over whelming body anxiety and restlessness. Not to mention battling random spurts of depression. I found this from a friend and was immediately impressed. The smell alone is enough to make you smile. This strain has eliminated all symptoms with one mighty puff of my trusted pipe. If i decide to finish my bowl pack I&#39;m left in a state of pure euphoric bliss. \u000aCalming my mind and allowing me to be productive. This stain man... its great

VVery strong bud.  This stuff knocked me on my ass and had me locked in my computer chair for days.  It was so strong I had to mix it with some other sativa-dominant strain to tone the indica effects down a little.  No problem though because this and some Super Silver Haze made a fantastic combination.  GREAT bedtime smoke.  Gave me munchies like nothing else I&#39;ve ever tried... normally I eat one maybe two times a day.  While smoking this stuff I would eat about 4 meals a day plus stacks and late-night dessert.  This strain is on my top 10 list.  If I had an unlimited supply of this, though, I&#39;d probably sleep 12 hours a day and gain 100 pounds.

VAbsolutely loved this Strain! Verry verry strong! If you like killer indicas this is definitely a strain for you. Beutifull frosted green nugs with super dense red hairs through out, you can really see the purple once you break the nug. The smell is an Earthy Kushy smell with a hint of grape. The smoke is heavy with an Earthy taste. Starts verry Euphoric and cerebral but then even out into a verry relaxing and potentially sleepy high. worked it&#39;s way onto my list of favs for sure!

My  roommate (John Ryan) received over a gram of this one hit wonder and unbenounced to me he smoked the entire strain of g13 and hash in 2 hrs.  If smoked with hundreds of herb conessouirs and never have I witnessed a more wasteful idiotic move than my roommate smoking this fine bud in less than two hrs.  John Ryan...\u000a. I&#39;ll never forget him for wasting one of the finest greens on Earth.  Thanks for the gluten.  \u000aSigned,\u000aA true green conessouir

VI love this stuff, it gets rid of my migraine and neck/back pain very quickly with just a couple of hits from the pipe.  Other reviews said this stain is a harsh smoke but I did not find that to be true.  Smells like grape both before smoking as well as the lingering smell after smoking is more like grape and less like pot.  I had no negative effects.  I could have slept but didn&#39;t so it isn&#39;t a couch lock strain unless you smoke more than just a few hits.  The taste is like a blueberry but more grapey rather than blueberry flavored.  I love this stuff, as a medical marijuana user I will continue to use this until I find something that works even better, which will be hard to do I think.

VExcellent strain for relaxing on the couch. After i exhaled the first hit from my pipe i felt immediately felt a slight change in mood. When i finished the bowl, i had a good cerebral high going. This strain starts off as cerebral, and about 20 minutes in you start to get that classic warm fuzzy couchlocked indica high. Only reason i gave it four stars is because im more of a sativa person and like doing things while high, but this is just excellent for nightime relaxation, although it tastes like shit, its a great strain for chilling on the couch.

VGot an eighth of this from a Dispensary a while back. It&#39;s definitely Nice. Has a taste reminiscent of grape flavoring that stayed on the tongue. Very relaxing and has really been helping me eat when I&#39;ve been very nauseous lately due to medication. However, it made me feel a little emotionally numb. Could just be a personal reaction, but every once in a while it&#39;s made my depression worse. Other than that, great strain, great taste, nice dark indica buds.

Vthis strain is the bees knees for alleviating my body aches, anxiety and depression that comes from PTSD. the smell is mostly what you get from GDP, a lot of linalool, lol! It assaults your nostrils with a very pleasant purple floral scent that is almost like lavenders combined with some dank cannbis. \u000aThe flavor on the inhale is again mostly GDP with a kind of skunky undertone. The exhale leans more to the skunky side. The effects are body heavy at first, with a warming body buzz that kind of settles into an extremely relaxed euphoric slight head buzz. \u000aOverall i give this strain a 9/10 for what it does for me personally. It helps with a significant portion of my ailments, the only downside is it doesnt make me hungry.\u000a\u000aIf you&#39;ve never heard of, or tried PMN but are an Indica fan a who has an affection for Grand Daddy Purple, this is definetly a strain you should try! You wont be disappointed.

Vprob my least favorite strain of the year and my very first rating below 4 stars. looks and smells good but that&#39;s a huge let down. I think the taste is awful and extremely harsh. I just smoked about 2.5 grams in one sitting out of a glass steam roller and glass water bong with zero effects, body or head. good thing I saved some alien og and bubba kush from last week!
