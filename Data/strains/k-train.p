VWow what a strain..Trainwreck x Kush... Beautiful as hell to start off with.. great heady fast strong body high, with intense pressure relief in my joints and relaxation. overall it made me quite lethargic and sleepy but worth it for what i needed\u000a\u000aIt hits fast, and it hits hard. Stoney on the body, confusing and trippy on the brain. A truly powerful smoke.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000ai feel like i just got hit by a K Train.

Vtrainwreck lite with citrus...  It&#39;s only lite compared to trainwreck though.  It&#39;s tastey and relaxing. A great med to help with pain without knocking you out.

VWARNING: CLEAN YOUR PIPE BEFORE BLAZING THIS. THIS ISH IS TOO DELICIOUS NOT TO.\u000a\u000aOn the serious side of things, though,the citrusy of this strain is delicious. I enjoy trying to taste the strain and see if my taste buds are aligned with leafly&#39;s, and I think the citrus-like taste of K-Train is one of the most obvious ones out there. So good.\u000aThe mental buzz is good aswell. Helps me concentrate and work a while or play music.

VWow! Your going to be duct taped to the couch with this strain but keep some kind of drink handy because your going to wake up with some mean cotton mouth.  \u000aIf you can find it, buy it! You won&#39;t be disappointed. I&#39;m old and falling apart and I can still get a good nights sleep, great MMJ.

VEasy to grow, huge harvests.  As the genetics imply, it&#39;s a train wreck that is more stony because of the kush. Very smooth relaxing, heavy, but not too heavy.
