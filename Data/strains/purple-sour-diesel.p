VLuv this strain !! Total stress reliever , very uplifting ! Puts you in the moment , if you have anxiety , ptsd , depression , this really helps . Keeps you focused on the positive , instead of worrying about things that are out of your control . The deep purple buds are frosted over in trichomes , which also makes it have an incredible bag appeal , even tho I keep it in jars . Overall , one of my definite favs

VOne hit on the bong then I was pretty stoned already. The weed is literately purple and taste like tropical. Little while I got stoned for 10minutes I was really really tired &amp; sleepy but after that phase I was pretty energetic. Basically PSD have all the strength that you need for weed. It&#39;s all put in one. Munchies, imagination, tiredness &amp; energetic &amp; relaxation in 2 hours average

VA.P.C.C. $55 1/8th. I toked this out of a 16 inch dome + tree percolator ice bong. It was smooth, but that&#39;s probably because of the ice. The taste is delicate, but you can definitely taste the purple. The high is at first an immediate buzz behind the eyes and near the bottom back of your head, and I felt euphoric and motivated to do things. I toked this before I went to Best Buy and had a great time there.

VUnfortunately I have not smoked this strain in plant form but I have Vaped off the Eureka Oil tank cartridge! as  some may know the oils dont have much taste or smell to them they are meant for discreat smokers anyways the EFFECT it definitely hit the charts right on the spot! the relax and euphoric feeling followed by mellowness and definitely let me focus for work. whats great about this strain is that its great for wake and bake smoking with out the drowsiness that follows and well its also great for smoking at night before bed because it does not leave you groggy and hazing in the head next morning.

VI have this strain currently. Visual perspective,  slightly premature,  fluffy with slight density near the stems. Aroma is strong, fruity with a hint of skunk.  Taste is delectable, device used Jet Water pipe, smooth controllable hits, no outrageous coughing or vomiting.  Roughly 8 mins after the first hit, effects are apparent,  feeling it in your eyes, then coasting across your entire body. I felt my blood pressure lower,  extremely tiring,  and relaxing. enjoy!!

VI&#39;m always looking for something that gives me good pain relief and helps me de-stress.This strain, and especially the oil made from this strain, gives that and more. I slept so good! I started with the flower, and ended with the PSD oil rated at 50%THC.\u000aIf you have  serious pain issues, and haven&#39;t tried vaping yet, you should. The  concentrated form gives powerful pain relief.  Just take it easy as you build up your tolerance, or you&quot;ll get a headache. Concentrates can range up to 90+% THC.  I&#39;ve had multiple spine surgeries and have severe chronic pain.

VGet it if you can.\u000aWonderful.. loved the heavy high that came with a desire for thought and conversation at the same  time, even simple pondering; brain activity&#39;s nice when things burn.\u000a.. It is quite the heavy one, though, I&#39;ll admit, but nothing to stray from.. I&#39;ll also admit playing a video game (based off of a board game, so, strategy) was possible with a seemingly clear hear when it was obvious my head was clouded.

VA great end of the night kind of bud to smoke! Hits fast and sticks around for a while! Giving an intense mental high with a relaxing body high simultaneously. The buds were very dry and frosted with Trichomes and broke apart almost effortlessly, the smell resembles a slight floral aroma with an undertone of the diesel it is crossbred with. The smoke itself is very smooth, perfect for smoke tricks and deep long inhales!

VGot a half z of this from my buddy. The nugs were a beautiful yellow-green and purple with red spots and red hairs. The knobby buds wreeked of sweet fruity kerosene(if that smell is possible) and pine. The flavor was also complex, reversing roles and leading with a strong fruity taste that has a distinct sour kerosen and pine finish. The high shoots to your head, verrrry similar to sour d, but after while it balances out, and feels alot more hybridish. Left me really high but still focused and uplifted. One of the few Sour d hybrids that maintains the true sour diesel taste, and brings a new twist.

VI suffer from anxiety, and no matter the hit, I was in for a gnarly ride of fear, paranoia and scatterbrain disconnect. This lasted for as long as peaks generally last; and boy is that peak of Everest proportions.\u000a\u000aOnce I became grounded is when I really began to appreciate the strain. For me, my euphoria was triggered by activities that required both focus &amp; interaction. The sensation was uplifting both mentally and physically. It was as if I pacified my wandering mind and got it to cooperate with my body.\u000a\u000aHowever, I had very little interest in movies and television. I did enjoy some light reading, but ultimately found that to be quite challenging. Music was a big hit, but it absolutely had to be upbeat and positive, and most importantly, in the background. To put it short, I did not want to kick back and relax. \u000a\u000aI&#39;d say this strain compliments productivity very well. Whether that&#39;s having fun, exercising, working on a project, or perhaps even doing chores. And even though I do get anxiety, meaning it&#39;s not something I enjoyed, I do feel confident in saying that it would compliment outdoorsy and social environments.\u000a\u000a#vaped this for over two months experience.

Now on to the buds, they are very dense, a nice green, with purple all over and quite frosty... looks can be deceiving, bc this bud was really beautiful &amp; looked like some exotic..

VI&#39;ve found that DAMA Oil&#39;s variety to be the best so far. There strain is pale green and very frosty. Other strains that claim to be Purple Sour Diesel are .... very purple and the effect, while still good, is not the DAMA variety. \u000a\u000aThis stuff is one hit and you are comatose, so it is great for sleeping, meditating and not for the faint of heart. But, that&#39;s just me.\u000a\u000aAs of 1/21/15, there is a rumour going around that DAMA may go recreational. I don&#39;t know if this strain in it&#39;s present strain will still be available in the medical dispensaries, I sure hope so for my sake and other&#39;s who have my issues.

VA little confused about what the difference is between this &quot;Purple Sour Diesel&quot; and the other &quot;Purple Diesel&quot; listed on leafly, both are described as being a cross between Purple Kush and Sour Diesel, but im not sure if maybe the difference is a variation in the diesel strain? \u000a\u000aAnyways, i picked this one to write my review on because of the fact that it said &quot;sour, fruity aroma similar to sour grapes&quot; which describes the scent perfectly, as well as the slight undertone of grape in the taste(on the exhale mainly).\u000a\u000aThe buds smell like sour grapes and purple kush, but as soon as you break open a nug and smell the inside, the diesel is unleashed! I mean seriously, I was sort of dissapointed at the smell at first (as i prefer diesels over kush) but as soon as i smelled the sweet diesel, i was excited to try this strain, and the taste of diesel is mixed perfectly with the Purple Kush to sort of take away the normal &quot;sore thoat&quot; i normally get with the intense taste of a straight sour diesel stain.\u000a\u000aThe effect is basically the exact same as the description says, very sativa like cerebral high with a nice body stone.

VI suffer from anxiety, and no matter the hit, I was in for a gnarly ride of fear, paranoia and scatterbrain disconnect. This lasted for as long as peaks generally last; and boy is that peak of Everest proportions.\u000a\u000aOnce I became grounded is when I really began to appreciate the strain. For me, my euphoria was triggered by activities that required both focus &amp; interaction. The sensation was uplifting both mentally and physically. It was as if I pacified my wandering mind and got it to cooperate with my body.\u000a\u000aHowever, I had very little interest in movies and television. I did enjoy some light reading, but ultimately found that to be quite challenging. Music was a big hit, but it absolutely had to be upbeat and positive, and most importantly, in the background. To put it short, I did not want to kick back and relax. \u000a\u000aI&#39;d say this strain compliments productivity very well. Whether that&#39;s having fun, exercising, working on a project, or perhaps even doing chores. And even though I do get anxiety, meaning it&#39;s not something I enjoyed, I do feel confident in saying that it would compliment outdoorsy and social environments.\u000a\u000a#vaped this for over two months experience.

You can easily let yourself couch lock but you have the control to change gears and perk up. That&#39;s why I like this one as a wake n&#39; bake. And for someone who&#39;s eyes get blood shot from one hit, my eyes are pearls after this strain. No red eye. An overall Fantastic strain.

VOne of my absolute favorites strains.\u000a\u000aBig Purple nugs covered in powdery trichomes. The smell is like sour grapes, very sour, and it shines through when you smoke it. (try making a twax of this with some Tangie Oil and it tastes spectacular.)\u000a\u000aThe high is extremely euphoric and energetic, but feels like a wave of relaxation washing over you at the same time. I could easily fall asleep with this, or go on a hike. or just sit and think. Excitement and creativity are abundant.\u000a\u000aP.S. for those with ADHD. This is great stuff, its energetic enough to keep you focused, but chill enough so you don&#39;t wander to much.

VI have had this many times before the rec shops opened and loved it. I took 4 years off of smoking and went back out there. I was really disappointed after buying it recently. It just made me hungry and bored. I can&#39;t blame the bud tender as he put it on the lower spectrum of what he recommended but I only but only bought it for the familiarity.  Not much of any high what so ever... just ate a lot after smoking 2 bowls.

VI&#39;ve found that DAMA Oil&#39;s variety to be the best so far. There strain is pale green and very frosty. Other strains that claim to be Purple Sour Diesel are .... very purple and the effect, while still good, is not the DAMA variety. \u000a\u000aThis stuff is one hit and you are comatose, so it is great for sleeping, meditating and not for the faint of heart. But, that&#39;s just me.\u000a\u000aAs of 1/21/15, there is a rumour going around that DAMA may go recreational. I don&#39;t know if this strain in it&#39;s present strain will still be available in the medical dispensaries, I sure hope so for my sake and other&#39;s who have my issues.

VGot a half z of this from my buddy. The nugs were a beautiful yellow-green and purple with red spots and red hairs. The knobby buds wreeked of sweet fruity kerosene(if that smell is possible) and pine. The flavor was also complex, reversing roles and leading with a strong fruity taste that has a distinct sour kerosen and pine finish. The high shoots to your head, verrrry similar to sour d, but after while it balances out, and feels alot more hybridish. Left me really high but still focused and uplifted. One of the few Sour d hybrids that maintains the true sour diesel taste, and brings a new twist.

The buds were very dry and frosted with Trichomes and broke apart almost effortlessly, the smell resembles a slight floral aroma with an undertone of the diesel it is crossbred with. The smoke itself is very smooth, perfect for smoke tricks and deep long inhales!

VOne of my favorite strains till this day. Very euphoric and pleasant. It kept my mind busy when I didn&#39;t want to think about certain things. One of my friends couldn&#39;t handle the high yet I freaking loved it. Nice rich purple and light green buds, hard hitting and a great fruity flavor. Warning: REALLY STRONG PUNGENT SMELL.

VI have this strain currently. Visual perspective,  slightly premature,  fluffy with slight density near the stems. Aroma is strong, fruity with a hint of skunk.  Taste is delectable, device used Jet Water pipe, smooth controllable hits, no outrageous coughing or vomiting.  Roughly 8 mins after the first hit, effects are apparent,  feeling it in your eyes, then coasting across your entire body. I felt my blood pressure lower,  extremely tiring,  and relaxing. enjoy!!

VBlunt took me a bit longer to finish and I almost tapped out early. Fast hitting strain. Relaxed laziness is what I&#39;m calling the overall effect.  Not as purple in color as I would have liked but overall thumbs up.

VMy particular batch of this was also not as purple or hybrid balanced as some phenotypes others have reported loving here. I found the local East Coast regular S.D. to be much, much better - likely due to a higher degree of grower skill. Truly I wish I had lab tested the batch I&#39;m still working thru mason jars of ... 2 yrs later it&#39;s actually seems significantly better than originally. Is that possible? Dunno, don&#39;t care - it&#39;s total candy - only sometimes rivaled by the likes of well grown BD, GSC, GG4... My Psd batch was very good, just not tip top shelf - near identical effects, just 20% less. Very sativa like, daytime focused, upbeat and thought inspiring. No sense of heavy body effect / couchlock ever, but uniquely &quot;3rd eye opening&quot; inspirational. My wife and I found that equal proportions of SD, Fire OG and Bubba Kush make the perfect trinity for an epically naughty evening. Could some savant breeder please cross those 3 for us, that would be great, thanks!

VLooks like purple kush, smells like sour diesel. Pretty exceptional as long as its a good batch. REALLY crystallized and smells pretty dank too. Have something to seal it really good in because the odor is pugnant!  Taste is decent you can taste the hints of purple kush  [im vaping].  Only negative is whether vaping or smoking this strain is quite rough on the throat. Best for a nighttime couchlock smoke. 4/5
