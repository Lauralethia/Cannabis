VThis is the fourth time I smoke marijuana. For the first three times, there were no significant effect on me. I almost felt nothing for the first two times, I smoked it on a pipe and I don&#39;t think my techniques were right. Anyway, the third time when I smoked it with my friend, I felt heavy-headed and pretty much that was all.\u000a\u000aHowever, this time, when I smoke it out of a bong, the effects were dramatic and out of this world. I was sitting in my room, around 6mins after my puffs. It hit me, hit me hard. All of sudden, I blanked out for 5 sec or less, then I came back and I almost forgot what I have done 3mins ago. It felt like I was in deep sleep except my mind was conscious. I was sitting in my room with music on, and everything seemed to slowed down, time was altered and everything was in slow motion. Then I laid on bed with my eyes closed, and I was in another world, I felt like there was electricity passing slowly through my body. It was weird, but somewhat enjoyable. I don&#39;t how long my high lasted, but I woke up 7 hours later, and I was WTF.

VAt first I am an over expressor of emotions and talk so much I forget about eating, and well get very anxious eating. Then thathatsollowed by the negativity in my head. Warmed up the machine took a puff and instantly no negativity but positivity replaced those thoughts. Instead of shying away from my objectives. Now I understand with happiness rather oh I have to do this or that. . This helps me feel better regardless of what my status of how I feel now, perfect for understanding and being happy in a world full of the negative chaos that we always see lol. Have a chill one with this strain if its hard for you to eat, due to a physical ailment or not it helps.

VYou know that Beatles song, &#39;Hello, goodbye&#39;? Well that about sums this up.\u000aI approached this delicious looking, plump nugget with the excited feeing of HELLO! and a smile on my face. This shapely, glistening lady tested at over 26% THC at The Greenhouse, a local and favorite of dispensary mine. Surely this beauty is bred to be one of their strongest strain, so carpe diem seasoned patrons!\u000aA very nice, light smelling flower with surprising results. Though my batch is light in aroma, it is still very pleasant smelling and smokes extremely well, especially considering the density of the trichomes. A few hits in and I could see the flower waving GOODBYE as I floated away.\u000a\u000aSo comfy now.\u000a\u000aThis is a good medical strain for those who sometimes don&#39;t have a choice but to be sofa-planted yet have a mind that still wants to wander the world. This bud will decide the winner of that inner-conflict for you.\u000a\u000aFirst timers and those still gaining experience might want to engage slowly and allow the effects to kick in one hit at a time as to not get overwhelmed or dizzy.

VI think anyone who compare this cannabis cup winner with regular smoke should realize they do not have the true Big Bud. Come on. Do you honestly think you have a true champion but it only is of Mexican brown quality. Its a great strain and sorry to.those who were screwed but research is key to get what you want. Don&#39;t purchase skunk 1 its extinct. Big Bud was a clone only strain so find out what male had been used to create the 50% Big Bud x ? .,I would want N. L. 5 or skunk 1 as the cross. Don&#39;t ever take a banks word for it it as it is a mistake!

VI got this one at a bargain price so I don&#39;t know how much care was taken in cultivating it.  I guess my review may be tainted with the quality of the buds themselves, but I tried it so I get to review it.\u000a\u000aIf I could use one word to sum up this smoke it is &quot;blah&quot;.  It just felt like I was smoking some kinder, gentler mids that somebody decided to name.  It does have a nice, sweet, lemony taste when smoked which is rather pleasant.  But the high itself was totally unremarkable.\u000a\u000aI ended up just giving most of this stuff away to some hard up friends and went for something with a little more of a distinct kick.  I would be quite sad if this were the only strain I had on hand.

I almost fell asleep after a couple of bong rips and  it gave me dry as duck eyes and a cotton mouth, what I didn&#39;t have from strains for a year or so.\u000a\u000aAlso be warned about the smell of this strain, it&#39;s just pure earthy as I couldn&#39;t find anything more in it and it smells HARD AS HELL. Had my room ventilated for 2 days to get away from this smell and the most other strains don&#39;t smell after a night of sleeping\u000a\u000aI really recommend this strain if you&#39;re a patient and need help falling asleep, wouldn&#39;t recommend it to the recreant user.

It&#39;s a pain reliever for sure, and it does need to be filled with food that&#39;s a side effect but overall a very nice relaxer.

VJust picked this up while traveling only tired it once so far but it was a nice time i plan to repeat. \u000a\u000aI used it in the evening vaporized at 365F. I experienced a nice mellow high no head rush or strange eye feel (im not fond of those), it was a very peaceful high. I wasnt worried, my mind was racing like usual, the inside of my head felt very peaceful. Body experienced some slight heaviness and very mild tingling as i upped the dose to try to help me sleep. \u000a\u000aIt didnt but me to sleep but my battery died so i stopped at 5 hits. I did sleep soundly though only woke once shortly rather then the usual 5 - 7 times a night. \u000a\u000aIm not to into flavor but its nothing impressive. The scent before vaping reminds me slightly of nail polish but not quite. Taste is pretty neutral i doubt many people will have an issue with it. \u000a\u000aIm a very light tolerance patient so for me i see this being a AM for anxiety in light doses and a good PM relaxation/movie night camp out on the couch in heavier doses.

VI like Big Bud. My dispensary has a $55 &#189;oz deal that changes every few days, and this is the most recent strain. I love the relaxation and the slow entry into the high, it&#39;s a very smooth transition. Oddly enough, it amplifies sound for me, which is unbearable because I can&#39;t sleep without music, but on Big Bud it&#39;s too loud to fall asleep, even on 2. So it&#39;s not for me personally, but a pretty good smoke all other things considered

VYam.. Food is so good with this strain. Also very relaxed and euphoric feeling. Good strain for chilling! Not too head high.. Little couchlock.. Same songs have been playing for a while, but i think you can use it for better things like reading, sleaping, chilling or something. Good strain if food doesn&#39;t taste for you or you suffer for depression, insomnia or stress :) There&#39;s better strains out, but i recommend if you get this!

VThis strain is great for the late night not only just for the early morning but, it helps me relax and refocus and melt that pain away. Very hard to find strains that don&#39;t couch lock me and overwhelm me. I am a light weight with a heavy tolerance, so it comes to me that; strains that don&#39;t couch lock, but provide pain relief and doesn&#39;t make me sleepy just relaxed. Great for days to sleep in or get your bearings strain either way it enhances your mood to the time of day.

VLet me qualify by saying this strain for me is a night time evening strain.  It is too much for me during the day...already like napping too much.  With that said I grew some HUGE plants in my back yard.  One of them was well over 10 feet tall.  I do understand why they say BIG BUD.  The buds become so heavy if you did not stake them the entire plant would probably just fall over from weight.  I got the variety tested at SC Labs in Southern CA.  My grew came in with just under 25% THC!  The bottom of my water tight barrel filled with crystal nuggets.  The smell is not that great.  That may have to do with my curing but it will knock you off your ASS.

VYam.. Food is so good with this strain. Also very relaxed and euphoric feeling. Good strain for chilling! Not too head high.. Little couchlock.. Same songs have been playing for a while, but i think you can use it for better things like reading, sleaping, chilling or something. Good strain if food doesn&#39;t taste for you or you suffer for depression, insomnia or stress :) There&#39;s better strains out, but i recommend if you get this!

VI like Big Bud. My dispensary has a $55 &#189;oz deal that changes every few days, and this is the most recent strain. I love the relaxation and the slow entry into the high, it&#39;s a very smooth transition. Oddly enough, it amplifies sound for me, which is unbearable because I can&#39;t sleep without music, but on Big Bud it&#39;s too loud to fall asleep, even on 2. So it&#39;s not for me personally, but a pretty good smoke all other things considered

VJust picked this up while traveling only tired it once so far but it was a nice time i plan to repeat. \u000a\u000aI used it in the evening vaporized at 365F. I experienced a nice mellow high no head rush or strange eye feel (im not fond of those), it was a very peaceful high. I wasnt worried, my mind was racing like usual, the inside of my head felt very peaceful. Body experienced some slight heaviness and very mild tingling as i upped the dose to try to help me sleep. \u000a\u000aIt didnt but me to sleep but my battery died so i stopped at 5 hits. I did sleep soundly though only woke once shortly rather then the usual 5 - 7 times a night. \u000a\u000aIm not to into flavor but its nothing impressive. The scent before vaping reminds me slightly of nail polish but not quite. Taste is pretty neutral i doubt many people will have an issue with it. \u000a\u000aIm a very light tolerance patient so for me i see this being a AM for anxiety in light doses and a good PM relaxation/movie night camp out on the couch in heavier doses.

VWIth this strain immediately within like 15 minutes my mind started off on a magic ride. It&#39;s definitely a space but as long as you ride the rollercoaster you can guide it where it needs to be. It&#39;s a pain reliever for sure, and it does need to be filled with food that&#39;s a side effect but overall a very nice relaxer.

VIts ok if you are a novice smoker or new grower. I would cross it with some other strain. In Vancouver, they have crossed BIG BUD with NL#5 and its called &quot;Baldy&quot;. I think that Baldy is better due to the high THC you get from NL#5. The result is an Indica/Sativa mix with a nice high. I then crossed it with some heavy duty Jamaican Sativa seeds I brought back from Negril. The result has been an extremely potent spacey cross that smells like Fruit Loops and gives you a soaring long lasting high.

VThis strain is legend, mainly to me because it can be mixed with almost anything and increase the yield a large amount. Most strains I have had with big bud I really don&#39;t notice huge smell change. It does have a little piney pungent smell ,but  it seems to be fairly easy to mix with anything that needs a little boost of size. I have had by itself. Huge buds. seems like thc probably about 12-15 thc. Nothing to strong just a nice happy go lucky day time smoke. I think I have an idea lets add big bud to god bud. Zues Bud or Phat Jesus OG.creative this strain I just had.

VVery Light green you can smell the sage and grass herbal smell through the bag. This stinky smelling green with red darkened pistols give the best stony high. It helps me with my appetite loss as it&#39;s a killer for that. It&#39;s a woody smoke which you don&#39;t get often with heavy hitters. Big time relaxer increases my thoughts for sleep. Taking away the pain can allow me to use yoga to stretch and get a good nights sleep on top of feeling happy in a blissful cerebral and painless with a full stomach it&#39;s great! Stress if your having that on an empty tummy! Tastes of wood and pungent textures can give you a dry mouth. It&#39;s a fast reacting strain if you need relief quickly or wish to eat more.\u000ahits my eyes with pressure relief, dreamy thoughts, medium thick vape at that 21%. I love it for all its medicinal purposes for anorexia/cachexia the happy feeling cozy comfort warmth that you can only get with certain strains. Not to many strains totally let me chill in a goofy positive way, most indicas still keep me guarded. No paranoia on this for me. 4 Solid Stars need a little less pepper/herbal to get more stars.

VBig bud got me feeling dizzy at first, but a comfortable dizzy. After I got really euphoric and just laughed at everything. At the end i got really tired and sleepy, and had a quite dry mouth. Still really good one, love it!\u000a

VThis strain punched my evening tension right in the face ! A very sedative and calming strain, with a skunky/pungent aroma that can be smelled across the room. The buds are of course known for being huge, but so is the relief !!!! The smoke is smooth, and didn&#39;t make me cough too much. I work with computers all day, and this strain really helped my eyes feel better, must be the awesome CBD percentage in it !! Two enthusiastic and happy thumbs up.

VGood bud, but not as good as many of these others on here. Smelled like pine needles in a dusty old attic. Tasted a bit spicy, the smoke was pretty harsh. The high is lazy and couchlocked, but has some trippy effects as well. I&#39;d recommend it for insomnia patients, but there are many other strains I&#39;d recommend first.

VI love big bud. I&#39;m still a relatively new cannabis smoker, but I&#39;ve tried several strains of different varieties to know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not. This will make you very tired, but it&#39;s a buzzy, happy high. Tastes better than most weed I&#39;ve had, and smokes well. Hits you hard and fast, and gives you a great night of sleep.

Vthe strain seems to get abit of stick for not having a wow factor but i believe all round it&#39;s a decent strain. strong, amazing yields , dense buds and doesn&#39;t have the odour of cheese at first glance but when you crack one of those buds the aroma is lovely. good for the inconspicuous  grower looking for large yields.

VI got this strain in a shatter and I loved it. It has great calming effects with our making you too sleepy. After about an hour or two of a very comfortable body high I drifted off to sleep and rested amazing. I just about murdered my fridge, this strain gave me super munchies\u000a

VI couldn&#39;t find any afghani so gave this a try. A little bit of a delay smoking it but then a very nice relaxing buzz. I&#39;ve tried other afghani variants like blueberry and wasn&#39;t impressed. This is probably my second favorite strain behind afghani. A good pain releiver and sleeper!
