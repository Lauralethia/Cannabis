VPrimarily a fan of sativa I thought I&#39;d mix it up and give this strain with such a demanding name a whirl. The flowers smell awesome and I was excited to spark this bud. First off the taste wasn&#39;t as expected, nothing really notable or something I would call good but it was descent. Typically I like strains that keep me motivated or interested in doing something. This put me in direct couch lock. Staring at the tv unaware of what I just watched the last 5 minutes of, torture to my dvr. That was only short lived until my eyes uncontrollably close and I drift off into a deep sleep. Like the description it works great for a good nights sleep and possible pains. I wouldnt list this as a good time bud because all it did for me was nighty night

VPleasant. Happy. Tired later, but it was a great hi for day also. If you wanna go you go, if you don&#39;t you can relax. Smoke can be harsh- just a tad. But tastes great.
