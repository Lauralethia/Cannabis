VAsa member of the ADHD club, it&#39;s been tough to find an indict heavy hybrid that can keep me (slightly) clear with the pain and stress relief I need.\u000a\u000aFace off OG is an all star. I find myself feeling refreshed and renewed and find the stoning to be a lengthy one. Gem. Fire.

VAfter getting my eye busted open and letting it heal for a day, I found myself in need of a painkiller/sleep aid. I went to Cannadaddys and picked up a dub of this strain. \u000a\u000aI immediately noticed the pungent ground type smell from this accompanied by a slight lemony citrus taste. \u000a\u000aafter smoking I would say I noticed that the little pain I had from my eye was completely gone. i was slightly dizzy but not in a bad way (more of a serious zone-out headspace.) About 30 minutes in I also noticed that I had some serious issues keeping awake. \u000a\u000aAll n all I would say this bud is great for that &quot;zoned&quot; type of feeling. its very relaxing and will take your FACE OFF. &#128513; Try it and enjoy.

VI am a high tolerance user.  I will smoke 1/8 of Gdp and be buzzed.  Now, Face Off OG is an entirely different story.  I just smoked a small bowl and half.  This strain is a slight creeper but once it hits....wow!  Smooth in...smooth out.  Flavor, smell, experience all are awesome.  This strain takes pain to the cage and submits it.  THIS is my ONLY strain from now on.

VFaceoff OG is really a must try! I can&#39;t pin down the taste, but typical kush taste with a twist of lite citrus and a slight nutty taste. My batch is a little dryer then I would like. Anyways, 5 puffs on my Pax 2 and I started to feel it right behind the eyes, my neck relaxed, and just went into deep thoughts. If you meditate before bed this would be the perfect co-pilot!

VLove this strain, had it in the concentrated form shatter.  This I was told is great for insomnia, pain and just a wind go to heavy duty indica, and let me say they were dead on!!!! Wonderful OG flavour citrus and pine, in a wonderful terpenoid profile.  I save it for special occasions mainly for when I need sleep, but I&#39;ve also had several crosses with a backbone of something x face off OG and all crosses I&#39;ve had are amazing, each a treasure to behold each different but each wonderful to partake!  Grab you a slab if you come across this treasure you&#39;ll be happy you did!  Wonderful for anyone looking for a heavy indica with a nice cerebral buzz as well not racy just nice and euphoric

VFace-Off OG had me smiling from the moment I opened the bottle and took my first breathe.  This Indica dominant strain is everything you would expect from an OG. Potent, sweet and floral flavors and aromas eminate from this strain. With dense buds covered in trichomes Faceoff OG is a sight to see, smell and inhale. This strain definitely does not disappoint. I got so high I did the whole hand on face.... face off... thing &#128521; Enjoy budz!

It hits hard &amp; beautifully, makes me dizzy if I overdo, but it\u2019s strong as hell &amp; wonderful. I thank the creators of this!

Tested at around 22% THC and a nice terpene profile including limonene and pinene, and 1.25% myrcene. \u000a\u000aI&#39;ve recently began an antibiotic cycle due to a persistent bacterial infection. The antibiotics completely jacked my stomach and caused extreme and persistent nausea. I finally had to leave work and medicate with Face Off OG. The nausea immediately subsided and stayed that way for a few hours. \u000a\u000aGreat A+ strain for nausea, depression and just feeling better about yourself.

VI love this strain, a little harsher than some others and sometimes its tough to get the last bits of flower to burn but gives me a good body and head high as well as relaxing. Feels like my energy is being slowly pulled upwards, really awesome.

VThis is a must try for those seeking a heavy hitting Indica. The high THC count made the experience very relaxing. The smoke was fairly smooth, coughed a little. The aroma was very earthy/pine with strong citrus flavors in the smoke. Had a nice pain relieving effect as well.

VThis was an incredible strain for me!  The smell was very inviting- pungent, earthy and a bit flowery.  The flower had a ton of trichomes with greenish and purple hues all over. \u000a\u000aI picked this up for my insomnia and it worked like clockwork.  After a about three or four hits from my Haze V3 vaporizer, I was ready for a nice deep slumber for the evening.  It also helped with my constant lower back pain, bonus! I got a solid eight hours of sleep and felt like a million bucks the next morning! :) \u000a\u000aIf I ever come across this strain again, it&#39;s an instant purchase!  Highly recommend!

VFace off did not disappoint.  Great body feel.  Joint and muscle pain all minimized. Euphoric mental state.  Taste great in the vaporizer, like earthy lemons.  Most OG varietals have this profile.  One of my favorites for sure.

VWOW!!! This strain knocked me on my ass!!! Went straight to my head and eventually making its way to the rest of my body. Don&#39;t expect to be productive for awhile, kept me on the couch for a couple hours. Very piney with slight earthy/grass taste. Easily one of my top 10 strains...Awesome stuff!!!\u000a\u000a\u000a

VThis strain is great! \u000aHowever, it needs to be rinsed. When you&#39;re smoking some bud, an OG Smoker like myself shouldn&#39;t be coughing after half a hit, lol. You can, indeed, taste the difference. Other than that this bud had everything I was looking for. 9/10.
