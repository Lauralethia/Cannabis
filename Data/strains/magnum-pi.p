VThis strain is a cross between Blue Hawaiian and Agent Orange. It has a very strong tropical orange aroma and sweet, mild flavor. Unique in every respect, one of my new favorites.

VTreehawk farms has a magnum pi that tastes like oranges and grapefruit. Looks tight frosty and bright. Got me talkative, euphoric, and uplifted. Slight anxiety but not to bad. Decent effects. Great taste though. I wouldn\u2019t get again.\u000a\u000aI recommend this for day use and activities.

VI dont know anything about any company called Seahorse, but i can tell you this strain was  created by a friend of mine name Ray.  I had an Agent Orange seed i cracked from an old TGA pack back in like 2010.  It turned out to be a monster phenome (but with a greasy orange smell that i didnt like, like gas station soap) so Ray took it and meticulously crossed it with blue hawaiian. He then picked a bunch of good looking seeds.  Keeping each one seperately tagged, and over several runs, chose the best one, which is the wonderful magnum PI we have today.  I still have it.  It was never crossed back on itself as far as i remember and has always been a little unstable.  Its an expert level grow too; very hard to get right and to get good yield. But when you hit the sweet spot it has huge yield and beautiful nutty orange citrus nugs.  If you do it just right it turns kinda white with orange highlights. High energy.  One of my all time favorites. Anyone who tells you they created this strain, and not named Ray, is a godman liar and you can tell them so. Lol

VNot a bad strain, however didn&#39;t give me the buzz my Dispensary told me it would. For a Sativa it did make me a little drowzy.
