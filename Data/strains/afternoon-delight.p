VThird best I&#39;ve ever had. (First is tangerine dream, second is moui woui and third is this.) really strong, very floral and herbal smell (like dried rosemary) and the cerebral high is killer. You need a little more to get super fucked but it&#39;s really good.

VExcellent strain, just make some room on your favorites list. Very potent, early onset coupled with latent effects. Taste good and smokes well

VI really enjoyed this strain of weed, one of my personal favorites. I got a nice relaxing high and got hella munchies with it. This strain is perfect for a relaxing day outside. If you come across Afternoon Delight I highly recommend it.

VI had the concentrate, crumble specificly. At 85% thc its not for a novice. A great vanilla spicy flavor and immediate heady high. Alsmost like another dimension. Lol visual stimulation for sure. Get strain for a stressful day as all thoughts become nonsensical lol its definitely top shelf strong sativa leaning /indica hybrid.

VI get this strain for $14.99 an eighth at my dispensary without complaining about a few seeds. \u000aWhat I get is a superb price but a very mellow and sluggish kind of high. I&#39;m not one to complain about weed that works but this gets me tired. With 0% cbd and the name of the strain I expected different.

VIt is an excellent hybrid that brings a great and soothing head high while also relaxing any racing thoughts as well as your body. It&#39;s good for afternoon, morning, and evening, in my opinion.
