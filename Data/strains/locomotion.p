VNote to self: do not smoke this strain again when you have anything you need to accomplish. Taking a few draws of this on the Pax was like ordering a Bud and then realizing you&#39;d drunk a Bigfoot. VERY high-school like buzz, felt a bit silly. Peaked in about 45 minutes, then hung there for an hour or so. Came home and listened to the radio for a bit, which was where this strain really hit its stride. Very nice groove if you&#39;re resting with no pressure. If the difference between Lemon Haze and Locomotion is the difference between Sativa and Indica, I understand now. Only take two pulls at a time of this next time.

VLM has a very pleasant high: medium-level, whole-body euphoria, which is just slightly eclipsed by its relaxing, narcotic-type effects. I can function very, very well externally\u2014while under a blanket of internal peace and happiness. \u000a\u000aLM definitely feels Indica-leaning, but it\u2019s not too sedative (at least for my high tolerance).\u000a\u000a8/10

VLineage: Blue Diesel x Timewreck \u000aMove on over the locomotion is coming through! With a unique fruity and fuely taste this strain will keep on going for a long-lasting high. Sour smelling complimented by hints of fruits and a pungent skunkiness on the nose. Locomotion makes you talk, along with giving you a euphoric relaxing happy high that does unfortunately come with a note dry mouth (which is worth the relaxation).  Medicinally, Locomotion is the perfect strain for depression, stress, appetite stimulation and stomach ailments, anxiety, and pain management.

VRight when you smell this strain you can pick up the diesel smell. Definitely wrap it well because it will smell up wherever you&#39;re ate before smoking. That being said the smoke is heady and potent. I&#39;ve had this in every form. Flower, shatter and kief. It will relax you and help with pain. I get an excellent nights sleep. A dab of this is strong enough to last me four or five hours. It&#39;s really tasty and makes you feel like jelly.

VStrain is very powerful. I am a veteran smoker and a couple rips and this stuff gets me toasted. Some pros: Euphoric, happy,  great for being social. Some cons: made my heart race (more then I think I ever had off of any other strain), Paranoia. Been smoking it steady for a few days and it is the same outcome every toke.
