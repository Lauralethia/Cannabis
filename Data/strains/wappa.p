VThis is the definition of a HYBRID. I like this strain even more than GSC. First off the FLAVOUR..wow what a beautiful sweet smell and taste. Effect wise expect to feel the indica body effects but your mind will still be somewhat cloudy. Expect to sit and giggle at the wall

VSmoked this for the first time last night.  I got it from Local Amsterdam in Longview, WA.   Let me start out by saying this weed smells very sweet, and somewhat creamy.  I got a lot of flavor off my bong, I grind all my weed and this was super smooth.  Rolled a blunt too, this was sticky weed so rolling up was easy, really smooth smoke.  Total chill mode with this strain.  Slight head high not as much as I would expect from a 60/40.  I didn&#39;t really get the munchies but my dinner was more satisfying.  I would buy this stuff again for sure, just if I didn&#39;t have too much to do.

VFirst review, it was that good. Smoked the flower in a bubbler. You can taste the pine earthy flavor. Amazing. Instant tension in muscles release. Happy, calm but focused high. Heavy body high and potent. Not for first time users. Ceberal high as well but not like a zombie just deep into whatever it is you are doing. Love it for lazy afternoon into evening smoke.

VWARNING: THIS STRAIN CAUSES TRIPS AND DELUSIONS IF USED  EXCESSIVELY! \u000aIm a heavy user not spending a day without it for a few months. Every strain people talk about I tried and it was nothing as crazy as what the said it would be.  This is my experience doing it the past weekend In crazy amounts. I was at home when I took out this masterpieces. I took a few toaks and I just felt relaxed. I didn\u2019t have any visuals or anything so i did some more. I thought it was another strain that doesn\u2019t do anything but I was wrong. Sat on the couch and my vision was in HD. Took 15 minutes to kick in and hit me like an edible. Every thing had this light green look to it. I started laughing at the tv that wasn\u2019t on. While I was laghing I had time distortions so I thought I was laghing for infinite time.  My brain kept looping like I was doing the same thing over and over for hours. DO NOT USE WHEN TRYING TO LOOK SOBER! I kept smoking this every hour all day. At points I thought my tv was connected to the frequency of my brain waves. I\u2019m going to write another review about the other day I tripped on it.

VMan Wappa I love how this strain makes me feel because it is definitely a unique high. The grower for the wappa I had is Sonic Green and I think they have my favorite version of this. The THC was 23% and is listed as a hybrid I would say it leans slightly indica. \u000a\u000aThe body high feels like it is on my skin in a good way like i&#39;m walking around with a light pulsing force field. I feel confident and low stress when I have this strain. I can still get things done and am happy to talk with friends or strangers.\u000a\u000aThe taste had a good flowery rose sweet tropical flavor. Love this stuff.

VI was at the Vancouver 420, not intending to buy any bud but just enjoying the scene, when I smelled the most heavenly weed stank coming from a large stall. I looked at their menu and saw \u201cstrawberry ice\u201d and decided to get an eighth (the price was good) after hooking me up the lady at the counter recommended Wappa. She might think she talked me into it, but I knew as soon as I smelled this one I had to try her. \u000a\u000aThis is the fruitiest smelling weed I\u2019ve ever encountered, a bright, zesty fragrance, like mango or pineapple, and marvelously sweet. \u000a\u000aBut how does she smoke? Amazing. \u000aSmooth and sweet, with a fruity twist both intriguing and delightful. I thought at first she had a very weak body high and not much else, but then I noticed the strong sativa head high. \u000aJust like the lady at the stall said, she goes both ways. Sit and chill, get up and move, she relaxes you without clouding your mind.  \u000aI feel like she might make you paranoid if your prone to that, though. \u000a\u000aI can\u2019t call her the best I\u2019ve had, and her stone is not what I typically look for, but I must admit that her uniqueness is a delight.

V17% thc .07 cbd. 40% sativa 60% indica. Smells of light lemon,chia tea and deisel. Tastes sweeter the more you smoke. Has an interesting light perfume taste. \u000aThe first 5 minutes feels a little tingly. You get nice visuals. It&#39;s kind of like a sober high. I smoked a bowl and I don&#39;t feel couch locked, just relaxed and not drowsy. A little spacy and I interested in things. Takes away my anxiety and makes me giggle. Smooth cloud lifts you slowly down as you sober up. Not to burnt out afterward.

VWappa is a hybrid that acts like a huge magic symptom eraser. Anxiety? Pain? No problem. \u000a\u000aIt doesn&#39;t smell bad either. It&#39;s scent reminds me of chamomile tea with a mild musky tone that is floral instead of pungent.\u000a\u000aDefinitely more medical in terms of it&#39;s effects. It does a great job of allowing pain to be managed while working on other priorities.

VSo I just want to get the fact out of the way that this was the first bud that I can legitimately write a review about because today was my first time to a medicinal dispensary.\u000a\u000aNow buckle up.\u000a\u000aI instantly fell in love when I opened my bag of this incredibly sexy bud. You know that feeling you get in the back of your knees when someone is whispering all fucking heavy and talking all dirty and shit in your ear? That shit happened when I unsealed my bag and the scent hit me.\u000a\u000aSo me and boolove had a little photoshoot before I ground her up. Sexy bitch. Shit ton of dark ass orange hairs with lighter orange mini hairs and looked like they&#39;re tossing sugar on the buds before packing it up the cloudy ass trichomes looking like a thousand gypsy&#39;s Crystal Ball&#39;s falling down some sick ass Amazon jungle temple pyramid on fire and shit.\u000a\u000aThen we got intimate. I packed up my glass piece I call Woot. Sweet baby Jesus. Listen. Smooth. Sweet. and I&#39;m not saying she doesn&#39;t hit hard. What I will tell you is it&#39;s a quick and steady but extremely comfortable Ascension to elevation. Like how Superman must feel after he takes off with Louis Lane in his arms; Sure he flies all the time but with her it makes it special.\u000a\u000aThat being said if you haven&#39;t tried this strain you really need to.

VI just took a dab of this and it&#39;s nice. Right at the back of the mind I can feel a little anxiousness creeping up but it seems to literally only be the initial intruding, because as I write this it has dissipated..I now feel pretty positive.  A nice Happy high..

Vit is a verry strain, it is not verry strong bus you will get a fun high. its a verry lazy high but i think eceryone will enjoy it. it looks dark green with some brown in it. it will give you a strong appetite and your focus is almost gone.

VHmmm. Wappa...I was thinking this one would Wappa me upside the head. Its more of a genital nudge. Nope, its more of a body high. Loose head. Its a Hybrid but indica-dominant, so easy does it. Or sleepyland awaits. Nothing worse than shelling out cash to get your buzz on, only to wake up 4 hours later, with cotton mouth and a head full of nothing. Would be good if you were reluctant on the psychedelics of MJ but wanted a decent pain relief.
