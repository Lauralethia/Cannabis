VI got the CBD variant from Starbuds Kelowna. This stuff works very, very well on pain. It handled my breakthrough pain like a champ, and helped a bit with my sore back too. \u000a\u000aHead-wise, it&#39;s a clear-headed high; you don&#39;t have to worry about being clouded on this stuff unless you take a high dose. It did make me a little anxious when I smoked a lot of it in one sitting, but that&#39;s easily avoided by smoking less! You don&#39;t need a lot with this stuff.\u000a\u000aThe nose is very nice. It smells like lemons and sweet bread with earthy tones. It tastes basically how it smells.

VKeeps you cool and calm just like Jamaica. A stoney, steady high but definitely mellow. Very uplifting, fun, and completely functional if a bit sleepy towards the end. Mellow yellow indeed.

VThis gave me the best I&#39;ve ever had. Right off the bat my body felt light and happy. My arms felt sorta tingly but my whole body was relaxed almost instantly. My mind felt clear and ready to focus on whatever I threw at it. It wasn&#39;t foggy or an &quot;oh shit I&#39;m really high&quot; kind of high, and I smoked quite a bit (out of a bong). I just felt very at ease and SUPER confident and open minded and was totally anxiety free. I&#39;ve been looking for a strain to help me with anxiety and this is it. I smoked this about 4-5 hours before I went to bed and woke up with a head ache, that could have been from the weed or just me in general cause headaches are common for me but that&#39;s the only thing I could pin point that I didn&#39;t like and I don&#39;t even know if it was from the weed. I will definitely be getting this again soon. \u000a

VThis is a wonderful uplifting but non-anxious sativa. Great for beating the blues on cloudy days and also probably  helpful in helping to treat full-on depression (you would use other tools to treat it as well, ideally).  And I love that this Sativa has a good bit of CBD in it as well. The buds I tried were 6% CBD and 10% THC. It has a really decent but chill head trippy buzz even with that little THC. I guess I&#39;m trying to say: it&#39;s quite euphoric but not in a zippy anxious must do everything at once overwhelming kind of high that I experience with a lot of Sativas and Hybrids.\u000aThe taste and smell are sweet and tropical and a little skunky. I love it!

VThis stuff does wonders on pain. It handles my breakthrough pain like a champ and keeps my baseline lower. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s a very clear-headed high; you don&#39;t have to worry about being non-functional on this stuff unless you take too high of a dose.\u000a\u000aI got a little bit anxious when I smoked too much, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for someone with anxiety.
