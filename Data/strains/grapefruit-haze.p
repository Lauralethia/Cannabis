VGood for a wake and bake, energetic and euphoric long lasting high. Very pungent grapefruit &amp; citrusy smell, decent amount of orange hairs. Smoke is a fruity &amp; citrus taste.

VNot sure why but up here in Vancouver when I bought this for the fifth or sixth time it was completely changed from the taste to the effects. It now tastes like pepper and looks really premature and smells nothing like it use to. I blame myself for not looking at it first. Even the effects were gone it use to make me very talkative and active and it did nothing but burn me out.\u000aI got it from the Cannaclinic Medicinal Society on commercial. I let them know and they were  going to look in to it.

VOne of my favorite strains.\u000aPositives: It is a high THC level, and tends to be cheaper than the rest.  Lasts a long time.\u000aNegatives: Joint does not burn smoothly and it goes out multiple times.  It is also a bit harsh on the throat to smoke. All that aside, this is strong and lasts a long time. 25 years of experience, and I would rank this side by side any other strain.

VGrapefruit haze has to be one of the best tasting strains I&#39;ve ever had! The name is true to its taste, a tangy inhale, and nothing but a sweet bliss of Grapefruit on exhale. The taste of fresh Grapefruit lingers in your mouth even after the high wears off.... The high is good too, definitely not the best but there is no sleepy come down what&#39;s so ever

VIf I had more money, I would have bought the store carrying this fantastic strain, out! It has a rich flavor, lemony fruity and is almost sour. Smells as good. Loved it! If weed could be a funny comedienne, this strain would take top prize. I found many things humorous and was quite funny. Felt happy and playful and didn&#39;t want to wash the smell off my hands...ever! :) \u000aMain thing with suggesting strains to people is that you have to get it from a place that has proved again and again that they have access to really good weed. I learned the hard way, a strain-name means almost nothing if the growers weren&#39;t ideal.
