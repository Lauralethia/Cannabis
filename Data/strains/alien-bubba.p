VThanks to Zach at The Herbal Care Center for recommending this excellent strain to me. After a hard day at work, I gave Alien Bubba a try, and I instantly felt so relaxed, but not zombie-like. Definitely great to unwind with but still be able to concentrate and keep focus.

VReally beautiful strain. Great for meditations and manifesting positivity. Would be perfect for watching a meteor shower, painting / doing something creative that doesn\u2019t require lots of physical energy. Doesn\u2019t knock you out but is definitely cozy. Decent pain relief without making you feel weighed down. Not a cloudy indica but definitely a borderline psychedelic one. I love this strain.

VRecently received some of this strain in a cartridge (made by Cresco) and the flavor was great (Cresco carts live resin carts always have great flavor) and it worked very well. I use it for insomnia and it certainly took care of that! Downside, is I did wake up later with a dry mouth. Took a drink and another hit and went back to bed.

VGREAT GREAT body &amp; head buzz, leaves you calm and cheerful and very high (pretty much out of commission). Fantastic for neuropathy, pain, anxiety, depression, and to a lesser extent insomnia.  Great bonus is a strong erotic influence :) I have tried over a dozen strains since I got cancer and this is far and away the best for me. Have used this as pre-rolls, buds, wax &amp; cartridge. They are all great, but the wax is just phenomenal. I use the wax with a Muad-Dib Concentrate Box. The only strains I now use are Alien Bubba in the evenings, and very occasionaly Harle-Tsu or Mari Mints (CBD) during the day. Thank you very much, breeder Cali Connections.

VSuper dank. The Bubba lineage was apparent with the first toke. The flavor was what you&#39;d expect from good Bubba mixed with a subtle herbal sweetness. \u000a\u000aThe high was a bit of a creeper. Once it kicked in it was super relaxing and laid back with a nice head and body high. Personally wasn&#39;t to sleepy or couch locked but definitely some sedation going on. I&#39;ve also enjoyed mixing this with some Jack Herer during the day time hours.

VAlien Bubba - I get a very earthy and grassy and vegetable like smell from this strain. I take a small amount first. I feel my body begin to relax and I mean my muscles &#128170; truly relax. After a long day of flying and traveling feels nice. After a couple minutes I feel my mind go into a. Super relaxed state and the music &#127932; sounds better and I feel an inner peace \u262e\ufe0f Lovely mind and body effects. I\u2019m just so relaxed I don\u2019t even really think I\u2019m used to this as I have an actually s i\u2019m just so relaxed I don\u2019t even really think I\u2019m used to this as I have an actually used flower in 2 years. I\u2019m actually personally extremely used to them much more concentrated version is whether that be in a wax form or in a cartridge form it\u2019s kind of a much cleaner experience in this definitely brings on a more heavy experience and when I say cleaner I don\u2019t mean the herb is dirty lol just honestly a totally different experience feels like old time vibes. I like it. Heavy. A second load of the vape and I\u2019m done \u2705 &#128175; Wow euphoric relaxation is here and in my face! Lovely strain from CrescoLabs and CY+ much love family. Enjoy and medicate responsibly \u2764\ufe0f

VThis strain similar to Katsu Bubba is a tasty treat from CRESCO and TERRA VIDA.The Live Resins cartridges are so tasty n loaded with terpenes and all that good stuff. I did notice a serious difference in taste adjusting temp on Vape Pen...keep it at 2.0v-2.5 after that it seemed to have a slight burnt taste.\u000aVery comforting,, perfect for socializing, or just relaxing &#128524; \u000aA great cartridge to enjoy at th end of a hard day or take some Harlequin or AC/DC and this is a good strain filled with goodies to give yourself the full effect.\u000aThree to four hits n you\u2019ll have a nice mellow high  , I noticed extra pain today and realIed the pain was froma damp windy day...so I hit it a total of 10 hits and this tasty treat quickly goes to work n calm your nerves.....\u000a( try a little iREMEDI extra strength topical rub n u,ll b good)\u000a\u000aTerra Vida does a nice job of mixing up vendors BEST products and offering the best to,there patients. Talking with your budtender will certainly ensure you leave with what ya came for.\u000aA nice strain to keep for those walks with the dog, watching birds, .......as long as there\u2019s no pain....ITS A GREAT DAY!!\u000a\u000aAlso my wife has MS n this was the perfct strain to boost her AC/DC....\u000a\u000aPeace\u000aVoodoo Idol
