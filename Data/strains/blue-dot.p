VBlue Dot, on a Happy 4/20! Fantastic Genetics! White Widow crossed with NL #5, and some Skunk and Big Bud? Oh Baby, absolutely outstanding, and highly recommend. Got a great cut of this at 20% THC, and some terrific pain relief also. Berry and fruity smell and flavor, with some creeper qualities that last accordingly. Very smooth, and well worth the donation, ENJOY!!

VI read the reviews of this strain and seen the photos, and I am convinced people are getting this strain mixed up. Some reviewer stated he created the strain and his name was &quot;Dot&quot;. Maybe he did, but I can say 100% that it was a medical club strain. Anybody who went to the bay clubs in 99 an 2000 have seen it. I bought it frequently. It was sold in a fancy prepackaged white tin labeled Farmacy, and had a blue garage sale sticker dot on each tin so you knew what strain it was. They also had a much less popular yellow dot tin. Regardless, it was a sativa with looser nugs, moderatley crystally, slightly pungent, extremely smooth, very well cured. Looking back, I honestly think the quality was in how well it was grown and cured. If I had to compare to a well known strain I would say super silver haze. Definitely smooth stoney herb if you can get the real thing. I gave up years ago.

VI purchased Blue Dot from a dispensary in Los Angeles, on La Brea Blvd, The Yellow House, back in 2003-2010,(approximately), before they were shut down for tax evasion), and it was always a big deal when Blue Dot hit the scene.\u000a\u000aEveryone wanted the Blue Dot! I remember the smell as sweet and the taste as quite pleasant.\u000a\u000aThe effect was more sativa, I remember, but the overall experience was great.\u000a\u000aI have not seen Blue Dot for sale anywhere since the Yellow House days, but would be a happy guy if available again.

VDefinitely one of the best high&#39;s I&#39;ve ever experienced. The dispensary I bought it at is also always out of stock because their employees can&#39;t get enough of it either! Gives you lots of laughs and is super relaxing, so it helps with my anxiety, and by the time my high is gone, it becomes more sedative and helps you ease in to sleep so well.

VI have smoked a lot of good stuff since the mid to late 90s in So. cal area but I would never forget smoking blue dot which my friend got as a medical marijuana in the early 2000s. It got me so high to the point where I felt I was smoking for the first time all over again. As other people have described, it is a very hard hitting sativa with cerebral and uplifting effects. I haven&#39;t tried since but I have never forgotten.
