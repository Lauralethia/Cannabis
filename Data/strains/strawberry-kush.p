VIm like a kid in a candy store today,stawberry cough and Strawberry Kush concentrates! The Strawberry Kush is beautiful and gives of oddly delicious fruity/piney smell. After hitting my rig, the taste was intensified, with a strong berry/piney kush taste that you want to keep on tasting. The effects were very balanced, untill i did 3  rips in a 20min period. I did feel couch lock setting in. Very relaxing with a non social introspective head high.

VUnique bright smell. Lovely sweet taste. Strong. Penetrating effects that wiped away stress and anchored me down to become deeply lost in what I was doing. Put a real smile on my face.\u000a\u000aPROS: Delicious, very dense, quite potent, penetrates body, mellowing effects, noticeable euphoric effects, sleepy\u000a\u000aCONS: Oddly alternating from A.D.D. to ability to focus, dry eyes, dry mouth (but milk worked well for that), lost in the woods feeling, sleepy

VVery strawberry.  I asked a non-smoker, they said it smelled like strawberry with something else.  To me it wasn&#39;t quite that strong, although with lower tolerances one can more than likely get quite &#39;Medicated&#39;.  This strain has a very pleasant taste and smell, very strawberry like as well.  This is a good indica, but it lacks in strength for me.  Overall, it may cause couch lock to low tolerances, adding a partial sativa/strong sativa strain afterward I think complements it well.

VStrawberry Kush! The ultimative sativastrain.\u000aSo I went to Barcelona with my class, a friend of mine said I should come over to his place before the departure to Barcelona. Then I smoked 3 hits from this strain. First of all: the taste and the smell were both heavily berry like. Also a bit sweet. \u000aMy friend and me then went to our bus straight to Barcelona. I already felt a constant flash when jumping out of the car. I was really happy when we finally sat inside the bus. The first hour was totally crazy, my field of view and the sounds became kinda hectic, its hard to explain. I felt like im moving back and forth with my head and the sound too. Also the only important thing were the seats of me and my friend everything surrounding was kind of black and white. We talked alot of stuff there and I only can remember that total high that lasted for 3-4h. This strain is fucking beast! I recommend smoking it carefully if you are not a heavy smoker, because as you just heard its pretty potent.\u000a-sheepysmoke\u000a

VI&#39;ve had Strawberry Kush probably more than any other strain and it is definitely a good strain, but since there is little to no head high, the feeling isn&#39;t the best; but I still enjoy the body high and it is a greatly euphoric feeling, it would be great to sit down and watch a trippy movie or something like that. 8/10.

VHybrid with 75% Sativa; gives a good head-high. Causes quite a bit of paranoia and probably not the strand for those with anxiety, but for those without, the paranoia is manageable and you will still feel happy and raised most of the time. Hits quite quickly and is a bit strong. Will cause dry eyes and dry mouth along with making you a bit Dazed &amp; Confused, but still creates quite a happy and HIGH high (You&#39;ll be flying). May help with some depression, but wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the #1 strain to deal with it. Not for anxiety, but could help with insomnia as it makes you sleepy. Seems to be good for creativity and the imagination, along with keeping focused. Smells and tastes fucking amazing, like sweet creamy Kush. The come-down my cause slight headache. Would recommend to most people.

Vthis was my first homegrow attempt (from seed, despite the &quot;clone only&quot; warning). they turned out WAY better than i anticipated! a great, easy, &amp; very fun grow for the first time. it seems to have a reputation for forgiving hardiness. it definitely held in there despite my missteps!\u000a\u000aas for smoking/eating/vaping:\u000a\u000amost reviews are spot on for me, especially terms like &quot;sleepy&quot; and &quot;horny&quot;.\u000a\u000ait lets the body do the talking by default. it doesn&#39;t give true couch lock in my opinion because i can mentally convince myself out of sleepiness if it feels important. the mind remains sharp, creative, &amp; engaged, so it doesn&#39;t make me dumb high at all. it just... makes me want to fuck and sleep!

VThis is what I like about strawberry kush: You smell it and it smells like strawberrys, you smoke it and it smokes super smooth with a sweet fruity flavor with an earthy aftertaste. Super potent. Amazing. The high is for extreme cases of insomnia as it will put you in a extreme kush state that hopelesslyends with a deep intense and refreshing sleep. 4.5/5

VA cost-effective option, but didn&#39;t get anything resembling strawberry in smell or taste.  I found the high to balance me out evenly (not overly euphoric or too heady), so felt a bit short changed.  It&#39;s a perfectly fine strain, but as a naturally mellow and introverted person, its not generally what I&#39;m looking for when I smoke.\u000a\u000aStrawberry Kush&#39;s biggest strength is that it&#39;s really great for sex.  I wouldn&#39;t say it *makes* you horny necessarily, but it definitely makes things more sensitive during, the orgasms more intense and slows you down to a pace where you&#39;re cognizant of everything physically. Given it&#39;s affordable price, I think I&#39;ll keep some around for that very reason, but it&#39;s not an every day staple in my weed diet.

VI actually just grew this unbelievable strain. They flowered for 9 weeks before I harvested. Let them dry and cure out for about 3 weeks before I tried it... not only is this the most interesting strain taste wise, the high is unreal. Through a bong, this strain literally tastes like hashy earthy strawberries with that pungent kush. (My seeds were strawberry cough x OG kush). The high is very well balanced. It starts in your head and then slowly but surely makes its way to your whole body, mind and body numbing. 10/10 on this strain and man was she fun to grow.

VNice subtle taste but the cut of this like other PNW strains is a bit less dense than what I&#39;m particularly fond of.  First time trying any of the strawberry lineage and while I enjoy the flavor it is in fact subtle.  Nice joint weed, rolled a few and saw a synth pop band, had a really good time.  Definitely an indica heavy blend in my batch, but seems very balanced ratio.  I did enjoy it as a hybrid versus the typical indica hybrids which still stick you down.  Wish it were more dense, wish it had candy like taste.

VThis strain tasted like wood chips smell like.  Leafly gives a good jab at describing it as &quot;musky&quot; being a more positive leaning considering patchouli is a nice spicy version.  A bit ranker on the scale would be armpits which can go either way as for attraction.  Strawberry Kush is wet cardboard box musky with a high that is just as flimsy.  The flower structure was nothing short of fabulous with big fluffy light greenish yellow hued buds woven together with orange haired perfection.  Def pretty.

VTook this on an Friday evening, alone in Amsterdam waiting for my connection flight to leave the next day. Plan was to party the night through. After hitting some puffs from a pure this strain knocked me out big time. Got a little panicky and ended up sleeping in the airport laying on a counter. \u000aI had a very intense head high with my body all super warm especially my central chest feeling like it&#39;s burning.\u000aIf not consumed in a situation like this, it might be a very chill thing. The shop I bought it from said it was mostly sativa, that&#39;s why I bought it.

It put me right there in the movie, the potent mellow gluing me to my seat and the high making me believe magic is real. I prefer straight sativas but this hybrid gave me the benefits of both in an easy compromise, busy head, relaxed body. Tastes nice, smokes nice, and makes you feel REAL nice.

The flavor is amazing if you happen to roll a blunt (still tasty if you smoke it in another way). It\u2019s really sweet tasting and the aroma is amazing. The nugs have a nice gold/green color with red hairs and they\u2019re super dense if grown properly. Definitely a favorite of mine, pick it up if you have the chance.

VThis strain tasted like wood chips smell like.  Leafly gives a good jab at describing it as &quot;musky&quot; being a more positive leaning considering patchouli is a nice spicy version.  A bit ranker on the scale would be armpits which can go either way as for attraction.  Strawberry Kush is wet cardboard box musky with a high that is just as flimsy.  The flower structure was nothing short of fabulous with big fluffy light greenish yellow hued buds woven together with orange haired perfection.  Def pretty.

First time trying any of the strawberry lineage and while I enjoy the flavor it is in fact subtle.  Nice joint weed, rolled a few and saw a synth pop band, had a really good time.  Definitely an indica heavy blend in my batch, but seems very balanced ratio.  I did enjoy it as a hybrid versus the typical indica hybrids which still stick you down.  Wish it were more dense, wish it had candy like taste.

VA cost-effective option, but didn&#39;t get anything resembling strawberry in smell or taste.  I found the high to balance me out evenly (not overly euphoric or too heady), so felt a bit short changed.  It&#39;s a perfectly fine strain, but as a naturally mellow and introverted person, its not generally what I&#39;m looking for when I smoke.\u000a\u000aStrawberry Kush&#39;s biggest strength is that it&#39;s really great for sex.  I wouldn&#39;t say it *makes* you horny necessarily, but it definitely makes things more sensitive during, the orgasms more intense and slows you down to a pace where you&#39;re cognizant of everything physically. Given it&#39;s affordable price, I think I&#39;ll keep some around for that very reason, but it&#39;s not an every day staple in my weed diet.

VThis strain is something else i must say. Not only does it arrouse your sex drive, you also tend to get madly tired and exhausted. Taste wonderful. Make sure you dont eat anything to flavorful or you wont be able to taste the strawberry after taste. Has a slight harsh burn. For a sativa based im so in love with this strain.

VTook this on an Friday evening, alone in Amsterdam waiting for my connection flight to leave the next day. Plan was to party the night through. After hitting some puffs from a pure this strain knocked me out big time. Got a little panicky and ended up sleeping in the airport laying on a counter. \u000aI had a very intense head high with my body all super warm especially my central chest feeling like it&#39;s burning.\u000aIf not consumed in a situation like this, it might be a very chill thing. The shop I bought it from said it was mostly sativa, that&#39;s why I bought it.

VI actually just grew this unbelievable strain. They flowered for 9 weeks before I harvested. Let them dry and cure out for about 3 weeks before I tried it... not only is this the most interesting strain taste wise, the high is unreal. Through a bong, this strain literally tastes like hashy earthy strawberries with that pungent kush. (My seeds were strawberry cough x OG kush). The high is very well balanced. It starts in your head and then slowly but surely makes its way to your whole body, mind and body numbing. 10/10 on this strain and man was she fun to grow.

VI got to grow this unbelievable strain. Got 3 fem seeds popped them all and got 3 huge and beautiful plants. First off, the bud structure and smell that comes off is literally the most intriguing smell that a bud has ever offered me. It is ridiculously sweet smelling with pine and pungency in the background. 3/4 of the buds also are very nicely structured and are HUGE. Am In week 3 of cure so I&#39;ve just been starting to get a feel for the taste and high. Right off the bat I give this strain a 10/10. The high starts in your head but is not over powering by any means. Nice calmness around your whole head, destroying any stress or anxiety that you have (which I suffer from). After about 30 minutes the effects creep down your body, numbing your muscles and completely relaxing your whole body. A perfect hybrid strain in my opinion.

VThis strain is one of my new favorites, it gives you a wonderful uplifting high. It doesn&#39;t have the &quot;couch-lock&quot; affect, you can be active and get things done. It has a very sweet taste to it. if your in San Diego looking for this strain, visit southwest patient group in San Ysidro!

VFirst time I tried it, I bought a gram of it in Amsterdam, rolled it into a joint and it&#39;s become one of my favorites.  The smell is sweet and fruity, the bud is frosted with trichomes and wonderfully sticky, and the taste in great! The smoke is much sweeter than most strains, it tastes kind of like incense. It is a very inspiring high, enough to make me want to write a review about it.

VBeing an Indica Girl. I was quite please with this hybrid strain. I have to choose my sativas carefully as they can make me feel jittery. This is a perfect 50/50 of OG Kush and Strawberry Cough. Nice body feel. Very nice head feel. Long lasting feel. Calming, definitely helps with pain. Feel like I could run errands or take a nap.

VVery nice smoke, noticeable sweet flavour and smooth on the lungs. It flipped my mood almost instantly; the effects come on very quickly. Was not very talkative at all while high, but very chilled out. I found it easy to focus on what we were watching. I believe this is an indica dominant hybrid (around 80/20), which is shown in the effects as you\u2019ll feel great throughout your entire body. We went straight to the sofa after smoking and didn\u2019t really get up apart from getting a few snacks. Went to bed after about an hour and a half when the effects felt like they were cooling slightly, and I fell asleep instantly.

VI had this strain in an edible (sour belts) and it was amazing. I was able to taste the strawberry through the flavoring of the sour belts, which was amazing. I would love to try the flower, because this stuff made me feel so happy inside and gave me the energy to still do stuff around the house or where ever I was. It wasn&#39;t very good strain to workout on though. Would definitely try again and recommend.

This strain had us sitting in the parking lot of Taco Bell with 40 dollars worth of food in our laps with eyes redder than the devils dick. If this weed was a car then it came at me at 70 mph.\u000a

VFor sounding so innocent, this bud will literally knock you on your ass. Absolutely fantastic high and great tasting, too. Just make sure that you have some water handy for when the dry mouth kicks in. The effects last a fairly short amount of time, which is honestly the only real down side. Definitely recommend this strain!

VThis has a very strong chemical taste. It reminded me of having a mouthful of chlorinated pool water. It smells, looks and sounds good but don&#39;t be fooled. It comes on strong and instead of relieving any anxiety and/or pain, it only added to it and left me with an irritating head-ache. One of the worse strains I&#39;ve smoked. I&#39;ll never be able to trust another strain with the word Strawberry in the name.
