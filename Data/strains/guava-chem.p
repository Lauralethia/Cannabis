VLucky to find this outstanding strain in soft pressed Hash form. Really easy on the throat with great uplifting relaxed mindset. The absence of any couch lock makes for a truly fun experience. Explore outdoors or get creative on this one. Will be back . .but may have to search more then one source.

VI much prefer  indica over sativa. However  fir daytime  indicas can be very quieting  and sleeping. So  I  have  tried  different  sativas for  pain relief but still  able  to  be active. Guave chem is very different  to other sativas imo. Lots  of insightful  thinking  and amazing  sex.  You  need  to stay  hydrated  with Guava and your heart  can race a bit. A little  mild paranoia  from the excitation  level. I   like  it  better than blue dream.  I did  not  find  it to be a short  high. 4 big hits and I  was  high  for 4 hours.  2 would  have been  enough.  There&#39;s  no real  rush. You  simply  realize  that  you  are  high. There  is  a bit of come down  from it.  Does reduce  pain  significantly but still  a little  too edgy a few hours  later.

VOk, so. Nice shade of green, real sticky, a good amount of little short white hairs, and bits of orange throughout the bud.  When I smoke this shit, I feel like I&#39;ve crossed into a magical new demention.. Not that I see anything, but it just feels soo damn good and magical. It&#39;s the vibe of being in a different demention that makes me feel so simply good ;)

VGuava Haze isn&#39;t on this site, but it&#39;s what I purchased from GTR in Anaheim. After looking at pictures and comparing reviews and profiles for both Guava Chem and Guava Kush, I believe Guava Chem is what I have/Guava Haze is a variant of Guava Chem.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m not one for sativas, sativa-dominant hybrids, or so I thought. GTR recommended this strain to me, and has it listed as a sativa, so I was skeptical. This is by far my favorite tasting strain as of yet, it DOES taste and smell just like guava fruit! Trying things for pain management, this helps, and I&#39;ve had experience with other hybrids giving me worse headaches on top of the one I was trying to get rid of, but this doesn&#39;t do that. It&#39;s predominantly a head-high, but I felt tingly all over in a good way; I felt like I was floating around my apartment.\u000a\u000aYou build on the high; you get higher the more you smoke, so if you only want to be a little high, you can only take a couple hits. This isn&#39;t a strain that gets you as high as possible with as little as possible, it&#39;s a very nice variable high. No matter how much I smoked (I put away a decent bowl -about ten hits- by myself), I didn&#39;t get couch-locked -I was able to do chores and get ready for work while high.
