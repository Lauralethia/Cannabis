VInteresting that Hawaiian Punch is listed as a hybrid here, because my dispensary had it listed as the only 100% sativa I&#39;ve ever seen. So, curious as to which is correct. Buds are very similar to the hawaiian haze I had early this year. Pretty loosely strung, light, deep green with long brown hairs. Smell is floral and tropical (not as much so as the Hawaiian Haze). The high is bit more clear headed, given the subtraction of the haze. I felt awake, but I somehow doubt this strain was actually all sativa, because I didn&#39;t feel as awake as I would with a Jack Herer or a Kali Mist. I really didn&#39;t find it overly powerful. Since I mostly vape, when I smoke a J I can really feel it, and I did, but not as much as I would have expected. I think this would be a nice strain to pass around with a big group.  7/10

VMy ex-husband had some and we smoked it last night. \u000a\u000aI found this strain to be VERY useful for me. I had mellowed out. It gave my mind a balance where I can stay focused, where as, in my typical day where I don\u2019t smoke, my brain is almost always jumping from one task to the next. My body was relaxed. And of course it gives that feel good feeling.\u000a\u000aI didn\u2019t feel the anxiety, nervousness, paranoid that most people usually feel, but of course, as an individual who has PTSD, anxiety, this didn\u2019t heighten it at all.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I dealt with is trying to wake up, I slept really hard on it. (Which can be good if you struggle with sleep, however I have kids to get to school&#128513;) So, when I did wake up, I felt just a little groggy. \u000a\u000aThe taste is sweet, and smooth when smoking it. I will definitely try this again.

VBeing from The Big Island and knowing the creator of this tasty strain I think I can give a good honest rating. Hawaiian Punch delivers the flavor and creeping punch that this strain packs. Just what I look for at the end of a long day. My gf loves this strain when she gets a headache. Almost instant relief!\u000a

VHad a nice hearty sized bowl of this one for the first time.... wow! Just wow! It&#39;s one of those types of high where you are so high that you don&#39;t know you&#39;re high but then all of a sudden you realize just how high you are. Very enjoyable... fun weird effects like &quot;did I just think that out loud or in my head&quot; followed by &quot;did I just think that out loud too?&quot; !!! Probably the weirdest thing was it was late at night and after I fell asleep, I was still stoned in my dreams. You read that right, I was stoned right down to a sub-conscious level, my own persona in my dream was baked! Probably wouldn&#39;t us this one in a social setting unless everyone else there was also smoking it so we could all surf this wave together.

VThis strain I picked up from 7 Highway in tacoma. when i got my hands on this one, i could already smell it through the bag. a nice and even aroma with a smooth flavor to it. i grough up a small piece and loaded it into my pipe. the firsr hit was heavy and punchy. i didnt feel the effects at first, but when i sat there for a moment, the calmness rolled over me like a wave. i found a nice, productive feel from this, with the motivation to write this review. right now, i feel the gentle &quot;twinkle&quot; in my head that sativas normally make me feel, along with a very pleasant numbness in the front if my head. i dont even feel my depression or anxiety. very good for daytime usage. gorgeous buds and even more gorgeous scent.
