VI love Sour Diesel and Headband.. The fact they crossed these two strains provides a phenomenal head high with awesome euphoria and upliftedness.. If that&#39;s a word lol. But has a nice mellow body high too. Definitely is something to have day or night. Just smoked a blow right now and I feel fucking great!

VThis review is very subjective in the sense that I rarely enjoy high THC Sativas. I know this is a hybrid but it leans heavy on the Sativa dominance. The absence of a counter balance of CBD in this particular strain makes for some potential negative mental affects. \u000a\u000aI tried this strain because of my love for Headband by itself. With that said, I would love to see this strain crossed with an ac/dc or Sour Tsunami type strain to see what beautiful  love-child would be brought into existence. \u000a\u000aUntil then, if you find a potent batch of this strain, exercise caution. If you want a strain to help with anxiety, this might not be what you&#39;re looking for.

VI smoked 2 or three hits and I wrote a 7 minute play with a group of friends.  I am still laughing because my character gets lost in a sewer full of dead bodies and rats to retrieve a cursed penny because I was the smallest person there and can fit in a drainage grate.  I felt the effects for 9 hours with 2 hits at 8pm and 1 at 11.  I think it is over 20% thc.

VThis is the perfect strain for a high intensity, focused workout! I went bouldering after consumption and rocked super hard! Once you open the jar of this strain, immediately the room is full of a sour, pungent has smell. The flavor taste just like it smells, and finishes with subtle notes of grapefruit. Plan to do something after consumption, the energy surge is too much to just sit still. The affect mostly stays cerebral with light affect on the body. Don\u2019t use before bed. You will not sleep.

VYeah buddy! Sour head band by Seattle\u2019s private reserve is my cup of tea. Very uplifting, slightly energetic, yet slightly relaxing. A great euphoria. Talkative with red dry eyes. The physical effects are concentrated in the head. Smoke is flavorful lemon skunk diesel. A middle weight imo with an abrupt cough leaving my face looking like a bit a lemon. Diesel and chem linger in the taste of the exhale. Buds look picturesque. Conical, sticky, fluffy, lime green silver coated nugs hold neon orange thin sharp hairs. Leaves contrast the nugs with dark green.\u000aRecommend for day time and would avoid at night. This is a strain good for the arcade.\u000a It smells, looks, smokes, tastes, feels amazing.\u000a\u000aWould I get again...?\u000aDoes howdy doody have wooden balls?

VLineage: Sour Diesel x Headband  (Sativa Dominant Hybrid)\u000aWith famous parents, Sour Band is the North West of the Cannabis world and just like Kanye&#39;s little girl these nugs are beautiful and crusted in diamonds. Expect a strong earthy lemon diesel aroma that carries over on the palate, a sure to love for Sour Diesel fans, with a unique high that shares some of the classic Headband brain pinch. A sativa dominant hybrid, the high is an energetic euphoria filled creative trip that somehow still leaves the user relaxed. Medicinally, this strain is noted for eye pressure and glaucoma, as well as stress, depression, headaches, appetite stimulation and nausea.
