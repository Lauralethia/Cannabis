VMethod: Glass blunt.  Aurora Indica keeps impressing me more and more.  This was a very fun 10 minute laugh-fest with my little brother and now I&#39;m cruising feeling very good.  I definitely recommend trying this if it&#39;s available to you.  Recommended activities: relaxing, talking, hanging out with friends.

VThis strain is very good for those who don&#39;t like the psychedelic/head high that sometimes gets you paranoid. All you get with Aurora Indica is a pleasant couchlock effect, with your perception staying clear. Sometimes induces retrospective moods. Very good for insomniacs, as it makes me sleep even if I don&#39;t really want to. I wouldn&#39;t recommend to watch a movie or anything, since you&#39;re most likely to fall asleep (apart from being unable to keep track of the happenings).

VI was having a particularly intense 10 say episode of either severe gastritis or cyclic vomiting (I get this frequently, likely some damage done while addicted to prescription drugs for years and consumed all my tons of pills on exclusively empty stomachs) and was broke and my medical card had expired, thus leaving me extremely ill.\u000a\u000aA good friend helped me out and gifted me some 99% CBD Isolate crystals and .5g of some Aurora Indica shatter by Paper Planes Extracts.\u000a\u000aAnd wow!! I cannot recommend this strain for nausea, vomiting, inflammation, and pain enough! Sometimes I could be salivating and shaking, just about to blow chow or heave up a few spoonfuls of bile...  take one good dab through the ol&#39; Zong and *ahhhh...* sweet relief! Nausea = GONE.\u000a\u000aSurprisingly groovy, euphoric, smiley high too. GREAT for anxiety, depression, and insomnia as well.\u000a\u000aTaste is delightfully piney/woody with some grapey/berryish notes on the exhale.\u000a\u000aOverall, I was actually pretty impressed! Much better than I had anticipated. Don&#39;t knock it til ya try it kids!\u000a\u000a\u005cm/

VThis strain is terribly hard to come by but do not hesitate to pick it up if you&#39;re a heavy indica lover. &quot;Aurora Indica&quot; is a perfect name for this mystic, delicious strain. It&#39;s more of a sweet/berry indica with earthy undertones than a hashy, spicy indica like some can be. The exhale is really fantastic with a clean, smooth, and tasteful smoke leaving your lips. It leaves you feeling extremely relaxed with most pain melting away and sleep unavoidable within a couple hours. The only negative is that it is a heavy hitting strain so I get a little paranoid if I overdo it but that&#39;s more on the consumer than the strain. Top 3 strain for me!

VA fellow pothead friend of mine grew this in his closet, super sketchy setup which only yielded about 20g per plant. \u000a\u000aHowever, the smoke was fekkin smooth.

At times it felt like too much - so many ideas and thoughts came rushing through my brain that I could almost feel the dopamine surging around, finding new connections. Needless to say, opening 2018 on this strain was a great choice, it inspired me to move on a few ideas that are now coming into fruition... \u000a\u000aIf you&#39;re a thinker AND a doer like me, then this is the one for you. \u000a\u000aOnly drawback is that I didn&#39;t get the munchies like I do on other strains. \u000a\u000aYou won&#39;t regret smoking this, but beware that it is a BIG head high... pure indica style ;) \u000a\u000aEnjoy!

Few different phenotypes with the majority having the strong Northern Lights/Purple Trainwreck smell. Grows horns like a Jack Here and is a very smooth smoke.

I gotta say that it&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s not even fully cured yet. I smoked a bit so far and it&#39;s got a nice sweet and earthy taste and although it&#39;s not super high in t.h.c. (I would guess around 18%) it has amazing indica qualities and is a wonder for my back pain. I&#39;m not an all day smoker so I wanted something to ease my muscles after the day and ease my anxiety to sleep better. It&#39;s one of the main reasons I chose to grow this strain.

VA new addition to my menu, this stuff is knockout good night, crack up an hour or so at the tv, then snoring next. It has a real lung expanding harsh hit, no feelings after 3 to 4 hits, then 5 minutes later the effects start and it is really heavy duty. A true creeper, and one that I will recommend to my patients looking for relief from pain and also needing a good night&#39;s sleep.

VThis is the one I always come back to. Super easy to grow, only 7 weeks to flower completely. Powerful, long-lasting couch-lock Indica effect. The best I&#39;ve found for PTSD related insomnia.

Vpeople swear by this, but you have to get the right pheno and apparently there&#39;s loads. tried the (hairy pheno) which wasn&#39;t that strong, still a massive long xmas tree center cola and big dense buds with a kinda kush smell when dried and diesel-like whilst flowering.

VFinishing curing now after growing two girls this year. Two solid ounces as I kept the plants small. I chose this strain because of the heavy indica qualities and it&#39;s exactly like people say. A nice and euphoric high that melts into couch lock and a great muscle relaxer. Tastes like sweet earth and lavender. very pleased with this strain and the buds are a olive green with tinges of purple and super red hairs covered in trichomea

VVery flavorful, deep and rich across the tip of the tongue with a slightly tingling exhalation. Bag smell was wonderful. Burn was even better.  Piney fragrance that quickly dissipates.  A brief flash of euphoria followed by a total body relaxation that presents you with the option of slumber or stimulating conversation with others.  All pain in the body is dispatched for 2+ hours.  I doubled down on this strain as it is \u000aan infrequent purchasing opportunity to be had.

VI smoked one joint of this and while the effects were not as strong as I expected, the relaxation provided was very intense and quite pleasurable. Great for stress; all my worries disappeared completely. There was no euphoria. It enhanced my appetite and overall enjoyment of food pretty significantly. While far from my favorite, it&#39;s a nice, mellow indica.

VThis has became a go to strain for a Heavy Indica lover as myself. Effects are relaxation after dinner, and the best effect is sleep. Then when I get up at 4:15 a.m. to let the cats out it will lull me back to sleep. Just the genetics alone should tell you that you are not going to be disappointed with parents like Afghani &amp; N.L. gotta keep some of this on hand in the Cookies container!

VHave grown (outdoor) and smoked it back in 2008.\u000aVery potent strain from Nirvana seeds.\u000aMade around 120g from one plant. \u000aAnyway, I remember that the high isn&#39;t the strongest, THC levels must be under 18%.\u000aHigh is uplifting, with a couch-lock effect but with the ability of staying concentrated. Good for some artistic stuff as another member mentioned.\u000aOne of my favorite strains. Haven&#39;t really tasted anything so spicy since.\u000a\u000a

VI have 40+ years experience growing and using cannabis, a masters degree in agri/horticulture from MSU and will break each review down as follows from my own personal experience with seeds or clones obtained directly from the original breeders:\u000a\u000aI would like to first note that although a very nice strain, my experience was nothing like Nirvana describes and I would describe it as more of a hybrid than an indica dominant strain and from the reviews of others I know and the reviews on this site and others, I&#39;m not alone in not getting what I expected and may be the reason why reviews are not as high as they should be.\u000a\u000aIt is a F1 hybrid which could explain the different variations and getting some that are very different than they intended.\u000a\u000aUse;\u000a\u000aHas more hybrid effects and is not a strong indica that makes you relaxed, happy and euphoric but it doesn&#39;t give you couch lock or make you want to sleep. It is still good for pain, muscle spasms but again, if you are looking for strong indica effects, than this isn&#39;t the best choice\u000a\u000aThis supposed indica dominant strain has a more hybrid balanced effect with relaxed, happy euphoric cerebral feelings but not a lot of physical couch lock type effects, like an indica should. The effect is good for symptoms such as pain, &amp; muscle spasms but it won&#39;t make you feel like you have to go to sleep. The effects are great and useful, just not as they are described by the breeder so if you are looking for something with strong indica type effects, than I wouldn&#39;t recommend this. Buds are very dense and have a very pleasant odor that is hard to describe. It&#39;s kind of earthy with a strong chocolate smell with hints of spiciness. Reminded me of a strain I used to get in the old days called Chocolate Thai.\u000a\u000aGrow;\u000a\u000aIndoors: Finishes in 9-10 weeks\u000a\u000aOutdoors: October 17th at 42*N latitude\u000a\u000aAlthough this plant doesn&#39;t have the strong indica effects one would expect it definitely looks and grows like an indica. The leaves are very wide to the point of overlapping. Plant is short and stout looking like an indica should but just like the effects are more hybrid type, so is it&#39;s flowering time. I wanted this specifically because Nirvana stated that it would finish in mid September and it definitely displayed more sativa characteristics, finishing late in October. The weird thing is I germinated 3 seeds I ended up using and all three seemed almost identical, which is not only weird for a F1 but also makes it strange that every phenotype seemed so much alike and nothing like it&#39;s described.
