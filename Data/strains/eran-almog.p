VHaving had the pleasure of watching this strain grow, I have learned a tremendous amount about Eran Almog. It has educated and truly refined my understanding of medicinally engineered (or very specifically selected and bred) cannabis vs. strains tailored for recreational use. No question that this strain indeed hits all the right notes for insomnia, inflammation, and particularly pain related ailments- and no doubt it may even go well beyond those which I have experienced first hand myself. It absolutely has a creeper effect that makes you feel under medicated whist first smoking, but 10-15 minutes later you realize it\u2019s full effect. One must consider this if doing something requiring due care and attention, or if appearing intoxicated is not desired. \u000a\u000aCured properly, EA has a very exotic nose/flavour and possesses a pleasant, light aroma with woody,hint of vanilla with an added element of light fuel, and lemony-citrus notes. \u000aThough it does have a heavy handed narcotic effect, it\u2019s remarkable and reliable medicinal properties are what make this strain particularly noteworthy.

VA rare breed in both accessibility and potency, I can personally attest to having received THC/THCa content of 27.34%, and that was a crumble(slightly less expensive) which tends run lower. \u000aPersonally, I found it an uplifting high that made me want to chat with friends, during which everything was hysterically funny. \u000aCan&#39;t give it the full 5 because like everyone else who&#39;s tried it, I payed too much, but it&#39;s definitely worth a try if you get the chance.

VSo here comes some TMI, but I feel that for medical purposes its important I say it. I have awful periods to the point where I am extremely anemic. To put the cherry on top of this situation I take birth control pills that make me vomit. This strain when I smoke it completely stops my nausea and for some reason gives me resilience toward my anemia (I literally don&#39;t feel anemic anymore..until it wears off 6-10hrs). One minute I am on the couch barely able to move and wishing for death, then after I smoke this I can get up and do what I need to do for the day(feeling good).

VEran Almog is an amazing medicine for those troubled by sleeping or neurological disorders, inter-muscular pain and for those who desire a high degree of mental clarity while deeply relaxed.  There is good reason to celebrate this strain and to maintain the integrity of its genetics that are unlike any other Indica offering I have tried over four decades.  Thank you for getting it right Medreleaf!

VGot this strain from Canopi and it&#39;s 19% instead of 28% as advertised. It did absolutely nothing, literally nothing. Two raw cones. 1 1/4 generously packed and nothing. It was almost like smoking really bad tobacco and some gas station kratom. Only that would have done more. Don&#39;t buy this crap your paying for the package. It doesn&#39;t work. If you do buy this garbage get one gram and try it, otherwise your wasting your time and money.
