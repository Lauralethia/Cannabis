VIndica. Almost straight for me. Not much of a head high. I usually like my OG cuts to get me stoned and relaxed. This weed almost acted like a cbd strain for me. I was relaxed and very happy but not sleepy. Taste is good and the manicure on this weed in impeccable!

VI used to get a strain on here that was rated about 3 stars by most people so I was used to very average kush, I used to smoke about a gram at a time of the other kush and it wouldn\u2019t hit hard at all, it just gave me a slightly relaxed feeling. With Rollex OG, I smoked half the amount I usually do and it hit harder than anything I\u2019ve ever taken, and this effect is with every smoking method. It\u2019s a very euphoric feeling mixed with a drowsy feeling, your whole body feels amazing and it is perfect for drowning headaches and pain. It\u2019s soothing and I 100% recommend it for any smoker who has never tried it.

VRelaxing and smooth that\u2019s the first two things a person thinks when Inhaling rollex Og. The high creeps up and it starts in your head and ends in a body high. Great to relax your muscle and a stress killer. I highly recommend this strain. It also has citrus earthy taste.

VWhen grown well, these genetics shine strong. This was a long lasting one for me and boy was the smell strong. I know because folks in the area let me know before my hay ride at the pumpkin farm. I was stoned as a goat.  Dense dense buds. My first assumption from seeing them was Cali grown and Leafly states that you can find this stand in CA or WA mostly.
