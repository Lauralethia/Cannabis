VI recently picked up a preroll from Nature&#39;s AZ Medicine of some God Bud. This is a strong indica with a skunky taste and potent high. The effects are long lasting and satisfying. This is now on my list of go-to indicas

VAbsolutely perfect for my first time. Took one hit and instantly felt euphoria. Just needed a few (3-4) hits from my vape pen (which was not loaded with a whole lot) and I was /good/ all night. I get really bad lows sometimes (like depressed almost suicidal lows) and I usually drink to get through it, which usually just makes it worse. I feel a million times better today than if I&#39;d drunk last night. I don&#39;t feel a need to do it again any time soon but knowing it&#39;s there keeps my mind at peace. Love this!

VGod Bud is some pretty ridiculous stuff, super powerful. If you&#39;ve ever done LSD and you&#39;re prone to flashbacks, this can trigger some pretty noticeable shifts in contrast and color if you smoke enough. Did a .3 grav of Romulan and then a .3 grav of this wonderful stuff. I was going way down on the Romulan, but within two minutes of taking the God Bud, everything started to get much clearer and I started to feel absolutely overjoyed and frankly, just fucking ridiculous. The only negative is this; if you smoke too much, and you end up alone and you&#39;re not prepared to be alone, you&#39;re probably going to have a freakout. Other than that, God Bud is pretty damn unique.\u000aPeace out guys (and gals). The march to total legalization is on.

VMy bud was dense and very sticky. White with trichomes. Nice smoke, not harsh at all. Immediate indica body high and a nice head high too, but still functional. Very sensual high, taking a bath after a bit of this was the perfect way to unwind after work. Only slight effect on appetite, which I appreciate.

VGod bud is a solid mellow indica with a musky, sour smell. I find that it really hits the back of my throat like a big juicy cock and the onset of the high is quick like my boyfriend ;p At first it feels really smooth and your muscles seemingly start to lose all tension. Next everything gets a little warm, and a little fuzzy, like you put on a pair of rose colored glasses. Then it rocks you to sleep so smoothly it&#39;s like it read you a lullaby and tucked you in.

VSmell is cheesy and musty with a hint of alfalfa. Odor is pleasant enough. Buds are dark green with orange hairs and yellow trichromes. Frosty, looks sugar coated.\u000a\u000aA few hits in and i&#39;m already feeling it. Colorful sensations with this one. Everything is getting silvery and vibrant, reminds me a bit of the time i mixed orange jack and xxx og. Very faint tingles, can&#39;t tell if its more of a head high or a body high, then again i was never good at those things. Pretty sure it is a hybrid, though, definitely a bit of both sativa and indica in there. \u000a\u000aHalfway through the bowl i&#39;m already well baked to golden brown perfection. Actually the room has become very yellow red and orange, the whole place seems warmer and more vibrant. It seems hazy, like a haze strain, but with a glowy, radiant feeling. I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve gotten anything like this without mixing strains before. Its doing some very cool hallucinogenic stuff with my depth perception. Space seems larger, more grand and wide angle. \u000a\u000a10 minutes in the body high has come in full effect. I&#39;m very tingly now, its massaging itself around my entire body, i&#39;ve turned my space heater on and it feels relaxing and nice, like i&#39;ve stepped into a hot tub. Thats always a nice effect. I still feel alert, but relaxed. I have my wits about me. Just had to lay back and go, &quot;yeah, oh yeah. that feels good.&quot; This body high would be amazing for sex.\u000a\u000a30 minutes in it feels like its in between the larry OG and super silver haze. nice ride, the high changes as it goes on. Its not as strong anymore but still very pleasant, relaxing. Good for stress relief.\u000a\u000aOverall this strain lived up to its name, for the visual and physical sensations, rather than the fact that it is somehow mindblowing. It was definitely very good, a real keeper.

VI bought this cartridge by Select Strains a couple of weeks ago but hadn&#39;t toked on it enough to give a review until this evening.\u000a\u000aGod Bud is an indica, and mine tested at 67.23 % THC and 1.65 % CBD. It reminds me of Hindu Kush, but not quite as tasty. There are notes of grape and black licorice, and maybe a bit of tree pitch thrown in? There&#39;s a small scrape on the exhale if that makes sense.  It&#39;s quite enjoyable.\u000a\u000aThis is a good strain for insomnia, as I&#39;m feeling some waves of drowsiness wash over me. I like this! During the week I&#39;m an indica gal because I have trouble sleeping, especially lately. My mom is dying and I&#39;d be surprised if she made it two more weeks. I&#39;m a complete mess to say the least, and I cry a lot these days.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m blessed that I live in Oregon where cannabis is legal, and Medical Mary Jane comes to my rescue at nighttime and I often listen to delta wave music too to help relax me. It usually works! If not I smoke more pot :) My nightstand is an indica altar with 3 loaded pipes, 1 loaded bubbler, and 1 loaded bong. I clean up and refill before bed or in the morning.\u000a\u000aI would be interested in trying God Bud in flower form. While the vape concentrates have a higher % THC, the natural flower still hits me harder and I do like it better than vaping for the most part.  I do ike the vape a lot though because it&#39;s convenient to discreetly toke outside at restaurants, walking in the park, etc. It&#39;s also easier on the lungs and there&#39;s no ash or ashy taste, no mess or pipes to clean out other than an occasional Q-Tip swab of the contacts.\u000a\u000aIn short - fellow Insomniacs, if you haven&#39;t tried God Bud yet, you might want to. It tastes and smells good, but most importantly it does the job.

VHaven&#39;t smoked very much good bud being from the midwest in an area rampant with $5 a gram mids dirt weed, but I just got some of this and it totally blew me away. The high is very clean and mellow, and very euphoric and lazy. I have anxiety problems when I smoke cannabis and I had NO anxiety or paranoia whatsoever which is extremely impressive. Usually bud makes me so paranoid and anxious I can&#39;t enjoy it. When it wears off it feels great to smoke more, it doesn&#39;t burn you out like dirt weed. Very powerful but easy to control, great for kicking back with friends, watching movies, listening to music, pondering life, or any other chill activity.  I highly recommend this strain if you have anxiety problems.  Also it was covered in crystals, the nugs were light green and very fluffy. The scent was a tad bit sweet and very earthy with a kind of &quot;subway&quot; undertone. (it smells like subway to me lol). The smoke was very thick and clean and doesn&#39;t burn your throat, it tastes very sweet and leaves a delicious aftertaste on your lips and tongue. It quickly and completely alleviated a headache I was getting too.

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings -- Brand: JD LLC Strain: God Bud Indica-dominant Hybrid -- Potency Analysis: TTL 21.4% THC 21.1% CBD 0.3% -- Cost: $15/g -- This God Bud is somewhat legendary in SW WA. JD LLC God Bud is a treat! It&#39;s cared for well, and it is sold at a very affordable price. This is some high-class Washington marijuana. -- The smell off the buds is remarkably clean and blue, with a citrusy zing under a sharp piney fragrance. -- Smoking this is refreshing. The flavor up front is super blue, like a Blue Dream strain, but as you inhale the piney freshness takes over and on the exhale is a brief return of that blue flavor, kissed with lemony citrus. -- The high is so perfectly balanced between euphoric, energetic uplift and relaxed,stress-relief. Mentally this is pretty interested, but very cloudy. All pain melted away with this smoke. The legs were remarkable and munchies later.

VThis flower is fantastic. My boyfriend and I tried it this afternoon and we still feel it. I instantly felt the effects after only one hit. Mind you I do have a low tolerance, however I have never smoked anything quite as potent yet. The smell is nice, the flavour is very pleasant, and the smoke is &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; in the best way. Be careful not to take a massive hit the first go, without having tried it, or one similar before. It had me coughing quite a bit because I didn&#39;t expect it to be so strong. All in all, I give it a 4 star. I highly recommend trying it.\u000a\u000aUPDATE: After 2 days of trying Godbud, I can say for sure that it is one of my favourite. It actually gets my boyfriend asleep at night (weed doesn&#39;t usually do that for him) and relieves his pain from working with his hands. I did rate it a 4 star, but after seeing these results its a 5 star from me.

I highly recommend this strain if you have anxiety problems.  Also it was covered in crystals, the nugs were light green and very fluffy. The scent was a tad bit sweet and very earthy with a kind of &quot;subway&quot; undertone. (it smells like subway to me lol). The smoke was very thick and clean and doesn&#39;t burn your throat, it tastes very sweet and leaves a delicious aftertaste on your lips and tongue. It quickly and completely alleviated a headache I was getting too.

VThis flower is fantastic. My boyfriend and I tried it this afternoon and we still feel it. I instantly felt the effects after only one hit. Mind you I do have a low tolerance, however I have never smoked anything quite as potent yet. The smell is nice, the flavour is very pleasant, and the smoke is &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; in the best way. Be careful not to take a massive hit the first go, without having tried it, or one similar before. It had me coughing quite a bit because I didn&#39;t expect it to be so strong. All in all, I give it a 4 star. I highly recommend trying it.\u000a\u000aUPDATE: After 2 days of trying Godbud, I can say for sure that it is one of my favourite. It actually gets my boyfriend asleep at night (weed doesn&#39;t usually do that for him) and relieves his pain from working with his hands. I did rate it a 4 star, but after seeing these results its a 5 star from me.

VThe flower I had is more on the purple skunk side of the lineage. Awesome Smoke lots of sweet flavor, excellent full body and mind high. I inhaled a nice bowlful and was feeling good for about 4hrs. I didn&#39;t feel divinity, but I did feel creative, omnipotent and holier than thou! Furthermore, if you wanna visit heaven for a few hours try God Bud. Heaven on Earth. The genetics of this strain can be traced to the bible Genesis 3:3 Gods private stash don&#39;t touch it or you&#39;ll die! Glad God decided to share with us! Amen! All praise is due to God...bud.

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog the Aging Ent&#39;s Tastings -- Brand: JD LLC Strain: God Bud Indica-dominant Hybrid -- Potency Analysis: TTL 21.4% THC 21.1% CBD 0.3% -- Cost: $15/g -- This God Bud is somewhat legendary in SW WA. JD LLC God Bud is a treat! It&#39;s cared for well, and it is sold at a very affordable price. This is some high-class Washington marijuana. -- The smell off the buds is remarkably clean and blue, with a citrusy zing under a sharp piney fragrance. -- Smoking this is refreshing. The flavor up front is super blue, like a Blue Dream strain, but as you inhale the piney freshness takes over and on the exhale is a brief return of that blue flavor, kissed with lemony citrus. -- The high is so perfectly balanced between euphoric, energetic uplift and relaxed,stress-relief. Mentally this is pretty interested, but very cloudy. All pain melted away with this smoke. The legs were remarkable and munchies later.

VThis strain is a really good strain.  Right away u smell notes of musty pine &amp; a slight hint of lemon, but if u turn it into rso oil and after u decarb it it smells like a slightly sweet sausage smell (try it, decarb it &amp; see for yourself) but whenever I burn a bowl all the notes turn into that strong resin smell BUT the effects are surreal because if I smoke enough I get a whole deja vu feeling like I been thru that high before. It used to bug me but I just ride it out like a slowly moving moped down a back road (very calming). a very couchlocky strain too, great for a toke and Tuck (after u satisfy your munchies which is easier said than done). it can get u horny AF too.

VDanroeth\u000a\u000a    I&#39;m experiencing Gbud for the first time. Because of my severe arthritis I would be classified as a heavy smoker, so lightweight smoke is nonsense for me. I&#39;m  satisfied at a higher level than usual with this indica. It has me sedate but does  not have me zoning, my thoughts don&#39;t go everywhere to discover the meaning of life and other simple things.  I get all the other great attributes of a great indica and still can hold thought to the conversation at hand. Truly amazing

VThis strain is a really good strain.  Right away u smell notes of musty pine &amp; a slight hint of lemon, but if u turn it into rso oil and after u decarb it it smells like a slightly sweet sausage smell (try it, decarb it &amp; see for yourself) but whenever I burn a bowl all the notes turn into that strong resin smell BUT the effects are surreal because if I smoke enough I get a whole deja vu feeling like I been thru that high before. It used to bug me but I just ride it out like a slowly moving moped down a back road (very calming). a very couchlocky strain too, great for a toke and Tuck (after u satisfy your munchies which is easier said than done). it can get u horny AF too.

VI got 2 grams of BC God Bud which I vaped this and it tasted great. It was a little sweet which I enjoyed a lot. Increased my appetite significantly, I eat so much when I smoke this strain. Euphoric and almost psychedelic high. I laughed out loud a few times for nothing. Makes you feel incredible. At higher doses it made me pretty tired. Really enjoyed this one.

VGod Bud is a very relaxing Indica type stone. Although not as heavy as other Indica strains it still provides plenty of relaxing, comfortable feelings. Buds were small in size with dark green and dark purple hues on the outside. The overall taste is pretty nice, fairly smooth not harsh but can really taste the hints of skunk associated with this strain. Also was helpful with pain relief and made me awfully hungry! \u000a\u000aOVERALL GRADE: 7.5  / 10

VDanroeth\u000a\u000a    I&#39;m experiencing Gbud for the first time. Because of my severe arthritis I would be classified as a heavy smoker, so lightweight smoke is nonsense for me. I&#39;m  satisfied at a higher level than usual with this indica. It has me sedate but does  not have me zoning, my thoughts don&#39;t go everywhere to discover the meaning of life and other simple things.  I get all the other great attributes of a great indica and still can hold thought to the conversation at hand. Truly amazing

VI decided to try this strain for its hallucinogenic effects. After packing my bowl, I went outside to look at the stars. After 10 minutes, I started to have mild hallucinations: the stars danced in kaleidoscopic patterns, while a heavy body high took over. This lasted about 20 minutes, then the rest of the high was typical of a strong indica strain. Definitely one of my favourites. A good strain to take if you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed or stressed.

VGod Bud is an Indica dominant strain that is known for its high potency. These large light green buds are absolutely covered in trichomes and emit a sweet citrus scent, with a flavour to match. When smoked it produces a strong body high with definitive couch-locking effects. Our Budtenders recommend God Bud for relief of Chronic Pain, Insomnia, and Nausea.

VBest smelling flower I have come across so far. God Bud has a very strong berry smell with just a hint of diesel. The buds themselves are nice and thick with dark green and purple flowing through them. You again get a bit of berry, this one in the taste of the flower. The effects of God Bud are great, they don&#39;t take, almost as if to ease you into it like it was your first time smoking. And then your on your way to a wonderful experience, allowing the high to rush over your eagerly awaiting body with just a slight head high to help push you towards the sleep you so desperately crave. All in all this was an enjoyable strain I look forward to smoking again and I definitely recommend this to everyone looking for some R&amp;R.

It was so dank it didn&#39;t even grind, just balled it up, if you experience this just let the bud dry out a little before you grind. Great taste out of this bud and very potent smoke. As for the high, its not as strong as OG Kush to me but I&#39;ve been at this 15 years so bud doesn&#39;t hit me as hard. Overall it&#39;s one of my current favorites. Recommended to anyone that&#39;s looking for a nice sedating effect without feeling the need to pass out.

VSuper relaxing strain pain relieving strain. I normally only use Indica dominant hybrids for sleep, but I came home from work with some back pain and God Bud eliminated it very easily. It also has a nice heady sativa kick which doesn&#39;t keep you up at night but can certainly aid in focus and creativity making this strain a good strain for almost anytime of day. But too much will certainly put you on your ass as it can be a very potent strain. Taste is subtly sweet and earthy. And the buds looks absolutely gorgeous. Amazing and versatile strain!

I smoked with a group of us and the conversations and ideas that flowed were fantastic. All while we kicked back and relaxed. Wonderful!

VReally great strain for physical relaxation while keeping a clear head and not couch locking, unless you overdo it.  \u000a\u000aMade me want to take off my clothes immediately.  Amazing self-love.  Slowed everything right down.  Not in a hurry to do anything but make out, make love, make up.  This weed is high on my list now.\u000a\u000aGreat for vaping and smoking!  Cloudy ballons of high impact vapors.  Or penitrating smoke that centers your mind and body.\u000a\u000aDrawbacks: gave me a headache 2 out of 5 times; dry eyes; it&#39;s unbelievably pungent!  My entire apartment building smells like it when i smoke a joint in my living room.  Nothing stealthy about God Bud.  It wants the world to know it has returned!  Lol.

My mind was all over the place in the best way possible. It made me very euphoric and giggly but it also made me pretty paranoid and a little bit stumbly while I was walking around. I&#39;m not very religious, but this strain most definitely saying &quot;God is good.&quot;

Although this bud is great in the evening for me, it also works very well for day time anxiety and muscle spasms. The wonderful CBD count in it makes it a double winner for me. The aroma coming off this girl is skunk-tastic !!! The Flavor profile is very skunky with hints of earthy goodness. The buds are tight and covered with crystals, just like I like them!!!

I fell asleep so easily and slept hard all night. Traditionally I have years of struggling to fall and stay asleep, this strain gave me the rest I needed and rad dreams.

VTried this with my father at a concert. Usually I&#39;m like Monk with my OCD and have a hard time enjoying myself, especially if I miss my afternoon dose of OCD meds like that night. This strain let me be a normal person for a few hours.  A little over indulgence made me a little anxious for 10 or 15 minutes, but after that, I didn&#39;t need to check things or perform OCD rituals.

V This is the only medicine whatsoever that I\u2019ve ever been able to get through my PTSD. I have dealt with it for decades and with a few puffs, It feels like the back of my head opens up and everything is safe.

VMinn.Dan\u000a              I grew my first god bud starting around now or early December last year. I was aware of its reputation as a very potent indica and even won the creator, Jorden of the islands  the cannabis cup gold  as best indica 2004. I believe.  It was brought outside in early may to get some size and finish. This plant was topped to bush it more and keep it easy to toss a 55 gal drum  over to  get 12/12 light cycle. Which was a pain in the ass  but I learned to enjoy it as it flowered . A  good friend  of mine and his woman Sherry, smoked this plant with me as it was ready for  smoking. It put Sherry out for the night  quick and she is a heavy smoker, I  was  very happy with such a hard hitting indica to offset my sativa dominance garden. That plant was crossed  with  my best male hybrid which is more sativa so Sherry can stay awake to enjoy a great indica dom hybrid.  The original from Jordan&#39; is everything I expected from the hype and actually lived up to it.

VSmoothe, relaxing smoke. No coughing. Barely gets you high, kills pain well, and works very well for insomnia as I have that problem. For best sleep results smoke a few hrs before bed and let it fade off a tad before lying down. Lessens the severity of migraines but does not rid them. High in CBD so hard to go wrong. Kind of like Harlequin strain but not as happy feeling, probably better for night than Harlequin though. Buds taste like a dried fruit cigar, and smell like dead pine wood, soil, and sweet dried fruit all mixed together. Strong smell but not skunky.

VBest smelling flower I have come across so far. God Bud has a very strong berry smell with just a hint of diesel. The buds themselves are nice and thick with dark green and purple flowing through them. You again get a bit of berry, this one in the taste of the flower. The effects of God Bud are great, they don&#39;t take, almost as if to ease you into it like it was your first time smoking. And then your on your way to a wonderful experience, allowing the high to rush over your eagerly awaiting body with just a slight head high to help push you towards the sleep you so desperately crave. All in all this was an enjoyable strain I look forward to smoking again and I definitely recommend this to everyone looking for some R&amp;R.

It&#39;s like a warm bath, cozy, comfortable, soothing, relaxing. Very euphoric and happy and sublime escape from pain. Great for relieveing anxiety and stress, to help unwind the body and mind. The bud itself was beautifully coated with a thick dusting of crystal clear trichomes, so exciting. It was heavenly, pun intended, yet deadly serious. Euphoria is the primary sensation.

Vvery strong and long lasting high. very strong almost overwhelming smell. would not recomend for newbies like myself. took 1 bong hit and it put me on my ass for the whole night. had to turn in early because the high was so strong the room started spinning and i couldnt move. almost hallucenegenic ide say. however this is definatly a good strain for those with higher tokerances and long time smokers looking for a step up from their original bud. time slows down a ton 10 min felt like an hour. mild paranoia from the long lasting and strong high (makes u feel that its permanant). still extremly high 2-3 hours later and still buzzed the next day 13 hours after i hit it.

Flavor is amazing, and the high is near instant and climbs for a solid 10-15 minutes then it&#39;s an incredible steady high for hours. In wax form I was getting long lasting highs and great full body effects. The perfect night time smoke, this is without a doubt one of my favorite strains and perhaps my favorite indica.

VThis is one of my go to strains for end of the day full body relaxation and beautiful sleep. I find this strain to have an incredible full body stone with a nice level of gentle cerebral invigoration. I find my mind gets super clear and my consciousness moves into that super aware clarity. The nice thing I find with this strain is its ability to float either direction. I can focus on the mental factor and let my mind swim in its clear elevation or I can focus on full body relaxation and get amazing relaxation. Either way I expect excellent sleep in 30-45 minutes. I tend to reach for it when I need to relax and the cerebral clarity is just a bonus. I get this from SWOP in Albuquerque and they do a fantastic job with their flowers. This is no exception. Easily in my top 5 and I have over 40 strains in my medicine cabinet. Great for my post hernia repair chronic testicle pain.

VIt&#39;s been a few years since I&#39;ve had this. However, I&#39;ll never forget the intense feeling of weightlessness, tingling, and relaxation take over. This is a great one to relieve pain or migraines. You can easily enjoy hours of great lazy conversation where one topic leads to another going where your mind wants. All the while basking in the wonderful relaxed state of body and mind.

VThis bud is dank. It&#39;s super dense, took a bit to pull apart and it stuck to my fingers. It was so dank it didn&#39;t even grind, just balled it up, if you experience this just let the bud dry out a little before you grind. Great taste out of this bud and very potent smoke. As for the high, its not as strong as OG Kush to me but I&#39;ve been at this 15 years so bud doesn&#39;t hit me as hard. Overall it&#39;s one of my current favorites. Recommended to anyone that&#39;s looking for a nice sedating effect without feeling the need to pass out.

VSuper relaxing strain pain relieving strain. I normally only use Indica dominant hybrids for sleep, but I came home from work with some back pain and God Bud eliminated it very easily. It also has a nice heady sativa kick which doesn&#39;t keep you up at night but can certainly aid in focus and creativity making this strain a good strain for almost anytime of day. But too much will certainly put you on your ass as it can be a very potent strain. Taste is subtly sweet and earthy. And the buds looks absolutely gorgeous. Amazing and versatile strain!

My hobby is  both in growing and smoking, so I really get to know the plants and their attributes before the absolute joy of smoking it in the case of God Bud.  It surprised me in the fact it didn&#39;t blast me at the start, it just slowly comes on you and keeps coming.,

None the less it is a beast in the pen and it&#39;s a nice heavy inca hybrid as well with some skunk in it, nice Id say skunk and super skunk smell best to me I am an Indica man, I cam function throughout the day.

She&#39;s a beauty, it&#39;s about a week and a half into flowering and it looks normal as far as early buds go with an indica structure. I can&#39;t wait until it is about 6 weeks into flowering so I can see how the buds develop and put on weight.. I got this as a 10 seed pack from Jordan of the ilands I&#39;ve had great success with his gear 7 out of 10 seeds I get to harvest on average and I&#39;m a rookie.

VInitially smoked a bowl of this and caught what could be called a blissful, sensual, and sexual high that lasted and 1 1/2 to 2 hours fading into a very relaxed state the munchies then reared its ugly or beautiful head (depending if one was dieting or needed to eat).  The following sessions there after using the same amount and method an occasional wave of anxiety, temporarily blotting out the usual euphoria minus too the sensual/sexual feelings. Overall this is a very pleasurable bud and initially has great pain relieving properties however it is short acting. Tolerance to this strain builds rapidly as reported by others as well. It is a good one to have a little tucked away for a rainy day or holiday celebration. .

It needs to be in your strain inventory.  Beanhourder  has a whole section of F-13 crosses at Hemp Depot, the seed outlet in Vancouver, They also stock for DJ Short so I checked the picture out and the plant. It&#39;s his personal favorite.. Because it&#39;s such a clear and  powerful  sativa high, and because it&#39;s faster than  most plants, indica or sativa at 7 weeks flowering, it&#39;s a breeder dream.

This is my life as both a grower and purveyor of pot.\u000a\u000aI guess I&#39;m over giving &quot;just any bud&quot; a good rating...   just because I&#39;m so excited to get so many choices in the first place..  yes I like smoking pot - there I admit it.\u000a\u000aMy personal grow is small yet highly managed and a prized batch of weed..   \u000a\u000aI&#39;m not exactly a newb when it comes to a little &quot;...puff-puff.&quot;\u000a give-give.&quot;\u000a\u000aI expected so much more from any strain ballsy enough to call itself &quot;God.&quot;  \u000a\u000aTruthfully, what a let down.
