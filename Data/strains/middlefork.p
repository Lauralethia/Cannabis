VGood bag appeal, almost as frosty as dutch treat but with denser buds.  unique sweet roadkill and souring cucumbers and fruitloop vomit -cocktail of smells.  The smell is bold and full bodied but is contains itself to proximity of the source and doesnt deffuse to surrounding air which is neat.  The happy serotogenic onset is rapid, happyness hits pleasantly fast while the intoxicating elements build slowly. Tolerance builds slower than average so the terpene profile must be complex.  This strain tends to stay fresh longer.  Capable of keeping pace with designer strains while retaining uniqueness.

VLove this strain, been around the PNW for a while glad it got documented.  Northwest Alchemy has the best batches in the Seattle area and always great deals.  Sweet like rotting fruit, the terps on this flower are really unique and pungent.  The high I describe as just the ideal hybrid, can smoke it whenever you want, very level smoke.  I get focused  and relaxed, with just a slight sativa up kick, also a good heavy feeling but not overly couchlocked. I do not know many people who have tried this strain and do not just like it, but love it.

VUncommonly reliable strain for an energetic and creative high. Very smooth smoke or vape. Even prerolls are potent; 0.75g joint lasted from 4:20 til last hit at 4:20 the next day.\u000aMedium tight nugs, cola structure visible as described by col4bin.\u000aVery even Haze head buzz, sustainable for 6-8 hours with careful booster dosage. I don&#39;t get the munchies until I put it down. Rare for other strains to be involved - in groups everyone just wants more Middlefork. Pairs and plays well with Strawberry Cough. Tried it once with Northern Lights, got immediate full body melt with Middlefork&#39;s antidepressant vector intact.

I was motivated to do some housework,  and danced and sang along to music the whole time, and actually really enjoyed myself. If you need some oomph to get working on housework/gardening/whatever, definitely give Middkefork a try.

VSuper uplifting from the sativa side. Gives the giggle a bit but it&#39;s very relaxing and euphoric. The taste is somewhat tropical and it&#39;s sweet to smell. The buds are pretty dense and crystal coated. With the indica side, it completely relaxes the body so it isn&#39;t something to use if you want to do a lot but it does make you feel focused
