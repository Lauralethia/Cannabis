VHad this strain a year ago was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Very heady but balanced at the same time definitely a unique strain would recommend it for stress, pain, and migraines.

VWell hellooooooo Crunch Berry! Just looking at you I could tell I was in for a beautiful ride. You are gorgeous with your purple hue and gleaming crystal trichomes. Your smell, intoxicating. Sweet berry indeed. And your high?... Whatchoo wanna do? I could either stay at home and chill or go out and socialize. You  got me up in my head but not too far in the clouds. I am smiling from the inside out, my friend. Dry mouth is a small price to pay to indulge in you. We will definitely be meeting again.
