VThis was a freebie seed from Herbie&#39;s that I grew and turned out to be an awesome strain. An indica, but the effects are closer to a balanced hybrid. It gives a little tingle in the brain at first, but the relaxing body effect falls over you and makes this a happy stone.\u000aThe smell is really sweet and flowery. The buds are a beautiful, deep purple that are fat and dense. \u000aI always vape this one and it is such a happy and enjoyable high. With the body stone, I usually keep this to a late afternoon/evening session.

VBubba&#39;s gift is a semi functional flower in that it will not make the user feel sleepy immediately.  This beautiful tasting bud will also not motivate or do anything that involves moving too much.  Found this strain to be very lethargic both on my body &amp; mind which can be very welcoming sometimes.  This flower should be avoided when user needs to be on top of their game.  The flavor is sweet &amp; skunky top notch for the ol factory sense, yet this flavor does not come through as well in taste. Very dense medium sized buds that broke apart with ease.  Decent flower =)

VThis is always one of my favorite strains. Easily has a spot on my top 10 list. I\u2019ve had this strain many times, all from the same grower, Phat Panda.\u000a\u000aIt has a beautiful appearance of purple and green, with medium amount of orange hairs and frosty as a snowman\u2019s nuts.  \u000aDelicious grape smell and taste.  Very fruity.  I\u2019m always a sucker for a nice tasty fruity strain. \u000aI took one solid bong rip from my hash tech percolator and that\u2019s all I really needed at the moment.  Very clear headed and focused high, euphoric, light; I feel like I could exercise with this strain very easily.  \u000aThe high drifts nicely into a solid body high and good appetite stimulation.  Sleep was solid as well. \u000a\u000aOverall impression: Best of both worlds, the clear headed high of a Sativa (without the usual anxiety), and beneficial effects of good sleep and analgesia with the indica expression.  This is a rare gem.  It has everything I love in a cannabis strain: fruity taste, a focused high, and a good sleeper.

VThis strain produces some of the best looking buds I&#39;ve seen personally. The purple and green is so vibrant. It compliments the, what I can only describe as fruit loops, smell. You can smell so many different flavors! The even better thing is, that flavor doesn&#39;t burn away when taking even big hits! It&#39;s strong! Makes for a beautifully pleasant smoke. Definitely a gradual high, starting with slight body weightlessness type of feeling, slowly making its way into your mind wiping away all negativity. Perfect strain for those with sleep issues. Definitely recommend. My share of the batch tested at 20% picked up at Green Cross in Aurora,CO (Medical only).

VSlow vegger, fast flower. If I did not see it for myself I wouldn&#39;t believe it only took 49 days (after flip) to create such a STRONG smelling and tasting flower. tight golfball nugs of pure grape&#127815; goodness. not fussy at all. smooth smoke and tastes as it smells. it starts out in the head but eventually drifts to the body. any-time kinda smoke. keep smiling and y ou will fade out. not much purp color in the pheno I observed but still great jar appeal being triched out.not the strongest but definitely connoisseur grade. Top 3 best tasting flower I&#39;ve ever had. 5\u2b50...&#127815;goodness. MUST TRY!

VBeautiful looking. I&#39;d rate a 3.5 but rounding up. \u000aNugs I have are Phat Panda grown - not sure what their growing methods are - nugs are very very small, but dense and covered in tricomes., and literally half the leaves are solid purple - some nugs nearly all, some mostly green. Gorgeous, even if so small. Grinds to a nice fluffy but slightly spongy  - e.g. perfect. \u000aAroma is sweeeeeeeeet. Ultra berry with tiny bit of skunk and/or hoppiness. There&#39;s a forest of smell in it, but the berry-candy sweet comes through strongest.\u000aEffects for me are bizarre - like an indica that sits &quot;high&quot; is how I think of it - e.g. there&#39;a tingle that pulls you up rather than down. It&#39;s great. Behind the eyes and through the head. Quite a bit of focus left, zoned and not all that sleepy, but not shifty or anxious either. About 10 minutes in I had a bit of uneasiness, but it passed quickly (update below). I would say - be wary of smoking too much of this delicious little beast. I chased it 10 min later with some CBD bud (little-to-no THC Sour Tsunami) and was coasting from there. Really nice. Just really, really nice stuff. Would definitely like to try another grower&#39;s version as well.\u000a\u000aUpdate: not sure what it is but this Phat Panda stuff made me ultra paranoid on the second session a day later. Didn&#39;t have any more than previously but it tweaked me to high hell. Be careful with it and go slow. Set and setting and all that.

I wish I could give it high ratings too but I just can&#39;t.\u000a\u000aBubba&#39;s Gift smells wonderful, like sweet grape/berry. Mine tested at 17.30% THC and .04% CBD. The high, however, is just average, and took 4 bowls to kick in. I&#39;ve had lower THC strains kick in faster than this one.. So not a disappointment by any means but not in my top 10 either.

With effects more similar to a sativa, in the feelings of being energized, alert, and  very a.d.d. The smoke itself is very nice, mellow with an almost cheesey flavor on the exhale. Definitely a strain for getting shit done in an hour or two and then sawing some logs in a nap.
