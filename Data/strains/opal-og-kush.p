VPretty standard Indica type strain that has a pretty powerful sedative effect (80% Indica). I found myself relaxed and deep in thought (in a good way). This would be a good strain to use if you need to relieve stress and get some good sleep. In the right setting (for me comfortable and quiet) this may also help with anxiety as it allows one to think deeply and calmly.

VReally nice. A single hit on the vape gave me a pleasantly relaxed buzz that lasted an hour before tapering down and leaving me as chill as chill can be for the rest of the day.

VSolid Indica strain that will both relax and lighten your mood. \u000a\u000aNot a good strain if you need to be productive, but a solid strain for a night watching your favorite films, playing your favorite video games or exploring your artistic creativity. \u000a\u000aThere&#39;s a distinct smell to this bud, keep it wrapped tight or your whole room will smell! \u000a\u000aHighly recommended, probably not a good choice for novice smokers, but veteran consumers who want something to keep them euphoric and chilled, will enjoy this strain.

VThis indica herb is lovely. Smells and tastes of sweet, light lemon. The lemony-ness lingers shortly, is not overpowering and just tastes wonderful, great summer flavor. The package description says &#39;initial thoughtful couch posture&#39; and &#39;energetic bliss&#39;. I would mostly agree with this.
