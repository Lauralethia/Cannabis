VFirst off, smelled amazing. Almost like a strong IPA beer. The smell stayed long, almost into grape soda. Flavor is soft and full. At a low high, felt focused and happy. At the highest, napped like a boss.

VA lovely silver green bud that when taken in small dosages can leave the user calm and relaxed, any higher and an extreme lay down may be in order.

VUsually it takes me five ten minutes for me to feel anything. At least for the strong effects. This feels like a sensory dep float. Im aware of what&#39;s going on around me and I smell/taste the grape on exhale. Suffering from body pain, I feel this not just ease off but turn off. I am relaxed with this brilliant hybrid. The zone out effect is real but worth it. You will feel like a kid again. New favorite. Yes. \u000a\u000aYou deserve this beautiful bud in your personal harem of dank herb. Recommend sharing with a friend. It will keep you from running out.

VI came in looking for some LA Confidential and the bud tender steered me toward this. A lot of reviews say that this tastes like licorice. Now, I *hate* licorice, but decided to try this anyway. I&#39;d say it&#39;s more like  Jagermeister than straight up licorice. Mine also has some earthy notes. It also produces CRAZY amounts of smoke, even when vaping.\u000a\u000aThe first bowl was nice. Mellowed me out, opened my mind a tad, and relaxed me a bit. Minor dry eye, major munchies. It really amped up my sense of smell, too.\u000a\u000aSecond bowl about 2 hrs later was really niiiiice. No additional munchies, thankfully! Feeling a little heavier, nice body buzz. It&#39;s also doing what all great weed does to me -- amps up my libido. I can feel sleep coming on soon...
