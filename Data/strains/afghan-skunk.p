VMuy buena.\u000aTiene unos cogollos gordos, compactos, fuertes, con un olor bastante intenso, verde intensos de color.\u000a\u000aSabor y olor en claro estilo &quot;skunk&quot;, entre pungente y &quot;maloro skunk&quot; bastante claro, y despu&#233;s, deja un sabor m&#225;s seco, a tierra a madera.\u000aOptima indica, deja una sensaci&#243;n de relajaci&#243;n general importante, baja rapidamente tensi&#243;n y stress. Perfecta antes de acostarme, para relajarme mejor y reducir mi insomnio.\u000aPersonalmente no es de los sabores que mas me gusta, pero no esta mal.

VI had this strain under the name Silver Skunk. Such an amazing strain. Smells of citrus, mainly pineapple. It&#39;s a 70-30 indica dominant strain, and hits perfectly. Very smooth toke, but it loses it&#39;s citrus taste.

VI tested this strain from the mmjthc in vernon,bc. Beautiful looking flower, tricomes are definitely there and do they ever glisten, great job to the grower.\u000a     This strain is a very nice strain for bedtime or if you simply have pain and want to relax. It has a very nice taste and smell. I just find that near the end of a joint it gets more harsh than other strains will.\u000a    Oh i must say if you have a problem eating this might also be a good strain for you i find myself indulging haha.\u000aMmmmm, but if you mix it with the green crack extreme from mmjthc it is just wonderful i tell you.

VThe afghan shunk #1 that I&#39;ve been smoking throughout the summer 2016 is indoor grown. The taste &amp; smell profile is very sweet, &amp; piney almost like cotton candy meets New England pine. \u000a\u000aOk the high is absolutely time bending. Minutes will be hours and hours can be minutes. Although this strain is very indica dominant it gives you sativa euphoria ala Irish Kush. Very smooth, relaxing indica high with little couch lock. Though if i smoke it late it tends to shut my eyes for me. I experienced no paranoia or anxiety.

VWell this strain is one of those where i&#39;m not sure how to put it...the smell is pretty amazing skunkyness...with a hint of woody undertones the flavor is described as different I donated for a 1/4 of it and its one of those strains that i&#39;m glad to see gone from my inventory its really potent if you smoke too much it leaves your head up in the clouds

VMan, I really wanted to smell skunk for some reason. In my batch there was no hint of skunk at all and i was dissapointed haha. It smokes real nice though in a joint and smells and looks good. I use for anxiety to calm down, and sometimes i use marijuana to focus and be awake. This did neither. I had to smoke like 2 joints and a couple bowls before i was satisfied that id had enough medicine. Not the lowest potency weed i feel like ive had lately, but close. Did nothing for my issues. Could be chalked up to having to smoke so much to get the effects that i just quit before i reached that level. I dont know. Overall dissapointing. Maybe try again. If it smells skunky ;)

VDepending on who bred the strain and which afghani an skunk strains used  or Afghan x skunk #1 determines the quality. There are 100&#39;s of variations of this strain like N. Lights, Afghan Kush, AK-47, White widow and many other stabilized strains used for breeding all the hybrids of today. Everybody has a version but I&#39;m giving this 5 star rating to the breeder who I think has the best Afghan skunk, a company of breeders called Positronics had the best version so much so sannie another breeder has a version called Anesthesia I believe and it&#39;s in his Herijuana. That says something for the strain. At least 80-90% Indica with full body stone, narcotic and mind numbing, easy to grow decent yields can be achieved from topping to a 40&quot; round bush in s sea of green or any medium an grow method. Very potent
