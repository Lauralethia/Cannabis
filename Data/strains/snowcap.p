VThis is the greatest strain I have ever smoked ever. It wreaks even in a container, smells strongly of lemon scent, gives the greatest head/body high ever (I feel like my brain is massaging itself!) I feel super uplifted and energetic, and the high came on so fast. Oh man I&#39;m so baked right now from only a couple hits.

VWe were both a bit tired and almost ready for bed at 9:30pm, but after just a few hits (Vaporizer) we both felt full of energy and wide awake.  We were very happy, lively, chatty, full of fun and just having the best time of our lives.  Every single worry and stress we had was completely gone - only the good feelings remained.  The high lasted well after we went to bed - sometime past 1:30am.\u000a\u000a\u000a   Slept great and had some pretty cool dreams, too.  Currently our favorite...\u000a\u000a   [PROS:] Probably a good weed to have sex with.  Definitely gives you the energy to perform - along with a nice tingly feeling all over your body. If not sex, it&#39;s a good party weed...Try playing a party game like Taboo while on this stuff - FUNNY!\u000a\u000a   [CONS:] This is NOT a trance out, meditate, watch Baraka kinda of weed.  Please do not attempt such acts with this stuff.\u000a\u000a   [SUMMARY:] This is a get you high, have some fun, give you energy, laugh, joke and play kinda weed...Good for small groups. Goes well with a cold dessert wine (i.e. Mascato)

VExcellent hybrid strain. Focus has been a noticeable plus. This hybrid is also quite potent, making the experience an invigorating, creative, focused and happy one. For pain treatment, specifically migraines, tension headaches and even cluster headaches, SnowCap is one unique hybrid, keeps you alert and relaxed plus perfectly focused on whatever task you might have in front of you.

So potent, smoke a little harsh on throat, but definitely worth the cough attack. BEST PART = NO AFTER EFFECT. Stayed awake all night but once I closed my eyes to sleep still allowed me too.

VSnowcap has been a favorite strain of mine for 4 or 5 years now. The Snowcap i got in Humboldt was lemony smelling, big round dark green w hues of purple sometimes. It&#39;s still in my top 5 danks to this day after trying many other strains. Great for pain, depression, and helped w my GAD. I HIGHLY recommend, especially if u like the complex, citrus smelling buds.

VI was born and raised in Central California. At the age of 21, my girlfriend at the time and I moved to Kansas City, Missouri so she could attend art school.\u000a\u000aNow the bud in KCMO, well frankly... it&#39;s shit. Usually absolutely, disgusting Mexican Dirt Weed. When you bought it (at obscene prices...) it was always still completely flat from the giant bricks they press it into to smuggle it.\u000a\u000aI lived there from 2013-2015, about 2 1/2 years. Every time we would come back to California for Christmas, I would bring back an ounce or so of a mixture of FIRE California bud, and like a 1/2 oz of some Reggie (Which to the poor people in KC may as well be Top Shelf) to sell a little of to other art school kids.\u000a\u000aSo I meet this kid from Florida who had also just returned and had brought back an1/8th of &quot;Snowcap&quot;. I traded him a nug of our good stuff for one of the Snowcap.\u000a\u000aAnd man, it was quite possibly the most crystallized nug I&#39;ve ever seen. Now at this time I was smoking 3-5 joints of weed a day, so I had a pretty solid tolerance.\u000a\u000aSo I&#39;m on the phone with an ex-gf back in California, and I packed 1/3 of the bud into a partially emptied out cigarette (Ran out of papers to roll and couldn&#39;t find my pipe).\u000a\u000aNow 1/3 of a regular cigarette isn&#39;t much space. But I smoked this..... and suddenly realized: &quot;Oh no. Ohhhhhhhh no..... This issss... baaaad news. Front Page--Bad News...&quot;\u000a\u000aOne toke over the line.. Suddenly I couldn&#39;t really speak anymore, causing my ex to hang up on me. My heart is beating out of my chest- horrible panic attack. Worst I&#39;d had in years. Then I that my Valium was over on the window sill! I&#39;m save-! It&#39;s this moment I realize: &quot;Uh-oh... I can&#39;t move. I&#39;m literally paralyzed. Valium(aka: Salvation) only one. foot. away. And I cannot move. Which really just makes the panic worse...\u000a\u000aSO, after about 20 minutes I was able to shakily make it to my bed. This was the 2nd most stoned I have EVER BEEN EVER.\u000a\u000aMoral of the story? Buy the ticket, take the ride baby....\u000a\u000a-BONG THE RIPPER

VSnoCap is a great daytime strain, as most on here have already pointed out. I love smoking this strain as it gives you a nice medicated feel but doesn&#39;t impair you for mental activities. The smell is wonderful, and the amount of trichromes on the colas is just beautiful. It looks like the snow on top of a mountain peak. Also it makes everything seem more Wintery and Frozen.

VSnow Cap has me feeling light,energetic. Exercizing and stretching my body is a priority after a solid hit of Snow Cap.That&#39;s got to be a good thing,right? Snow Cap smokes very smoothly,in fact,the smoothest strain I&#39;ve ever smoked,bar none. Dry mouth is a side effect from smoking Snow Cap that I effectively address with Biotene rinse and by drinking plenty of water. Snow Cap gets a definite thumbs up from this reviewer.

VThis strain is what you make off it.  It gets you high but it seems like the more you smoke of it, the less potent it becomes. So dont oversmoke this strain expecting to get higher.  Defiantly a functioning high, not my favorite but it does help me face reality and gets rid of any negative feelings you might have.  7/10 worth a try, some of you might like it more than me.  Its really what you make of it

VI&#39;ve been looking for the elusive Headband, head high for the last couple of months. Living in the Midwest it is tough to get medical strains. This one was fun as it built up from the 4 hits I took. It starts in the head and then moves to the back of your eyes until you are just flat out happy. I&#39;m talkin, the kind of &quot;look at yourself in the mirror and laugh&quot; you will want to enjoy this one in the morning or middle of the day. The only down side is that it only lasts for a little while and the down buz isn&#39;t that great. So I guess smoke more !

VLooks dark green, almost purple. Smells like sprite, pine, citrus acidity. Tastes like a Forrest of Sprite. Not too harsh. Vaped in the Volcano. Provided by a local, personal grower. Immediately felt behind my eyes and in my head. Not racy, just another &#39;numb-skull&#39;. My eyes got low too. Not super strong but good for the head and good for the daytime. Great stress reliever. Not a super long hIgh. Will get again. Was cool day smoke. Higher rating due to it being an ideal daytime strain.

Body high allowed me to eat dinner. Head high slowed down a bit but socialable which was nice. What wasn&#39;t nice was the meds crashing hard 2 hours later. Must be a sativa dominant.

Vone of my top three favorite strains. uplifting and energetic, yet small body high that relaxes - definitely get the giggles on this one. doesn&#39;t cause me to want to eat everything in sight like some other strains. works great for both running errands and just relaxing on the couch with Netflix all day. super helpful for anxiety and stress.

VI&#39;ve been looking for the elusive Headband, head high for the last couple of months. Living in the Midwest it is tough to get medical strains. This one was fun as it built up from the 4 hits I took. It starts in the head and then moves to the back of your eyes until you are just flat out happy. I&#39;m talkin, the kind of &quot;look at yourself in the mirror and laugh&quot; you will want to enjoy this one in the morning or middle of the day. The only down side is that it only lasts for a little while and the down buz isn&#39;t that great. So I guess smoke more !

VSnowcap is one of those strains that affect everybody differently. I have become a staunch devotee of this strain, while my girlfriend avoids it like the plague. Based on MY personal account of it, creativity is noticeably enhanced, mood is stable, my mind tends to mellow and slow down to embrace tasks one at a time, rather than multitasking and freaking out. My girlfriend, however, becomes VERY paranoid, can\u2019t keep her thoughts straight, and takes up to 6 CBD oil drops when it becomes too much to handle. The point is this: if you are a sativa fan, you\u2019ll love it. Indica worshippers might not. Just like any other strain, different people will respond differently. Just take it slow...duh.

VI&#39;ve been looking for the elusive Headband, head high for the last couple of months. Living in the Midwest it is tough to get medical strains. This one was fun as it built up from the 4 hits I took. It starts in the head and then moves to the back of your eyes until you are just flat out happy. I&#39;m talkin, the kind of &quot;look at yourself in the mirror and laugh&quot; you will want to enjoy this one in the morning or middle of the day. The only down side is that it only lasts for a little while and the down buz isn&#39;t that great. So I guess smoke more !

V4rating for potency BUT I did not enjoy my experience with this particular strain. I was gifted it and gave it a try when what I normally use as medicine ran out and I didn&#39;t have anything else. this one definitely felt like a total sativa to me and gave me terrible anxiety which caught me totally off guard. I&#39;m bipolar 2+PTSD diagnosis and deal with anxiety daily. I&#39;m writing this review because I was curious and looked SnowCap up and had a very different reaction to what others have been reporting. Just wanted to give a heads up to anyone who might have these factors which added with this strain became very unpleasant even by a daily sufferer of anxiety&#39;s standards... It&#39;s not a low quality strain, just not what I expected...

VNot a fan. This is the Sativa high I do not like. Absolutely not recommend for people with anxiety. I have really mild anxiety but two puffs off my spoon pipe and I was freaked out about death and on an anxiety trip for the next hour. I had to turn something really funny on for the next few hours. If you want a sativia I would do Maui wow wowwie or pink lemonade instead.

Great strain, I believethe one I had was the Snow x Haze, but makes you wonder as it has a catpiss smell, it\u2019s definitely Sativa and too much causes me anxiety and paranoia but I love the flavour!

VHOLY SHIT. Made a firecracker using 1.7g of this and I was completely gone. Turns out that firecracker was anywhere between 357-408mg THC. I didn\u2019t know this beforehand because I had never bothered to calculate the exact potency of my edibles, only how many grams I was putting into them. Well needless to say that much THC was a bit much. And by that I mean I was completely fucked. Especially considering this strain is as pure of a sativa as I\u2019ve ever seen. When you smoke it there is a strong spike of a head high with almost no indica effects.

VIm not a very big fan of sativa&#39;s but this one is one of the best ones I&#39;ve tried to this date. The high is cerebral and very energetic. I got medicated and started cleaning the whole house LOL This is one of those strains you can medicate on in the morning right when you wake up. It mellows you out but at the same time it gives you crazy amounts of energy. Perfect for productive people that want to get things done. It will make you feel happy and outgoing; which is another thing I liked from this strain.

VI didn&#39;t like this strain. It was very energetic. There wasn&#39;t a big body high. After one bowl I became very anxious and paranoid for hours. I didn&#39;t want to be around people. In fact, people scared the crap out of me. I&#39;m a regular smoker, and I&#39;ve never reacted this way to a hybrid. I&#39;ve had short term anxiety on certain strains (for example, OG kush can make me anxious), but I&#39;ve never had a strain induce a full blow panic attack. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this if you suffer from anxiety or PTSD like I do.

Not suitable for beginners. Even though this is a sativa strain it packs a strong potency from its beautifully frosted condensed nugs. Definitely an uplifting, motivational, and creative enhancer. Smooth scent of lemongrass and a taste of citrus. This is a Must try I enjoyed this strain even though I&#39;m a huge indica fan. Get a little bit of dry eyes but no low eyes.

Smoked cool and menthol like with some chocolate flavor in there similar to the chocolate of chocolope but drowned out my the earthy kushy flavor with the cool minty note. Covered in resin.

It looks almost engineered in how it grows into healthy fat and dense buds that are COVERED in Orange-Red hairs and white THC crystals. It is the most distinct smelling and looking strain I&#39;ve ever come by. I was hesitant at first because the smell and amount of white crystals and kief in between the dense almost unnatural looking amount of hairs, some of which were thicker placed almost looking like tree moss. To be honest at first I thought it was laced or compacted herb but no I can assure the buyer it sure is Sativa. It is a mix between strong lemon/grapefruit/citrus and ammonium scent. It is a little pungent for my liking but friends love it. I have noticed it is hard to judge how much to smoke as it doesn&#39;t have the sleepy cutoff of Indica. I have noticed it is very ineffective in treating my depression and PTSD, as my mind usually functions at a high rate normally (diagnosed with multiple depression and add issues). On this strain I go ADD on everything or am stuck on one topic for hours. By that I mean my browser will have 15+ tabs ranging from different videos, articles, descriptions, pictures, social media, etc. when I am in a good mood and smoke, also good for video gaming. BUT, when I am depressed as I am now and have some nonviolent PTSD, it is basically a one way focus on my biggest suffering in which I cannot smoke more and escape from. So basically it enhanced my PTSD and depression and multiplied the feelings while making my mind so focused on that one thing that I cannot escape or relieve myself of suffering until I fall asleep by taking an ambien. It is a real hit or miss strain for me. Best recommended for college students wanting to focus on homework or on research assignments and or cramming before finals. Can be a social clear-headed day strain.\u000a NOT GOOD FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR PARANOIA.

VI purchased what was called just &quot;Snow&quot;, so I&#39;ll assume it is about the same thing as &quot;Snowcap&quot;. Overall, it&#39;s a pleasurable strain. I enjoy playing basketball after taking about 3-4 hits. The one thing I noticed recently is that it doesn&#39;t help me when lifting weights. Having even a small high made lifting more strenuous. I couldn&#39;t do as many reps as usual with my normal amount of weight. Even push-ups were more difficult. Muscle burn is more intense and comes on faster. So I experienced less stamina where strength is concerned.  On the basketball court, strength is less necessary for success... playing the game well is more about speed and anticipation of the offense and defense, and about having a jumpshot... so I plan on continuing to use &quot;Snow&quot; before playing basketball.

Smells fruity and has a citrus-y lemon-y flavor.  Hits pretty hard and definitely tickles the throat enough to make you cough like a mofo!\u000aVery euphoric high, mellow and positive, got alot of really good ideas while high on it. did give me a pretty decent case of the munchies and was a long lasting high.  \u000aThe end of the high lets you down slowly but did make me go nearly comatose, like i was so tired i couldn&#39;t move! all around great smoke!

VSnowcap has been a favorite strain of mine for 4 or 5 years now. The Snowcap i got in Humboldt was lemony smelling, big round dark green w hues of purple sometimes. It&#39;s still in my top 5 danks to this day after trying many other strains. Great for pain, depression, and helped w my GAD. I HIGHLY recommend, especially if u like the complex, citrus smelling buds.

VFirst off the name says it all this one cold top notch strain! Can you dig it? If you want to have a perfect wake and bake or after work energy smoke session this is the perfect strain. Not suitable for beginners. Even though this is a sativa strain it packs a strong potency from its beautifully frosted condensed nugs. Definitely an uplifting, motivational, and creative enhancer. Smooth scent of lemongrass and a taste of citrus. This is a Must try I enjoyed this strain even though I&#39;m a huge indica fan. Get a little bit of dry eyes but no low eyes.

VHOLY SHIT. Made a firecracker using 1.7g of this and I was completely gone. Turns out that firecracker was anywhere between 357-408mg THC. I didn\u2019t know this beforehand because I had never bothered to calculate the exact potency of my edibles, only how many grams I was putting into them. Well needless to say that much THC was a bit much. And by that I mean I was completely fucked. Especially considering this strain is as pure of a sativa as I\u2019ve ever seen. When you smoke it there is a strong spike of a head high with almost no indica effects.

Thick smoke that doesn&#39;t rally smell like anything different.  High is nice and mellow, lasts a good hour and a half with no cliff, it just drifts off.

Rather it just tapered off and I settled into a good book.  I don&#39;t like it when I feel like I need a nap-- I have shit to do!\u000a\u000aI should say that I did take a major toke and did get fairly paranoid for about 30 minutes, which was uncomfortable.

VNOT GOOD FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR PARANOIA. BEWARE! \u000aFirst of all the smell is EXTREMELY pungent and can be smelled through many plastic bags and even medicine canisters. It looks almost engineered in how it grows into healthy fat and dense buds that are COVERED in Orange-Red hairs and white THC crystals. It is the most distinct smelling and looking strain I&#39;ve ever come by. I was hesitant at first because the smell and amount of white crystals and kief in between the dense almost unnatural looking amount of hairs, some of which were thicker placed almost looking like tree moss. To be honest at first I thought it was laced or compacted herb but no I can assure the buyer it sure is Sativa. It is a mix between strong lemon/grapefruit/citrus and ammonium scent. It is a little pungent for my liking but friends love it. I have noticed it is hard to judge how much to smoke as it doesn&#39;t have the sleepy cutoff of Indica. I have noticed it is very ineffective in treating my depression and PTSD, as my mind usually functions at a high rate normally (diagnosed with multiple depression and add issues). On this strain I go ADD on everything or am stuck on one topic for hours. By that I mean my browser will have 15+ tabs ranging from different videos, articles, descriptions, pictures, social media, etc. when I am in a good mood and smoke, also good for video gaming. BUT, when I am depressed as I am now and have some nonviolent PTSD, it is basically a one way focus on my biggest suffering in which I cannot smoke more and escape from. So basically it enhanced my PTSD and depression and multiplied the feelings while making my mind so focused on that one thing that I cannot escape or relieve myself of suffering until I fall asleep by taking an ambien. It is a real hit or miss strain for me. Best recommended for college students wanting to focus on homework or on research assignments and or cramming before finals. Can be a social clear-headed day strain.\u000a NOT GOOD FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR PARANOIA.

VUplifting, happy, and makes me connect with the outdoors. The pickup I got was super dense and covered in orange hairs. Smelled like pine and menthol,a bit chocolatety, extremely memorable. Smoked cool and menthol like with some chocolate flavor in there similar to the chocolate of chocolope but drowned out my the earthy kushy flavor with the cool minty note. Covered in resin. Wonderful in a joint.

VI didn&#39;t like this strain. It was very energetic. There wasn&#39;t a big body high. After one bowl I became very anxious and paranoid for hours. I didn&#39;t want to be around people. In fact, people scared the crap out of me. I&#39;m a regular smoker, and I&#39;ve never reacted this way to a hybrid. I&#39;ve had short term anxiety on certain strains (for example, OG kush can make me anxious), but I&#39;ve never had a strain induce a full blow panic attack. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this if you suffer from anxiety or PTSD like I do.

VSnowcap is a top 10 hybrid for me. The sativa effects are amazing, but still doesn&#39;t pack the punch that I think it could. Not a bad bud at all, definitely very euphoric .

VI give it a 4.7. Its super lemon flavoring after and taste amazing literally every hit. Select makes a great co2 cartridge. It&#39;s pretty cheap for a gram too. It needs to be strong that&#39;s only it. But still gets the job done. I prefer heavy hitters.

VSo glad I went and got the deal that was available for this strain. Definitely worth it! Almost immediate body and head buzz after a few hits. Tastes of lemon with a hint of a diesel smell. Really a beautiful bud with dark and light green leaves, long dark orange hairs. Amazing. &#128525;

VThis strain kicked in hard and fast. I felt very euphoric and uplifted; I smoked it at night, alone, which I feel wasn&#39;t the perfect choice, but overall it has me feeling really stress free and motivated to do stuff (I settled for cleaning up my apartment a bit). I definitely want to try it again but during the day with a good friend.

VIm not a very big fan of sativa&#39;s but this one is one of the best ones I&#39;ve tried to this date. The high is cerebral and very energetic. I got medicated and started cleaning the whole house LOL This is one of those strains you can medicate on in the morning right when you wake up. It mellows you out but at the same time it gives you crazy amounts of energy. Perfect for productive people that want to get things done. It will make you feel happy and outgoing; which is another thing I liked from this strain.

VPersonally i can&#39;t get enough of this sativa dominant hybrid, with humboldt snow crossed with haze makes this strain excellent for the day time usage, with nugs as frosty as  the rockies, and a lemon pepper type smell, the flavours dive deep with this one, as well as the effects, i use this strain on a daily basis its a perfect way to start off my morning with a nice cerebral buzz, following along with a nice creative and energetic type high

VI was pleasantly surprised with snowcap. I picked it up from a local collective that just opened. They didn&#39;t have a ton of strains yet but what they did have looked, and smelled great. I talked to the grower, it was a nice change of pace. He explained his grow process for the snowcap and said that it would be a good fit for pain.\u000aThe high was a bit of a creeper. I took about 2 or 3 rips on the vaporizer and I was flying. I didn&#39;t have a care in the world and forgot that I was ever in pain. The one downfall to this med (at least for being a sativa) was that when the high started to wind down I became tired. It wasn&#39;t a bad thing really though. I slept for quite a wile and woke up ready for the day!\u000aIf you have a chance to try this strain, I would try it!

VUsually when I smoke I do bong hits, but every now and then I have to use a pipe which I don&#39;t much prefer as much because in my opinion the taste is not as good. However, this strain tastes the best out of any strain I&#39;ve smoked from a pipe, and it tastes super yummy from the bong too. This strain gives me a great high, and really helps to relax and numb any soreness I may have. Would always go back to this strain for sure

VI wasn&#39;t sure about this strain as price was a mid shelf. I took a shot based on reviews and info and am HAPPY I did. Buds are tight, resinous with a heady smell of the forest and fresh cut grass with a tint of citrus. \u000aVaped as my first medicine today and this is a nice creeper with a great overall body high. \u000aDefinitely the best value or steal of a deal I have seen!!\u000aLady is on my grocery list of repeat strains.

VNOT FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PARANOIA, OR ANY MENTAL ILLNESS RELATED TO DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY! \u000a\u000aThis is a strain for the *happy* average college student or any kind of worker really. It can be energizing, enhancing in focus and brain power, and uplifting in the search for knowledge. It is a relatively clear headed high that doesn&#39;t have a low over-do limit like most Indicas and Hybrids. \u000a\u000aOthers have recommended it for Depression, PTSD, and Anxiety but I highly advise AGAINST doing that. I suffer from all three and usually have a lightly enhanced level of paranoia no matter what strain I smoke. That being said this strain made my mind so focused on the feelings that are bringing me the most suffering, while energizing me so I can&#39;t easily fall asleep to escape. No matter what I&#39;ve done to get myself out of fits after smoking this while feeling lost, I could not. My mind would go directly back to that negative feeling and images flashed in my mind of memories tied to the cause of the suffering. As you could imagine, not too fun. \u000a\u000aAbout it: It looks fake, to put it bluntly. It is the most distinct strain in many ways that I&#39;ve come across. It is PUNGENTLY lemon/ammonia smelling that is overpowering sometimes to some, very pleasurable for others. It also gives the appearance of being fake because it buds in dense fat nuggets that are lighter green and almost covered in THC and vibrant colored hairs. HAIRS everywhere! Definitely one of the hairiest strains I have ever seen, and I have had it tested to make sure it wasn&#39;t some other herb compress or fake weed. It is indeed just a very distinct and bold strain of Sativa. \u000a\u000aI would recommend buying a small amount and seeing how it effects you. I&#39;ve seen positive and negative reviews for Depression, Anxiety, ADD/ADHD, and mental disorders so it seems the strain chooses the smoker in a way. \u000a\u000aGive it a shot if you have taken or have needed to take medications like Ritalin, Adderall, Welbutrin, or similar drugs. Or if you are one of those college &quot;dopers&quot; cramming for finals.

VVery chill, makes me feel centered. Cerebral, but my thoughts feel relaxed rather than full of the rapid edginess some sativas evoke in me. I&#39;m a little sleepy, but that might be because I was up at 4:30. Wouldn&#39;t choose it as a go-to sativa, and it won&#39;t become one of our staples, but I definitely like it. I read other reviews saying it can cause anxiety. I haven&#39;t had that issue, and I&#39;m prone to it with sativas, but if you are, too, maybe hit and sit is the way to go--you might find it really pleasant in low doses or mixed in with an indica.

VI&#39;m kind of a noob, but thought this strain was a bit harsh to smoke from a pipe. But holy crap once it hit me I was in my own little world and I just thought about so much stuff that I can&#39;t even remember. It made me kinda dizzy though so I had to lay down which ruined my friends fun a little, and I threw up until I was empty (no I wasn&#39;t drunk). It was still a good time though my friend had a bouncy house and we chilled in that for a while after wrestling and playing soccer with an enormous beach ball in it.
