VIf you suffer from anxiety and stress like I do then this strain is sure to help. its a great morning strain helped get the wheels turning and the creativity flowing. Has a really noticeable citrus taste that is sure to get the taste buds going. Great for crushing social anxiety a mist try.

VChemdawg as a sativa?!?! Snowdawg is a strain I was interested in trying for a while and it met expectations well. The bud was sage to light green with forest green calyxes, brown pistols, and sparkling trichomes. This bud was the opposite of dense, anti-dense if you will; &quot;So fluffy I&#39;m gonna Die&quot;. The scent and taste of this flower was sweet/flowery and musky with some earthiness. Good cerebral high. the first few rips from my 16&quot; grav straight tube had me feeling UP for a good amount of time. I don&#39;t know if it was the pipe or the bud but it was good. Definitely uplifting/slightly energizing while keeping focus alive. Nausea was not experienced, hunger tended to take its place. Great sativa for getting through the day.

VIncredible. My favorite sativa so far. Makes me real thirsty and a little hungry. High lasts a decent amount of time too. Great for day time anything. Has a great citrusy pungent smell, fluffy when fresh, lots of crystals. Also known as G6 in the medicinal community in NJ.

VGreat tasting pot that hits hard and fast, both in the head and body. However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for people suffering with anxiety issues. I have smoked pot several times a day for the past 14 years to relieve my anxiety. I smoked two one-hitter bowls and found it actually sent me into a anxiety  attack. That&#39;s the first time smoking pot has ever triggered an attack instead of relax me. It was a great high still, but the anxiety attack that came with it was not worth it.

V\u2600\ufe0f &#161;good morning, sunshine! \u2600\ufe0f \u000a\u000aThis is an excellent choice as daytime strain-favorite when one needs to have energy, be creative + productive, with a smile on your face bc pain is managed + anxiety&#39;s by the wayside.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m presently water-bonging T 21% Super Snow Dog (cultivated by Curaleaf in Simsbury CT) and, while taste is vaguely-citrusy, it&#39;s more woods-y \u2013 both is flavor and physicality. Not impressed with trim-job, and I&#39;m not even one to notice EXCEPT that it&#39;s quite obvious! ..stems galore &amp; disappoint-ment abounds.. smh, bc they also produce my ULTIMATE|ALL TIME-FAVORITE oils: any single strain, any day of the week! \u000a\u000aBUT -- I must say -- this glorious sativa FAR-compensates for Curaleaf&#39;s &#39;bad bud-cut&#39; by euphorically punching me in the brain!\u000a  \u000a\u2600\ufe0fSo all is forgiven &amp; I am once-again \u2014&gt;\u2600\ufe0f

VI was quite interested and curious to try this one\u2013 as I LOVE to try the flower-form of my favorite oils, and vice versa. While I smoked a joint of this G6 only 10 mins ago, I normally have full onset of effects by now.. and the results are ..well, ..NOT-abysmal (lol), as well as NOT what I expected from this T25 flower. My back pain began at a 7 and is prob at 6 now, presently 15 mins after intake. And while I&#39;m content and happy and relaxed, I&#39;m not sure how much of it is thanks to our snowy, furry friend..

VI have to go against the grain on this one - first strain ever that I could not finish a chamber (vaporizer) of, and I&#39;m not very picky. Anxiety is one reason I come to cannabis and this stuff just makes it worse for me. They can&#39;t all be winners for everyone.

VJust picked up some Budder at 76%  I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Very heady but slowly comes over the body. Looking forward to picking up some more

VFantastic strain. Smells like citrus and fuel w/ some funkyness. Powerful sativa effects that leave you feeling excellent and focused. A nice smooth strain. Effects are definitely sativa dominant.

VSSD takes the crown for the most delicious tasting bud I&#39;ve ever tried. I always make sure I purchase only top-shelf flowers and this one earns its place with the rest. It&#39;s a fantastic high that keeps you focused, enthusiastic, up for anything for anything. Listen to some really great music, roll a joint and smoke a few bowls cuz SSD is the password to a good time.\u000a

So it has a better consistency to break it up .. Never had it hydro so I wonder. Great cerbral .. happy productive high. My PTSD always gets me with a sativas (benefits over negatives) ..
