VThis is a top 5 strain I have ever had.  It&#39;s taste is hardly given justice by the desciption &quot;Fruity&quot;(at least for the grower I got it from over a decade ago in the Seattle area).\u000a\u000a  It has a stimulating high, well capable of cognizance and clarity in my experiences.  But this was a long time ago I had smoked this, so my memory isn&#39;t totally pure...  (And my tolerance back then was pretty darn high).\u000a\u000aIn my experiences the taste of the cannabis is a bit better than the smell of it, for this strain.  The smell is heavenly, so that says a lot.\u000a\u000a I give this strain a 10/10.  I think the strain I smoked could be top 5 in cannabis cup in a year, it was that good.  And I have smoked cannabis cup winners before,...not comprehensively by any means, but that may change with time as my state(Oregon) just legalized Dispensary sales to 21+! (One of the best days of my life:)\u000a\u000a I highly recommend Tutti Fruiti if you can manage to find it(if it&#39;s from an experienced and/or good grower).

VThis was a good way to medicate seeing as a half ounce is 125 in New Mexico, which was beyond reasonable. Great outdoor grown California smoke , Citrus scent at first then accompanied by hints of Diesel and skunk. Only takes 1 bowl to gain relief, this is mostly Sativa so it will get you going in the morning and throughout the day, I did become more &quot;immune&quot; to the strain after 7 grams though.

VNOT GOOD FOR ANXIETY. Tastes amazing, very bright and fruity. Kind of a creeper, 25 minutes in I was hit by a strong spinning body high. Comes in waves, hard to focus on one thing (in my case the presidential debates), echoey, and an uncomfortable warming head and neck sensation/pressure. Warning for this strain if you have dissociation struggles. I was fighting off a panic attack halfway through. But when it was good it was great. Very Euphoric.

VTutti Frutti. After only two tiny hits of this I&#39;m already feeling it&#39;s effects. Leafly says the effects come on slow, but for me (3 times now) it&#39;s fast-acting for sure! The flavor is indeed a bit fruity, maybe berry-like, and a bit earthy in flavor as well, and I admit that I can imagine an almost tropical flavor-- not citrus, but something kinda tropical... Almost Pine kissed with Mint. The appealing names of some of these strains can really lead one to expect something more from (or something else than) what the strain actually tastes like, and Tutti Fruity is no exception... Maybe it tastes fantastic vaped or in edibles, and I most certainly do enjoy it&#39;s taste in my freshly cleaned glass pipe here; I simply find it to be an unremarkable flavor despite it&#39;s appealing name. That said, it IS a remarkable strain! Fast-acting, heady, &amp; potent, Tutti Frutti leaves me happy, perhaps a bit motivated, probably socially \u201con\u201d if I was out in public &amp; not typing this from my PC, itching to go do something fun. And it&#39;s a bit relaxing as well; my \u201citching\u201d is not anxiety, so much as contained excitement for all the other awesome things I can do once I finish typing this sentence. ;-D

VI&#39;ve always been an infrequent smoker.  With age came a high stress job, chronic pain issues, and all that fun, adult stuff so I started looking more seriously at medical use. A friend supplied me with some wonderful stuff recently - Tutti Frutti.  I certainly haven&#39;t tried every strain out there, or even the majority, but this is hands down my new favorite. Smells and tastes wonderful - beautiful fruity taste on exhale. Pleasant cerebral buzz yet leaves you clear headed. Very relaxing, but no couch lock. Decent body effect, nice pain relief, but not overpowering. I can mildly feel the effects in seconds then it kicks up a notch after about 30 minutes. They seem to have captured the best both Sativa and Indica have to offer while eliminating the negatives. I really can&#39;t say enough good things about this strain. Personally I highly recommend it.

VReading all these other reviews makes me wonder if I possibly got a bad batch because the batch I got tasted and smelled nowhere near fruity, more like bark dust and hay. Not a bad strain effect-wise, definitely a daytime strain with lots of energy and happy feelings, went on a hike after a couple bowls and it made the experience 100 percent better, I&#39;m usually not the hiking kind of person. Overall not a terrible strain but also not an amazing strain, only thing holding it back was taste and smell, hopefully I can come across some more soon and give it another try.
