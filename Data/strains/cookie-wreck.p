VMy name is Michael. And I have MS. This is the best strain that I&#39;ve smoked in my life. I&#39;ve smoked a lot of different strains. But with my disease my balance is off bad. But when I tried Cookie Wreck people thought I was crazy. But it helped my balance so much. And I wished that I lived in a state that was legal for it. But l guess I will keep on going the way I am. With out.

VThis strain has definitely moved itself up there to my top favorites.  As soon as I ground the buds up I could smell the cookie like aroma.. The buds when ground up come to a very satisfying fluffy flower with the scents of cookie, sweet, mint, earthy. \u000a\u000aI rolled a blunt last night and cookie wreck wrecked me to sleep.  I doze off into a wonderful nights rest after enjoying 45 mins of tv, smiling, and relaxation on the sofa.  \u000a\u000aThis morning I awoke to the Bong bowl loaded with a fat bowl of the cookie wreck.  I was still pretty tired and I even felt a bit high still from the previous blunt of cookie wreck; which was more of a Stoney, sleepy, relaxation, stuck/couchlock high at this point. I simply could have just shut my eyes and fallen right back to sleep, but no I decided to enjoy the wake and bake of the cookie wreck.  As I hit the bowl of course the cookie aroma spread throughout the air. And the inhale was smooth with an exhale of sweetness and euphoria soon after.  I was awake for 30mins to an hour and then gladly fell back asleep.  Cookie wreck is bomb!! &#127850;

VPotent hybrid that gives you a strong cerebral buzz with good pain relief. Smooth smoke with a sweet subtle vanilla after taste. Spacey buzz that had me feeling euphoric and focused at first but drifted into mild couch lock after a while. Long lasting effect though, good for creativity. 4.5/5.

VOK my name is Michael Carroll. I&#39;m 48 years old. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2007 and my balance is bad. And I tried Cookie Wreck and it helped my balance. I wished that it was legal here where I live. I live in Mississippi. And I can&#39;t pay what they want for it. So I&#39;ll just have to keep going the way that I am.

VWOW! I&#39;m a big fan of GSC I love Cookies and Cream, Cookies and milk, but this is defiantly the best. Immediate weight to right behind the eyes, the taste isn&#39;t as good as cookies and cream which freaking tastes like a vanilla cookie, but it&#39;s got everything you want in a good concentrate/flower potency, smell, and taste.

VLove this strain. It is a cross between Girl Guide Cookies and Trainwreck and is a fast acting hybrid with indica like effects.  I love this strain for relaxing in the evening or in the backyard after a long day of work.   It makes me feel happy, relaxed and peaceful.  This strain helped with my anxiety and reduced ongoing arthritis pain, making going for a swim a possibility for me.   It has a beautiful, sweet taste, and is sure to put a smile on anyones face.

VThis strain is a perfect combination. I usually dislike hybrids however I felt incredibly relaxed and at ease within my body. This strain is a pleasure to all five senses, its a very beautiful strain to look at. With a fantastic smell and taste, the GSC earthy notes hit the nose and then rampaging behind that is the sweetness of Trainwreck. The high is unreal, very fast acting and not quite a couch locker but it will definitely keep me around the house. Fox street does it sooooo right. Vaped at 392 thru Volcano, 5 bags.

VThis is a review for Barbasol, which I THINK is the same as this strain? I&#39;m a novice and have chronic anxiety - much to my surprise, Barbasol did not help calm me. I was struggling hard with a lot of racing thoughts and fears that everyone was mad at me. The raciness was uncomfortable and caused me to tense up my muscles a lot which contributed more to my nerve pain. I was too confused to crochet, which is normally a favorite pastime while high, and had a difficult time understanding how to use Netflix. It was uncomfortably disorienting for me. From what I understand this is basically the opposite of what it is supposed to do, so perhaps I react very differently from most (I struggle with finding strains that don&#39;t cause nervousness anyway). I probably need to look more into indica strains and high CBD.

VWow! This strain kicked me right into the couch. Literally, I was asleep within 30 minutes of my first bowl, and it&#39;s pretty rare for a hybrid to knock me out like that. \u000a\u000aI wasn&#39;t expecting the sleepy effect, and that&#39;s not really my style high, but if someone is looking for a strain that will put you to bed like sleeping beauty, check this one out.

VAbsolutely incredible euphoria.  I found my creativity to be buffed, and my ability to stop eating to be debuffed.\u000a\u000aThis turned me into a relaxed, snack-seeking artist who didn&#39;t care about anything except being a relaxed artist who doesn&#39;t care about anything.\u000a\u000aCookie Wreck is my favorite strain of anything, ever.  Great when combined with a sativa, too.

VI have some flower that has a 1:1 CBD to THC ratio. Not only do I find the smoke to be absolutely delicious. This is my go-to medication, as it does wonders on my PSTD and ADHD, while giving me just enough of a high to feel it, but not feel impaired at all.

VI really enjoyed this flower! It has put me into such a happy but cerebral high that I have to think about being high! If that makes all the sense! This is on my top 20 of all time! Would recommend this to all that need stress and anxiety related issues! Also great for social anxiety!j\u000aJaybird

VThis was my second dispensary buy, 7g lasted me almost two weeks which is unheard of, I average about 7g a week.  Excellent mellow high without being sleepy.  That&#39;s the best part was it never really wore me out but was uplifting and clear for hours after a smoking session.

VStill new to reviews.  This stuff was a nice middle ground.  Perfect for chilling on the couch or anywhere around the house.  A bit of a dry mouth, but immediate relaxation without sleepiness.  Perfect for end of day, wind down before bed time.
