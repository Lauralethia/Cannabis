VTried this for the first time on recommendation of the young lady Karla that was working...Needless to say it is AMAZING!!!!!  I have an extremely high tolerance to most medications and this one did the job extremely well.  It is a 50/50/ hybrid and it is the only one besides the Sour Diesel that has helped alleviate a multitude of pains.  That said....it is not for the light weights...if you are a lightweight for lack of a better term I would suggest first time users do only 2 puffs to start.  LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! This particular strain!

VI&#39;d have to say that of all of the Sativas I&#39;ve sampled, Grape Stomper is my favorite. It provides an energized buzz that&#39;s great for being productive, in fact, it makes me feel as though I&#39;ve had a couple cups of coffee...I also found Grape Stomper to provide noticeable relief from pain...

VI really, really, really want to love this strain, but I just can&#39;t give 5 stars.  Nothing personal against it but I have a bad reaction.  I call this my grape bubblicious Perma-grin strain--tastes great.  The first 30-45 minutes of smoking gives me this sh*t eating grin and a very happy, relaxed feeling, but then I pay the price. I go dark without warning...start beating myself up and think I&#39;m the most horrific person in the world. Maybe others have a different reaction, but just thought I would share my reaction.

VThis is an okay strain, not the best I&#39;ve ever smoked, but not the worst either. I&#39;m more of a Sativa smoker, I like the head high. This strain made me extremely relaxed, but creative and talkative at the same time. My body has slight tingles from the waist up, and overall was an enjoyable high. I don&#39;t care for the taste, it really tastes like sour grapes. The buds I got were huge,sticky, and dense. Recommended for people who have anxiety,  stress, or are just looking to relax by yourself or with friends.

VFirst and foremost this is a good strain for people who just started smoking and/or don&#39;t necessarily like the other high THC strains. I got this strain at NETA Brookline with a TAC of 16.6%.\u000a\u000aHowever, personally for me this high was too mild and helped the pain just a little bit. To be completely honest I was really let down by this strain. Maybe I just got my hopes up but as a hybrid the high is really weak and I don&#39;t even have a high tolerance. It actually does smell like an artificial grape candy, which is great! \u000a\u000aAfter the hour or so of a mild head high (barely helped pain either) it goes into a little bit of couch lock. In conclusion, this is a good strain for pain and maybe for someone who wants to stay focused and work productively. I can imagine if someone is not looking for strong medicine this could be for them.

V&#39;Grape Stomper&#39; 3.8/5 Smell is typical skunkiness with a tinge of fruitiness. One bowl out a medium sized bubbler. Effects are quick to onset in the head, with a typical hybrid buzz not characteristic of a sativa or indica, but somewhere in the middle. Body high sets in a couple moments later with a nice energetic tingle that fades with time. Not a bad one, but there isn&#39;t anything particularly noteworthy about  this one.

VGrape Stomper gives you more of a cerebral relaxation  than in the body, although by relaxing the mind, you keep a relaxed body by association. Its a social friendly strain, meaning that you can maintain a rather serious conversation without getting panicky or zoning out. For a rookie or seasoned stoner/patient will work smoothly, instead of feeling &quot;the hit&quot;. Grape Stomper is a pleasant experience that will help you glide through day and night, do all things you need to do and still feel relaxed, happy and at peace.

VPurchased under the moniker Grape Stomper at a local dispensary. Fuity, berry goodness. The berry flavor on this was like a punch to the brain, shockingly strong and pungent, even in the form of budder. Gives some nice daytime pain relief, mildly sedating but still functional. Leaves me floating through my day. My only complaint is that it&#39;s a little too cerebral for my liking, making it easy to get lost in one&#39;s thoughts. I&#39;d recommend using this towards the end of the day, best used as a pre-dinner stone if you ask me.

This is truly the only thing that helps relieve my pain. I&#39;ve tried all the over-the-counter pain meds/anti-inflammatories and they don&#39;t come close to providing me the relief I need like Grape Stomper does.

VThis strain was a nice wake and bake. Woke up rolled up a joint, first thing you notice is the grape smell just from the buds. As you smoke you get a sweet taste. As you medicate you feel fast acting relief and energy but you are high as shit. Good for mornings and mid day smoke breaks.

VThis is a fantastic strain...I\u2019m a patient in Massachusetts and I\u2019m using this as a distillate vape cartridge and it\u2019s amazingly tasty and it certainly does the trick! I feel much better,less anxious which is a HUGE PROBLEM FOR ME,ANXIETY!! I always try to choose Indica or a Hybrid that\u2019s more of an Indica but again loving this strain Grape Stomper,I\u2019m a New Fan!! \u270c&#127995;\u2665\ufe0f&#129303;Sara from Massachusetts

VThis is my first time smoking Grape Stomper and I would have to give it an 9/10 for taste. It\u2019s really sweet with only a hint of sour. All together it\u2019s probably an 8/10. It has made me feel very relaxed and almost euphoric but it has given me headache. Probably won\u2019t buy again though.

VPurchased under the moniker Grape Stomper at a local dispensary. Fuity, berry goodness. The berry flavor on this was like a punch to the brain, shockingly strong and pungent, even in the form of budder. Gives some nice daytime pain relief, mildly sedating but still functional. Leaves me floating through my day. My only complaint is that it&#39;s a little too cerebral for my liking, making it easy to get lost in one&#39;s thoughts. I&#39;d recommend using this towards the end of the day, best used as a pre-dinner stone if you ask me.

VSativa dominate at 60 to 70% Sativa. Chunky lighter green buds covered in a ton of frosty crystals with amber hairs. Taste &amp; smell was a milder sweet sour grape which made for a smoother smoke. Cerebral high at once making me happy &amp; uplifted. Followed by nice body relaxation without the heavy/sleepy effects. Mine was Home Grown &amp; it did get the job done but,the effects did not last long. Would buy an eighth from a dispensary if i come across it. I&#39;m STOMPing my way out of here, Peace!

V4/22/18\u000a-Smoked Outside\u000a-Grape Stomper\u000a-from Urban Greenhouse, Phoenix AZ\u000a-Smoked a blunt, tropical twist white owl wrap.\u000a-Smoked at 9pm directly after a very unimpressive blunt of stem-filled, low quality OG Kush (I think) and the previous day I didn\u2019t smoke at all.\u000a-Bud was fresh and fluffy, light green, and covered in white crystals inside and out.\u000a-Started off with an intense and uplifting head high that was clean and palpable, but did not cause any shakiness or paranoia. As I smoked more, a tingly and warm full-body sensation began and quickly lent itself to an intense physical euphoria concentrated in the stomach that washed over every inch of my body in energizing and comforting waves. The entire high remained clear-headed and induced a full-body relaxation without feeling heavy. The peak lasted about 40 minutes, after which a pleasant cerebral buzz and relaxing body effects remained for nearly two and a half hours. The come down was hardly noticeable and was not unpleasant in any way. Residual effects were minimal and I woke up the next day feeling refreshed and did not have a hazy head space as is common when I smoke.\u000a-Great for daytime use but also gave a great night of sleep with no mental fogginess the next day.\u000a-10/10

VHeavily under the influence of this strain at the moment. I&#39;m looking at my 150-gallon freshwater aquarium, thinking of how pissed off my angel fish look because I haven&#39;t fed them yet this morning. Angel fish are the most consistently pissed-off aquarium fish I&#39;ve ever had.\u000a\u000aThis strain is almost perfect for me, as it is so multi-purpose. I get the pain relief I need, it stops the nausea, calms me down and can pick me up at the same time. It&#39;s hard to describe feeling alert/energetic, yet completely relaxed at the same time, but that is what I get from this strain. I can get up and get work done out in the yard, or catch a nice nap if I need to. Other fun things that accompany this strain are a calm/cool sensation in my nasal passages after I&#39;ve vaped for a while; colors seem brighter, deeper and wider; sense of smell is pronounced, such as putting on a nice perfume and being able to better discern/appreciate the individual notes in the perfume; paying more attention to music and noticing things about it that you haven&#39;t before. I find it almost impossible to become depressed with this strain (I&#39;ve been using it hundreds of times over the past year) and at the same time it never provokes paranoia or anxiety. It has been on the gentler side on the throat while vaping in comparison to most others. It is not a heavy skunky weed, it is more gentle with a slight &quot;grapey&quot; smell/taste. One more thing I could add, I seem to get less with the dry mouth/eyes with this strain than I do with several others. Definitely try this strain if you haven&#39;t already!

VSour Grapes or Grape Stomper, is a fantastic sativa dominant blend. A cross between Purple Elephant and ChemDawg Sour Diesel. The bud is light green, orange hairs, with a thick covering of trichromes. It has the smell of grape candy and sour notes, the taste is very similar.\u000a\u000aThe indica is very apparent in the onset with a physical body and head buzz, which has an easy transition to intense cerebral, thought-provoking effects from the sativa. With this comes euphoria, as well as giggling and happy thoughts. This is good for stiff muscles, pain relief, and depression. This strain is an all around delight, uplifting and enjoyable, especially useful to unwind after a long day of work.

VSour Grapes or Grape Stomper, is a fantastic sativa dominant blend. A cross between Purple Elephant and ChemDawg Sour Diesel. The bud is light green, orange hairs, with a thick covering of trichromes. It has the smell of grape candy and sour notes, the taste is very similar.\u000a\u000aThe indica is very apparent in the onset with a physical body and head buzz, which has an easy transition to intense cerebral, thought-provoking effects from the sativa. With this comes euphoria, as well as giggling and happy thoughts. This is good for stiff muscles, pain relief, and depression. This strain is an all around delight, uplifting and enjoyable, especially useful to unwind after a long day of work.

VPurchased under the moniker Grape Stomper at a local dispensary. Fuity, berry goodness. The berry flavor on this was like a punch to the brain, shockingly strong and pungent, even in the form of budder. Gives some nice daytime pain relief, mildly sedating but still functional. Leaves me floating through my day. My only complaint is that it&#39;s a little too cerebral for my liking, making it easy to get lost in one&#39;s thoughts. I&#39;d recommend using this towards the end of the day, best used as a pre-dinner stone if you ask me.

VGot a gram of Grape Stomper and just smoked some in a squeaky clean bowl. Initial reaction of the smoke was that it had a bit of a peppery quality to it. Upon a few exhales, I definitely couldn&#39;t resist the urge to cough and felt a mild sting in the nostrils. Not unpleasant, but wasn&#39;t what I&#39;d call a smooth smoke. The buds definitely do have a sweet berry or grape candy smell, along with a slightly spicy aroma. They are dense and coated in powdery kief, grinding up fairly fluffy. The aromatics when freshly ground are pretty great. I&#39;m definitely experiencing more of the typical sativa effects initially after this first bowl, even though the growers&#39; label calls it an indica hybrid. There&#39;s a sense of focus combined with a pleasant euphoric feeling setting in. I can also feel a heady calmness growing over me and my body has begun to fully relax. Another bowl of this, and I could see it getting me ready to go to sleep, and it&#39;s about that time.

VGrape Stomper is decent with a hay-like sweet odor coming off medium to large fluffy nugs.  The slightly purple buds are perfect for rolling joints, but do tend to burn fast in a pipe being so light.  The sweetness that comes off the flower does not translate so much into the taste with more a burnt tart flavor.  Never been a huge fan of bud that smells like my lawn.\u000a\u000aWith such a lukewarm reception to the terpene profile and bud structure combination there was redemption in the buzz.  A high that is very medicinal with the amazing body numbing sensation of headband being picked up by a nice steady head high.  Keeping things alert, yet not at all high strung or anxious.  Laid back, giggly weed that would be great for social or personal use.  Was very munchie oriented herb that could be paired with a nice dinner or picnic while hiking.

The dilaudud made me halucinate and the morphine made me constipated so turned to medical marijuana. Grape Stomper literally kicked my butt. I got the pre-roll 4 hits off that and I was pretty much done for the day. I did not taste a grape flavor on the pre-roll I got nor was there a sweet aroma to it, pretty pungent actually. But it did have the effects listed. Other might rate it higher but I gave it a 3

VAnother fine strain from Igadi in Tabenash.  Just like the Lavender Jones pre-rolls we grabbed and held in reserve, we took a while before we sampled this strain.  Even though it is supposed to be slightly sativa dominant, both the Mrs and I found it to lean more toward an indica&#39;s effects.  It has a very nice aroma...similar to Grape Ape but not quite as distinct.  It burned perfectly and had a slightly sweet taste to it with a little bit of woodsy thrown in as well.  Definitely not a harsh pull so its pretty easy to take a nice big hit without having your lungs explode.  Effects were quick to hit.  We were a bit talkative...so maybe that&#39;s where the sativa was sneaking but the majority of the effects were an entire body hum.  Sense of touch was really kicking, so those of you looking for an amorous enhancing strain...this one hits the mark.  You&#39;re definitely in for a good night&#39;s sleep as well...again..why the Mrs and I believe it leans indica.  We both really liked this strain and can see it having a place in our stash vault.

V[AKA &quot;Ros&#233;&quot;] \u2022 Process\u2014Lovely. It took several minutes to sink in, during which I wondered if I should smoke more because I didn&#39;t really feel anything. Gradual onset. Also gradual leveling out. // \u2022 Stoniness\u2014A pretty level, controllable high. I rolled a joint and it felt like an extensive, time-consuming process (about 30 minutes had passed in total with smoking a small bowl and rolling the joint). // \u2022 Somatic\u2014I have a headache but I have had those recently even when sober, so it&#39;s not too out of the ordinary. But other recent strains haven&#39;t given me a headache, so it&#39;s notable. I was hungry for breakfast prior to smoking this bowl so it probably just intensified my hunger signals. My eyes only feel slightly droopy are not visibly stoned (slightly red). Body aches and tension have mostly relaxed. // \u2022 Mood\u2014Feeling happily relaxed and fairly awake/alert. Able to focus on tasks without zoning out. // \u2022 Fx\u2014Currently listening to music in bed and was able to compile easily a list of things to do later today. No real urge to sleep, but also no real urge to get up/out. Would be ok socializing.

VI&#39;ve used about 10 different strains by now, and so far this is my favorite. I love the creative energetic high I get from this. It is strong and I admit, fun to vape more than I need to for pain relief. I love to recline in my porch in the summer with this with the windows open and listen to all of the birds singing together. There are about six different birds screeching in trees up and down the streets, but I find myself focusing on one in particular and becoming fascinated with that particular bird call. Then I watch a movie and pay more attention to the music track behind all of the action, then go and try to write music similar to that that I just heard. I have bad fibro and I was able to clean the old briers out of my raspberry patch this summer when using this strain. I felt like a professional landscaper, at least for a while.

VI use this strain for two main reasons:  It tastes delicious (even the shatter smells like grapes) and it helps me wake up in the morning and have something for breakfast. I suffer from PTSD and have problems eating. Grape Stomper works very well. As always, big shout-out to NETA for continuing to bring new medications to the people of New England.

All around, a very pleasant strain for anything on the go.

V[AKA &quot;Ros&#233;&quot;] \u2022 Process\u2014Lovely. It took several minutes to sink in, during which I wondered if I should smoke more because I didn&#39;t really feel anything. Gradual onset. Also gradual leveling out. // \u2022 Stoniness\u2014A pretty level, controllable high. I rolled a joint and it felt like an extensive, time-consuming process (about 30 minutes had passed in total with smoking a small bowl and rolling the joint). // \u2022 Somatic\u2014I have a headache but I have had those recently even when sober, so it&#39;s not too out of the ordinary. But other recent strains haven&#39;t given me a headache, so it&#39;s notable. I was hungry for breakfast prior to smoking this bowl so it probably just intensified my hunger signals. My eyes only feel slightly droopy are not visibly stoned (slightly red). Body aches and tension have mostly relaxed. // \u2022 Mood\u2014Feeling happily relaxed and fairly awake/alert. Able to focus on tasks without zoning out. // \u2022 Fx\u2014Currently listening to music in bed and was able to compile easily a list of things to do later today. No real urge to sleep, but also no real urge to get up/out. Would be ok socializing.

VGrape Stomper is decent with a hay-like sweet odor coming off medium to large fluffy nugs.  The slightly purple buds are perfect for rolling joints, but do tend to burn fast in a pipe being so light.  The sweetness that comes off the flower does not translate so much into the taste with more a burnt tart flavor.  Never been a huge fan of bud that smells like my lawn.\u000a\u000aWith such a lukewarm reception to the terpene profile and bud structure combination there was redemption in the buzz.  A high that is very medicinal with the amazing body numbing sensation of headband being picked up by a nice steady head high.  Keeping things alert, yet not at all high strung or anxious.  Laid back, giggly weed that would be great for social or personal use.  Was very munchie oriented herb that could be paired with a nice dinner or picnic while hiking.

VWhen grown the full 11 weeks, the calyxes swell to large, round, grape looking clusters. The smell is almost non existent, especially when grown with other strains. Making it perfect for small spaces. It&#39;s very pretty with colors ranging from pink to purple. Don&#39;t be tempted to pick early, a week makes the difference between 4 and 5 stars, it&#39;s very easy, and I accidentally let a little light leak form some intersex pollen and hit a purple kush with it. The kush can be seen in structure, speed of flowering, and the mass of the flowers. Takes away the sativa, short buzz and makes an overall 75/25 indica  sativa that has the perfect buzz for medical use. Too much will make you feel like numb, al dente pasta. There&#39;s no ceiling until you hit the floor! This one has a more pyramid stacked grapes that spiral out and explore with thc late in flower. These 2 strains look pretty, but not strong. The last 10 days is so important for thc, it will fume when harvested, losing some taste due to numbness. Both take extra time to cure as the last coat is still ripening, while the rest cures. I have to make them as small as possible to get a good cure. Both will numb when grown right by the right people, that&#39;s the easiest way to tell, but needs to be tried. Look inside the bud also, make sure it&#39;s done. I&#39;ve never seen properly grown grapestomper from a shop or vendor. The grape is pronounced earlier and the fuel is there when cured. Can&#39;t smell numb!\u000aIt is a specialty item to be shared with friends, like a bottle of the best wine after dinner. The perfect dessert, both are social and relaxing. \u000aI&#39;ve made several crosses since- cheese, blue cheese which is my own blue dream lavendersnowdog x cheese strain, Hoffman is pheno 1 of lsd x pheno 5 lsd. 1 being fuel, to 5 being darkest making a rainbow of color over 30% in thc and a nice .9% cbd on a non well grown plant. Made that in 2005 from a Hawaiian pheno of lavender x snow x my male diesel responsible for most of the really fuel smelling plants that can&#39;t be masked. It had huge chromatic balls of resin even the pollen smelled like fuel. 5 grams was used to pollinate 1000s of the best so cal strains. I won&#39;t name the company, but a gram was taken without my permission, resulting in many cup wins. That&#39;s cool as long as people find relief. I just can&#39;t stand it when I run out and have to buy my own genetics back, because they are so much better than others! Believe that crap&#128514;\u270c

VI want to love this strain, but it&#39;s probably the worst I&#39;ve ever bought over the last couple years. I really like the fruity sweet smell (I would almost call it &quot;kids chewable multivitamin&quot; over candy) paired with a sativa if you sit up and lean back it gives great head rushes and the high is nice. but around an hour in, my mood takes a HUGE nosedive. I recently found out I have internalized borderline personality disorder (basically when episodes hit it&#39;s like... all my worst fears are 100% real, I&#39;m the worst garbage person, and I could prove it mathematically, if only I wasn&#39;t an idiot and could do numbers, oh and also someone else is at the wheel and I&#39;m just along for the ride. it&#39;s fuckin wild), episodes of which CAN be brought on by some weed strains. and seeing girliefoofoo gets a similar response, I felt compelled to also comment. I suspect that this is potentially a BPD triggering strain. (Girliefoofoo, I hope you&#39;re okay!) also, without fail, I&#39;ll get really bad headaches and they LAST. I bought a half oz because I&#39;ve never had this response to weed before, so now I&#39;m not sure what to do with it... I&#39;ll see if I can lightly top a bowl with it without getting the negative effects... stay safe and mindful, everyone!

VI am a bit of a light weight when it comes to smoking just started back up due to bilateral amputations and the pain involved. The doc gave me morphine and dilaudid for the pain. The dilaudud made me halucinate and the morphine made me constipated so turned to medical marijuana. Grape Stomper literally kicked my butt. I got the pre-roll 4 hits off that and I was pretty much done for the day. I did not taste a grape flavor on the pre-roll I got nor was there a sweet aroma to it, pretty pungent actually. But it did have the effects listed. Other might rate it higher but I gave it a 3

VGrape stomper first discovered this strain in 2012.Heard a lot about the strain.Sour grapes very enjoyable can be a little racier for me at least.Smell and taste is like some good white wine.Picked up at x&#39; location&#39;s West valley AZ.\u000aIf I need to clean house in the morning or a morning starter this might be the strain for you.

V@mike_the_budtender with another strain review! Phenomenal flavor with this sour grape from Monkey Grass Farms. I smoked a few bowls before eating a meal at a restaurant. Those could be the best chicken tacos I have ever had. Anyways... The high was very creative and talkative. It lasted almost two hours which was a huge bonus. I would recommend this strain to slightly experienced smokers.

VSmell and flavor is amazing. Buds I got from Deep Roots clocked in at 24.8% THC and 0.05% CBD. Gives a super relaxing effect of an indica without the couch glue and the sativa side keeps me clear headed to work, while lowering my anxiety and pain. Nice.

VA great example of a hybrid. While being slightly Sativa dom in my experiences it still has a very relaxing body high to it. The leafly description is honestly fairly accurate IMO. This is another good social strain if one has anxiety or is a more introverted person, helping open one&#39;s self to other&#39;s and lower the guard. I personally just had some of this strain a few days ago and after taking 2 hits of it as &quot;Natural Trichomes&quot; (aka kief) I had the urge to get out of the house and go see some friends (which I normally don&#39;t do; I am an EXTREMELY introverted individual who rarely wants to go anywhere [except to the dispensaries of course.])\u000aI&#39;d recommend this as a wake-and-bake strain or one for your general day. It&#39;s really an anytime strain to be quite honest though.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m going it 3 stars only because it&#39;s not as potent of a strain as I would like it to be. It&#39;s still a great strain I will continue to get but overall it&#39;s high is just a tad bit too &#39;light&#39; for my tastes.

VAnother fine strain from Igadi in Tabenash.  Just like the Lavender Jones pre-rolls we grabbed and held in reserve, we took a while before we sampled this strain.  Even though it is supposed to be slightly sativa dominant, both the Mrs and I found it to lean more toward an indica&#39;s effects.  It has a very nice aroma...similar to Grape Ape but not quite as distinct.  It burned perfectly and had a slightly sweet taste to it with a little bit of woodsy thrown in as well.  Definitely not a harsh pull so its pretty easy to take a nice big hit without having your lungs explode.  Effects were quick to hit.  We were a bit talkative...so maybe that&#39;s where the sativa was sneaking but the majority of the effects were an entire body hum.  Sense of touch was really kicking, so those of you looking for an amorous enhancing strain...this one hits the mark.  You&#39;re definitely in for a good night&#39;s sleep as well...again..why the Mrs and I believe it leans indica.  We both really liked this strain and can see it having a place in our stash vault.

V Also know as sour grapes, grape stomper is a cannasours dream. This indica dominate hybrid of Chem DawgxSour Diesel and Purple Elephant. The particular batch tested at above 28%. Now I should mention that I have a hard time believing any flower over 25%. This stuff I firmly believe is at or near what the numbers say. The bud itself was some of the most beautiful and crystallized flower I&#39;ve seen in a very long time and was fairly dense. The first hit was so smooth and sweet it truly lives up to it&#39;s name and a bit pungent on exhale but not unpleasant. The high was very quick to onset, around 5 minutes, and was everything you want in a top shelf nay premium indica. Full body relaxation and no more pain after just a few hits. This was so potent I couldn&#39;t sit down and finish the bowl in one sitting and I&#39;ve been smoking for the sunny side of 20 years. Expect to not want to do much of anything but watch television or play games when on this. Great for sleepless nights and killing pain.  9.5/10 a must have and well worth the 20 a gram price tag.

VSlight points off for making me sleepy and not super social, but this strain gave me some intense visuals when I closed my eyes. I went over a bridge on a blue river, I explored the universe and saw beautiful purple stars, I hiked in the mountains and watched an intense yellow sunset. My partner reported visuals as well, and we both felt comfortable and tingly. Unfortunately, we both fell asleep before we could see how it goes, you know, sexually.

VThe taste is sweet, which I think is pretty neat. However, the heightened awareness was sensory overload and that pissed me off, but I liked that there was absolutely no cough.  I liked that some folks had better reviews, I&#39;m just sorry I could report better news. Maybe, I&#39;ll give it another go and not have the sensory overload.

VA Hypbrid that might as well be a Sativa.\u000aThe grape side doesn&#39;t seem to come through that hard, mostly a sour diesel effect.\u000a\u000aNegatives made me feel very jittery, and Anxious, a tiny bit paranoid but not to much. \u000a\u000aOverall Id say this is not a great strain for myself, or if your the type to get easily anxious.\u000a\u000aP.S. Had some before a theater show hoping I would get zone out and ended up wanting to get out of my seat.

VI actually just got 1/2 of sour grapes for 50$ at the lab. for a low shelf flower.  I was surprised how dank and dense this herb was. at first when inhaled it takes a while to kick , great tingly body feeling and head high. for some reason i was told it was an indica but even tho I wake and bake. I still have tons of energy like almost a sativa feeling has sour aroma. and earthy grape taste
