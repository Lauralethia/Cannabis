Vone of the best buds i&#39;ve ever got.. atleast this batch from a local dispo is really good.... buds are like rocks they actually look like the moon rocks dipped in kief. and dense as rock.. bigger than average buds with a blue hue to them... smoke is fantastic, smooth with a perfect balance of sativa and indica... takes a few to kick in but it&#39;s strong top notch for sure... got an o, would buy the whole lot.

VOne of my favorite sativa hybrid dominant flowers ever. This is an excellent pain reliever, it smells great, it tastes great and it has a very relaxing head high and deep body high... myself and another both fell asleep after smoking this . The next day my back pain and sciatica pain were not present and did not show for several hours. Not only did it help the pain when I smoked it but the next morning when I woke up I felt great. I would smoke this all the time and every time if I could.

VWhen the delivery driver gave me a few different hybrids to choose from, my nose instantly kept coming back to this strain. The strong, piney smell, with the intense sticky buds also kept be coming back, and eventually, i purchased 11 grams. \u000a\u000aThe high offers an instant head rush, followed by a &quot;stuck in time&quot; feeling, which is pretty cool for zoning out after a long day at work. I am in chill mode for 20 minutes, than ready to do household chores and cool and shit. Nice that it allows me to function, all while offering me that spacey feeling for a couple hours; only after three intense bong rips. \u000a\u000aThe buds are not as tight as I usually prefer, they are a bit leafy, however, sticky and packed together. I&#39;m about to take another bong rip, i will upload some pictures.  YOU have to try this strain at least once.

VGrower:  Raven Grass\u000aHarvest:  14 May 2015\u000aPurchased: 24 Oct 2015\u000aQuantity:  1g\u000aRetailer:  The Novel Tree\u000aTHC (total):  18.84%\u000aTHCA:  17.60%\u000aCBD:  0.19%\u000a\u000aThree guesses as to what this sucker smells like.  It&#39;s a really pleasant blueberry and I swear I&#39;m getting a little tobacco, like a cigar, as well.  But I&#39;ve sampled a bit already, so keep that in mind.  :P\u000a\u000aThis one hits the hybrid sweet spot - energetic enough to avoid couch lock, but suuuuuper laid-back while you&#39;re going about your business.  Strong sativas (and sativa-dominant hybrids) frequently have a &quot;let&#39;s go clean the house&quot; effect on me, but this one doesn&#39;t.  It was more like, &quot;let&#39;s sit down design a database schema.&quot; Lemme tell you, visualizing databases after a few hits of this strain is a craptonne of fun.  Very nicely done, Raven Grass.

VFinally, a strain to put my mind at rest. Taste is on the stronger, earthier side. After splitting a half gram joint with a friend, the true serenity and peace of the spirit of the plant set in. Light body awareness and everything becomes simple and clear. The feeling was, nothing to do, nowhere to go, just simple positivity. Eating food was rhythmic, calming and delicious. No eye or mouth dryness. I forgot my worries. Deep, well deserved exhaustion set in after a few hours for a comfortable sleep.

VSuper chill mode is the best way to describe this. I did not get the energizing effects described by others at all, but I will try again at some point to confirm. I&#39;ve tried several Blueberry crosses and this carries the least aroma and flavor, but more of the indica affects than expected. Needs more prominence of both parents to impress.

VVery nice indica dominant hybrid.  Tastes pretty nice and brings a very nice cerebral high, but without the normal shlumpification that comes hand in hand with most indicas is not seen here as the sativa side of this strain brings enough energy to combat this.  Solid strain if you want to just get shconed and listen to music or if you&#39;ve got some trouble falling asleep.

You can feel the haziness and the craziness from the trainwreck, but there&#39;s this light euphoria and bliss in the background from the Blue Dream. i would say it&#39;s a 75/25 sativa dominant hybrid. makes you really aroused also. not good for if you need to get stuff though but perfect weekend bud. 9/10, really dense nugs

And I am NOT the only one who feels that way. My wife and I both have been smoking this stuff for a week and it does not get old it has the best high ever, has some couch lock and I&#39;ve been trying different mixes to see if I can get the ultimate high. So far Skywalker og is not working, blackberry Kush, bubba kush, bananna og, tahoe og kush, master goo and tonight we&#39;ll be trying CHAMPAGNE KUSH.... we will actually reply and let you guys know what we think of champagne Kush, tomorrow... http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/champagne-kush
