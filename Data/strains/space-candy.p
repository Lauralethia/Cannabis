VComes on pretty quick with your brain simultaneously stupefying and uplifting in a tantalizing way. Vision is narrow, but accented in a way that triggers an almost physically pleasurable response. Very moving. Ability to function continues to deteriorate while mood elevation increases. Music is close to being the best, but the bewilderment and positive bias prevents much emotional nuance. High can be a bit distracting, too - but damn it\u2019s fun and full of childlike excitement. Would be tough to concentrate and get stuff done, but you couldn\u2019t do better for a reward after! Especially considering how relaxing it feels, in addition to the impressively long-lasting euphoria, makes it hard to find much fault in this strain.

VIt&#39;s a different yet very good high. The more I smoked the better I felt. This strain is rated high for happy, euphoric feeling. And I can see why. This is most definitely going at the top of my list with my other favorites. 5 stars &#128588;&#127996;

Vcame up on a truly excellent batch of space candy at torrey holistics in san diego.  with sparkly (almost shiny-sparkly) nugs and a pronouncedly sweet smell, it was honestly some of the prettiest weed i&#39;ve ever seen.  \u000a\u000aon the effects:  i&#39;m noticing more of a sativa effect up front (most noticeable in the fact that I just worked eight hours behind a computer and still felt motivated to log on Leafly and write this review).  definitely a steady, clear head high.  able to sustain conversation, enjoy creative projects, yadda yadda.  body gradually becoming more relaxed...a sign of a great hybrid.  recommend highly.*

VUnique strain that smells and tastes like a candy green apple and looks almost like coral with a range of colors. Very resiny and covered in crystals, would be hard to manage without a grinder but still a surprisingly smooth smoke. Nothing too strong in any direction but puts me a relaxed good mood.  Definitely worth checking out but bag appeal alone will have people doing that without any recommendation. 4.5/5

VReview # 312.098A\u000aTechnician ID. 420420\u000aMethod: Combustion\u000aDevice: HomeMade Gravity Water Bong w/flow control and advanced carb system.\u000aQuantity: Half a Cap Full, if the cap was a Pepsi Cap.\u000aPlume: An Atomic Dense full 2 Liters.  \u000a\u000aI am going to do this review in a robot voice...\u000aSorry dawgs, I&#39;s got trippen in some of my last reviews, whew, a little heavy. Lets bring it back to the weed. One must ride out those periods, as best they can. When it&#39;s heavy. And that&#39;s life. Oh, by the way, the robot voice is inside my head. You have to add your own robot voice.  I think it reflects, it, being some of those reviews, an interesting period. I was getting into concentrates, oils, waxes and the like... All that came about because of some dude who worked in my crew; he had it. It was some crazy quest on my part to try to find the perfect high... the most up high... the high that would scratch the itch...and it was no go. None of those things did it. They made me feel almost &#39;dirty&#39;. Something about those methods felt miles different than just smoking or vaping some bud. I don&#39;t think pot appreciated being used for those reasons either.\u000aOK. So why does this matter now?? Here&#39;s why. I just smoked some killer fucking weed. Like, I&#39;m absolutely unabashedly totally trashed hee hee! And it&#39;s been forever since i&#39;ve felt this quality, this kind, this &#39;how it should feel&#39;, high. The high is so uplifting. But I can&#39;t give all the credit to the pot alone. Its me. See. I&#39;m a little more centered. I was going through some tough stuff when i was trying those really heavy methods... and i&#39;ve worked some of that out... practically and emotionally... its called learning:) Anyway... so the bud meets me and I meet the bud..! Get it? Do you see? Before... i was relying on the weed to walk the whole way.. to do all the work... so i think it strained the high, as well the methods chosen to ingest. Whereas now... im bringing myself to the high, to the weed.. meeting it halfway. \u000aPutting that aside for the moment... Space Candy is mighty fine and dandy for a dollar weed, its parent seed, its breed, sets aside a creed all it own, damn kid, i&#39;m in the zone. And if you could see me on my face it&#39;s shown, a radiated meditated Ohm, its frequency has a sequence see to me, known, its wild wind blown, and at times a little chilly like a frosty snow cone, but ive a cap on the dome, done the work &amp; crawled (my way) home, started stoking up the center of my own hearth stone: I got an anvil of steel, a grinding wheel, plus enough life in me to seal the deal. Watch em kneel. Gonna build me an empire. Sire! Gonna lift populations up, by getting em higher. Fuck the pits and the mire. I retire. Time to rehire. New Blood!\u000a++++Rhyme: It Happens.\u000aWow. So love this weed. I&#39;m gonna stick my nose in it right now, hold on... it&#39;s like walking through a pine forest, heavy, resin hues, a subtle old pleasant leathery smell, odd right? Bright, with a diesel-like citrusy scent to it. \u000aGonna look under the hood with a 8x loop... one moment- fun... i saw what looked like two kinds of trichomes: very light and clear resins on the outer hairs and leaf, and then a layer down... a darker, almost amber, thick pellet or resin much larger in size. Its everywhere. I&#39;ve seen &#39;shinier&#39;  bud, by far... but not nearly as nice, potent, long lasting... i see why people rated it happy! Its not happy for me... its beautifully light... who knows, maybe its the same. Subjectivity n all.\u000aThere it is kids! A well rounded review. A little philosophy. A little personal psychology. Some pure bud talk. Some rhyme. And it&#39;s an hour in... and i&#39;m still really stoned. I knew the minute i looked at the review score that it would be nice... 4.6. All the way. For me.... 5star++!\u000a\u000aTravel well, fellow travelers...\u000aOccamsPhazer

VThere is a wide variety of color in these buds. There appear to be different phenotypes. Some are green with only a hint of purple, which comes off as a dark green on its hazy, long buds The other is dark purple with orange hairs and dense, fluffy buds. It smells pretty kiefy. \u000a\u000aWhen smoked, it gives off a light fruity taste. It is sweet, almost like an apple, almost citrus.\u000a\u000aI&#39;d add this to my list of racy strains because of its mind-racing, tingling effect on the brain. There is also a physical effect on the body, very relaxing. It&#39;s almost like a buzzing. I&#39;m feeling effects with audio too, as far as music and other sounds outside. It feels heavy, but not quite couchlocked.

Vburns nice and slow for me, gently put me through a calmed mind setting and really helps those like me who have heavy depression. This does make me space out and have a good time but make sure you drink a lot of water with this one.

VAwesome head and body high. Seriously helps with muscle spasms and depression, as well as nausea and increased arousal. High doesn&#39;t last as long as I would like but what can ya do. Great any time smoke - it was great before and after dinner, before bed it lulled me into a nice sleep and this morning it&#39;s uplifting and euphoric. I love this. Flavour is piney and appley, not bad.

VThis is by far my favorite strain! The mind and body high that comes with this is out of this  world! I just love that I can just let my mind go wild with this. I feel like I could write a book, clean the house and and the most interesting conversations with someone all at the same time. My explanation is not doing it justice. It\u2019s a must try!

VPurchased this in a preroll. Smooth smoke. No cough. I\u2019m writing this after pulling a double. Let me take a couple of pulls. \u000a\u000aSmells really good like old school reefer. I have no idea what the color of this bud is, as I said before I purchased a preroll. Why do some guys assume if you smoke you are dtf?

VEasily one of my favorite strains! Made me euphoric and giggly while taking my pain and anxiety away completely. A slow creeping high but when it hits, DAMN. I didn&#39;t feel too too foggy in the head but definitely felt a little spacey (for lack of a better term), in a good way! I was able to go back to work and focus but also felt very relaxed. The perfect hybrid!

VJust tried it, was amazing. I&#39;m a regular smoker, and i took only 3 pulls, waited bout 10ish mins. It hits you as creeper does, and when it does it hits you like a tank. Definitely a new fav. Has a sweet taste, with a hint of citrus. Absolutely love it.\u000a

Vthis was a very nice strain.i didn`t get all the smells and tastes everyone else got but it was nice.to me it was a little fruity and lemony and a bit earthy and pungent.dark green w/ lots of orange hairs and a solid nug!the buzz was very nice,not quite as good as i would think from something w/ 25% THC but the buzz was respectable.took care of many issues i have.to me it`s a very good wake and bake strain&#39;
