VNew purchase, mid-morning, so I already had my &quot;coffee strain.&quot;  This was delivered and I tried it for my mid-morning snack.  More like dinner.  Sweet, smooth, thick LONG lasting vape.\u000aHits like a freight train after 5 minutes.  Cannot say when I will feel like moving.  Totally couch locked!

VAs someone who has not used cannabis in over 20 years, this has been my favorite strain so far after trying about 10 various others. For anxiety and stress, Blue Haze gives a nice, mellow feel of relaxation without the unfocused feeling I&#39;ve had with other strains. Works well on reducing chronic muscle pain also. Liking this one - it&#39;s a keeper in my natural medicine cabinet.

VThis is, so far, my absolute favorite sativa strain. I haven&#39;t been lucky enough to try super silver haze yet, but until then this strain is my #1. Blue haze helps me focus, relieves stress, wakes me up, removes anxiety, helps my creative thinking process, everything good. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety but take a pill each day (40mg of Paxil once a day) that allows me to function. Blue Haze turns me into Bradley Cooper in Limitless and I feel supercharged and ready to take on anything. Highly recommended for sativa lovers and those that work in a creative field.

VMigraine pain mild; nausea 6-7 when I medicated round 1800 or so. Takes bout 5 min to start working. Pain/nausea gone. No anxiety/paranoia (absolute must for me). Body high allowed me to eat dinner &amp; enjoy a relaxing evening. Did not expect the head high to be sooo heavy. I guess I shoulda maybe expected that if this is a Blueberry cross. But, definitely got the job done &amp; I slept great that night! Highly recommend for nighttime use for pain/nausea/insomnia! :-)

VFantastic Indica blend. was having problems with my seizure ticks and insomnia and got some Blue Haze and a couple of hits off the pipe and I had the most intense body high I have ever had my entire life. absolutely amazing experience. Don&#39;t plan on going anywhere because it&#39;s a couch lock for sure and I haven&#39;t had the munchies so bad from a smoke in my life(which was good because I have been losing alot of weight lately). The body high was unlike anything I had ever felt before. I could feel every atom in my body float away in rhythm with the space heater I was sitting next to. Perfect for sitting home on a cold winter evening and then getting a good night sleep. I keep reading it&#39;s a sativa but the incredible body high has to show it&#39;s an indica dominant strain.

VThis strain is awesome, i just got home from a crappy day at work, wound up stranded for 2 hours past my shift because I ran out of gas, my anxiety was through the roof. I had picked up a preroll of Blue Haze earlier today and decided to give it a go. I have a super high tolerance and havent always had the best luck finding ones that work for me, but this one did. I feel like I am rambling now but I also dont care. I only had to smoke a quarter of the preroll and i feel it behind my eyes already. My tension headache is subsiding 15 mins in, my anxiety is gone and my muscles are relaxibg too. I am very thirsty though and my eyes feel dry and itchy, but that is probably my contacts. \u000a\u000aSo essentially, this strain is a heavy hitter for those with high tolerance and is a must have for those super crappy days.

VBackground info: I picked up 7 grams of this stuff from Green Planet the other day, this batch in particular being a very deep purple sprawling with orange hairs in company too a thick forestry coating of beautiful glistening trichomes and containing 17.11 % THC with a 0.07 CBD content. (For only $5 a gram too!)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEffects: Being a patient of chronic back pain this strains gave me an amazing body tingle, would be the best way to describe it, along with it coming a ever present but function-able, manageable and uplifting mind relaxation.

This hybrid really is that plus some more. I enjoyed the Berry taste alot and the mental high lasted for a good amount of time. I was able to finish chores around the house &quot;this has been challenging&quot; and for the first time In a while i didnt feel all down about my situation instead i started feeling kinda happy that i had a situation with a solution. lols rt.

Brilliant for relaxing and a happy feel. I would recommend this for a night-time use (possibly in-doors with a sofa/couch). However, this does leave a somewhat dizzy feeling (only to some various consumers) and a very dry mouth. Although, overall this is brilliant, I give it an overall rating of 8.

VI had never tried this one before, but my favorite dispensary had a deal on an eighth of this for a very low price- and when it was between this one or an all-time favorite of mine (Sour Diesel), the bud tender convinced me to try this one. I&#39;m happy she did. It&#39;s not overpowering and the effects don&#39;t last as long as I would like, but overall it is a pleasant high while it lasts. Not on my top 5 list, but I would try it again. It sparks some productivity.

VBearing in mind that my goal in trying this was to ease pain, I would have to rate this as average. My brain function was elevated, and I was unusually calm, but in lieu of easing the pain, it actually drew my attention to the pain and I could think of little else. This would be better for something who suffers from anxiety or depression than for someone strictly medicating pain.

VBlue haze is the polar opposite of what it name suggests. You are anything but blue or in a haze. This hybrid is a relaxing in the body high and provides a nice, euphoric head high. The flavor is very nice with a strong sage flavor but sweet at the same time. Good strain for the day when you want to medicate but have things to do as well.

VOn the first hit, the strain tasted kind of funky. It sort of  tasted like the smell of fresh, finely trimmed grass. By 10 mins in, I felt like I was finding myself emotionally and spiritually in the 3rd person perspective. 45 mins in, my computer monitors started to mesh together and I was seeing images of John Candy in my current session of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\u000a\u000aI felt more active while under the effects of this strain, ready to start making giant plans and push forward with lifelong goals, yet...I couldn&#39;t find my feet while my mind wandered. The more I thought about designing Halo tournaments in my quad city area, the slower time seemed to turn. By the time I generated a one paragraph sponsorship pitch idea to Bungie and 343 Industries on OpenOffice, it was 3 am. \u000a\u000aSuffice to say, this a wonderful strain to lose yourself in. With a pinch of salt, understand that Blue Haze will open your mind to new, engaging thoughts. You might not feel inspired physically, but mentally your ideas will soar. But be warned, your stomach might be sore as well as this strain can cause major munchies.

VI&#39;ve been going through alot within the last few months so naturally i was seeking a medicine that would help cure depression without the long body high that an potent Indica has too offer. mental vs physical. yah know. This hybrid really is that plus some more. I enjoyed the Berry taste alot and the mental high lasted for a good amount of time. I was able to finish chores around the house &quot;this has been challenging&quot; and for the first time In a while i didnt feel all down about my situation instead i started feeling kinda happy that i had a situation with a solution. lols rt. I hope this helps ty for reading

VThis one is interesting... I love the flavor it is a good balance between the berry and earthy funk! It for me has proven to be a great wake n bake strain providing a mild euphoria with some easing of pain. creative and productive. recommended for a great anytime strain.

Vthis is the SUV of weed. good for chilling, good for a party and laughing your a$$ off. I&#39;ve baked one pre-work and had a productive (for me) day. I think it tastes a little sweet/woody/nutty. like granola. All in all you can&#39;t go wrong.

VI vaporized it, and honestly it&#39;s not my favorite combo of flavors, the sweet blueberry (which I don&#39;t think is dj shorts) mixed with that haze flavor is not good in my opinion. But smoking this out of a bong made me realize the potency so 3/5 seems fair.

VThis is a good solid strain I just like others more. Had some in the evening and felt super caffeinated. Texted like 20 friends a mile a minute for hours. Focused energy was the name of the game which I didn&#39;t expect. I still have a gram left but might never get around to vaping it...\u000a\u000aI got around to vaping it to watch Jodorowsky&#39;s Holy Mountain. Very amazing experience - I saw so much more in the movie, drawing connections between every scene and world history. Currently my favorite movie, possibly because of Blue Haze.

VThis is genuinely the best weed i have ever had the chance of smoking in my life. This weed didn&#39;t dry out my mouth or eyes, it&#39;s the only shit that hasn&#39;t dried my mouth out to hell. And I am generally someone who gets very glossy and dead-eyed when I smoke, and my eyes remained generally fine aside from a little spacey. \u000aThe affects of this weed were to die for. It&#39;s the sweetest, smoothest weed I&#39;ve ever smoked and it was so easy to take. It completely chilled me out with very limited munchies and some laziness. Coming down from the high was very slow and I felt completely fine, not that dead feeling that certain strains leave but like I had just awoken from a great sleep.\u000aI would 100% recommend this strain to absolutely anyone who can get their hands on, it&#39;s the best shit in the world.
