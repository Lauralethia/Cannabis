V\u200eTriple A Grade Green Crack\u000a(aka. Super Green Crack) \u000a\u000aStrong flavor, and thick feeling in the throat but surprisingly not harsh at all. High feeling hits fast and very hard, but isn&#39;t like a smack in the face. The high builds very quickly but doesn&#39;t destroy you. \u000a\u000aSurprisingly extremely alert and as if I can move more freely than normal but I&#39;m so comfy that I don&#39;t want to move. Very calm and composed, in control. \u000aBut overall there is still a strong presence of a common; large high.\u000a\u000aDefinitely a good strain for the morning or before something that you have to feel and act somewhat somewhere. But aren&#39;t comfortable going when your sober. Like school, or work, or the airport, you know what I&#39;m saying?

Well this strain gives you a smooth hit in almost any piece. It gives you a good boost of energy to do things. Although I did notice that the strain gives you a loneliness feeling if you smoke it alone and dont do anything interesting. DOESN&#39;T TAKE MUCH to get you stoned. Took about a half gram to destroy me in a period of an hour.

VThis strain has become a staple for me with a powerful energetic buzz. It&#39;s amongst my favorite Sativas. A perfect daytime smoke. Might be my favorite go to smoke for a powerful high that leaves you in an energetic state that doesn&#39;t sap your motivation. You can actually get a surge of motivation after smoking it. It seems to have a THC content designed for the experienced user. Amongst my all time favorite strains, hard to find one Iike better. Maybe Durban Poison but it&#39;s really close.

VWhen I first opened the bag, I got a whiff of sharp, cheesy-lime, but after few more whiffs, it has a real musty, woody smell(very kush-y). The nugs are dark green with bright orange hairs, dense and sticky. This starts off as a strong, euphoric head high. The buzz came on quickly, and I felt very energetic. After and hour, I can feel myself beginning to slip into a buzzing, moderate body high.
