VThis very unique smelling and tasting bud consistently sits around only 15% THC, but it still packs a pretty good punch. Fruity and piney with a happy, focused head high.

VSmoked it earlier in the day when I\ufe0f was busier and I\ufe0f enjoyed the high a lot. Felt very uplifted, talkative, and awake. Then smoked it before yoga and felt slightly paranoid, hyper, a little heart racing. Wouldn\u2019t recommend this strain for focused activities lol. Colors pop a ton and music sounds great though.

VI didn&#39;t smoke too much but a few hits had me pretty energetic and moving around. I smoked some before bed and actually had a hard time falling asleep which is great for a Sativa, unfortunate for me that night :) Smells amazing. No anxiety or paranoia. Just a calm yet energetic feeling for a few hours.

VI was hesitant to try his new strain, but it exceeded my expectations.\u000aOne think i noticed right away and fell in love with, is that the smoke is so beautiful-the shape and viscosity and smell.\u000aBoth the flower and smoke had very fruity odour.\u000aThe high was not very different from a typical sativa/haze.\u000aWhich is pretty awesome :D\u000a

VFinally drifting off to sleep now wth some final blissful thoughts. What a ride!  Taste?  I can&#39;t remember. I just know this one makes me REALLY social. My wife kept telling me to STOP talking lol. But wow, brain was working non-stop!  Wrote down some great ideas. Kinda had some stupid thoughts at first, then pure excitement from there

Vbuzzy and stoney best 2 words to describe this. smells incredibly like mangoes, taste good to. very haze like high with a heavy stone feel at same time. batch I got was only 13% but it did the job, I could see going on hike or doing mundane shit focused on this. would give it 5 stars but guess I&#39;m more of a diesal guy.

VGood times strain right here! screw the anti depressant meds, cuz this is all u need! upbeat,relaxing,hazey type of stone. smells amazing, flavors are good too. more of a hybrid to me though,racey at first like sativa but mellows out nicely to relaxation town. 4 out of 5 cuz it&#39;s more hybrid like if you will,for those looking for straight sativa. mine was only 13% but still dank shit! goes to show you don&#39;t need 30% shit to feel good! quality over potency my friends... smoke on!

VThis strain is tricky. If you smoke just a little, you&#39;ll get a nice, uplifting High.\u000a\u000aIf you smoke just a moderate amount however, you&#39;ll be fucked up. \u000a\u000aIt tastes great and each mug has a beautiful hue of red trichomes.\u000a\u000aShout out to Liberty Reach for this fine grow

VUsing an oil cartridge with this strain. Great flavor. Relaxing but I\u2019m still alert. Very good for when you\u2019ve got to get stuff done. I think this is perfect for puttering and doing chores around the house.

VI decided to try this because it is an award winning strain. Once I smelled it I was sooo excited to try this. Smells amazing! The taste doesn&#39;t have the same pleasentness. Tastes very chemically to me. I didn&#39;t like the high much. I kept mumbling and felt sooo stupid. Doesn&#39;t help with anxiety because I was getting sooo frustrated with my speech.

VWhat can i say about this fruity delicious sativa that hasnt already been said? It smells divine, STRONG mango strawberry flavor on the exhale. Such a beautiful high, chilled me out but kept you alert enough to enjoy a few documentaries a little more than i would otherwise. This strain just plain makes you HAPPY. It doesnt come around very often so I better go re-stock before it all gets snatched up!
