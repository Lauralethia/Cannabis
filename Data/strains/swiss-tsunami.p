VSo this was my first true CBD strain. A very important thing to know is that CBD strains are a little harsher due to the lower concentration of THC. I&#39;m not sure why this is, but it&#39;s definitely noticeable. The flavor profile was meak, with the only real notes of flavor coming through as a sort of haze flavor. Now that I have let the effects set in, I am quite pleased. I love the body relief, and have been needing it alot lately. It isn&#39;t couch locking, but rather more of a warm body relaxation that leaves room for productivity.

VThis is everything I have been looking for in a strain. I wanted to be able to come home from work, veg on the couch and let the worries of the day melt away, without conking out. I vaped Swiss Tsunami from a Select cartridge. One 3-second hit and I was set for the night. (I have a very low THC tolerance, and am very sensitive to CBD, as well.) I had been panicking over work stuff, and within a few minutes I was more relaxed than I have been in ages, and I was just happy and giggly. At one point, I was laying my face on my cold granite kitchen counter just because it felt good, lol. I did eventually fall asleep about 3 hours later, and I slept for 7 hours, which is unheard of for me. I&#39;m lucky if I get 5 hours. I feel like a new woman!

VMy go to CBD strain.  I found it in passing and was hurting like all get out. 23% CBD and I was feeling right as rain, given this is Portland that is saying something. \u000aI keep this on hand for the skull clawing bouts of ick I feel when I get way to far into my own head, or the pain has kept me from sleeping worth a damn. \u000aWorks best in a flower vape. OMG kind of went into a panic when I felt the horrible pain and tightness in my hips melt into serious warmth. I was snoring shortly after from of of the deepest sleeps I have had in forever.

VMethod: Select Oil Vape Cartidge\u000a\u000aBefore you read the review, I must clarify that this was my first real CBD strain.\u000a\u000aAroma: Smells lightly of fresh orange peel. Not particularly pleasant. 0.75/1 Star.\u000a\u000aTaste: I was hopeful for the taste based on the smell but I guess CBD strains really do struggle in this area. A burnt kind of taste or nothing and it wasn&#39;t the pen because I got a Select pen. Weed, which is disappointing for a cartridge. 0.5/2 Stars.\u000a\u000aFeel: I was worried the THC levels on this would be too low but it&#39;s a perfect ratio.  I wanted a strain I could go to work on and have my status not be too obvious. This strain does the trick. There&#39;s a little bit of a head rush at the beginning which settles into just plain content. You feel like everything is okay. You have a full tummy, a comfy bed, and people who love you. Swiss-Tsu is like a gentle kiss upon your forhead.2/2 Stars.\u000a\u000aRanking: I think I&#39;ll be looking for a better tasting strain at this ratio and leaving Swiss-Tsu for others.\u000a\u000aTotal: 3.25/5 Stars.

VI\u2019m surprised this isn\u2019t more popular. I really liked it. Good medicinally and even recreationally - as long as you\u2019re not looking for anything too crazy.

VI suffer from intense paranoia when smoking. Swiss Tsunami, is the only strain I have found to where I can catch myself becoming paranoid, and can curve the direction of my thoughts to prevent a bad experience. Hands down my favorite strain.

VHave purchased this multiple times, and this is my number one CBD medicine so far. Perfect Ratio, and fantastic working medicine for all types of medicinal needs. I purchased it every-time from TJ&#39;s Organic Provisions.

VExtremely calming. Tastes like pickles, if you ask me. Mixed with some jet fuel, which made for a smooth but dimensional high.
