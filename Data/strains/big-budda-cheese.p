VI picked up half gram of Big Buddha Cheese in cured resin wax.  I normally rate my experience with a strain on a simple scale 1 thru 10, 10 being the best. I break it into aroma, flavor, and potency.\u000a\u000aAroma 9/10\u000aI can smell the cheese smell everyone mentions, however it&#39;s very faint - not sure if it&#39;s because I got the wax.  There&#39;s something familiar about it, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve had one of the parent strains.\u000a\u000aFlavor 8/10\u000aThe flavor was on the bland &amp; generic side.  Notes of an earthy cheesey musk taste. \u000a\u000aPotency 10/10\u000aLike many other patients, my tolerance sky rocketed once I started dabbing.  When I picked it up I was skeptical, very few concentrates can give me the relief I need before I have to stop dabbing because my throat hurts so much.  Not this strain.  BBC can be used anytime of day I&#39;ve used it to get me going in the morning, and at night to calm my brain.  \u000aEffects of the strain left me feeling at peace with the world.  I felt happy &amp; ready to take on the day.  I heard this strain was good for depression, and doesn&#39;t give users anxiety.  \u000a\u000aI feel like I know why the Buddha smiles, because he smokes the Big Buddha Cheese! \u000a

VDon&#39;t remember pain scale as it&#39;s been a decent couple of days as far as pain. But my nausea has been ridiculous. My anxiety has been was well. Medicated round 1330 or so. Takes bout 10 min to start working (I think, lol). Nausea/pain gone. Anxiety bearable so dis strain helped quite a bit with that to. Body high allowed me to eat which is exactly what I wanted. Head high a lil heavy for a productive (or what was supposed to be) Saturday, lol! But did not put me to sleep either which was nice as it&#39;s way too damn early for bed. High lasted bout 3 hours which was nice. I&#39;d highly recommend for after work/evening use for pain/nausea/anxiety! :-)

VThis one had a lot of crystals, practically caked in it. It literally had a cheese/dank/sour smell to it, but a pleasant one at that. It smells VERY strong so keep it in a jar with a lid rather than a plastic bag unless you like stinking up the place (which I do :) A nice head high with a relaxed body state. You focus on things more and try to understand how it works, but you&#39;re too lazy to get up and actually experiment with it. Great choice for a kickback!

VThis medicine hit me hard man, didn&#39;t think the Big Buddha Cheese would be this potent.\u000a\u000aPicked it up at Oakland Organics (Organicann) in Downtown Oakland, California  and it tested at 12.4% THC and 0.3% CBD, thought that was relatively low for a Sativa dominant hybrid so I picked it up.\u000a\u000aHit it once out of my pipe and I could instantly (like within 20-30 seconds feel the uplifting effect) In low doses, this medicine is GREAT for Depression.\u000a\u000aAfter my initial first hit out of the pipe, decided to roll aout a .8 gram joint of it, 2 hits and I was flying. This has to be some of the trippiest weed I have smoked.

VAwesome for pain relief and stress relief. I used some after a hard day of work and it relieved my stress and soreness almost instantly. Very nice sativa-influenced head buzz with the indica body buzz. Overall great strain and well worth the money. Mine seemed a little dry and not very dense, but apparently that is the case often, with the buds being more leafy and not as dense as an indica.

VAmazing uplifting strain. Anxiety gone, depression gone. Very euphoric without being overwhelming, which is a must for me as I have a severe anxiety disorder. Definitely a bit more heady but it&#39;s got a decent body high as well. Music sounds absolutely AMAZING on this one. This strain also has a tendency to make one pretty reflective and thoughtful. Great for philosophical discussions but not much else socially. Definitely felt some creative juices flowing and it&#39;s pretty versatile in that you can either get motivated and starting doing this or chill back and relax on the couch. Good for daytime or evening use. The head high is a bit short lived for my taste but that may have more to do with having a higher tolerance. While the head high (specifically the pressure around your temple) does dissipate after about 30-45 minutes, the medical effects stick around for at least 3 or 4 hours.This one is definitely permanently in my top 3 strains and will get it any time I see it.

VDark green buds, dense and sticky, but break up well and don&#39;t stick to the grinder. I&#39;m always a fan of cheese, not necessarily for the taste or smell but always a very chill, balanced hybrid. I don&#39;t get anxious on this strain and that sets it apart from most hazes and Kush. They lineage of the strain shines from this herb. It feels like the relaxed head high of the cheese, but with the body buzz, bad focus and sleepiness of Afghani. Like smoking a J with some good Afghani hasj. One of my new favorite take-it-easy-dude strains.

VAmazing uplifting strain. Anxiety gone, depression gone. Very euphoric without being overwhelming, which is a must for me as I have a severe anxiety disorder. Definitely a bit more heady but it&#39;s got a decent body high as well. Music sounds absolutely AMAZING on this one. This strain also has a tendency to make one pretty reflective and thoughtful. Great for philosophical discussions but not much else socially. Definitely felt some creative juices flowing and it&#39;s pretty versatile in that you can either get motivated and starting doing this or chill back and relax on the couch. Good for daytime or evening use. The head high is a bit short lived for my taste but that may have more to do with having a higher tolerance. While the head high (specifically the pressure around your temple) does dissipate after about 30-45 minutes, the medical effects stick around for at least 3 or 4 hours.This one is definitely permanently in my top 3 strains and will get it any time I see it.

VThis will be my last review for 2016. I had rhis strain before, but had no time to write a decent review.\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: I use psychiatric medication for a serious anxiety dissorder. This has direct influence on how weed works for me. I do not recommend combining psychopharma without talking to your doctor, or at least doing some research.\u000a\u000aIngredients for this trip:\u000a-Olanzapine 5 mg 1x/dd\u000a-Venlafaxine 225 mg 1x/dd\u000a-Clonazepam 0.5 mg 3x/dd\u000a\u000a-Big Buddha Cheese. 0.5 gr smoked with tobbaco in a joint\u000a\u000aThis strain smells very strong. A combination of grapefruit and cheese. The buds are big and dense and are kinda hard ro crush. The taste matches the smell and is easy to smoke.\u000a\u000aThe high kicks in after 5 minutes and builds up. Iny case I first felt the immediate urge to take a nap for an hour. I set my alarm and just gave in to the sleepiness. I woke up very relaxed and had some difficulties walking, although not as much as with a sativa strain like dominator. I took a nice cild red bull and went to visit my parents, where I am right now.\u000a\u000aI feel lazy, still relaxed and pretty happy.  I can function well, but I&#39;m definitely glad we don&#39;t have a lot of visit. This stuff makes me less talkative and I feel like enjoying it alone is the best thing.\u000a\u000aBbC doesn&#39;t make you super hungry, but food definitely tastes better.\u000a\u000aI wish you all a happy, healtht 2017. And if you can get this strain (which shouldn&#39;t be too hard ( then take some home to enjoy a nice, calm and happy trip. \u000a\u000a

VAwesome for pain relief and stress relief. I used some after a hard day of work and it relieved my stress and soreness almost instantly. Very nice sativa-influenced head buzz with the indica body buzz. Overall great strain and well worth the money. Mine seemed a little dry and not very dense, but apparently that is the case often, with the buds being more leafy and not as dense as an indica.

VI took 8 hits because I did not feel much then it hit me. I could not stop laughing even if it was something sad. But I could not stay awake easily. I could not walk good. I was also disoriented too. Voices (good voices) were telling what to do in order to not get caught and I listened to them and was not caught. I sip a little water and gained back my coordination to a certain extent. The next day I was still high and very slap happy. Then it wore off a little before I went to bed.

VBig Blue Cheese is one of my favorites. Best strain from Dr. Orders in co springs Colorado. Purple, dense, frosty &#128293;. Big Blue Cheese is a cross between Cali Big Bud and Blue Cheese. Lucky for me I was able to secure all my favorites from Colorado including, Tangerine Power, and 303 Kush to name a few MmmmMmmm. This plant is one of my hardest to grow, not for beginners. It yields 3 times more than most strains but requires defoliation or swazing. Very bushy, With an extended stretch cycle. And when most plants are streatchin up the Big Blue Cheese stretches outwards branches. I&#39;m not a fan of cheese tastes in bud or feet smells but this smoke will knock your socks off. Great with red wine &#127863; \u000aThank you Leafly for featuring my photos as the main example for this and other strains. Check out the fox tails on my Tangerine Power.

The energy of a Skunk, with the relaxing power of a Cheese. Sensation of the silence in a temple (&quot;Big Buddha&quot; is appropriate). PERFECT for meditating,  Taste cheesy and a bit pungent.

VThis is an awesome strain, I love the cheesy scent and taste, it puts me in a fantastic mood and does make me a little hungry. Overall it&#39;s a decent indica dominant hybrid that calms me down before bed. The bud is quite sticky and maintains it&#39;s texture when it&#39;s grinded.

VThis was a strain I had in Amsterdam, a city famous for its drugs and whores, a city where some wonderful weed can be found. Big Buddha cheese was not a top shelf pick, more of a casual beginning to a night out. BBC (not the news) made me gigglier than usual and opened me up for more experiences, and is a well rounded bud for your bong, or joint for the euros.

VThe use of Big Buddha Cheese in Taichi and Qigong,\u000a\u000a50% head, 45% body and 5% grounding.\u000a\u000aI like the euforic and uplifted feeling this strains give you it makes you happy, but its hard to focus during the tai chi..\u000anot that I get anxious, but not wel centered, so I loose my form.. But then I also could think my movements like from a thirth persons view. What makes it handy to find \u201cthe why\u201d of a movement. \u000a\u000aSo I would advise to use this strain when you are in a class, and pointed in the right direction...The flow feels nice by the way. \u000aBut using it allown and try to practice is almost inpossible... then take the B-52 \u2026 same feeling, but more focussed.

Vcalyx to leaf ratio: 7\u000asmells better after it was broken up. sweet and cheesy.\u000asmells woody before grinding.\u000anatural solutions has scientific herb; not that organically grown hippie weed. Futuristic candy shop.\u000a\u000a

VFriend and I just smoked two bowls of Big Buddha Cheese.  Since then We have partaken in various pseudo-sexual acts and penned the groundwork of a dystopian novel.  I just got my ear licked! (BBC will turn straight men gay - no pun intended).  Highly recommended.
