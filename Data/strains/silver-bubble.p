VWow!! Lovely haze tasting weed that gives you an almost instant high a deep thoughtful wave while smoking followed by a nice chilled relaxing high. Got munchies with this strain and when relaxing got a full body tingle which was amazing... NOT a beginners weed 5/5

VI picked up some flower of this strain after the owner of the dispensary told me &quot;Yea, this is usually what I suggest to people who are looking for something really strong&quot;. And after I went home &amp; smoked this wonderful flower, I was not disappointed! Maybe a bit of a creeper, but once she hits you, you&#39;ll be thrown for a loop! Along with the heavy effects, I was still functional/up and about, but maybe not excited at the idea of driving. ;) Looking for strong &amp; balanced effects? Try it out!\u000aHappy Smerkin&#39;!\u270c&#127995;

VSilver bubble is one of my faviourte strains and this one is a perfect example to use for my review. Start of on visual the Silver Bubble is a beautiful bud with lots of crystals coating it, brown hairs coming out it is a dense bud but will bounce back after squeeze. The smell is amazing fruity almost like a exotic smell, ground up the weeds smell potency increases and tips out of the grinder nice not straight off but a little tap. Very nice smoke no harshness at all nice clean smoke fruity taste hits you hard good relaxation and to make you forget whats happened in the shit day what you have had &#128514; over all a very good strain and will be getting it again&#128074;

VSilver bubble, the weed that killed me. \u000aAmazing to smoke, very smooth and a very hazey taste. Got complete body tingle and then was couch locked which is when I felt dead. Was just so relaxed and got unreal body tingle that made me feel the most relaxed I&#39;ve ever been. \u000aGot extreme dry eyes, and dry mouth. \u000aAlso a little paranoid and very thoughtful. Amazing strain 5/5

Vthis strain hit me hard and ate me alive, i thought i was going to fly away, but seriously when I got it i thought my dealer played me with semi dry crumble, and my fears where corrected when I started smoking it, it had a grass texture to it. questioning my thoughts to this is hemp, but not was i wrong, i feel like I&#39;m out of my body and ready to do anything but i also want to lay down and watch a movie with a large pizza this weed amazes me with a great high rush but also a Indica body relax

VSuperb smoke, buds are dense and pungent with a sweet aroma, even more so when cured in jars the sweet smell intensifies.\u000a\u000aThis is the perfect strain which allows you to benefit from both the sativa &amp; Indica lineages found in this hybrid, if you require an uplifting, energetic smoke or a kick back and relax type of smoke this allows you the best of both worlds!\u000a\u000aThe taste isn&#39;t as intense as the smell, but you get the initial old generation spicy haze taste when dragging and understones of sweet citrus and pungent earth when rolled around your mouth and exhaled through your nose, it leaves you wanting more after each toke!\u000a\u000aNot generally a fan of &quot;supreme&quot; hybrids but this is one genetic I will keep close to me, top quality in every aspect and one of very few strains which allows you to swing either side of the uplifting sativa effects and couchlock indica effects!

VSilver Bubble Shatter\u000aLook: Tiny square chunks, a nice milky color yellow color to it, perfect consistency.\u000aSmell/Taste: Heavy hazeyness mixed with sandlewood and a berry/fruityness,definetly hits your lungs hard.\u000aEffects: I found this to be sorta like blue dream with a differnt flavor. I enjoyed this slightly more honestly, a little more spacey and super mellowing. Had me content to stare at the stars for 30+ mins with out blinking.My eyes watered for 15mins after that.

VAmazing high like nothing else before. Experienced it at the Grey Area cafe in Amsterdam. I walked the town non stop for 5 hours plus before I realized how high I had been. Almost like a positive drunk, happy but energized state w none of the stuttering and imbalance issues. I was alone in Amsterdam on a very cold couple of nights. This strain made the entire experience worth doing it repeatedly. A must experience Strain. Now, get it here in Vancouver Canada please.
