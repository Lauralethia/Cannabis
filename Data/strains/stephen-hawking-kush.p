VOh My Goodness. I picked up a couple of grams of this yesterday at Dockside Cannabis in SODO based on the recommendation of one of the bud tenders. This bud took me on a wonderful ride that started in sativa land and gradually descended into indica land. It was the end of the day for me so i really appreciated the soft landing. Had I been more energetic I feel that this strain would have been helpful in being creative or even a good walk around buzz. I will definitely keep this in my rotation. Sweet and pungent aroma after I broke up the buds, reminiscent of a sour diesel or a chemdawg.

VBEST CBD strain I&#39;ve tried so far.  Many CBD strains have the downside of being a little edgy (for me) so it nice to find one that had a lovely mellowness to it, maybe because it&#39;s crossed with an indica? Whatever the case may be - it eased my joint pain and put me in a good humor. The buds are lovely and frosty looking. THC is low - around 4% but I still caught a nice buzz. Very soothing.

VHealing codes from the universe immediately came to me when I smoked a hit of this high 11.4 CBD strain. Absolutely Smiles and TOTAL RELEIF are endrenching me in this dream. My love of indica just got greater because I have had a crush on Stephen Hawking and now I can smoke bud named after his fine ass and mind. WOW I think this strain will make me more intelligent. It is so much stonier and higher than I thought it would be. This is awesome medicine and its fun to smoke it.

VIn celebration of Mr. Hawking&#39;s life, I will review this high cbd strain. \u000a\u000aMy 1/4 was raised and harvested by Pruf Cultivar, a PDX grower associated with Electric Lettuce. The CBD : THC ratio is roughly 10% : 7% on this predominantly indica hybrid. \u000a\u000aThis is the perfect flower to keep on hand when you&#39;ve had a bit too much cannabis, and you&#39;re starting to feel anxious and paranoid. I had happened to have one too many bowls of OG Kush and felt myself beginning to feel a bit anxious, so I packed a bowl of Stephen Hawking Kush, vaped it in my Firefly2, and almost immediately, the anxiety went away. And slowly, I began to feel sleepy (as I should have, at nearly 4AM).

VI asked for a strain that would not allow anxiety to flare up and would ease me into a nice, relaxed sleep. This one delivered as promised! I don&#39;t get super high, but I love the gentle lull into a sweetly mellow state. I felt cuddly and warm and and secure between all my blankets and pillows on my bed right before I fell asleep! I would highly recommend this one to anyone who need to feel at ease.\u000aPlus, it&#39;s named after an awesome scientist!

VThe particular batch I had was 17.2% THC and 10.7% CBD. I really liked the smell. It crept up on me a bit, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a bit harsher than some other stuff, but it didn&#39;t lead to coughing. Eyes were really dry but dry mouth wasn&#39;t terrible. Manageable really. The body high was great, had a nice tingle in the back of my neck and a great feeling in my hands. The tingle slowly moved down my whole spine and then down from there. The head high was also good. I am a one bowl a night smoker, so I still have that low tolerance. It was pretty strong but not to the point of paranoia or getting couch-locked. Very functional high. I will say, I did lose track of time for a little while right after smoking. I also didn&#39;t feel how cold it was until I went back in the house. That could be good or bad, your choice. Overall pretty good.

V&#39;Like sipping sweet tea on a cool summers day&#39;\u000a--\u000aThe specific product I&#39;m reviewing is grown by Rogue Raven Farms.  This is my first time smoking this strain.  As always, I am smoking this product via my preferred method of consumption\u2014a bong.  The smell is not distinctive or pungent.  The closest comparison I can make is to green tea, with a hint of lemon.  It smokes surprisingly smooth.  I&#39;ve found that smoking a large amount of CBD heavy strains comes with a fatiguing dryness in the throat.  The high is surprisingly uplifting from an indica dominant strain, and has substantially eased my anxiety within 10 minutes of smoking it.  I generally distance myself from indica strains as they tend to put me to sleep immediately.  The high is light and unobtrusive.  I am pleasantly surprised by this strain.  It is definitely not a strain intended for an intense high, but for accommodating those seeking a therapeutic de-stresser.

VI bought  2 grams of this yesterday from a recreational dispensary. I am not a huge smoker, a bowl of good weed and that&#39;s all I need but this stuff reminded me of the weed I used to get in high school 25 years ago,  light buzz and you have to keep smoking it in the hopes that you would get high. With only a THC of 4.6% with CBD of 6.2 this is not something that you want to smoke to get high. I am actually mad that I wasted 20 bucks on this. Can&#39;t give it away because no one wants weed that won&#39;t get you high. I know better now.
