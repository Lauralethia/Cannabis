VWe loved this strain and had a really good sesh in the woods the buds smelled like Hawaiian punch and were nice and dense. They were covered in tricomes on the outside and had even more when the bud broke open and we got a lot of or if when it was ground.

VWow odd name to me. The bud has a minty finish for me. Harsh and earthy. The buzz is very headzie, with minor hallucinations, i have not used bud like this in ages,  Heavy burn out on the end,Has indo effects on me. I wouldn&#39;t recommend fkr a wake and bake sheesh, use this as a unwind at the end of a busy day.
