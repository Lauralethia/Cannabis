VI hit the chillum with the mighty King Kong packed nicely. It was slow to come on, but when it did I stood for 3 hours while watching The Wolf Of Wall Street. I don&#39;t know if I was standing because I was energized or because I didn&#39;t want to fall asleep. But it is a heavy high with a solid embrace between the temple.

VThis is very good. the high last strong the comedown can be a bit harsh. I will say mood going plays a big role in King Kong. If my adrenaline was up, no high but great pain relief, If your mood is relaxed so is the high, from what I have experience. Great stuff definitely worthy of any smoker.

VConfession of a Lightweight: This is a potent and attractive bud that has the best of both the Sativa and Indica worlds. \u000aOwing to its intriguing hybrid genetic structure, KK is a brilliant sedative if you just want to Netflix and/or chill. However, if taken too far one can experience an uncomfortable otherworldliness and short-term memory issues. The physical effects are immediate and soon followed by a cerebral high that is at first subtle but soon gains momentum and blasts you off.

VThis strain from Dr. Underground is excellent. It grows fast and tall, so pruning early in vegetative is recommended to increase yield. The buds are super crystally and have a unique smell, like a mix of lemon, mango, and papaya. This is definitely not a good daytime smoke to be productive. While it isn&#39;t a couchlock, King Kong is more psychedelic and can induce paranoid delusions. Coming down off this strain usually sent me into a deep sleep. I would definitely recommend anyone to add this strain to their catalog.

VI&#39;m not sure about the sativa percentage of this hybrid bc it hit me like a giant indica hammer of happiness.  First hit - full on stone - full body stone - numb.

I am a daily smoker and have been having problems of the potency. smoking a lot and not getting high. i thought it was me but it turns out it was the shit weed i been smoking. i got this tonight and immediately began to grind it up. (i found two very nice looking seeds btw.)\u000aafter packing and smoking the first bowl. i began to feel the effects immediately. very intense hit and really nice high you might expect from a good sativa strain.  As this is the first time ive smoked this strain, i don&#39;t know how long it will last. so may have to come back and update .but for now i am really digging this strain and will see hoe it plays out.

VI got this strain called King Kong X from The Treehouse Club in Spokane.  It was a strain from Fine Young Cannabis.  They had a 2 gram package for $20.  For the price, this was definitely worth the purchase.  When I opened the package I was very happy with the strong skunky aroma and nice fat buds.   The high was  very uplifting and  energetic and lasted for several hours.  Would definitely buy this strain again.

VI have Kong. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same as this strain, but they are similar. Here we go; It smells decent. It hits harsh in a pipe, but rolling joints is great. It gets you high. Not stoned, blunted, cloud nined, couch locked, etc etc high, but it will do the job. I don&#39;t know if I would use this for any medical issues... that&#39;s just my view.

VThis strain is slow hitting. It last for a long period of time and when it hits you in a wave it balances out to create an uplifting and euphoric high. You definitely feel energized and relaxed but not sleepy. You feel very focused and immediate pain relief. Your thoughts wander and you feel very pressed with a beautiful hug of clarity and a force field high. It tastes very earthy and has a very pungent and strong aroma. It&#39;s coated in beautiful crystals and it&#39;s hairs break easy with the pinch of a finger. When grinder up it smells very sweet and fresh and it&#39;s an overall wonderful experience. Definitely my newest favorite and I would put it under my top 5 and it would be the 5th. I smoked king king in a joint the first time and it tasted beautiful with a very sweet hit to the throat and it allows you to reminisce on the little things in life. This morning I hit it in a bowl before my daily activities. I was very focused and energized and very excited for the morning and the activities that are to come. It made me very happy and relaxed but not to a sleepy point. This strain is nearly perfect. It can only get better than this

VI was not very impressed w/ this bud.It smelled skunky and earthy and the taste was ok nothing special.The buds were a little too airy for my liking and dried out to crispiness quickly.I know different growers all vary but the high was just not there.this was King Kong X.

VMy experience could be due to the fact I don&#39;t have a grinder, but I&#39;m not a fan of how KK burns at all.  Very ashy and I keep spitting out ash when I&#39;m like a quarter of the way left in the bowl.  The high is relaxing, and it does what it needs to though.  I recommend a grinder for a better experience that&#39;s for sure.

V3 stars is a bit low for this strain, but 4 is too much so I&#39;ll give it 3.5. Very nice strain but nothing special. Buds were tight and dark green. Had a nice smell of citrus, sour, and then a pine, grass undertone. The taste to me was very nice, quite kushy and skunky. Strong smelling, I smoked a joint and the house really stunk of bud. Effects were nice, quite a strong mental buzz to start with before the indica side began. Not much couch lock but not exactly motivating either. Very relaxed. Overall very nice but nothing really that special, I would buy again though.
