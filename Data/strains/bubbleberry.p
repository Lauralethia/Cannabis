VDespite reviewing this wax strain several times already, I really can&#39;t emphasize how fucking good it is.  This is Nectar Sector wax, by the way, which imo is a very reliable brand, and certainly has my loyalty.  I recommend picking it up at your nearest dispensary, or at Delta Health Center, where I get mine.

VSweetness was greater than fruitiness, expansive smoke made for great value as hits (smoked w/ one hitter) lasted longer, thereby decreasing usage for achieving requisite dose level.\u000a\u000aNote to growers, don&quot;t be afraid to take extra time for curing, makes for a more flavorful taste and brings out fruitiness.

VNot too strong, high lasts a really long time. Im prone to anxiety, this is something i would take during a panic attack. It doesn&#39;t make me hungry or tired which is a plus, I never felt really giggly as I was hoping I would by the reviews...But Its very calming, yet you can still function and interact. As it started to wear off I got slight paranoia though. My BF said he got a bad headache, so if you&#39;re prone to that take that into consideration. I&#39;ll defiantly try it again, I take a few more hits than usual, but the calmness of this strain is probably the best compared to others.

I asked for advice from gurus, what strain to bear most of the mite infection. The BubbleBerry offered and indeed, this breed does not like the spider mites.\u000aDark-leaved, thick-stemmed plants are growing rapidly. Sativa  plants and Indica form inflorescences creators. Robust cylindrical flowers, thick pistils. Lavishly sprinkled with large visible trichomes. The bloom was completed exactly two months.\u000aSmoke: light, pungent aroma. Tutti frutti aftertaste.\u000aExcellent mixed high and Stone. Long lasting.\u000aProduction: 10/10. Effect: 10 / 10. Double Happiness.\u000aThis strain wasn&#39;t even cup winner.

VThis wonderful, absolutely perfect hybrid of its parent strains IBlueberry crossed with Bubblegum) results in a probably slightly indica-dominant, uninhibited body-and-mind euphoria; definitely a new favorite for me (and that&#39;s so uncommon these days). It has a primarily sweet yet somewhat earthy taste that also features a little pine. However, the awesome high and flavor of Bubbleberry downright pale in comparison to its absolutely divine aroma that I can only describe as the sweetest-smelling thing in the universe. I personally never see this strain at all, so if you find it, know that it&#39;s a must-have, must-smoke treat.

VI had a low tolerance for once, so I got some Bubble Berry and man, its intense in a good way. My anxiety and depression are replaced by relaxation and euphoria; however if you have a low tolerance, you are in for a ride.\u000a\u000aSmoking one bowl gets me to a strong level of inebriation already. As i smoke another bowl I feel relaxed and get strong dry mouth. After 3 or 4 bowls it gets to a whole &#39;nother level, a body and mind experience. \u000a\u000aThe body feels heavy and slow, very relaxed. However I in my head I feel quite dizzy, but euphoria increases as well. Closed Eye Visuals are seen if I close my eyes. If I smoke too much, I feel extremely heavy and quite dizzy, which is remedied by laying down and riding it out, as it is quite intense.\u000a\u000aOverall however, 4.5/5 since its one of the most relaxing/euphoric/psychedelic strains i&#39;ve ever tried.

VI got 4.5 of this stuff. Smells very sweet with bubblegum and berry tones. This was a batch I got from a local dispensary, this stuff was very fluffy, not necessarily fluffy but hollow, airy, crunchy buds. I am not a fan of &quot;leafy&quot; like buds, although it could&#39;ve been this batch. Nug&#39;s are covered in resin and a few orange hairs here and there. When smoking from a bubbler, you get a hit of a sweet blueberry candy mixed with a cheese like taste...idk because it got a drop of water on it from tipping bubbler over. Very sweet smoke. Effects were as listed with a small hint of a giggly type effect. Good sleep after this wares off. 4/5 due to bud quality (airy light buds) but 5/5 for effects and flavors

VA Sativa dominant hybrid from right here in WA. There&#39;s a funny story behind how we brought it home.\u000a\u2029Our first impression? It smells reaaaaally good. The buds we snagged from our go to bud-tenders,&#160;Agate Dreams in Suquamish, WA (check us out being, on their &#39;gram!) were big and dense, enough to make it almost-laborious to grind.\u2029A great tasting, sweet first smoke. Do I taste berries? Definitely some blueberry in there! Dense buds. Mean, thick, smelly smoke. MMMmm! The SMELL!!\u000a\u2029Great full body high, makes me really slow and derpy. Fun to just chill outside, watching the stars together until it&#39;s too cold! Some cough off of the drag because of the super thick buds (although, all of the wildfires around here may have contributed, sadly). Happily, this one makes us smile big, cheek-hurting grins. No major munchies. We grilled some bomb cheeseburgers, see Jess&#39;s recipe on our blog&#160;here and then we watched Man Down, a top notch BBC comedy on Netflix that is HILARIOUS, especially the kid who&#39;s always shouting.\u000a\u2029This strain seems to be the best of both worlds!&#160;It has a mind racing, all-over Sativa body high that makes you grin like a Cheshire Cat, while still being hella relaxing, mellow, sleeps like an Indica.\u000a\u2029Grade: 9/10 - The sheer amount of &quot;derpyness&quot; is the only thing stopping Bubbleberry not getting a perfect score.\u000a\u2029UPDATE: We went back and picked up some more, Bubbleberry is definitely one being added to our list. What&#39;s on your list that we definitely need to try? Hook us up.\u000a\u000aCheck out www.stonerjoesus.com or follow us on Twitter and Instagram for more!!

VPeople drink straight alcohol because it gets them drunk fast. The issue with that is alcohol by itself doesn&#39;t have the greatest taste. This is the marijuana version of liquor. It has a very earthy, dirt-like taste to it. That actually is an understatement, it is a gross swampy taste. At first I was disgusted with the taste of this dope, however I came back to it as the high is incredible. This is one of the better highs I have had from a hybrid strain and I would recommend this strain to people, but be wary of the awful taste.

VI had Bubbleberry way back in 2000 or so, and was elated to find it at a dispensary. I got a 1/2 ounce and was happy I stocked up! This is my #1 daily go-to med for daytime. Very cerebral high, great mood booster, and wonderful adjunct to creative endeavors. Now all I need is a good stable clone to assure future availability. Bubbleberry may not be a new &#39;hip&#39; strain, but it is tried and true. The batch I got had big dense buds that last a long time when used in a small bong. I had an 1/8th last me two months with almost daily usage.

VA good break from many of the &quot;staples&quot;, this is much more muskily flavoured, more pissy than skunky but a bit lighter than you&#39;d expect, with an aroma to match.  Fairly nondescript, elsewise, besides having somewhat lighter, thinner trichomes than on some other strains such as NYCD or Tangerine Dream.  A solid euphoria, and an nice, swimmy head high that is quite enjoyable and relieves tension nicely.
