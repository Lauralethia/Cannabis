VJust had my first taste of this and I like it a lot.  Great rich fruity scent and nice taste.  The effects creeped up on me and lasted a long time.  Classic Indica, nice body sensations, dreaminess and completely relaxing.  Doesn&#39;t make me inoperable, but I thought it was fairly strong.

VAmazing strain that survived several weeks of a fairly heavy California rain storm.  Turned out Beautifully purple.  Smelled a deep flowery sweet aroma about as earthy as it gets and was about as stoney as it gets.  Perfect for Insomnia and Pain relief.

VVery nice strain. Smooth and nice tasting, but nothing of spectacular note in the flavour regard. Very interesting buzz though. Nice cozy lay low and do something quiet and interesting kind of space. Low anxiety/paranoia, if any at all. Surprisingly slow rise, like as much as 15 minutes before cruising altitude -- so be patient before you go fire up more engines. Great evening bud, hands down. Perfect for reading, TV, puzzles, folding laundry, writing, a little slap and tickle maybe; that kind of thing. Great buzz in spite of very high tolerance. Highly recommend.

VPersonally, this strain makes me pretty nonfunctional. It makes me feel really groggy, and makes it difficult for me to be productive. This is definitely going to be a &#39;smoke this before bed&#39; kind of strain for me. I&#39;m inclined to avoid smoking this when I have anything I really want to get done after smoking, aside from passing out or mellowing way out. \u000a\u000aThat being said, this strain is fantastic for just mellowing out and feeling happy. It&#39;s a really relaxing high.

The high was a nice floaty feeling, very euphoric. When in a bad mood or super stressed out, give this one a shout. Test results of my sample. 15.47% thc 0.0% cbd

Vthis strain is one of the only kinds of co2 oil I&#39;ve smoked that will give me paranoia and rapid heart beat if you smoke too much. it&#39;s fine if you just have 1 hit of it but it&#39;s so easy to over smoke. one night I hit it 3 times and tried to go to bed and I had lots of trouble breathing, it was kind of scary. too strong to just smoke like its nothing, be very very careful with this one. a little goes a long way. try out 1 or 2 hits and leave it at that for 30 mins before deciding if you want more.

VHeavy Hitter! Lovely potent strain. Hits your head nice n quick, then is immediately followed by a relaxing, calming, numbing wave throughout the body. Both mind and body are medicinally soothed by a pain relieving euphoria. Nice earthy sweet flavor and a lucid high overall.  Good medicine.

VSolid indica! Has a great aroma, really lavender-centric flavor, felt clear-headed the next morning. Awesome anxiety-related insomnia/post 12 hour work day Netflix strain.
