VI have been trying to find a strain of cannabis that helps treat back pain and lower my stress and anxiety. This strain does all the above! I am a newbie smoker and sativa strains were just not working well for me as too much racey thoughts and hyperactivity. This strain silences my mind and gives me full body relaxation. The flavor is sort of a blueberry fruity flavor and some pine notes. Used a portable vaporizer and the flavor matched the smell well. After a bit of smoking you are likely to get the munchies so good for appetite. The high is odd because you can have laser focus one moment then be a total space cadet the next. Good night time smoke as it will relax your whole body and make you nice and sleepy. The sensation starts at the lower back and moves it&#39;s way up. Highly recommended if you have stress or anxiety issues as well as those looking for pain relief.

VThe particular pheno of this fine strain that I purchased is the CBD rich variant, it smells amazing. A strong rose smell, lilac, pine, and a bit of lavender. One of the more amazing and unique smelling strains I&#39;ve encountered.\u000aIt is very heavy hitting, and I have a quite the tolerance. The pain relief is the best I&#39;ve found. After maybe 20 minutes my entire body suddenly completely relaxed and pain dissipated. Eventually so much so that my extremities and my body felt somewhat numb.\u000aFairly clear headed and focused, and pretty effective for anxiety and depression.\u000a\u000aGreat if you need to relax and be pain free.

Not a harsh smoke at all.  Relieves my back pain and leaves me feeling very content with my surroundings.  Definitely try it if you have the chance!

VI don&#39;t know about the &quot;immobilising narcotic effect&quot;. It&#39;s potency and duration were very good. I didn&#39;t know that (narcotic effect) was even possible. I mean, I don&#39;t ever get couch-locked, but this strain was decent for pain management. NO immobilisation here, regardless of how much I smoked. Long lasting body buzz. I&#39;m sure that I would enjoy the flower more. I got this in black hash form and I would rate it a 3.7. It had a strange farm/zoo aftertaste, most likely due to a shotty trim job, I&#39;m pretty sure it was grown outdoor. This strain is very rare where I am, but it was average pricing.

I saw auras around my dogs head, while everything was fairly amusing to me I was so relaxed I didn&#39;t feel the need to laugh. We&#39;ve grown and smoked a few different varieties this has quickly become a new favorite and will definitely find a home in our garden again. Anyone looking for a nirvana like high, look no further. Just a gorgeous gorgeous strain. First class weed!

VThis was a strong cerebral high and I smoked it for about a week straight. The positives: This strain is good. It&#39;s a nice heady high and a deep lemony flavor. Makes me really hungry and I really enjoy music while high on this strain. However, this is one of the harshest strains I&#39;ve smoked so far. Leaves my throat pretty wrecked and I would recommend drinking a lot of water while smoking. It&#39;s a good balance but not my absolute favorite.\u000a
