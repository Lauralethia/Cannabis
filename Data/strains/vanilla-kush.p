VAbsolutely hands down best strain for anxiety AND insomnia. For me the effect equated to 10mg of Valium. I&#39;m hoping to use this strain to replace anti-anxiety medication. \u000aAlso is some of the best sweetest tasting I have had in years.

VGreat for &quot;bedtime&quot;\u000a\u000aIf you want to fall asleep with some tasty flavors in your mouth, give this stuff a try.\u000a\u000aGood for helping to fall asleep, without putting you to sleep. Excellent for if you plan to smoke, &quot;say goodnight&quot; to your lover using your hips, then both fall asleep afterward.\u000a\u000aRelaxes the body without dizziness or couchlock.\u000a\u000aGreat indica for if you have anxiety related insomnia.\u000a\u000aI feel like it even gives me slightly sweeter dreams.

VSecond time around with this strain. Different grower. First time I didn&#39;t like Vanilla Kush. This time, however, it&#39;s a completely different story. This strain is SUPER strong. I smoke every day (at least nightly, sometimes during the day a couple times) and need help sleeping (also need help getting more food in during the day) -- this strain knocks me out and helps me sleep w/o a doubt. Also, potentially gives me the munchies as most strands do. However, it can also make me dizzy (as it&#39;s so headstrong) and feel sick (last night I was near throwing up for a while - laying down solved this problem, fell asleep in a second).\u000a\u000aI&#39;d get this again/will get this again, and recommend you try it if you haven&#39;t!

VThis morning I wake and baked with Vanilla Kush.  It was pricey, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s 27.69%  THC.   Newbies- be careful with this one!  ;)  \u000a\u000aVanilla Kush smells sublime - like vanilla and dank skunk.  Something about it reminded me of a foreign country. It&#39;s a potent strain, and I am very pleasantly high and HAPPY this morning!\u000a\u000aI also got my period (five days late) this morning, and it was a stronger one than normal. This medicine really helped with the cramping and general malaise.  I&#39;m chillin&#39; like a villain and am not at all perturbed that the dishes are piling up in the sink..\u000a\u000aVanilla Kush is an indica strain, and I&#39;m discovering I prefer indicas over sativas.  Both are wonderful and have their places, but I love being relaxed into couch lock and able to slip off into sleep.\u000a\u000aI would totally buy Vanilla Kush again.  I really got lucky this visit to the dispensary because both strains I picked up I would buy again, which is rare.

VI was never really an indica person-until I found this strain. While most indicas of the past have left me feeling bogged down and burnt out, the world of Vanilla Kush is totally different. Its scent contains the sweet elements normally attributed to the strain, but I didn&#39;t feel much of anything different about its taste on the inhale. This strain is strong, much stronger than I was expecting. The buzz definitely sneaks up, and when it hits, it hits hard. This is a really great strain to smoke with other people-I have yet to share it with someone and not have conversations for what feels like hours on end. On the comedown, appetite is huge, so I would say this is not a strain for those really trying to control their portion sizes. I do get pretty sleepy and lazy, but a quick nap usually cures that. Overall, Vanilla Kush is a perfect strain for anxiety and depression alike, and I find once the effects wear off I am left with an incredible sense of inner peace. The only real downside is the dry mouth, but a couple tall glasses of water usually take care of it.

VVery Happy with this strain. I bought Shatter and it vapes really nice. It has a sweet vanilla aftertaste and works well on my neuropathic pain, nice to take before bed; Very relaxing :-) Little dry mouth, but nothing too annoying.

But vet-tokers will appreciate this 4.5 \u2b50\ufe0f-&#128076;&#127995;strain for her ability to combat pain, stress &amp; foul moods \u2600\ufe0fso def give her a try if opportunity presents! &#128163;\u270c&#127997;

VThe grower (my cousin) who gave me a couple of ounces of Vanilla Kush didn&#39;t take it all the way to completion and he didn&#39;t flush the plants and he dried the buds a bit too fast so it wasn&#39;t the best smoke I&#39;ve ever had by far. I think a lot depends on the grower&#39;s skills as to how potent and flavorful this strain is. The buds were light and fluffy and I prefer dense nugs but I have three of the Vanilla Kush about two weeks from putting into flower so if I can get these plants to live up to their potential I&#39;ll write another review in about 3 months. The strain is bushy as all get out and looks to be ideal for scrogging.

VI grabbed an O of vanilla kush a few days back, it has a very distinct smell - it stings the nostrils and you can find hints of vanilla within the strains &#39;extract like&#39; fruity scent. Vanilla kush gives me a nice cerebral stone, yet leaves my body with a euphoric tingly feeling. It tastes real smooth and the bud itself has bag appeal - different shades of light and dark green/yellow buds w lots of red and orange trichome covering most of it.  Combined with northern lights... unreal, pick out a good movie.

VBargain hunting produced a loaded jar of brown dry buds. Yikes! I dusted off the bottle labeled Vanilla Kush by Barneys Farm. Then hesitantly cracked the top and was nailed by a tidal wave of Vanilla. Excited for my catch, I raced to my cave and commence the festivities. Golden brown &amp; delicious, dusted with powder; I could smell spice, earth &amp; vanilla mixed with hints of citrus &amp; skunk.  The taste was musty with a strange vanilla twist. My effects were outstanding, clear minded and totally relaxed. I will visit her again but hopefully a fresher batch.\u000a\u000aCheers,\u000aLB420

I was really stimulated and entertained. The trip didn&#39;t get out of control even when I smoked larger amounts (1g+) and it was really focusing on the main tasks of indica. It has a serious couchlock effect and is very good to treat pain and cramps. I had the slightest hybrid effect as I was also very creative and as a music producer i found this strain very good for daily use for me.\u000a\u000aFrowers i recieved were very beautiful, and full of crystals.

VIf you havent tried vanilla kush you gotta get some. First few hits sneak up on you quietly, and before you know it you&#39;re wrapped in a warm indica blanket that keeps your mind in deep and intensely inward focused thought. Pain relief is very noticeable. Keeps you couch locked with the muchies, so probably best at night, and keep snacks nearby. Good for focusing on self healing and meditation.

VVery earthy kush like flavors with subtle vanilla notes make this strain an enjoyable smoke. The high is very relaxing and eases anxiety right out the door. With a thc percentage of 21% this is a potent hard hitting indica that is not for beginners. I would recommend this for anyone with anxiety or depression as it simply crushes both with small doses. The high can lean a little twords couch lock but can be easily avoided due to the good vibe and body high given. This strain is a go to for me.

VIf you havent tried vanilla kush you gotta get some. First few hits sneak up on you quietly, and before you know it you&#39;re wrapped in a warm indica blanket that keeps your mind in deep and intensely inward focused thought. Pain relief is very noticeable. Keeps you couch locked with the muchies, so probably best at night, and keep snacks nearby. Good for focusing on self healing and meditation. Might mention that if you&#39;re smoking with a friend, probably not much conversation going on besides sharing some deep thoughts.

VThis strain makes you chill as heck. Had anxiety, stomach pain from anxiety, and couldn&#39;t sleep because I was on edge so much. This strain really relaxed me and made everything that I was worrying about dissolve. It also made my stomach ache go away as well. Was able to fall asleep and stay asleep for a long time. It&#39;s such a relaxing and easy smoke strain. It almost feels like you&#39;re using aromatherapy because of the scent it has. I loved it and will use it again before bedtime.

VI really enjoy the high and the real heavy feeling I got from it. It&#39;s a great night time strain. My only complaint is how bad it gave me the munchies. For someone trying to watch what they eat, you may wanna try something different. Getting the munchies that late and acting on them isn&#39;t good lol. But I slept all night, I was nice and relaxed, not to fuzzy headed. I Could still play a few games before I headed to bed and still played at the same level I would have if I smoked something else. It was a very earthy sweet kush with small notes of vanilla. I would buy it again.

VSmells so damn good! Hints of vanilla and very floral like the smell of floral tea. I got this in-house strain from my favorite new recreational dispensary (House of Green in Anchorage, Alaska) not listed on Leafly. Freshly harvested just a couple weeks ago, the buds looked perfect, nice and bushy dark green covered with tons of visible crystals (I also submitted a photo!). I bought this indica to help me sleep and it does the trick, melting my body into my bed. I am still alert enough to write this review but I feel like I could fall asleep in an instant. It also cured my minor nausea from the acidic espresso I drank earlier. The effects are very comparable to one of my favorite strains for sleeping \u2018Chocolate Chunk\u2019. Easy 5 stars for relaxing, sleeping, as well as a 5 star smell, flavor, and potency! ~19,72% bought an 1/8th for $45.

Vhi all well heres my experience of vanilla kush from barneys farm,this is coco grown,\u000aan easy grower quite quick in veg and i should imagine would be a good candidate for 12-12 growers the smell is strong even in very young plants making a good cf a must nice short stature with close internodes and minimal stretch in flower takes to rough treatment well however older branches do become brittle so training is best done early.\u000afirst 2 weeks of 12-12 they like a little more nitrogen than most so a little grow nutes added to flower nutes seemed best. after that a low ec 1.2 inc bg of 0.40 was adequate.\u000abuds are solid trichy and retain this well after drying smell is intense and grows more so during curing.\u000ayeild a little above average but i think with big lights could be substantialy more(mine is 250w hps)\u000ai make no mention of length of flowering as bf claim 65 days but for full maturity and 20% ambers mine took a little over 100 days 12-12 but as we grow for oil medicine it needs longer,would have been most stoney at about 70 days.\u000aright smoke report,\u000athis strain has it all taste is good and improves with curing no cough if properly flushed (10-14 days till brix reading near zero)\u000astrong hit straight away then shortly after a freight train drives through you and gravity increases!if you go for a bong then its taste is smooth proper vanilla/lavender and taste lingers a while stone lasts a good few hours and no stone over!\u000ai will add that this is a good strain for oil and above average yeild of 5ml from an oz so a winner there.\u000aright well im really stoned so if i missed anything feel free to point it out,peace all

I feel pretty happy but my brain isn&#39;t too chatty for sleep. \u000a\u000aI have found it most difficult to get consistent sleep medication via cannabis.  I&#39;m trying a two birds one stone strategy to help lower my reliance on opiods and night time benzodiazipine. Vanilla Kush has been a good strain to cover both purposes. and it&#39;s dee-lish.

When I crushed it, there was more of a citrus note to it. \u000a\u000aMaybe it is just because I had been smoking Sativa&#39;s and Sativa dominants all week but this high really made me sleepy. The flavor had a slight vanilla taste on the lips after I vaped it. I wish I would have bought more of this stuff. Good flavor, good scent, really helped with sleepy time, and no munchies.

The flavor well it&#39;s obvious vanilla but it&#39;s not what I expected really earthy and really strong vanilla taste which I didn&#39;t expect to taste so much vanilla it&#39;s the bomb high recommend this one.

VMaybe it&#39;s me...\u000aGrew out two feminized &#127792;&#127792; from Barney&#39;s, both germinated in &lt;1 day.  \u000aFlowered for 60 days, good size/density.\u000aSmoke:  perhaps I messed up the curing??  My other Strains are fine...\u000aTaste:  not so good no vanilla, no nice weed taste, just an odd taste, 3-week cure. I tried some in my PAX but same, just a funky taste.\u000aHigh:  surprisingly good given the taste.  Uplifting I can get shit done.  \u000aI&#39;ve saved a mother plant and will run a few clones for a few harvests, if the taste continues to be like the first batch it&#39;ll be removed from my rotation.

VI was a bit disappointed with this strain. I expected something much more potent. It just didn&#39;t live up to all the hype - was I expecting too much? I don&#39;t think so: It just didn&#39;t do much for me &#39;at all&#39;. Little stress relief, no pain relief (&#39;mild&#39; perhaps), it COULD be beneficial for those w/ trouble falling asleep. \u000a\u000aI mixed mine with some Blue Cheese and another time with Blue Dream. Only THEN was the experience &#39;MORE&#39; than enjoyable :-). It&#39;s better than nothing (solo), though, that&#39;s for sure.

When trying to come up with a descriptor for the flavor all I could think of was, &quot;this is how god intended weed to taste.&quot; So thats how I would say it tastes.  The high is a wonderful low key indica buzz.  Not a couch locker but a wonderful, smoke a bowl and clean the house slowly while drawing a bath, sort of high.  I think that I would recommend this strain to anyone.

VI really like this strain. I am predominantly an Indica vaper. This is primarily for medicinal purposes, specifically insomnia caused by anxiety. However, since I started using cannabis to medicate this, I have started to enjoy it as a general relaxant. \u000a\u000aVanilla Kush fits the bill for me. My main medicine is CBD Critical Mass. It reminds me of it in terms of effect. Body stone, couch lock, but a little clearer - so in smaller amounts I can use it to relax while watching TV at night time. It does help with my sleep and getting to that winding down stage. \u000a\u000aHowever - my personal plant doesn&#39;t really seem to match other reviews in terms of flavour profile. This may have been my own fault. This is only my 4th of 5th grow. When it had fully cured in jars and ready to smoke, each time I popped that Kilner jar, I was hit with a smell that was more pungent, earthy and a little spicy. \u000aThis did mellow over time, as I worked my way down the jars over the months. The taste for me was more savoury, but I did get a very mild vanilla undertone. \u000a\u000aAnyway, since I am mainly a medical user, the taste/smell doesn&#39;t really affect me much. I just need it to wind me down. \u000a\u000aGood for turning off, locking into your seat, setting eyes at half mast and settling in for a snooze.

VVanilla Kush&#39;s THC content hits you almost immediately--an orally numbing sensation whose mere presence manages to dry my mouth to the point where I decided on nicknaming it Lake Chad for the remainder of my session was the best idea of the night. Twenty years of being sucked oppressively bone-dry by the sun succeeded in being endured in a little under an hour in my bedroom; chugging water from a jug, the AC on full blast and set to Cold notwithstanding. Wicked cottonmouth invaded my head space, though I hadn&#39;t seen this as being exceptionally problematic.  Its medicinally bitter, vanilla extract flavor was hard to ignore (or wash out with juice!). Relaxation an enjoyable numbing audibility, was fiercely good minutes after I first took three puffs from my joint and appreciated the surrounding wilderness. However, it certainly hadn&#39;t been the case 1 hour in: relaxation ceased to be relaxing. My head fluttered and I felt hungry. The tiredness grows much like taproots reaching heavenward and stealing the water from your garden&#39;s original inhabitants. Watermelon seeds and cotton balls: \u000atwo oddball tastes I experienced hours after initially smoking. This is a fun Indica --I&#39;m perhaps a touch weirdly reflective and introspective while peaking, but I seemed to notice so many of the little details of the activities and tasks I performed, making them a lot easier (not to mention quicker) to finish. I also processed thoughts in a more philosophical fashion. Would recommend but won&#39;t exactly remember.  It&#39;s too similar to a great many other Indicas for this specific strain to get branded in my brain anytime soon. Likable.

VSmells so damn good! Hints of vanilla and very floral like the smell of floral tea. I got this in-house strain from my favorite new recreational dispensary (House of Green in Anchorage, Alaska) not listed on Leafly. Freshly harvested just a couple weeks ago, the buds looked perfect, nice and bushy dark green covered with tons of visible crystals (I also submitted a photo!). I bought this indica to help me sleep and it does the trick, melting my body into my bed. I am still alert enough to write this review but I feel like I could fall asleep in an instant. It also cured my minor nausea from the acidic espresso I drank earlier. The effects are very comparable to one of my favorite strains for sleeping \u2018Chocolate Chunk\u2019. Easy 5 stars for relaxing, sleeping, as well as a 5 star smell, flavor, and potency! ~19,72% bought an 1/8th for $45.

VI absolutely love this strain! It has a smoothness like vanilla, and a but of a floral/lavender kick. Very nice tasting (vaping with pax2). \u000a\u000aI feel lifted and happy. Maybe a little giggly. It crept on slowly, which I love! I never had a sense of paranoia or anxiety, which is fantastic as my primary reason for using marijuana is for anxiety, stress and depression. \u000a\u000aI sleep like a baby with this stuff. I think it might be a new staple for me. Very nice! \u000a\u000aI would say that if you go easy, it&#39;s great for novices, if you go heavy a chronic user would also really enjoy this one.

VThe other reviews definitely resonated with me, the notes of lavender, vanilla, citrus, and a slight earthy flavor were all apparent! I&#39;d describe this as a functional indica in lower dosages. While the body warmth will allow you to get to sleep, I didn&#39;t feel glued to the couch. This is a potent strain for novices, so be careful as it hits very smoothly and tastes great. I dose appropriately for medicinal benefits, so my end goal isn&#39;t to get baked. Clear headed and calm thoughts from this one.

VI don&#39;t know what it is about this strain, but it puts me out of this world. Definitely not what I&#39;m used to with any Sativa. It&#39;s a very heavy head high. Only one bowl of this really gets you going. A bit harder to focus and be in a productive mood, but it&#39;s still accomplishable. I would say it&#39;s in its most effective state for about an hour, then dies off slowly. A fun strain to use at night, not so much earlier in the day unless you really don&#39;t have much to do. In comparison to other strains I&#39;ve tried, this gets you to that good state of mind with just 1 bowl, while any Sativas I&#39;ve used would take around 3/4. Still prefer a good Sativa &#128077;&#127996;

Vhi all well heres my experience of vanilla kush from barneys farm,this is coco grown,\u000aan easy grower quite quick in veg and i should imagine would be a good candidate for 12-12 growers the smell is strong even in very young plants making a good cf a must nice short stature with close internodes and minimal stretch in flower takes to rough treatment well however older branches do become brittle so training is best done early.\u000afirst 2 weeks of 12-12 they like a little more nitrogen than most so a little grow nutes added to flower nutes seemed best. after that a low ec 1.2 inc bg of 0.40 was adequate.\u000abuds are solid trichy and retain this well after drying smell is intense and grows more so during curing.\u000ayeild a little above average but i think with big lights could be substantialy more(mine is 250w hps)\u000ai make no mention of length of flowering as bf claim 65 days but for full maturity and 20% ambers mine took a little over 100 days 12-12 but as we grow for oil medicine it needs longer,would have been most stoney at about 70 days.\u000aright smoke report,\u000athis strain has it all taste is good and improves with curing no cough if properly flushed (10-14 days till brix reading near zero)\u000astrong hit straight away then shortly after a freight train drives through you and gravity increases!if you go for a bong then its taste is smooth proper vanilla/lavender and taste lingers a while stone lasts a good few hours and no stone over!\u000ai will add that this is a good strain for oil and above average yeild of 5ml from an oz so a winner there.\u000aright well im really stoned so if i missed anything feel free to point it out,peace all

For someone trying to watch what they eat, you may wanna try something different. Getting the munchies that late and acting on them isn&#39;t good lol. But I slept all night, I was nice and relaxed, not to fuzzy headed. I Could still play a few games before I headed to bed and still played at the same level I would have if I smoked something else. It was a very earthy sweet kush with small notes of vanilla. I would buy it again.

If you need something to help you sleep then smoke a fat vanilla kush joint and you&#39;ll be out for the night. And it does actually smell vanillaish and is a decent smooth smoke. It needs more smell and flavour though for 5 stars though

VTook a few dabs of Vanilla Kush at the end of the night before slipping into bed with netflix. \u000a\u000aVanilla Kush hits you right in the back of the neck and quickly makes its way down your spine. Makes you feel warm and at ease with life. Great for muscle spasms and insomnia. Pretty heavy indicate if you&#39;re getting the real stuff. Vanilla kush is a solid indica and worth a try. Be safe!

VNot really an Indica person, but this was a very calm and soothing high. The flavor was incredibly sweet and floral, reminded me of vanilla, but was a little closer to a mild lavender. Good smoke and relax kind of strain, don&#39;t plan on getting anything done. After a rather large bowl the body high was very nice, but paranoia kicked in singly out of nowhere. Moral of the story, pace yourself. Woke up a little groggy the next day, but when I got up, it wasn&#39;t too bad. High amount of linalool kept me coming back for another hit

VThis was a beautiful plant with all the right &quot;kush&quot; characteristics. It cured to have a smell and taste very true to its name... very pleasant vanilla. It has been a bit hit with patients and should probably be used in the evening at a time when the sedative feeling will not inhibit other activities.

VThis has been the highest quality of pot I&#39;ve ever tried. My cousin got an ounce of this, and a new bong, we both hit about 8 bowls of this (holy shit so good) and the taste was like walking through a field of vanilla plants, roses and whatever other flowers that smell sweet; it smelled and tasted like Christmas morning. By far the best I&#39;ve had. The only downside was around an hour after smoking that much, I got really dry mouth and started to be too stoned to move. Not that bad of a thing, but I smoked wayyy to much of this to start with. Would highly recommend tho.

VWhat can I say about this one? It has easily become, one of my top 5 strains of all time! Big, beautiful, chunky, frosty, nuggets of awesome! I ordered this strain 4 times in a row, from Top Flight Cannabis in Pomona, California. It was sticky, the trichomes glistened in the light, it tasted amazing, and it gave me one of the greatest highs I&#39;ve ever had! Right from the beginning it smelled like Vanilla (of course), but when you grind up the nugs is when you really get to smell everything in it. Vanilla, lavander, and a subtle sweetness, that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on. And in all honesty, it tasted just like it smelled! Great for any kind of pain, insomnia, anxiety, lack of appetite, nausea, and stress. Things that a lot of us patients deal with on a daily, this strain took care of it all! The high comes on nice and easy, last for about 2 to 3 hours (give or take), and fades of nicely with drowsiness. Definitely recommend this strain!
