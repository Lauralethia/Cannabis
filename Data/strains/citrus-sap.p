VI kept passing this one up for other strains for awhile. I&#39;m glad it was my only option for anything sativa like. I picked up a half gram of shatter from AZNS of Scottsdale. Yum is it tasty! I have only recently begun to appreciate terpenes, this is one of my favorites. Obvious citrus taste along with what can only be described as a sap taste, but it tastes good. This strain is great to give me an appetite in the morning normally I can&#39;t eat to save my life in the mornings. The buzz lasts around 2 hours for me, and I&#39;m able to stay productive. Too much and I experience a hazy sensation

VGot a half ounce of some very good looking Citrus Sap from DC Collective in Canoga Park. Bright green, dense buds with dark orange, almost red hairs stuck tight to the sides. \u000a\u000aTaste is great, the name fits it well. The smoke is sweet and light start to finish, with a tangy lemon/orange aftertaste. Smells piney, but tastes more fruity. \u000a\u000aDefinitely a sativa dominant hybrid, the high for me has been very clear yet pleasantly stony. More of a head high than a body high for sure, but it seems relatively controllable overall. Most noticeable effects are increased humorousness and calm, buzzed focus (for those of you who can focus while high). \u000a\u000aOverall? Would recommend strongly as a daytime sativa. Tastes great, good quality, pleasant effects.

VWawaweewa!! This is one unique strain. It has a VERY special taste and smell... I don&#39;t know if I would say it&#39;s &#127818;... it seems very sweet to me... but it&#39;s really pleasant. Heavy hitter. Kind of knocked my socks off to the point where I thought it might actually be an indica. See? Crazy talk. But it makes me very mellow, like I could take a nap &#128564; and it&#39;s only 9:15am. Will keep this baby as a night time strain cause...HOT DAMN&#128293;&#127774;

VAGL-CTMJ-Prime Wellness\u000a\u000aWas very excited to try this one after reading about its lineage &amp; flavor profile. \u000a\u000aThe only thing I really liked about it was the well advertised &quot;glue-esque&quot; sticky buds. Everything looks &amp; smells high quality. \u000a\u000aThe draw is lacking but what you do get upon lighting is generally smooth. The hit lacks the citrus &quot;Punch&quot; in its name &amp; its a relatively light headie effect.Skunky musty taste with the slightest hint of orange.\u000a\u000aMore of a light hearted day time smoke that frankly fails to live up to the hype. Will not try again.

VI had so many lemon/citrus scented strains that scream citrus to the nose but most fall short by having that typical earthy kush taste that doesn&#39;t resemble the smell. If you&#39;re looking to have the flavor of citrus look no further. The high was not sedating nor energetic, it&#39;s exactly what you would think a hybrid would give. A great balance with lots of euphoria.

VI was not expecting this to be so potent!  Smoked a joint the night before, split amongst 4 people.  We were all high, giggly, and talkative.  And all was well...\u000a\u000aThen, the next day, I smoked just 1 large toke off a bowl.  Because I had smoked the joint previously, I thought i knew what i was getting into.  Wrong!  I coughed my ass off.  Pow!  The smoke was so thick.  About 10 minutes later, i practically forgot my name.  30 minutes in, i found myself lost in the sheets of my bed, unable to pull together a tangible thought.\u000a\u000aI felt lost in the sheets like a toddler.  Literally staring into an abyss of floaty whiteness.  No idea where i was.  Also, it didn&#39;t matter.\u000a\u000aThe initial high lasted for well over an hour.  It was incredibly psychedelic.  I had a lot of mental energy, but remained calm.  Eventually played videogames like a champ.\u000a\u000aI have a lot of it left, but i think i&#39;ll take smaller tokes moving forward, or i&#39;ll vape.

VPicked up an 8th of this today from the dispensary, big fan of both of the parents so why wouldn&#39;t it be good! Although most of the reviews recall a more tangie dominant taste/smell, mine smelled like straight up pine sap with hints of citrus coming through. Tested at 19.76% THC-A. Very pungent flavor with a very nice heady sativa high. I was already in a good mood, and after smoking a bowl of this I was in an even better mood! Great strain, HIGHLY recommended if you can get it!

VCitrus sap is an outstanding bud. I very much enjoy the round, dense structure of the buds, and when you take a deep inhale from the jar it opens your sinus with a blast of orange and lemon.

VI just picked this up for the first time in sauce form to dab for my back pain and honestly, to just relax after a long work week on a Friday evening.  \u000a\u000aLots of Meyer lemon, lime zest, and a touch of raw sugar on the nose.  Very tasty on the release of Limoncello , Cara Cara orange, and surprisingly, a tiny hint of clove.  I know, clove?  It&#39;s faint, but it&#39;s there.  \u000a\u000aIt kicks in a little later than what I anticipated, however after about 10 minutes I felt my back pain subside, with a beautiful sense of tranquility and positivity (much needed).  I will for sure pick this up again! :)

VAWESOME strain, picked up in AZ @ Greenpharms.  1/8th of fresh flower, auroma is strong citrusy, begging to be hand ground.  my nugs were well cured, but very &quot;shaky&quot;.  After grinding the result was amazing.    The ground flower was true to its name, sticky saplike consistency begged to be  packed.  The first bowl was fantastic with ice in the bong.  The coolness of the smoke can change some flavors, only noticed a slight minty tinge to the lemon &amp; orange taste.  Perfect for pain, and daytime use to get things done, however too much can lock you down for light nap.  Pestie

At first site the flower are simi tight buds that are a light green with dark red hairs and covered in tricomes. The aroma has a definite tangerine smell and a little pungent.

VThis is the very first strain I\u2019ve ever smoked legally; I got my RI MMJ card today.\u000a\u000aI couldn&#39;t get a straight Tangie right now, so I picked up this strain and Clementine \u2013 both Tangie kids.\u000a\u000aThis buzz is just what I was hoping for; clear-headed, creative, happy and non-paralytic. I&#39;ve been sending emails and photos of my great day to friends and having a great time.\u000a\u000aI only smoked a tiny bit \u2013 about half the size of a pencil eraser \u2013 so just a gram is going to go a long way at 21.56% THC. Great smell, great taste, great high for my first legal experience.\u000a\u000aCan&#39;t wait to try Clementine next! (But that will probably wait until the weekend.)

VThis strain looks, and smells really nice. A hybrid that I wished was an indica Dom. The taste after burning was a bit like cardboard. Compared to my homegrown. It burnt fast, and was pretty strong. Stronger than nicotine however. It was not a two blunt night. As it locked my body, and elevated my heart rate. Relaxing on this strain proved very hard to do.

VI took today off work and am flying high this afternoon on White Label Extract&#39;s Citrus Sap, a &quot;pull and snap&quot; dabbable, a goey extract in parchment paper just like shatter. It&#39;s listed in Leafly as a hybrid and it feels that way to me, and I was surprised to hear that it is a cross between Gorilla Glue and Tangie, because it tastes like the name implies, a pure citrus sap... reminds me a bit of the smell of violin rosin, and it&#39;s this incredible taste that brings me into the forest on a crisp fall day.&#160; It reminds me of lemon and&#160; amber and wood and sap and sunshine, warm and yellow mellowness.&#160; I feel glowy inside and all lovey dovey.&#160;\u000a\u000aMine tested at 65.51% THC.&#160; Now that I&#39;ve enjoyed Citrus Sap as a dabbable I look forward to picking it up in a vape cartridge and as flower someday, should I be so lucky to stumble upon it!

VThis stuff explodes from the bag with an array of insane aromatics: lemon, lime, grapefruit... a dark citrus foundation. \u000a Flavor is fresh, green, slightly spiced and super citrusy.  This sample was super fresh bud, loaded with juice.  Very much a directive strain: If I&#39;m looking to work, easy to focus.  If I&#39;m looking to chill, easy to relax.  It can make me a bit edgy... the THC is on the high end, so if I hit it a bit hard, I&#39;m not as functional.  If you have an Instant Pot, crumble some stems into your oatmeal, the night before.  Set the timer.  No better way to start the day, unless you add some raisins and dates!\u000a\u000aMedically, an eighth of this cured my back pain.  For intense back pain, smoke a quarter or so, and rub raw, melted chocolate (no sugars or sweeteners), into your back muscles.\u000a\u000aPlanning to infuse some yogurt (Instant Pot) over the weekend.

You can also stay focus and alert on this to get somethings done if you have to. \u000aMedical uses if most definitely for depression and pain relief. Works well for anxiety use, and the mental stimulation from Citrus Sap isn&#39;t overwhelming to make you feel anxious. It works well for mental fatigue, so Citrus Sap is a great medicine for brain fog issues. Will do very well for headaches and body pain. \u000aReally like this strain and would not pass up on this if found.
