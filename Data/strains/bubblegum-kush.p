VOne of my best stories of how I came across this amazing strain LOL!\u000aI went to a huge party in MN and some guy was just tossing weed at strangers. He asks me if I got my free bud yet and hands me a hand full of this great yummy bud!\u000aI found more later on the floor.\u000aI&#39;ve never seen so many bowls rolling at one time!!!\u000aThe guy at the end of the circle holding like 12 bowls being like what dur furk wur dur I pur dis! LOL 2 bowls were broken during this event!\u000a\u000aThe dream of when I get my hands on it again!

VSweet, earthy scent. Nice smooth smoke with slightly piney aftertaste.\u000aVery relaxing high, but not necessarily sleep inducing unless overdone. \u000aUse with caution! This one is a creeper! Effects not necessarily felt right off. High and relaxation increases slowly over about 30minutes. You can easily become couch locked which is great if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for but not if you have stuff to do. \u000aNot great for inflammatory pain, but seems to work well on muscle tightness and neurological pain.

VGreatest bud I\u2019ve ever tasted, the sugary taste makes you feel young again. I was able to do work on this bud and was extremely happy the whole time. I did feel as though my face was locked in a permanent smile and coworkers were weirded out, but all in all a great experience. \u000a\u000aThe first time I tried it, the blunt was coated in a thin layer of honey(!), the sweetest, headiest buzz I had had since trying dabs for the first time. \u000a\u000aHighly, highly recommend for an outdoor activity strain.

VWe got a clone from a Montr&#233;al Legal Medical Patient Grower of his F1 Double Bubble Gum Kush where she crossed her favourite BBK with one of her celebrated Double-Bubble X her best F1 indica-leaved clones to make this the largest Kush plant I&#39;ve known since Kush arrived on the scene about 12 years ago.   This is a very short-tracked nodded plant that we my grower and I teased to a 9 foot lady in the end of flowering and she yielded an average of 15 pounds per plant and we had 35 of these gorgeous ladies with the freshest Bubblegum note as soon as we enter the garden in their mornings.  It became one of our best producers and a favoured medicine for me over the 5 years we grew her.  We only outdid her with my Quad-Crossed Skunk plants of Euphoria !!!\u000a\u000aNow 3 years later we processed the remaining Bud Trim, no leaves into water hash using a recently bought triclombe washing machine which makes great quality and much faster water hash which we took over to a partner developed / made a 25 thousand tonne press with 600 watt digital plates to make the very FIRST Cannabis Rosen I have had the pleasure to try last afternoon when my growers met me to bring me this new Highly Concentrated Medicinal Cannabis new treat.

Bubblegum started out slow with a very subtle but pleasant high. After about 20 mins. I just about feel over! My body just totally relaxed. The feeling of total happiness just engulfed me. I was completely in the zone. Also, I was lazer focused on mu husband! BEWARE of this side affect!!! Overall the experience was extremely pleasant and satisfying.

VThis is definitely one of the strains to first think of when you hear the word \u201cIndica\u201d. The buds for this strain vary from a small lengthy buds to short but plump buds. It\u2019s a distinct green bud with many orange tendrils poking out of the crevices. It\u2019s smell is a vary natural stench but beyond noticeable after opening a jar or baggy with bud inside. The first hit I took I really couldn\u2019t give a flavor to it but as seconds past the after taste had a very sweet flavor. It\u2019s not a harsh inhale either but once it kicks in, get a drink. The cotton mouth is horrendous if you don\u2019t deal with it. The high you get lasts hours but takes a minute or two for it to kick in. It\u2019s a definite \u2018couch lock\u2019 strain (as you would expect from any Indica) with giggles to ensue and a constant smile on your face to be created. This is a great strain and a must try. I would definitely recommend this to any beginners or veterans in smoking.

VBubblegum Kush has a sour smell and flavor, and has a medium THC content range based on anecdotal experience, this indica did leave me feeling bloody relaxed. \u000a\u000aIm not a huge indica fan but was easy to grow, the buds got so big I had to be careful with airflow so be careful of bud rot.  Yields are pretty good its a really nice strain for any passionate grower. it was awesome to watch it mature &amp; change color, I had some purple tints in the bud &amp; some fat purple leaves. \u000a\u000aI smoked this in bongs that left me with a long, strong head &amp; body stone. Smoke was a bit rough, but has a great flavor - sweet and a little spicy.

I was sweating, Nautious, and all my friends were telling me I looked pale. after almost an hour of that I felt better, and the high was pretty good. I smoked at around noon, and was still high until 6pm, which was nice. \u000a\u000aOverall review, shitty at first, but the high after that was relaxing and long.

VIt&#39;s a pretty rugged indica that has smooth smoke and a delicious aroma that reminds me of fresh cut grass with a hint of citrus or berry. The high is medium lasting maybe 20-30 minutes before my head started to de-fog, but the stress relief lasts after the high wears off. A great all purpose standby or mixer kind of bud that rounds out other strains.

VI&#39;m absolutely in love with this strain. It is a very heavy indica that leaves you with an incredible body high. With a sour and earthy aroma with some pungent undertones, she is definitely a favorite of mine. She definitely helps with pain, stress, and insomnia. Do not plan on going ANYWHERE because you are guaranteed to be couch locked! 5/5 all day!

VJust ordered this on special at Hybrid Fast. WOW it\u2019s a solid 4.5 with a 6/5 on the special price. Nice flavors and the buzz works at night for sleep as well as the next morning for relaxing pain free but yet clear and alert. Get it before it sells out.

VMan, talk about outstanding potency. One of the most intense indicas I&#39;ve had in a very long time, with an interesting cerebral high to boot. Everything is enhanced and things can get kinda trippy. Definitely a one hit quit kind of strain, will leave you tingling and in the couch. Warmth is powerful with this strain as well. Hang on to your reality, because all worries will fade into the background, leaving you questioning real life.
