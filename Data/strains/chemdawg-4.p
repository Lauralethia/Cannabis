Vcompletely out of hand, in the best way.  only 22% thc, but from one of my two favorite growers, this is one to smoke if you wanna be non-functional and just have a blast.  stop over-thinking things...  really stop thinking at all... have a few chuckles with friends and enjoy the full-body buzz.

VI\u2019ll begin with this; watch out. This strain is one hell of a punch. I\u2019ve been smoking for quite a while now, and this strain has been giving me quite a fight. I love it. The scent is a nice lemon, citrus, and earthy, couldn\u2019t be a better scent for my grinder. Both alone and with friends, this bud can put anybody on their ass, no doubt. It\u2019s such a relaxing strain to take pain or anger off of anyone\u2019s mind. Being an original mass cultivated strain, it makes me happy that this hybrid can create amazing effects. If you have this strain and are smoking it, keep it up. Best shit out here. Thank you for garden remedies getting this out here to me!

VThis strain is not for a beginner or one who gets lifted easily by a few hits on a bowl. It packs a punch and it hit me in two solid steps: One, automatic, medium effect when you hit it and let the fumes linger in your lungs. That first step hits you after the first hits you do, then the second effect was harsher for me. That kept me laying on my bed, writing this review...

VA unique strain with a unique high, the buds have a tendency to turn out to be fat and round like broccoli. A true hybrid, it&#39;s immediate effect is a sativa head high, followed by a powerful indica stone. Immediate pain repression throughout the entire body. Better pain relief than norco or vicodin and comes on faster.

I grew her until the end and OMG what a joy it was. The taste is on point. It&#39;s also probably 1 of the strongest and best tastes that I&#39;ve grown to date. That first hit off that bone, bong, whatever u prefer is just out of this world. I almost fell off my seat after smoking my grow of Chemdawg!!! I&#39; gave myself a pat on the back for this one.lol. do needless to say..... if u ever come across this strain; GET IT!!!

VI got an eighth of this stuff from a good buddy of mine that works at a local dispensary.\u000aI kind of underestimated it.\u000aLoaded a bowl, and took an incredibly fat rip.\u000aIt went straight to my chest, and made my eyelids heavier than anvils.\u000aA nice, mellow stone. I highly recommend it if you have work in the morning, and can&#39;t sleep. No stress, not much paranoia. Just relaxation and gnarly munchies.\u000a\u000aI mixed this and Super Lemon Haze in a bowl with my buddy, toked, and played Super Mario until we passed out.\u000aDefinitely a nice time. *thumbs up.*

VWhen done right this plant tastes like a fruity lemony soapy skunk mixture. everyone loves it, when cut at 65 days instead of 75 it has more of the energetic creative uplifting values and less stone. The only problem is with the san fernando valley og male that cali connection crossed the original chem4 f1 with. Theyre crossing everything with that and its f5 at this point. That means the variations in each pack of beans is outrageous. instead of buying a 10 pack and getting 3 or 4 winners, u now need more like 20 10 packs to find 3 good ones.

VThis indica-dominant strain is one of my favorite buds to smoke before bed.  This strain will give you the best head high after a long stressful day and literally less than 15 minutes will knock you tf out.  I am a heavy smoker and this strain was able to help me sleep with half of what i would normally use.  Definitely my top 2 strain for evening use.  I also noticed that Chemdawg 4 will give u severe munchies lol. I recommend this strain for people who have a hard time eating, or people who work hard and need a calming strain before bed, even for people dealing with stress.  Only negative for me is this strain will give you cottonmouth and it&#39;s so potent that it&#39;s guarantee to make you cough out a lung.

VPretty potent, and anyone with a high tolerance will feel this one. Starts with a cerebral head effect, then a full body buzz that will slowly get you relaxing with a heavy body feel, and a bit couch locky. Felt very stoney as I spaced out sometimes on this, but still had a clear head. Would recommend evening use, and I wouldn&#39;t do anything important on this. Just sit, and chill is all you should be doing after smoking some Chem 4. Love the diesel lemony smell on this. Newbies should be careful when smoking Chem 4 just a heads up. \u000aMedical use from Chem 4 is chronic pain, and depression. Will help out with other mood disorders for maximum bad moods relief.

VThe smell of this strain hits you as soon as you open the bag/jar, its a very distinct strain at that so you know what it is your getting upon smelling &amp; smoking it. The taste is like a good Pinsol &amp; chemicals . The chemical notes stay lingering in your mouth. The nugs also look like they&#39;ve been sprayed in sparkle dust. There light green and very dense to the touch, small to medium sized nugs. It was just a tad dry but still good enough when breaking up. but all in all I would definitely purchase this strain again from my local dispensary. And because it&#39;s soooo good I&#39;m getting ready to smoke a bowl of it.lol.

As far as that goes, if you like the way OG feels, then this is a nice bud as what Chem4 you can feel helps soften it a little.  Not enough for me, tho.  \u000a\u000aWITH that said, I have mixed it with Raspberry Kush, Obama Kush and Royal Master Kush and now have one kick-ass pain obliterator only to be used in very small doses.

VGot this on special only knowing that it was supposed to be a heavy hitter and good for relaxing. Smell is earthy and foresty with hints of citrus/lemon. Almost smells like it could be a cologne. The buds were super dense with a mixture of light greens, dark greens, and burnt oranges. Taste was sweet, almost like a rich unsweetened chocolate or maybe a very mild coffee. Sweet in an earthy way. The smoke was thick and smooth. High was creative, euphoric, nostalgic, and transported me to a different place. It was beautiful.

V\u2022 Testing at thc-30.68%, this beauty-bud is crossed with Pakistani Chitral Kush, so both chem &amp; kush qualities SHINE in this not-for-newbies&#39; strain.. \u2022 Head to toe &#128293;-euphoria that literally resembles a whip-it \u2022 true indica, so great &#128076;&#127995; for evenings.. altho its&#39; calming, cerebral effects perfectly balance-out my ADHD-brain, so also great daytime strain (for me) for creativity &amp; focus. Highly recommend \u2022 &#127808;

VPotent strain from The Green Room.\u000aSmell and taste stings with a very organic, bitter citrus overtone with undertones of cleaning chemicals.\u000aThe high gives me a smack-faced feeling at first and keeps me active. Definitely felt my heart rate go up with this one. A bit too much of an upper without the clear-mind effect that I look for but it is fun for sure. \u000aWent through 1/8 this time.

VThis is my first strain review, inspired by realizing that vaping this flower has not only lifted the early-midlife-crisis anxiety swirl of &quot;I&#39;ve wasted so much of my life! what have I even accomplished? What does it all meeeeeean?&quot; that had started to plague me, but is also giving me positive creative energy. It&#39;s made me think about the various projects I have in the air with renewed excitement, reminded that there are things I do that matter to other people and make their lives nicer places-- it grounded me again and chilled me back out. It made me think about the meaning of happiness, and I feel this guilty feeling at typing such a terrible cliche, but it&#39;s true. I did do that, and it was pretty nice. \u000a\u000aWhat I&#39;m getting at here is that this really worked for me to combat the bad kind of introspection and stave off hours of feeling woe-is-me, so maybe it will for you, too. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s also one of very few strains I&#39;ve tried that had &quot;creative&quot; listed as a trait and really lived up to it. I definitely feel high, but I&#39;m also plenty focused enough to write this review, and I feel really awake despite being relaxed. I also feel like if I try to go to sleep instead of using this energy to make some art or accomplish something else productive like dishes, I&#39;ll be able to zonk out no problem. \u000a\u000aChemdawg #4, I think you and I are staying friends for a long time.  This is one I&#39;d like to keep in my stash for creative energy, productivity, positive introspection, and a nice heavy-hitting de-stresser.

VI think this is a great indica strain. I have it crossed with PCK(a heavy indica) &amp; its 27.5 THC. This is one of the BEST indica strains I\u2019ve ever had. It relieves stress, anxiety, insomnia. Just what I was looking for!! A little pricy at $48 1/8th but its worth it. I take Klonopin for anxiety but it is not needed with this strain!! Don\u2019t smoke it first thing in the AM unless you want to be super couch locked.

It&#39;s a stress reliever for me, I have a lot of anxiety and usually the stress builds up physically in my neck and once Chem 4 sets in the stress is gone. Both mentally and physically. I do notice a slight decline in focus and motor function but not a couch-lock type deal. It&#39;s smell is a dull lemon with fuel undertones, it&#39;s not really a good looking strain in appearance but it&#39;s effects are top notch. A must try if your local shop has some.

Great for sitting comfortably in an uncomfortable chair and watching your friends argue about nothing. Guys guys guys... what&#39;s the big deal anyway man, what&#39;s up with all this bickering? Come over here and check this stuff out I got.

VStardawg sets in quickly.  It is definitely indica dominant.  It reminds me of good Blue Dream, but less dreamy.  It is particularly effective at relieving anxiety.  No paranoia whatsoever.  I would recommend it for PTSD.

VChemdawg 4 is quality bud. Appears lightish green with long orange hairs and plentiful coating \u000a\u000aTastes like straight pine-sol and chemicals.  However, be warned , Chemdawg 4 is different from other Chemdawgs because its definetly more indica than sativa.

VAnonymous, your story has some truth to it but not all accurate in the beginning. It was actually 2 lbs that was shipped to &quot;chemdawg&quot; for an enormous price at the time. It was summer and there was a huge drought that year. We were fortunate to have any weed let alone 6/7 types of kind. In that 2lbs he found 6 seeds in the entire 2lbs! This strain is where it all began. This is the original Diesel of NYC. Then crossed with mass super skunk by chemdawg, sour diesel was born. The rest is well documented. As it stands now, nobody knows where the strain originated. We came across it in a 18 wheel trailer HIGH in the Rockies...

VTried this strain out in Colorado. The chem part of the name is accurate, this smells strongly of pine and diesel mashed together. Like someone was trying to mop up a diesel spill with pinesol. \u000a\u000aInitially, it was really pleasant. Nice head high and we were all super giggly. However, as the night went on, it started to have more of a psychedelic effect and I was having disturbing thoughts and flashbacks. Another person in my group also was not enjoying the trip. \u000a\u000aOverall, may be a good strain, but not for this dude right here. Do not touch it if you have PTSD, it may mess you up.

VJust picked this strain up from a club, it tested in at over 27% which is ridiculous. They said its the strongest they have ever had at their dispensary. \u000a\u000aThe high is very powerful i smoked about half a bowl and just laid back day dreaming for awhile. \u000a\u000aExcellent strain overall. The smell may put some people off but this is a fantastic strain

VChemdawg 4 is quality bud. Appears lightish green with long orange hairs and plentiful coating \u000a\u000aTastes like straight pine-sol and chemicals.  However, be warned , Chemdawg 4 is different from other Chemdawgs because its definetly more indica than sativa.

VWhile the THC was presented as 24%, the medical slip said 21% so I am a little confused by that...with that being said, I enjoyed this strain a great deal, feel the high lasted quite awhile, and the taste was great as well. It&#39;s a little bitter but earthy, and somewhat sweet at the same time. Kind of a neat combination. The high is good, I wasn&#39;t overly hungry which is something I don&#39;t like as a side effect, and I am pretty impressed.

VFor those that never got to try the real cut of Chem-D, this is the closest you will get to the perfection known as the D.\u000a\u000aI don&#39;t get the Nag Champa Smell that you would associate with Star Dawg, or Chem-D, but what you do get is a flower that all others should be measured.  \u000a\u000aVery few strains possess the inability to grow a tolerance.  The D was one, and this did not lose that trait, which makes it one that all others should be measured.\u000a\u000aTHC-V should be highly sought after, and this has it, which is rare.

VFlat out amazing strain. \u000aThat flavor of piney citrus sour funk is almost unmatchable. one of my favorite tasting strains in the world. It definitely has a more indica high than the 91 chem. Very dense and uniform structure with light green buds and short straight orange hairs. Very potent smoke, sends you soaring straight up and leaves you there for a good long while, which leads to a nice, borderline narcotic body buzz. Great medicine, this puppy will always be in my arsenal.

VThe smell is captivating and strong. Wow. That of a Chemical &amp; or diesel type scent. Hence the name Chemdog. The colors pop on her and make for a pretty lime &amp; forest green colored Plant. The nugs are small to medium size.  The potency is there, just not off the charts. But most importantly, it works well for me. ChemDawg#4 helps with depression/PTSD/Anxiety &amp;appetite.

Lasted for several hours from 2 bongs hits (less than full bowl). I will be getting more of this wonderful strain. The smell and taste are easy to injest.

VBest C-4 in town - just out of the hospital my knowledgeable bud tender at Have a Heart CC in Seattle, recommended next to a few grams. An avid mmj patient four bong hits and cannot wait to vape into dreamland. The relief I received helped me to relax enough to force me to keep checking to see if my mouth and gums were still attached to my jaw bone. Thank you to the friendly staff and I think C-4 is the best secret to enduring chronic pain. Hands down Have a Heart has the best C-4 in town otherwise known as Chemdawg 4. http://www.haveaheartcc.com

VThis strain did not work for me. It was wayyyy cerebral! My boyfriend &amp; I both individually each get through about 1/8 every two weeks. We both had the same reaction - we felt like our bodies were jerking at every movement, whether it was walking, moving our arms, etc. I felt like I had parkinson&#39;s just trying to push the pedestrian button to cross the street &amp; became super paranoid because of it. I did end up finishing off the 1/8th &amp; each time I had the same results. It&#39;s really really strong, &amp; very cerebral. It&#39;s very unique in it&#39;s effects, I never experienced anything like it. I could see someone with chronic pain that&#39;s moderate to severe benefiting from this. It was too strong for my taste however.
