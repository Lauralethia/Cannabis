VThis strain is dope, whether you call it snow bud or akorn. You can tell that it\u2019s almost exactly 50/50 sativa indica. As a person with anxiety I find that it doesn\u2019t make my anxiety worse when smoking it. Doesn\u2019t taste the best but it\u2019s worth it for the high

VI found this strain to have an almost coffee-like flavor at a low temp but when I raised the temp just a little bit, it began to taste almost like a \u201cburnt homegrown.&quot; Bleh! It\u2019s a strain, in my humble opinion, that should be vaporized at a very low setting for flavor. I think trying to smoke it in a joint or bowl could be a little harsh. \u000a\u000aThe mood of this one was great and I felt very happy. But, I got very little work done and felt a tad bit spacey. I think this strain is terrific for pain relief and even better for anxiety! I had a very nice experience with Snowbud in the evening. It helped made me relax into my yoga and allowed me to sit quietly with my thoughts. What a great strain for stress relief and sleep!

VThis has quickly become one of my all time favorite strains. Sunflower meds here in az has this strain regularly and it is always exceptional. I use this strain like most would have a redbull when I have homework. Uplifting but doesn&#39;t make me feel anxious. The flavor is very earthy and woody. It does indeed taste like oak or acorns.

VAka Akorn. My first review of this strain was for the RSO only(Bloom-PHX is great for strain specific RSO\u2019s). I\u2019ve since had crumble, shatter and flower. The fact I\u2019ve tried all should tell you how much I love this strain. I do prefer the RSO, however, they ALL are miracle workers on my arthritic hips (inflammatory arthritis). I\u2019ve yet to find anything that works as well as this and it seems to help my crohn\u2019s disease as well, curtailing some of the cramping. I will say that this is NOT a daytime usage strain. I\u2019m amazed at this strain\u2019s ability to make me feel \u201cfuzzy\u201d all over, and it\u2019s a good fuzzy akin to a warm blanket wrapped around me. Mind wise, it makes me quite contemplative and in a chilled kind of daze. This strain always seems to leave my mind in a happy and calm place. For me this is the ultimate chill strain. Music sounds great, pictures brighten, and pain is gone.\u000aThe flower that I got from Nature\u2019s Medicines was a bright green wee little nug. Though a bit skunky, it smelled a bit of pine and something else that made it kind of brighten up on the tongue.

VI have two reviews to make.\u000aFirst to Leaf life the Dispensary, they are second to none. They think of you the patient firs how, they don&#39;t sell products that don&#39;t do the same. Their price range is lower with a much better product. You should travel to only shop from this Dispensary.\u000aSecond this Flower, it was frosty with orange crystals every where. Great for bedtime, or chillin on your game console. (PAIN FREE)
