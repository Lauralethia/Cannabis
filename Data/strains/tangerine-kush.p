Vthis was pretty good. a smooth good feeling high. it jsut didn&#39;t last very long at all. it tasted great, but I&#39;d imagine that you&#39;d have to medicate constantly to keep yourself feeling good. if you got the funds for that, by all means, do it. I for one do not, so it&#39;s good. but there are much better.

VThis citrusy strain is another one that got me going. I got focused and energetic at first and eased into a relaxing high after taking a break. No worries, another session soon leads to a need to get things done again. Tangerine Kush is one I will be keeping to get things done!

VIt&#39;ll get you high fast, and it will keep you high for a while. I usually stay at my peak for a half hour, but this had me feeling really STONED for about two hours.

VSmoking this strain right now, tastiest fucking weed I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s comparative to having just sucked on a sweet lemony ginger candy after every exhale. The high is very heady and relaxing- definitely one of my favorite indica strains. 9/10 would recommend. The only reason I wouldn&#39;t rate it 10/10 is bc I&#39;m a true sativa loving fool deep down. But I was in a pinch and I&#39;m definitely not regretting it at all&#128076;&#127996;

VCan&#39;t say anything but good things about this strain. Picked up a gram of the Tangerine Kush II from Quality Choice in Colorado Springs to give it a try. First thing I noticed is the most citrusy smelling weed I&#39;ve had yet. It doesn&#39;t even smell like weed, more like an orange air freshener or something. The buds are small but dense. Dark forest green with dark orange and brownish hairs and covered in amber and sparkling trichomes. The high at first is just like a sativa high, but only for a few minutes and then things just get totally relaxed and everything becomes hilarious. I can&#39;t give a review on the flavor since I mixed the bowl with a CBD strain from a totally different place.

VMy sample of Tangerine Kush did not look ultra &quot;frosted&quot; with trichomes for bag appeal, but is very sticky and hard to break apart. Smells faintly like tangerine in the bag, and tastes more strongly like tangerine on the exhale. A decent hybrid smoke... uplifting and slightly stony at first... then Bubba shines through, numb and lazy on the second half of the flight. If you wanna go to bed at 11, smoke at 9:30 pm. Decent quality bud, nice taste, nothing amazing or super impressive about it compared to other strains I have tried.

VSo this is my second batch of Tangerine Kush. I&#39;m pretty sure the first batch was mids, but this is far from mids. Chunky structure with bright green leaves thrown into the compounded nug. Sweet and floral taste, and a nice, tingly head high and sorta crashed after a few rips. I&#39;m kinda slumped now. Be careful when you use this, it could put you straight on the couch with its indica qualities. A very nice nighttime strain. Overall gotta be the most solid 4 in my books

Not gonna give you an otherworldly feeling so if that\u2019s what your looking for this strain doesn\u2019t really do it. I\u2019ve definitely been stoned on this strain and it\u2019s a nice one to settle down to. If you smoke a tiny bit, you\u2019ll feel very nice and floaty, but you can be a little productive if you want to read a book or draw or something.

This shit ran $12/gm. I&#39;m quite impressed, I can feel both the indica and sativa like effects.  My taste for this strain was citrusy. I rolled it in a joint. Can&#39;t say how long this stuff will last as I am mid trip. It doesn&#39;t feel like this strain will have legs when compared to the other strains I have on me.

VTangerine Kush\u2019s evergreen buds will find favor among patients looking for anxiety relief without the heavy-eyed saturation of most indica-dominant strains. Light, thinly wound orange hairs threaded throughout deep green nugs of noticeably larger size may need to be broken down for proper dosing. Just one of these potency-packing buds may make for the perfectly rounded joint. Upon grinding, the smoker will notice the landmark citrus fragrance that gives Tangerine Kush its title. Well earned, perhaps. The air of Valencia or Navel oranges delivers acidity between the nostrils, presenting an almost food-like salivation when grinding, or sampling straight from the packaging. The smoke carries a light, lofty taste of citrus into the throat and will be felt within minutes as it begins to silence tension throughout the body. This indica-dominant strain may be felt primarily in the body, as the patient finds themselves deeply relaxed however conversational for at least some time. For those needing to keep their head in the game, Tangerine Kush remains a quality option for early evening hours when patients have returned from work, but still need to carry out the rest of their day.

Vthis is a very solid strain. when you crack open a jar you get a whiff of a Tangerine fruity like smell hence the name hahaha when you take the nugs out of the jar to have a purple tint to them with orange hairs. the buds break up nice but they don&#39;t just crumble up like dust they have a bit of density to them. Taste Of The Strain is probably the strongest of its traits as it has a very pleasant Tangerine like taste that shines through even in a blunt. the effects are nothing crazy but you&#39;ll definitely be feeling nice and happy. I recommend you try it.

VThe consistency makes this weed a really great pipe smoke.\u000a\u000aAlso, the smell is not super potent, but kinda cheesy. In a really good way, when you smoke it, the smoke smells like tangerine though, really pleasant.\u000a\u000aThe high is a kind of soaring, fun, folksy thing. Like I can imagine people smoking this stuff on the oregon trail. Or like something Regina Spektor might have in her pipe. Mellow too.\u000a\u000aPROTIP: Smoke this mixed with some Blue Dream, about 1:1 for a really HIGH, high.

VWhat a pretty looking bud.  The trichomes are truly tangerine colored, and each nugget is like a little pine tree.  Very floral, almost piney scent beneath the usual skunkiness, and it smokes smoother than most other strains I know of.  Not widely available from my experience, though, and it can be expensive.  Good for a top shelf sample though!

VIt&#39;s been 25+ years since I&#39;ve smoked, and this was my first since then. It got my heart racing at first, and I felt very jittery and excited when I exhaled. I only took one hit, and then realized this is nothing like it used to be. Lol. I had to calm myself down from the anxiety and paranoid feelings I was having. Then after 25 minutes, the calm, relaxing and happy feeling took place for about 1 hour and 1/2 . I have tried it again, but I was prepared for the anxiety but I have noticed this is more of a head high and not a body high. Over all for first timers like me, take it slow until you get the feel for it.

Very smooth smoke nonetheless, with a sweet, mellow, and citrusy undertone. The scent and taste resemble tea as well, adding a flavor I&#39;ve never had in bud.

VTangerine Kush\u2019s evergreen buds will find favor among patients looking for anxiety relief without the heavy-eyed saturation of most indica-dominant strains. Light, thinly wound orange hairs threaded throughout deep green nugs of noticeably larger size may need to be broken down for proper dosing. Just one of these potency-packing buds may make for the perfectly rounded joint. Upon grinding, the smoker will notice the landmark citrus fragrance that gives Tangerine Kush its title. Well earned, perhaps. The air of Valencia or Navel oranges delivers acidity between the nostrils, presenting an almost food-like salivation when grinding, or sampling straight from the packaging. The smoke carries a light, lofty taste of citrus into the throat and will be felt within minutes as it begins to silence tension throughout the body. This indica-dominant strain may be felt primarily in the body, as the patient finds themselves deeply relaxed however conversational for at least some time. For those needing to keep their head in the game, Tangerine Kush remains a quality option for early evening hours when patients have returned from work, but still need to carry out the rest of their day.

VThis was the first time I&#39;ve ever purchased weed. the aroma of this strain was pretty delicious. My fingers always smelled of a sweet, grapey flour after breaking this up. The high from this fruity strain was pretty intense, followed by a trip to the kitchen to satisfy my hunger.\u000a\u000aOnly downside I found was that I would get a headache as the high would wear off. A really bad headache. Other than that I love this strain.

VTangerine Kush\u2019s evergreen buds will find favor among patients looking for anxiety relief without the heavy-eyed saturation of most indica-dominant strains. Light, thinly wound orange hairs threaded throughout deep green nugs of noticeably larger size may need to be broken down for proper dosing. Just one of these potency-packing buds may make for the perfectly rounded joint. Upon grinding, the smoker will notice the landmark citrus fragrance that gives Tangerine Kush its title. Well earned, perhaps. The air of Valencia or Navel oranges delivers acidity between the nostrils, presenting an almost food-like salivation when grinding, or sampling straight from the packaging. The smoke carries a light, lofty taste of citrus into the throat and will be felt within minutes as it begins to silence tension throughout the body. This indica-dominant strain may be felt primarily in the body, as the patient finds themselves deeply relaxed however conversational for at least some time. For those needing to keep their head in the game, Tangerine Kush remains a quality option for early evening hours when patients have returned from work, but still need to carry out the rest of their day.

VIt&#39;s obvious where this fruity strain gets it&#39;s name. The first thing I noticed when I cracked open the bag is it&#39;s similarity to tangerines. It has a pleasant tangerine smell, and when vaped out of a MFLB the taste is unmatched. I&#39;d definitely recommend this strain. At first, the effects feel more like a sativa, uplifting and energetic. After a shirt time however. the user will feel relaxed and tired. Good all around strain, will certainly be picking up again.

VI love Tangerine Kush. It&#39;s tropical, fruity, sweet, citrus (Tangerine!!!) first note will make you want to smoke or vape more. The finale is more hashish like sweet. That&#39;s the main marking difference I see between this strain, Tangerine Dream and Orange Tango. My favorite buzz with this taste (but I haven&#39;t tried Tangerine Haze yet...). Really combine couch-lock and trippy mind. Good herb to relax on the beach on a day you have nothing else to do. Vacation stuff.

Vthis is a very solid strain. when you crack open a jar you get a whiff of a Tangerine fruity like smell hence the name hahaha when you take the nugs out of the jar to have a purple tint to them with orange hairs. the buds break up nice but they don&#39;t just crumble up like dust they have a bit of density to them. Taste Of The Strain is probably the strongest of its traits as it has a very pleasant Tangerine like taste that shines through even in a blunt. the effects are nothing crazy but you&#39;ll definitely be feeling nice and happy. I recommend you try it.

I got a caregiver card to help her out and i am learning a lot. The nurse Brianna, who rocks, was very concise, clear in explaining how it all works to my Momma, recommended Tangerine Kush to assist with pain from two falls, and subsequent surgeries over the past five years. My Momma actually relaxed, forgot about the pain, and even giggled a bit. :) Renee was awesome as well, made us feel right at home, was very informative, and kind. My Momma got two pre-rolls for free, being a new customer, and a courtesy. I highly recommend the Tangerine Kush strain for anyone in pain and the Verdes Foundation to anyone in need. They have a lifetime customer. H
