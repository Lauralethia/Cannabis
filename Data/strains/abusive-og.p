VAMAZING STRAIN. Bought it for the name, originally, laughing about it in the shop. I did not expect it to be so potent and intense. It takes you to a whole other world and can last for hours or minutes... \u000aGreat equal body and mind high. I recommend this to people who have been smoking for a while.

VI obtained a gram of AOG from Ajoya in Louisville CO. Its an outdoor and you can most def tell. Very odorous with a sour, eucalyptusy, earthy aroma. The flavor is spicy and hashy. The buzz is body and mind numbing. Def a good strain for the end of a long day or to numb the pain.

VAbusive OG is one of my favorite indica strains, and by a large margin. I can&#39;t quite put into words the overall feeling beyond its tendency to ease gradually from comfort and relaxation to full-on couchlock if you consume enough. \u000a\u000aIt&#39;s my ideal strain right now for a very complex, yet comforting high. Great overall taste and as close to zero throat harshness as it gets for me. Easy to smoke, easy to enjoy. Fly, fly away.

This strain is straight up MEDICINE - puts you into total euphoric sedation, increases appetite, then slowly walks you into dreamland! The only thing this strain abuses is the couch!!!

VVery good indica \u000a\u000aWhat can I say, abusive og is a solid solid indica for you OG lovers. Buds on the smaller side but that&#39;s genetics. Dense, skunky green buds with dark orange hairs. Instant eye level drops upon inhalation. Nice, happy uplifting head high which makes you exclaim &quot;wow I am stonneedd&quot;. Head buzz fades rather quickly into deep full body relaxation/couchlock. Perfect for insomnia and pain.\u000aHigh isn&#39;t quite as &quot;heady&quot; or euphoric as og kush or Skywalker og, but very similar to King Louie xiii.

VI have seen this strain at a lot of local shops and just now picked some up for the first time. All in all a good smoke for sure. Not one of the highest potent indicas out there but definitely did its job. The smell is so sour smelling that it almost has that Candy Jack smell, but still a indica smell. Sticky resin bud for sure. I am sorry, but I am actually zoning out while writing this and just got punched in the head by the high... So just wait like a couple minutes after the hit and you&#39;ll start feeling it.

I don&#39;t remember exactly what happened right before I knocked out, but I remember getting up in the middle of the night and still feeling high. It didn&#39;t take much either. So because of my experience with this strain, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be going to be good in small amounts for pain throughout the day because it is a stronger indica and the high lasts a while.

Nugs on the smaller side, typical for abusive og, yet dense, sticky buds that are covered in trichomes. Smelled of fuel, pine, and earthiness. \u000aEffects- Felt the effects of this og nearly immediately. Initial head high sets in strong. Can make you paranoid, mentally-foggy, and forgetful at times but personally I like powerful knockout strains. Felt euphoric, happy, uplifted... the munchies soon followed and after that a narcotic sleepy feeling sweeps you into couchlock. One of the best OG&#39;s in California. \u000aDefintely possess effects of mood elevation, appetite stimulation, and heavy sedation typical of any top grade indica strain.

VI picked a pre roll so I could sleep at night. This is a nice Indica, it relaxes you and eases you into a nice space. It won&#39;t give you couch lock or at least it didn&#39;t for me.

VI&#39;ll admit I&#39;m somewhat biased when it comes to OG Kush and its many, often mediocre and unremarkable variants because I feel them to be overrated due in part to my inability to see why OG is a huge, never-ending trend in major US cannabis markets while superior Kush strains are extremely prevalent. However, after so many attempts on my part to find a truly great OG that lives up to its popularity, I think I have finally stumbled upon one such strain in the form of Abusive OG. Abusive&#39;s supremely relaxing body stone and high potency distinguishes it from the rest of its counterparts and makes it easily my favorite OG.
