VI love this strain. It is so relaxing. Not a complete couch lock. I was able to get things done. It took the hard edge off the world and made it a softer place to be. Nice dense long burning buds.  Good stuff!

VI was introduced to this lovely strain in shatter form by Altered State, and speaking as an experienced canna-consumer this was top shelf all the way.  Great for reading, movies, making unique snacks, and ending your day on a positive note.
