VSTRONG! \u000a It&#39;s a creeper. When the initial head change took place my anxiety really amped up. I felt my chest get tight. So I stuck my usually routine when things like this happen. Just found a comfy place at home, laid down and closed my eyes focused on my breathing. Just a simple trick if a strain is too strong.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this strain to people who can handle a strong sativa. I can see how much energy you can get from Silver Surfer. I would not recommend this if you have stress or anxiety. \u000a\u000aThe flavor it&#39;s self tasted very light. Not pungent. It reminds me of some very old school chronic. The initial strong head change lasted 20 minutes, but I was still going strong 3 hours later.\u000a\u000aPlease keep in mind that I don&#39;t think there are bad strains. You just need to find what is right for you. Interested to see further reviews on this strain.

VVery strong high, very head and strong body highs, lots of tingling and heaviness in extremities. Vapes really well and doesn&#39;t take as much as normal. Which is good - I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s indicative of the strain but there seemed to be a higher ratio of kief in the plant material.

VSSH is a classic top shelf bud, if done right. It&#39;s hella heady, so watch out for that if you do not like sativa&#39;s. This will get you high really fast, almost instantly and you do not need a lot to get there either. Highly recommended for anyone that has never had it. It has a real fresh/citrus-y taste to it - always kind of reminds me of a fresh sprite or something. I think the best way to smoke it is to grind up, but with this strain it doesn\u2019t matter how you use it because it is so strong. I have had some SSH that was 10+ before but I would give it an 8.5 \u2013 9 average rating.

VAlthough it is a hybrid, it definitely feels like a sativa. Very light airy bud that crumbled really well but burns a little too fast and doesn&#39;t pack a high THC count. Would give it a higher score if the price was lower. Reach for a Blue Dream or Allen Wrench if you want similar high but better experience or price.

VI smoked some of this with a friend once, at first it was a fun giggly high but once he left it made me extremely anxious and paranoid. This was the first high I didn&#39;t enjoy.
