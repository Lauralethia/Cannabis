VThis stuff is the BOMB.  Check out this article:\u000a\u000ahttp://ireadculture.com/2012/12/reviews/strainsofthemonth/white-dawg/\u000a\u000aI can&#39;t believe it has such a low rating on Leafly.  White Dawg fans gotta step it up!!  This strain is SUPER potent, it says in the article above that it&#39;s at 28%!!  So, just be careful with it.  Some people have mentioned paranoia with this one, but I have a theory on Sativa buds and paranoia:  I believe that as your body becomes used to a particular strain of sativa buds, it becomes more prone to paranoia on that particular strain.  I recently had this happen with Super Silver Haze.  So, it&#39;s good to switch up your Sativas.  Speaking of which, the article above says it&#39;s indica dominant but I disagree.  The smell alone is pure sativa.

VIf you wanna feel like a teenager again smoking weed for the first time this is the strain for you. Giggles, munchies and a general whimsy are the main effects. Is very euphoric, however not that preferable for the every day smoker who needs to also function like an adult! Would get again for the joy though.

VLove this strain! If you want a strong strain that also has great effects, long lasting, happy feeling, relaxing yet makes you feel good and uplifted when tired, than choose WD! I am a roofer and have the day off and this is the perfect strain to clear my head, relax my body, and still be focused so that I can get all of my errands taken care of on my day off, I get mine from LIGHTSHADE on Sheridan in Colorado, it is 29.11\u2105 thca, .56\u2105 thc, .94\u2105 cbda !!! Very good and would recommend to anybody unless you are not an experienced smoker, but even to novice smokers a hit or two would probably be perfect !!! I&#39;d rate this bud 9.5/10! I am a hard critic as well, surprised this strain only has a rating of 8.2/10! It&#39;s way better than that in my opinion!! Try getting it from LIGHTSHADE, they have true WD there, it&#39;s very good and only $36.50 after tax for Recreational!! Some of the best rec bud u can get at the best Recreational dispensary in Colorado!!!

VPicked up some of this stuff in Eindhoven En-route to visit the outlaws in deepest darkest Poland with my girl, her sister and the dog (for my first Polish christmas)....After a wonderful 16 hour drive (including a 500 mile stretch of German autobahn I was looking forward to smoking a big fat banger of this pungent, sticky, diesel smelling fluffy lung candy....and it didnt disappoint  !....after 3 or 4 inhales i could feel it on me.....like a warm blanket covering me.....I got a little bit weirded out at first.....but i put that down more to getting into a car in England, then travelling through 5 countries, stopping once and then the next time you get out you are in Poland.....the tiredness and disorientation probably didnt help either.....but the next day i did a little bong at the crack of noon and smoked a joint of some lovely hash we picked up as well and i felt awesome !!, very upbeat...full of energy and a mighty hunger...perfect for when you you need to make 200 pierogi and stuff your face with fish and sourcraut all day....also found if I had a few beers i suddenly felt really high/drunk...it was hard to tell which it was, so if you arent a big drinker maybe take it easy if you are smoking this stuff as it does seem to interact with alcohol in a strange way...didnt feel any paranoia after the first night ....I even smoked some before I was tricked into a dental appointment my girlfriend had secretly made for me ( I have had a massive phobia of the dentist since I was a kid and have not been for over 10 years, even though i really should )....and I felt fine as she examined and cleaned and polished my stinky teeth and told me what needed doing next time...if anything this weed helped me deal with the situation in a calm and relaxed way...and for that reason i have to take my hat off to this delightful strain.....now where can I get some more ???

VI humbly amend my previous review of White Dawg. This stuff will send your ass to the moon! Well - two bowls and two 35mg THC suckers will get you properly keyed. Odd thing is, I still stand by my previous review of not getting stoned the first time I tried this. Second time around, hoo boy, different strain altogether. \u000a\u000aParanoia with this strain, surprisingly, none! And did I get the ULTIMATE litmus test to determine if I could keep my shit together. Tried to sell artisan glass before a concert at Red Rocks and this Ranger had to be Mr. 20 fucking questions, with: Do you mind opening up your car? Are you selling things? Do you have a vendors license? (Answer to all of the above is of course: I&#39;ll be leaving, Am I being detained? No, you may not look inside my vehicle.)\u000aWell, long story short, my ass got run off like a gypsy. Also, dealing with faux fuzz while high as a kite is doable but not advisable.\u000a\u000aTaste- still the same subtle piney taste.\u000a\u000aWhite Dawg, it&#39;s got some kick to it. But it&#39;s quite weird, maybe it will get you super stoned. Maybe, you&#39;ll be asking yourself &quot;Am I high? I think I feel high, nah, I&#39;m not that high.&quot; Or maybe 70mg of THC lolipops made me feel like I was flying around on that Dragon thing from Neverending Story all day.\u000a\u000aWell, either way, I smoked some White Dawg and got massively stoned.\u000a

VWhite Dawg is a great &quot;thinking&quot; strain. I find it to be mostly Sativa. It makes me very talkative and creative, with creative ideas for solving problems, etc. just rolling off my tongue! It makes me very happy and safe. I save this one for when I need inspiration for an engineering project or any other technical endeavor.

VWell, this is a mighty strange predicament. Vaped this 29% THCA testing beast, and, didn&#39;t find myself feeling high! This can only mean one thing, my tolerance has returned - bummer. As for other pertinents, it tasted pretty good (slighty piney) but very subtle. I&#39;d even go so far as to say it doesn&#39;t have much fragrance or taste. That glorious stink is missing, missing! In this case, the terps truly make the plant and it aint all about cannabinoid content. All engine no transmission. White Dawg, you have let me down Dawg!\u000a\u000a-P.S. watched Super High Me after smoking White Dawg, and I liked it about as much as this strain. It&#39;s the weed activity equivalent of wearing the band t-shirt of the band you&#39;re seeing in concert. Or, the joke: How do you know someone does Crossfit?

VI think this is a matter of personal biology, but this strain did NOT agree with me and I spoke to one other person who had the same reaction. If you are someone who has trouble with paranoia or anxiety from meds then steer clear of this. Full disclosure: it was my first time using concentrate so this probably magnified the effects.
