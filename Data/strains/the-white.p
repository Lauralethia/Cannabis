VYES! I&#39;m so excited to have tracked down this strain. I&#39;ve been hearing about The White for over a year now and I finally got my hands on it, thanks to Harborside SJ and their elite selection. AND HUGE props to Leafly.com for having the new cutting-edge strains on their site! Some online grow forums are claiming it&#39;s a clone only strain from Florida but I&#39;m not sure about the genetics. I know it not from White Widow lineage, but at first glance(and without know that) I would have guess White Widow crossed with Big Bud.\u000a\u000a\u000aOn to the buds. They are HUGE! I was really surprised. I didn&#39;t really know what to expect, but they were bigger than expected. I&#39;ll post pictures tomorrow. The buds were completely covered with swollen Trics. I&#39;ve never seen buds so frosty. I smoked a couple bags from my vapo and LIFT OFF! The initial effect was trippy and uplifting. Maybe because I was so pumped to have found it! It finishes with a very heavy Indica sedative effect. (That i love). This is a very strong strain that will send you spinning in a state of confusion\u2026 until the Indy effect take hold and slows things. \u000a\u000aWill The White make my Rotation List\u2026? Let me just say, Skywalker OG &amp; Sonoma Coma just bumped from the top. Although, I&#39;m not sure how often I&#39;ll be able to find it. I&#39;m heading back to HSSJ tomorrow for a refill!\u000a\u000aA+, 5 stars, 10 out of 10.\u000a\u000a\u000aBinky\u000a\u000a\u000a

VThis strain should receive the same acclaim as an OG should!  &quot;The White&quot; is an awesome hybrid that does you right...if you give it a chance!  The smell doesn&#39;t hit you as much as opening a container of OG, but it smells hella dank nonetheless.  Visually, I find it more appealing than an OG.  Those frosty, dusted, &quot;white,&quot; trichomes just screams at you, &quot;You know you want this fire!&quot; I have vaporized and smoked &quot;The White.&quot;  Take a pick...both methods provide solace, relaxation and...just a good stone you know?  I didn&#39;t notice my sciatica while on this fire!  There&#39;s a lot of strains crossed with this sweetie, and for good reason!  To the unexperienced smokers, I would definitely not go big on this one!  It&#39;s a definite, &quot;slow your roll,&quot; type of cannabis.  Green outs is possible with this one so be careful! &quot;You gotta crawl before you walk!&quot;  I really love this strain and wish you all to experience it as well!

Body relaxed but not couch locked. Very pleasant buzz. &quot;Put the phone down and pet your cat for half an hour&quot; kind of high! Enjoy.

VI got so lifted off of half a joint that I had a munchies panic attack.  I thought it was the strain and me did not get along, but it turns out its just that dank.   I tried again because I had got an 1/8th and didnt want it to go to waste.  It was chill, not my favorite, but it got the job done.  They should warn patients that its super potent.

VMigraine pain 6; nausea minimal when I medicated round 1730 or so. Takes less than 5 min to kick in (love that!). Pain/nausea gone. Head buzz strong but even &amp; not too much. Body high dang near perfect. NO ANXIETY/PARANOIA (an absolute must for me). Tastes like honeydew melon (yum). I dint expect to fall asleep so fast tho. Last time I vaped this strain it energized me. Either way very highly recommend! Top shelf stuff; you gotta try it if you haven&#39;t yet! :-)

Vgreat hybrid strain. however this strain is indica heavy, i&#39;d say 70% indica and 30% sativa. so expect a strong, long lasting, mostly body, high. i have sleep issues and this puts me out pretty quickly however, i have day-smoked and can still be functional and efficient. The most significant thing about this strain is it&#39;s thc percentage which is upwards of about 27%. pretty impressive. this will definitely send you to space and make your brain sparkle. happy smoking!

VA very difficult strain to describe. \u000a\u000aWhen I bought this, I was told it was very strong - potent indeed, however, to me this personally isn&#39;t that potent; perhaps I&#39;ve been dealt a weak batch. \u000a\u000aThe high is very difficult to explain: think an energetic mellow? An oxymoron, right? Indeed -\u000aThe sativa hit me instantly; I thought I had just consumed cocaine when taking my first hit. That energy turned into a mellow buzz. Likewise a powerful mind at ease, high functioning individuals are often riddled with anxiety due to their overthinking, and those who are not riddles with anxiety are riddled with ego...\u000a\u000aThis hit is an energetic, humbling, and relaxing. What a combination!\u000a\u000aAbout 30-60 minutes in, the indica body high creeps up.\u000a\u000aTLDR: Sativa hits immediately, indica effects afterwards, mellow and humble additives - focused driven strain too.

VThe White is the sh*t one of the best strains I&#39;ve had lately and things have been very good lately. The taste is awesome very piney, and sweet. It&#39;s covered in crystals pretty amazing actually. The high is very nice, every time I smoke this a few seconds after the first toke there&#39;s like a bubble that pops in my head and a feeling of like expanding or something, then everything is soooo good. Very much a head high very relaxing but with quite a bit of energy for an Indica but it&#39;s relaxed enough to not give any anxiety. Anyway super strain no problem at all giving this one 5 stars

VTried for first time today. I&#39;m in love. I suffer from severe anxiety in depression with Insomnia thrown in. I have tried over 50 different strains looking for one that helps. I do okay with most indicas. After smokimg a joint today, I can say i felt more like myself for the first time in six years. Now I just need to find clones.

VI have to say this is one of my favorite strains.  Long, STRONG high. A lot of strains I can still work, or talk to friends and just have a mild buzz.  The White is NOT like that. It is a face melter. It is good when you are about to go to a concert or a party.  I found it to be a heady high that kicked my butt. A little negative is I have sometimes found it to be a little paranoia or anxiety inducing. In other words, this is not the strain I choose when I am looking to relieve pain or looking to mellow out. This is a very energetic &quot;THIS IS THE BEST SONG IVE EVER HEARD&quot; type effect.\u000a   As always, your mileage and effect is personal and may vary. I can just this is my go to &quot;party in a box&quot; strain.

I stayed present and focused throughout, and even felt I could hold some of the harder poses longer than I normally do! The &quot;after high&quot; was a nice, slow descent into calm well-being.

VThe white is by far the best strain of marijuana I&#39;ve had so far. This stuff smells wonderful and the nugs literally look like they are covered in a dusting of snow. This is one of the most expensive to buy per gram, and I use it sparingly for when my legs or back is in a lot of pain after a long day of working in my feet. Two hits of this had me insanely high but also completely rid me of pain in my back. I use marijuana for muscle spasms also, and this is a wonderful indica to use before bed. It&#39;s also great for migraines and nausea. This is THE BEST medical marijuana I&#39;ve used that is helpful for so many symptoms.

VGREAT! Very pleasant surprise, we had no idea what we were getting, mild smoke, mild flavor, powerful high. The smoke it self was smooth and worked almost instantly. Long lasting Indica without the usual exhaustion. Will buy again!

VThis strain caused a pretty unique high for me.  Instead of how most strains hit me this one brought me to a lower high but sustained the &quot;buzz&quot; for around 1.5-2 times longer than those other buds.  Made me somewhat anxious towards the end and left me feeling somewhat disoriented afterwards for quite a while, it&#39;s a day killer so don&#39;t smoke if you have to be anywhere for the rest of the evening.

VWhite LSD is a lovely and positive strain that packs a nice punch, while also provides a calm and uplifting high. A fun strain to toke for traveling with friends, social times, and chill grooves. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related to the Lamb&#39;s Bread/Sour Diesel LSD, but it sure reminds me of a more frosty and relaxed LSD high. Love this strain, can&#39;t go wrong!

VA little cheesy funk on the nose, and next to no flavor with my Pax2 vaporizer. BUT, once the high hit, I felt great! In 90 minutes, I put a brisket in the oven, made salsa, vacuumed the house, cleaned the dishes, and pushed  myself to take an online yoga class! I stayed present and focused throughout, and even felt I could hold some of the harder poses longer than I normally do! The &quot;after high&quot; was a nice, slow descent into calm well-being. Very nice strain.

Vreally good stuff. feels very very indica, great pain relief and relaxation. could be sedating if you mean for it to but the high is so mood enhancing it just makes you want to chill and listen to music and enjoy it. definitely a &quot;sit down, shut up, and enjoy&quot; type of high. smoke is smooth and the flower is stunning in appearance.

VThe White is an excellent all around hybrid. I purchased it under the assumption it is an Indica strain and it\u2019s effects definitely leans Indica-dominant; however, I was pleased by the subtle cerebral effects The White offers. It has nice light-green flowers that are generously covered in Tricomes. The cerebral effects are subtle, as indicated above, but they are short lived. What I liked most about my experience with this strain is the somatic effects. This is the strain for people looking to Zonk out! I slept like a newborn after administering one bowl of The White. Now I get that the effects may be different for each individual but I have a lot of experience with different strains and The White is distinct in this regard. I will definitely partake in this strain again. ~life is too short for hate, so remember to like and follow. Peace!

VI love The White. I picked up 3.5 grams from GOE in Hayward grown by Pharoah Pharms. this is my second dance with The White. the first was a gift joint from a friend. after that I&#39;ve been waiting for it to hit the East Bay dispensaries again. Finally found her. I smoke this in joints only. the flavor to me is smooth, menthol-ish, kind of flowery on exhale. Very nice and pleasant to smoke. Definitely a creeper. bout halfway through my 1/5 gram joint I feel it start to tingle in my legs then my stomach and then my whole body starts to vibrate. It feels like being wrapped in a blanket of warm love. next my eyes start to get squinty and I lose a little peripheral vision and then BAM! the head high kicks in. VERY narcotic like with tracers and sound artifacts and when I close my eyes the visions are psychedelic, trippy, and oh so fun. Forget reading or watching anything because it just won&#39;t make sense! Time to go nighty night!\u000a\u000aThe White is in my top 3 maybe at number 1.\u000a\u000aGet some!

VThe White has a smell similar to a strain I smoked when I was living in Florida. My friends and I would call a strain such as this &quot;crippy&quot; (which is more than likely derived from Hawaiian terminology) not caring for what it was actually named just caring about getting high. I&#39;m also happy to report both, the color and the structure of this particular strain (The White) is almost, identical and the high is reminiscent of what I was smoking when I was seventeen(minus the extreme paranoia). That would mean that the origin of The White extends atleast, five years in advance of 2009. DO NOT QUESTION THE POTENCY. I smoked one bowl out of a bubbler after the first draw I tend to cough but, all subsequent hits were smooth and mellow. The smell is both piney and earthy on the break up. The taste centers around the same but, the one thing that&#39;s unexpected is the high... it certainly delivers more of a cerebral although billed as an indica by Leafly which must mean there are other more sativa dominant phenotypes out there. While, I certainly can tell that The White has an indica feel to it the head high seems more prevelent and reminds me of a stronger Blue Dream.

VPurity, Goodness, Perfection, unblemished, White hot...FIRE! \u000aThe White that I was so privileged to inhale was grown by Solstice. The THC percentage was 29% and the flush, trim, and cure was waaay above average. The White grown by Solstice is about as close to marijuana perfection as anyone can get. That remarkable smell, those terps...that smooth inhale followed by the lung expansion and tasty exhale. WHITE HEAVEN. The effects of this perfectly grown hybrid lasted for several hours. Hours that were filled with laughter and pleasantry, smiles and elation. Its as if I took cloud nine to 7th heaven. What a journey in exhilaration and ecstasy. Best cannabis I&#39;ve used so far this year 2015!

VMy favorite strain. One of the most beneficial and medically-therapeutic strains for my predisposition. A very friendly and compassionate bud; loved treats you and treats you kindly; long-lasting effects go into the four hour range and leave you with a calm abiding glow towards the end of effects. Though technically an indica, The White is an ideal strain for evenings that will carry you into bed. Effects are relaxing, happy, peaceful and content with great body pain management and that &quot;tingly&quot; sensation over my body, often leaving me forgettinh I had a body. Top quality. A++, 4.9/5.

VI tried a new dispensary, White Mountain Health Center, because I heard they had some very reasonably priced edibles. But I was also very impressed with the quality of flower, the specials, and the overall feel of the shop. I got the edibles, but could not pass up picking up a quarter of The White on their early bird special for a great price. I am never disappointed when I get this strain. The buds where very fresh, nice density, and absolutely covered in white trichomes. People say this bud tends to lack a strong smell, but every time I&#39;ve had it I think it smells bomb. Excellent high. Good for both day and night time in my opinion. Nice heady high, with body high to match. Definitely one of my favorites.

VThe rundown on this plant commonly seen now,&amp; referred to as &quot;The White&quot; derives from A clone-only strain by way of (pretty fucking sure, but I don&#39;t claim to be that bright, however... I can comfortably say, I&#39;ve done this a little longer than most) the Colorado cannabis community, &amp; was called the &quot;Chrome&quot; cut. The master grower/breeder responsible for reviving/re-energizing correctly is none other than OGRASKAL, by means of STS (Tieriasias Mist)on a select branch to induce male flowers containing pollen with only Y chromosomes (no X male chromosomes)l and in-turn pollinating the entire plant, breeding it back into its self &amp; producing what are called S1 seeds. All S1 seeds will then by nature, be fem&#39;d&amp; in my opinion, as good as it gets, making thousands of new, perfectly identical powerhouse plants. Raskals White strain seems to work jaw-droppingly well when used for breeding projects, as almost every breeder utilizing this knowledge, is also a major cup holder for doing so... Indica dominant hybrid, with very little, to NO PHENO variance in a full room run from seed.

VI shop around for medicine here in Cali due to being a bipolar patient. This means I usually lean towards a product that will leave me somewhere in the middle of the road after medicating. So this one keeps me from getting too pumped during a hypo-manic episode, meaning too much of a head high can be a bad thing...or good depending on the individual reading. I wish I wasn&#39;t as tranquilized, tranquil and sedated in my case so I could upload a photo of these rich and aromatic, flowers, buds, or whatchamacallit&#39;s. I dosed first with a fine piece of glassware that left my throat tingling and then burning with the same intensity I imagine would be brought on by swallowing glass. It burned basically as I knew it would when I saw the creamy and chalk white smoke that tasted like I had chewed the entire ounce and left my palate saturated with a cacophony of different tasting inorganic and organic substances. The high was slow hitting and left me seated, coughing, and looking for the nearest drink. Thankfully, I chose this experience since I knew I had nothing to do for an hour or so and enjoyed some somewhat bright colors and even brighter conversation with my wife before dozing off into a peaceful sleep. The flight box allowed me to enjoy the peppery, piney, and somewhat sweet flavors from this excellent batch delivered to me by &quot;Merced Green on the Go&quot;. While I still coughed and had dry mouth, the high was much more purposefully dosed and could be used as a daytime med for me on days where anxiety peeks but sleep has been more constant. I personally can&#39;t take a royal hit from the bong of this masterfully crafted product and not end up sleeping like a peaceful Buddha.

VThe White is an incredible strain. Its incredibly smooth and I was high off the first hit. I had been having a so-so day and I instantly became happier and content. A great strain for people with anxiety or depression. After a long toke, the high becomes really relaxing and you get hungry! REALLY HUNGRY! Be careful or that full tub of ice cream in the freezer just might become an empty one really quickly. I got my meds from The Root Cellar in LA, and they have a Medbox so the buds were super fresh and had a great smell. The White is for sure in my top three now. Highly recommended

VThis strain has a pine smell, with a subtle background of lemon. When broken up, mostly smell of pine and sometimes sugar. Thick vapor, kind of harsh on the throat when taking big hits, even from the vaporizer. Back pain is forgotten, head is a bit cloudy. After a few moments of settling, the head gets a little warm, welcoming pressure on the top of your head.

VI got some of the original Krome line, and I will attest to this being one of the best all-around strains out there.  Head and body, but pretty clear, and just very nice feelings.  I guess most would call this potent.  The batch I got tested over 30% THCa.  So there&#39;s that.  I&#39;m pretty experienced, but I suppose it is strong enough.

VI always like anything with &quot;White&quot; in the name and these were pretty dense at my favorite dispensary, the Green Element in Torrance.  Anyhoo- I use frequently for cptsd and anxiety and this is a one hitter even for me.  Very good for sleep and relaxation.  I might make a salad with my super blue dream  for balance!

VAmazing buds to look at covered like beautiful green gems in crystals thus so it knocks tone of bud down lighter with Leafly&#39;s description being spot on in that way. Wouldn&#39;t say no smell or taste because there is a faint smell of dank spicyness that does not carry over to the flavor of The White. Usually this is a disappointment and a sign of not so great cannabis for me to be honest. This flower though is an exception in that it can be used much like tofu is used when cooking to make foods healthier. Aside from texture it is unnoticeable when mixed with other foods because it takes on the flavor of that food. The White usually of higher percentage when mixed with tastier strains takes on their yumm factor while symbiotically raising the THC content. Only have seen above 20% and would not buy at any lower percentage due to use as a supplement strain in cannabis salads. This bud is a relaxing, pain reducing blessing which is also extraordinary to see with all its crystal splendor.

VThe White is one of my new go-to strains. It doesn&#39;t give you couch-lock and it also doesn&#39;t make you overly hyper or hungry. It has a very level headed effect that lifts your spirits while keeping your faculties, which makes it a great strain for athletics and creative types. There is basically no smell so if you want to be discreet or are sensitive to the strong smelling strains this is a great choice. It is worth noting that I only vaporize The White so it may or may not apply to smoking it as well.

VThe White is the vodka of the marijuana world. It goes in clean, but can bite if entertaining first time smokers. The body effects are lifted and light with occasional feelings of incredible heaviness. However, its play on the mind is where this variety truly shines.

VI picked up this beauty on the Oregon coast while on vacation several months back.  I wasn&#39;t used to smoking anything that was as high in THC as this was.  At 22 % it is quite potent.  I did find it to be a very balanced and highly enjoyable high.  It strongly favors it&#39;s indica side as you can get pretty couch-locked but it&#39;s cerebral effects were quite noticeable as well.  Overall, I would recommend this for those with aches and pains, those with anxiety issues and those wanting a very, very relaxing time.  Kick back, make no plans and let this baby take you to a new dimension.

After carefully vetting my own possible theories, I suddenly realized I had at least a dozen things I just had to google. This is a fast acting very creative strain; uplifting with almost a floating feeling. Top shelf kinda bud. Tons of trichs, very prickelly, almost furry. Taste was pretty neutral except for a very slight almost chlorine taste, huh? Not too much throat burn and grinded up bud burnt completely when smoked with a 5&quot; pipe. Anyway, this is an A strain all the way.

VThe rundown on this plant commonly seen now,&amp; referred to as &quot;The White&quot; derives from A clone-only strain by way of (pretty fucking sure, but I don&#39;t claim to be that bright, however... I can comfortably say, I&#39;ve done this a little longer than most) the Colorado cannabis community, &amp; was called the &quot;Chrome&quot; cut. The master grower/breeder responsible for reviving/re-energizing correctly is none other than OGRASKAL, by means of STS (Tieriasias Mist)on a select branch to induce male flowers containing pollen with only Y chromosomes (no X male chromosomes)l and in-turn pollinating the entire plant, breeding it back into its self &amp; producing what are called S1 seeds. All S1 seeds will then by nature, be fem&#39;d&amp; in my opinion, as good as it gets, making thousands of new, perfectly identical powerhouse plants. Raskals White strain seems to work jaw-droppingly well when used for breeding projects, as almost every breeder utilizing this knowledge, is also a major cup holder for doing so... Indica dominant hybrid, with very little, to NO PHENO variance in a full room run from seedi

VThe White, is an outstanding strain originating from Florida. This bud is so kind, yet soo demanding when inhaled. She will leave you coughing, but the effects will be well-worth the exertion. You can expect a very relaxed day, or a great nights rest. She smells of pine and tastes strong but beautiful. This is medicine at its finest.\u000a\u000a5 STARS :)         (*****)
