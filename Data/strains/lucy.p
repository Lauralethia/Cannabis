VI picked up a gram of this strain in a joint, and it instantly became one of my favorites, smokes fairly smooth, made me feel relaxed, stress free, just a tad tired, felt it relieve the pain in my neck and lower back, I barely felt a head high, I would recommend this strain to anyone just starting out smoking or looking for a nice relaxed feeling without being hazey.

VVery much a full body high, but not overly strong. I like the taste a lot. Lucy is probably my number, with Flo being my love. It&#39;s also a steady high for me, I&#39;m kinda lightweight so two, three hits of this and I was good for a few hours.

VInitial high is ok but comes to a halt quickly, so be ready to nap. I&#39;m not a fan of hybrids or indicas but understand and appreciate the pain relief in this strain. It&#39;s not terrible and I would definitely use when my pain is kicking up.

VI got this strain because I suffer from debilitating panic attacks and anxiety. It&#39;s basically Xanax in the form of weed. Almost immediately took away my anxiousness. I feel chill with no racing thoughts. I recommend Lucy for anyone who really wants the medical benefits only. I prefer a more giggly, stoney high. I already have a prescription for Xanax so I&#39;d rather spend my money GSC and SkywalkerOG.

VSolid CBD strain, I really like this for headaches, though I\u2019m sure when I have a migraine it would help as well. This is great for when your temples, jaw,neck and sinuses are in pain and your temples and auricularis muscles feel like a raw tangled mess. I strongly feel that Indica CBD\u2019s are best for severe pain and sleep while Sativa\u2019s help with anxiety and mild discomfort for work or daytime use.\u000a This is what I want in an Indica CBD, it helps with stress, pain (especially musculoskeletal pain), anxiety, TMJ and Insomnia. I didn\u2019t really increase my appetite like some strains (which was fine with me) and it causes mild dry mouth, but nothing too bad.\u000aI\u2019m home from work on a Friday and I\u2019m watching Netflix. I could easily take a nap or just chill and relax. &#128076;&#127996;&#128134;&#127995;\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Smoke or vape a bowl or joint and you will feel a mild and mellow THC high that\u2019s relatively short lived. I Recommend.

VA new favorite! What a sweet strain! Kind bud indeed. Bought to relieve a slew of nerve issues, It worked! Though it is 10%THC, the 10%CBD Kicks! My first exhale came with the words &quot;oh, Beauty&quot;! I Love Lucy!

VBeing a high cbd fan, I found some of this locally and was excited to try it. Usually high cbd strains work great for my PTSD and panic anxiety, however this did little to nothing to mediate my symptoms. Rather disappointed, and tasted like moldy hay. Had some pain relief, but it was minimal and short lived.

VI would characterize this strain as a clear-headed, heavy indica.\u000a\u000aOne solid hit and I felt the effects creeping in over the next 5 minutes. Somewhat euphoric and body/head buzzy, lasting about an hour with full effects, and almost back to baseline after 90 minutes.\u000a\u000aVery relaxing and eventually sleep inducing. \u000a\u000aGood for:\u000a-Relaxation\u000a-Sleep\u000a-Appetite stimulation\u000a-stress\u000a-Doing nothing in particular\u000a\u000aNot good for:\u000a-Using heavy machinery\u000a-mental focus\u000a-solving problems\u000a-any task requiring more than 5 minutes of effort\u000a\u000aThis is one of those &quot;living in the moment&quot; strains. Your short-term memory will become even shorter to non-existent.
