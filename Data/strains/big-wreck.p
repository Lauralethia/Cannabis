VDefinitely one of our best strains!  Buds are dense and extremely frosty!  Rolled a whole blunt of it and it burned smooth and tasted phenomenal...for the price it was totally worth it!  The high was long lasting, it made me nice and sleepy but was not heavy enough to cause couch lock.  It did cause me to get the munchies hard core, so it would be good for someone who has problems with nausea or lack of appetite.  This bud can easily top the list on my favorite strains of all time!  Stop by Local Product of Colorado and give it a try, you&#39;ll be glad you did!

VLOVE this strain! The plant I bought is from Mtn View Naturals in Hood River and although it is an indica dominant hybrid, I have found it beautifully relaxing without making me tired or groggy at all. Also puts me in a great mood; laid back, happy and even a bit cuddly at times &#128521; Thanks to Miss Emmy for such a wonderful little plant.

VI like Big Wreck but it&#39;s one probably for a littlelater in the day. The buds are on the rounder, chunky side, they&#39;re very dense, bright green in color, with bright orange hairs and it&#39;s absolutely covered in sticky frosty triches the stuff I have gotten doesn&#39;t have a ton of color but it&#39;s still definitely a looker It&#39;s initially kinda upbeat. It starts with some energy, a great body high, and a bit of that Trainwreck euphoria but that feeling changes with time or continued use to become very relaxing and can lead to feeling pretty lethargic and sometimes make it hard to get a bunch done. Smell wise it doesn&#39;t have that Trainwreck piney twang to it. It&#39;s closer to Big Bud it&#39;s sweet, fruity, with a skunky earthiness to it. This is probably a great strain for someone looking for an Indica dominant strain to use before or after dinner just depending on how much u wanna eat!

VI like Big Wreck probably a little more later in the day. It&#39;s buds are on the rounder chunky side, they&#39;re super dense &amp; sticky. It&#39;s bright green in color, lots of bright orange hairs and blanketes of frosty triches. The stuff I&#39;ve gotten hasn&#39;t had a ton of color but it&#39;s still quite a looker. Smell wise there isn&#39;t any of that Trainwreck piney twang to it. It&#39;s closer to Big Bud it&#39;s sweet, &amp; fruity with a earthy skunky quality to it. Big Wreck starts out with a bit of a boost in energy,   some of that Trainwreck euphoria, and there&#39;s a nice full body relaxation. Sometimes that feeling of relaxation can build with time or continued use, can lead to feeling lethargic and can make it hard to get things done or stay off the couch. In my opinion this is a great strain for right before or after dinner depending on how much you wana eat.

VIm a huge Trainwreck strain fan, and when i saw &quot;BBTW&quot; AKA &quot;Big Bud Train Wreck&quot; for sale, i was in. This strain was a bit underwhelming, to be honest. Compared to Purple Trainwreck for example, and BBTW wasnt nearly as &quot;trainwrecky&quot;. BBTWs buzz lasted a long time, but the high wasn&#39;t as trippy and potent as some other trainwrecks out there. A solid mid, but far from the best trainwreck.

VI&#39;ve heard people talk about the body-high from this strain and to me it was just more that I was super relaxed/couch-locked. I didn&#39;t get the tingly/floaty/lifted feeling that I usually associate with a good body-high... Still, this stuff is very good for when you just want to mellow out, fall asleep, or just generally turn into a happy potato.

VTonite I&#39;m vaping flower, some of the Bad Wreck I picked up tonite from Glisan Buds.  At last, after 3 weeks, my crush Goth Boy was there!  He wasn&#39;t my budtender but we did exchange a few lines.  I probably outweigh him by 80 lbs.\u000a\u000aPer Leafly, &quot;Big Wreck is the indica-dominant cross of Big Bud and Trainwreck. This chunky combination offers functional relaxation with an uplifted mental buzz that some might describe as creative. This strain becomes very sedative with continuous use and may also stimulate your appetite.&quot;\u000a\u000aI appreciate my G-Slim vape even more now that I&#39;m medicating with the concentrates. The cartridges totally work on the G-Glim, which was primarily made for flower. It&#39;s nice having a second vape on the charger in case you drain the battery.\u000a\u000aTonite&#39;s the first night in a couple of weeks that I&#39;ve used it for flower.\u000a\u000aLike Ultra Violet, this indica doesn&#39;t taste very good :/ However, also like Ultra Violet, I&#39;m liking Big Wreck&#39;s high very much! Very relaxing, cozy...a good one for sitting in front of a fireplace on a December afternoon while it&#39;s snowing outside.\u000a\u000aI would totally buy Big Wreck again someday!   Big Wreck delivers the deep relaxation that one looking for in a good indica.  The reason I only gave it three stars on Leafly is because it doesn&#39;t taste or smell great, and while the high is very nice, there are others whose high is just as nice that also smell and taste good.
