VPretty damn good strain. From the first exhale, you immediately will taste the tropical notes of mango just like a smoothie. I absolutely love the taste of this strain, and man is it fruity. If you ever get the chance to consume this amazing herb, realize its awesomeness. You will notice that the high is very very clear headed. There seems to be a low to minimal haze hat you would get usually. I found that this strain is great for being productive as well as a few bits of cosmic euphoria sprinkles through your journey along the way. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it made me anxious at the start of my sesh, however it soon vanished. Enjoy!

VThis strain reflects the name in perfect harmony, mango, diesel and the unique tropical maui wowie heritage are all present and welcomed hit after hit.

VThe smell of this bud just hits you like a fresh mango to the face. The taste is once again a strong tropical and sweet one with mango being the main bit. This is a good daytime high, I felt immediately relaxed but not tired. This strain made me a little hungry and lightly thirsty. The look of the bud was a nice green with some darker leaves dotting the fluffy nuggs. As for the Keef this strain wasn\u2019t particularly caked, it did have a decent yield.

VDefinitely up there with tangerine dream as far a tasting incredible. Fresh mangos! The high is incredibly relaxing but clearheaded. I use it as a day strain and there\u2019s no \u201cdopeyness\u201d to it. Feels great, makes me smile, and removes any tension  good for relieving my tension headaches and causes no anxiety for me (thankfully). \u000aP.S. If you are prone to auditory hallucinations like I am, this has never caused me any.
