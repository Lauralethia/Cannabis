VIf you can get your paws on this original sativa landrace hailing from Nepal, you will experience something most users, recreational and medicinal, will never experience. This is a pure sativa with fruity notes and high psychoactive potency. Moreover, it is also a parent of the infamous Chemdog (allegedly), when bred with another geographically close landrace, Thai (or Thai sticks).

VWell, there are different strains in Nepal, mostly Sativa. These are really sweet in berry like smell with lovely resin covered buds. Smoke one heavily and it will give you a cough lock for sure. Giggly and somewhat Psychoactive. \u000aThough you need to get the true Nepalese landrace. \u000aBOOM BHOLENATH!!

VI got these INCREDIBLY phat chunky nugs from a local grower. Grown Outdoors these buds are giants! He showed me one that weighed roughly 9 grams, dried&#128562;. The flowers themselves are a beautiful combination of the sweet and the skunk that I think we all have come to love. Definitely a great strain!\u000aThe only down\u2b07side is because it was grown Outdoors there&#39;s little trichomes on the outside when you crack open an nug you see it&#39;s real &#127894;glory&#127894;and the Terps will overwhelm you. It has some serious bag of Hill because the buds are so HUGE but, the lack of trichomes can be off-putting. Give her a chance, At first glance I didn&#39;t seem as special as it was when I opened the &#127873;gift&#127873; and saw what what what was inside. Trichomes and sweet skunky terps &#128513;

VI didn&#39;t realize the effects tended to be indica- this -ish put me on the couch. But don&#39;t worry, I was up again after about 2 hours! Beast looking weed I have ever seen in my life. Nugs like the inside of crystal covered caverns. Smells great too. Try it out, but save it for after dinner!

VLoved this strain but have to leave a warning, 10 minutes after my vapes bowl I was instantly hard, like painfully so...SO glad I was alone and it was night time. After that it was wonderful and relaxing, took my stress away completely, which was what I needed. I was a bit forgetful, which was new for me, but not in a hazardous way, like forgetting I drank my tea 15 minutes ago. Overall, great strain for stress, pain and a great nights sleep.

VStrong fruity smell, and very sticky. I def felt in control during my high but I tended to focus on very minute things. It&#39;s Energizing in the sense that it helps you get up out of bed to do stuff. Super helpful when it comes to alleviating anxiety. I thought I would enjoy it more but I lacked feeling the euphoric rush or the giggles. I just end up fixating on stuff and focused on performing physical tasks. Very chill though.
