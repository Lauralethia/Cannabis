VI&#39;m a pro CBD activists which is why I love all CBD.. I&#39;m more interested in low THC high CBD other then the 1to1 ratio or such. I picked up two grams and a Pre roll of CW it&#39;s my go to when I have to be clear head for work and stuff and still get relief.

VWith a strong, pine-y scent and a strong, long-lasting high, this is one of my favorite sativa strains. When I smoke this, I tend to want to just laying down, listen to music with my girlfriend and read. The high takes about ten minutes to reach full effect, at which point I become somewhat entranced.

VI&#39;ve used Charlotte&#39;s Web many times now, and have been waiting to write a review.  It is difficult for me to put my finger on exactly what happens when I use it.  I can tell you certain things that I absolutely do NOT experience.  I do NOT get anxious, I do NOT get paranoid.  Oddly enough it seems that the effects do not actually start to be felt until well after 30 minutes, and this is when Vaping the flower.  I do feel calmer, I do feel relaxed.  I do in the extreme feel like taking a nap, although I&#39;m not tired.  I can certainly work throughout the day with this, so daytime strain for sure.  I&#39;ve looked to see if there was/is anything that is perhaps just a bit stronger than this, and so far each time I&#39;ve had negative effects.  CW is my go to and has always made me relaxed and never made me anxious.

VI am currently going thru perimenopause and the mood swings make me say very hurtful things and I can get aggressive.   I&#39;m lucky to have a loving family.\u000a\u000aI had no problems managing this for 1 year.  This was the year that I started using the concentrated form of Charlotte&#39;s Web for my seizures.\u000a\u000aThen I got really sick and only used my Dilantin pills for seizures.  At the same time I was PMS&#39;ing.  I almost got divorced and declared myself a childless woman that had no husband.....I asked an attorney with help doing this too.  It was a week-long event which ended with me crying uncontrollably.\u000a\u000aI advise this to other women who experience the same things but don&#39;t want to take a bunch of pills to control themselves.  I stated taking it again yesterday afternoon when my fever broke and I&#39;m no longer agitated/stressed/angry....but no high so yeah!\u000a\u000aI do not smoke or vaporize this, it is a rice size amount that is eaten with my meal 2 times a day.

VI LOVE this. I have heard about CW for a long time, but it only recently became available in the dispensaries I go to. I have an extremely low tolerance to weed, and I mean extreme. I use cannabis every day and I remain super-sensitive. Depending on the strain, I can smoke 1-2 hits maximum, and with potent strains, even 1 hit is enough to get me way too high. With edibles, 5mg can get me scary messed up for 12 hours. \u000a\u000aFor that reason, and because I seek anxiety and pain relief from cannabis, I love Charlotte&#39;s Web. The stuff I got has 1.2% THC, and 22.2% CBD. Over 20 minutes, I took 6 hits from a joint, which as I&#39;ve said, is way more than I can usually handle. I did get high, but in a mild, pleasant way. A body buzz, plus the leg pain melted away, my irritability was gone, and I keep grinning and feel happy. But other than some fogginess, I&#39;m not experiencing a cerebral high. It&#39;s just a good feeling. I love it.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this strain for anything CBDs help with--from a plain old feel-good, listen to music space out session, to migraines, seizures, etc. Also recommended for people with low tolerance, or who don&#39;t like psychedelic effects from weed. I think you could use a small enough amount to manage the symptoms in question without feeling too buzzed to be at work, too.

VBeing a former cannabis addict I have been so grateful for this strain. Virtually no mental change after a smoke. It functions as a general down-regulating medicine for a wide range of conditions. When I had chronic pain it helped a lot on that too, but it lets you keep your sharpness. No euphoria/high whatsoever and at first I didn&#39;t get why others described their experiences as &#39;high&#39; at all untill I started growing the phenotype myself.\u000a\u000aApparently the process responsible for cannabis to produce either the high-inducing THC or the (for my part) medically appliable CBD is dependent on the flower&#39;s pH. Sour pH in the flowers produces THC. Neutral pH makes the strain phenos produce CBD with a hay-like smell with a side of freshly baked bread. You can litterally smell the different Charlotte&#39;s web phenos&#39; THC/CBD content when you compare them at first.\u000a\u000aI have stopped smoking now, since I don&#39;t need any more help with CBD. Now I help oher people with anything from cancer to PTSD with the CBD-rich phenotypes, but I keep a 50/50 THC/CBD pheno in the grow and on the shelf to accomodate people with those illnessess where a combination gives the best foundation for healing.

VStrain: Charlotte\u2019s Web (Sativa CBD Heavy Hitter)\u000aTHC: 1.2%\u000aCBD: 22.2%\u000aGrower: LionTree	\u000aLocation found: Natural Wonders\u000aDate purchased: 2.1.16\u000aPrice: $35.00 (with $5.00 off) == $30.00 for an \u215b \u000aWeight: 3.5g\u000aMethod of Consumption: Herb Iron and small bong \u000aSmell: Most to all CBD heavy strains do not smell like our favorite THC concentrated strains. It was one of the reasons it was breed out of plants for so many years. This CW had a nicer, lighter, almost fruit type smell.\u000aLook: The nugs are fluffier but with good structure. \u000aTaste: in comparison to all other CBD strains, this was the best taste yet I have found for the medicinal effects. It made me cough but not near as harsh as some indoor and greenhouse strains I have tried before.\u000aRecommendation for medicine: I consume about .25-.50 every 24-36 hours. It helps with my physical pain, some of my PTSD and I do notice a return of some ailments if I go longer than the 36 hours. All around some of the most inspiring medicine I have found yet.

VI tend toward paranoia, and therefore don&#39;t like getting &quot;high&quot; very often. But this strain is easy for daily use...I deal with anxiety on a daily basis, and this is excellent for that. I use a vaporizer pen, and the smoke is very easy. I feel calm but not out of it. If I smoke a little bit in the morning, it also helps me achieve a deeper state during meditation, which compounds the anti-anxiety effects. Then I can move forward with my day and focus and accomplish things. So I definitely recommend for treating anxiety without knocking you out.

VInteresting!  I&#39;m used to the relaxing qualities of Indicas and while I can feel that familiar relaxation, there is no high associated with it.  Still tinkering with how much to use for my diagnosed anxiety and OCD but pleasantly surprised so far.  I smoked it this time since my vaporizer broke but I imagine burning this at lower temperatures will have a slightly different effect. \u000a\u000aHighly recommended for those that want to benefit from the relaxing properties but wish to avoid the stoney and high feeling.

VThis strain is truly amazing. Like others have stated, it has a nice and strong piney scent. The looks are decent, light green bud with tiny orange hairs. The smoke is smooth, but earthy. The high is very calm, not much of a psychoactive high at all. It&#39;ll just mellow you out. I can feel the CBD taking effect and relaxing my muscles and taking away my aches. I&#39;ve heard a lot of good about this strain and now I&#39;m seeing it for myself.

Vi have ehlers danlos syndrome and i love this strain. it really is a true Medical strain. mine was 22.2% cbd to 1.2% thc. I don&#39;t respond well to high thc anymore so this was wonderful. barley any high, relaxing, stress reliving. great smoked and vaped. I plan to make AVB oil with it when I have enough and also a tincture from the small buds. it&#39;s not good for insomnia though. it keeps me up. but otherwise it helps with pain, is relaxing, and doesn&#39;t cause the effects that mainly thc strains do. for me that&#39;s causing me to be too lax and triggering spaisms and laxity. I feel energized and more comfortable when I use Charlotte&#39;s web

It did make me feel a little dizzy but nothing to worry about. It does give you a very clear head to focus on what you are doing. It did take away the pain, but just a all around good strain without the head high. My Charlottes web was a 1:1 strain.

Also......don&#39;t let the lack of frosty crystals. Soothing potent aromas or other typical &quot;chronic&quot; physical characteristics fool you. Your cbd selection will have plenty of potent cbd medicine for you. Not that the person reading this didn&#39;t already know that. Please ignore me.\u000a\u000aAnd stay medicated my friends.

This strain leaves me deeply relaxed for about 6 hours after vaping. It&#39;s stopped all my symptoms: motion sickness, mental fatigue, migraines, and let&#39;s me sleep all night. I do get a little dizzy for 20 mins and have dry mouth for hours. If you&#39;re looking for a no-stone, highly medicinal, ultra-relaxing effect, this is for you.

VExpand your consciousness while releasing PTSD effortlessly. This is my new go-to strain for dealing with anxiety related to PTSD. I&#39;ve long been a dedicated spiritual practitioner (Reiki Master, multicultural shaman) and enjoy vision quests via drumming and other means. I trained as a shaman before cannabis culture went mainstream, and during my training, I was taught how to use breathing and awareness to expand one&#39;s experiences.\u000a\u000aAnd now, there&#39;s a strain of cannabis that pairs beautifully with seeking insight, and with releasing anxiety during this period of intrinsically tumultuous social &amp; political change. We&#39;re in this together, my friends. I love you ALL, and wish you abundant peace and well-being. The radiant heart within me recognizes the radiant heart in you. Or, to put it into a single word, Namast&#233;. &lt;3\u000a

VHighly reccomended cbd strain for those dealing with chronic pain. Inflammation. Anxiety or myalgia. Calming soothing effect it had on myself. Excellent choice for day time hours and individuals who prefer no head high or euphoria with their doses. I reccomend getting the highest cbd you can find. Also......don&#39;t let the lack of frosty crystals. Soothing potent aromas or other typical &quot;chronic&quot; physical characteristics fool you. Your cbd selection will have plenty of potent cbd medicine for you. Not that the person reading this didn&#39;t already know that. Please ignore me.\u000a\u000aAnd stay medicated my friends.

VHoly moly, I am pretty impressed with the high CBD content of this strain, and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone needing pain relief without wanting to feel high or stoned. There are very minimal THC levels in this particular strain, so those that are sensitive to THC don&#39;t need to worry. If you are wanting to feel high or stoned, in addition to getting pain relief, I&#39;d recommend grinding up or mixing this strain with another of your choosing. That way you can have the best of both worlds! You could combine this with an Indica for nighttime, or you could combine this with another Sativa for the daytime. Maybe mix this with a hybrid and keep it 50/50? There are many combinations you can try with this versatile strain, so see what&#39;s right for you! Cheers!

I also have to navigate some serious bouts of anxiety and sleep-onset insomnia. As you can imagine I need to be able to function through (at times) gruesome calls over a 12 + hour period.

VThis stuff is a life changer! I always thought I wasn&#39;t one for sativas but this is something else. I get terrible anxiety from high THC strains so I love that CW is high CBD, very low THC. I&#39;ve tried 1:1 (Warlock CBD- too high of THC for me but still a great strain). No anxiety, I feel happy, it&#39;s so wonderful! It&#39;s been a long time of unhappy feelings and cannabis is appearing to help immensely. I become so focused when I smoke CW ( 3 puffs is all I have been taking); my favourite thing to do afterwards is clean hahaha. No munchies with this, quite the opposite which I really like. Before bed, I like to have two small puffs of an indica, then three or four of CW and I&#39;ve been sleeping so well. Thank you to the wonderful people who created this.

VI am a medical user in my mid-40s. I got high for a few years in my adolescence, but stopped liking it and quit. A year ago or so I tried THC for medical reasons. I usually smoke Indica, but I wanted to try this product because of its low THC and high CBD content. I took a pull of a CW Select vape cartridge and I&#39;m quite high. It&#39;s a pleasant buzz, none of the anxiety I associate with some Sativas. Glad I bought a whole gram.

VOh man, this strain is amazing. I got a variation of the original strain that had a 1:1 CBD-THC ratio. I am always very careful with sativas since they, in my case, induce racy thoughts and heartbeat which I find overwhelming and enventually leads to anxiety and paranoia. I tried Harlequin and the same thing happened when I took my third hit, great pain relief but too much anxiety. \u000a\u000aI mainly use cannabis for chronic pain, anxiety and depression and sometimes, it is hard to find a high-CBD indica strain that helps with both without making you sleep or feeling lazy. \u000a\u000aWell, Charlotte&#39;s Web was a game changer. I was looking at all the strains on the online store and saw CW and told myself &#39;why not try it? It has equal parts of CBD and THC so we&#39;ll try.&#39; \u000a\u000aWhen I opened the bag, I was overwhelmed by the smell of this strain. Such a wonderful smell, yet I cannot describe it. Very unique. I was also surprised because the leaves were quite dark for a sativa strain. The buds were beautiful, bursting with orange hair and shining with trichromes. Not sticky though. \u000a\u000aSo I started with one careful hit in my glass pipe. Nice smoke, not too harsh on the lungs with a pleasant taste. I noticed some tingling and pain relief after maybe 5 mins. I was just feeling good, relaxed, focused and happy. So I took a second hit. Now I was smiling and feeling really productive, but still relaxed. So I decided to take one last, 3rd hit. And that&#39;s exactly when I decided to pick up my phone and rate this strain on Leafly. Man, I feel so good! \u000a\u000aNow I can enjoy a sativa to kill my pain and be productive without feeling overwhelmed with anxiety and racing thoughts. Love love love CW, thank God for your existence.\u000a\u000aOh yeah and I finally took a 4th hit while writing this. Hehe.\u000a\u000aJust go get some, you won&#39;t regret it!

VI have been fortunate enough to come across a half gram of wax of this strain. Normally I don&#39;t really smoke all-CBD or high-CBD strains since I like to get super high on weed, but there are those occasions where this might come in handy. Two nights ago, anxiety set in with no reason about an hour after I took a big dab, and was glad to remember that CBD helps to mitigate those negative effects. In addition to the anxiety, my back also hurt from working for a while around the house, so I decided to take a break and have some Charlotte&#39;s Web. When I took my first dab of the stuff (around 0.05g), I immediately felt my back pain subside, my intense high settled down a tinybit to where it was comfortable again, and my anxiety went away completely within 5 minutes. I was not only relieved but shocked that it worked that quickly. Not to mention the taste is phenomenal! The wax I got tastes like a mix of cherry and pine and is very flowery. Very delicious!

I really wanted to be as impressed with it as everyone else is, but I just wasn&#39;t. Everybody&#39;s body chemistry and needs are different and I guess my body just doesn&#39;t respond to CW.

VI\u2019ve been a daily smoker since about age 16, and have mainly used high THC with little to no CBD strains. After developing lower back pain, I have actively sought out CBD strains over THC heavy ones, not because I don\u2019t like being high- but because the CBD strains actually perform a necessary daily function for me to alleviate pain and the anxiety caused by it. This is far and away the best strain I have ever smoked in that regard. The flavor and burn is beautiful, and the buzz is mellow, long lasting, and most importantly: my back pain and daily anxiety are all but cured in that space. I would recommend this strain above any other CBD heavy strain, and frankly over several high THC ones, but maybe I\u2019m biased &#128579;

VAfter struggling with Multiple Sclerosis, light Fibromyalgia, Cervical Dystonia, Lumabgo, Neruopathy, Musculoskeletal of the Suboccipital, and Lumbago, I was forced to take 8 medications to reduce the pain: Gabapentin, Tramadol, Klonopin, Hydrocodone(Nocro), Seroquil and Trazadone, along with Fioricet, and a variety of NSAI&#39;ds. I have always been against drugs like marijuana and had never used them, that was until I tried Charolettes Wed. It has completely changed my mind about CBD and Marijuana&#39;s medical value. I have reduced my medicines to only 3 medications. I stopped taking more than half of my meds over night after trying this strain. I feel so much better and I am no longer taking opioid medication like hydrocodone along with the rest. I recommend Charolettes web to anyone struggling with chronic pain. soon enough I am going back to college to finish my degree in biochemistry. This medical strain has changed my life.

VI have chronic neck pain, and often get migraines. This strain did not live up to its hype, unfortunatley. I tried it in the morning, when I first had symptoms from a migraine starting (along with my neck pain). I smoked a bowl from my pipe, and CW did almost nothing. Took mayybeee a tiny bit of the pain away, which atleast helped me get back to sleep... but the pain was still there. Woke up an hour later, and symtoms had gotten worse. Smoked a bowl of Pink Rockstar, and the pain disappeared much more then it did on just CW... however, still there a little bit.\u000aThis evening, I decided to mix a bowl about 2/3rds CW and then 1/3rd Pink Rockstar. Which has seemed to be the best so far.\u000aI think, with migraines atleast, you still need a bit of that high to take the pain away. CW has virtually no high for me... but the CBD helps. Mixing it with Pink Rockstar (which is a heavy hitter for me) mixed in just enough of that THC to balance it out. (Pink Rockstar is also known to help with pain.)

I use it to even out anxious episodes, depressive moods, and related physical symptoms like hypertonic muscle spasms. I haven&#39;t had any muscle pain since starting with this and I now have increased feeling in my hands and feet because muscles that were chronically squeezing nerves have *finally* relaxed. I smoke this at any time throughout the work day and find myself functioning at a high level with no interference from a head high. My only wish is that the effect lasted longer.

I am not sure if the oil is the way to go but I did see that some users smoked Charlotte&#39;s Web and had the same experience.

VTried this today for the first time. I wanted a low thc high cbd strain so I had to try this. Gives a mellow spacey head high. Feels weird but to be fair I heard that your first cbd &quot;high&quot; is going to feel weird and be hard to describe. I feel like it actually makes me sleepy, but I did try it later in the day while relaxing so that could be why. I also feel pretty relaxed but no body buzz or any kind of body change like I heard would happen. Only took a couple of tokes. I&#39;ll try again tomorrow in the morning to see how it affects me then. As of now, I would say this strain is &quot;OK&quot;. \u000aBtw the strain I picked up was 16.8%cbd/.50%thc

VI have to say this strain has introduced me to a completely new start. I love it, and its been helping my seizures settle down a bit since i just recently moved here in December. This is what i call exception and understanding. The even better part is i&#39;m not looked down on or pointed fingers at laughing like i&#39;m just one big joke an like everything i say is just one big fairy tale, well guess what world i&#39;d rather smoke the right thing rather then popping pills day and night when they do nothing for you and yet can still cause deaths only because of side effects, that&#39;s what I call F&#39;ed up! I would say listen to what your body tells you. Not what a paid person tells you cause all that screams right there is &quot;MONEY IN THAT PERSONS POCKET!&quot; An all I can say is that just cause they all have a pretty good amounts of money in their pockets doesn&#39;t always mean their a right person to have it. Haven&#39;t you ever heard &quot; Listen to your bodily instincts? &quot; Ill trust nature over chemicals any day, everyday!!!!!!  I would also love to add in a little bit more and just say thank you leafly for being so informing on everything. I learned a lot from this website and also proved others wrong. So thank you for practically being a dictionary of marijuana! This website and that beautiful plant got me further then my neurologist and neurosurgeon did back when I didn&#39;t smoke and was still taking those pills slowly becoming overdosed by my own dr. It&#39;s pretty sad when you finally think you have hit enough because you were up there in mgs with your pills, ya i had almost hit or even hit up to 3000mgs but back then when i woke up like a piece of shit; now i can only wake up with a smile and say hey its gonna be a great day as long as i have that perfect plant with me cause i promise you if i don&#39;t its not gonna be to good of a mood going into that day and would just lead straight to my problems/stress. This plant can help just about everybody in one way or another. Just don&#39;t look down on something that can help you so much on, Charlottes web was the first CBD strain i had found out about because of leafly &amp; youtube. Once more thank you! #420sweepstakes

VI absolutely love this strain. I work in an office and I am constantly getting stressed out and anxious over projects. I can take it before going into the office and at lunch and it keeps me stress-free and relaxed and I feel zero psychoactive effects thanks to the extremely low THC. An added bonus is that it helps to lower my blood pressure.\u000a\u000aMy wife was also taking this for a while but had to switch to a different strain because she has naturally lower blood pressure so she feels too dizzy when taking CW.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend for those who need to take the edge off from chronic pain during the day.

VDid this strain for my first time using weed for medicine. I have fibromyalgia so am looking to vape to alleviate the pain. Since this was my first time I experienced the typical high - dry mouth, face tingling , dizzy, shaky, mucnhies, my facial muscles were practically forcing me to smile and laugh and my cheeks felt like they were dwelling. I feel my body way too much so I realize all these reactions are probably never noticed. I felt really relaxed but had a little difficulty following what my friend was talking about. I&#39;m not sure if it helped me pain. But it definitely was the best relaxation I&#39;ve ever had. I used it again tonight and am wondering if doing it alone will affect the experience. However I may not have vaped enough as it was my first time doing to alone.  I didn&#39;t experience much other than facial tingling

VAmazing for pain relief and muscle relaxation. At first I wasn&#39;t getting pain relief but tried a higher dose and definitely got there thank goodness! I also use this to negate any negative reaction to higher THC strains. I suffer from autoimmune conditions that cause significant pain. This feels like getting a pain shot w/out the dopiness. So thankful.

VReviewed for anxiety control:\u000a\u000aI use Hempios 350, (11.67 mg per dropper, 30 droppers per oz). 8 drops every 4 hours controls my anxiety.\u000a\u000aWhile out of town I couldn&#39;t find Hempios, and bought CW Everyday Plus: (28 mg per dropper, 30 droppers per oz), so more than twice the mgs. of Hempios 350. However,  8, then 10, then 15 drops every 4 hours were not enough to calm my anxiety, even when I returned home. I suffered for 6 days with this stuff before I could afford to repurchase Hempios. All is well now with 8 drops.\u000a\u000aThe math: 3 mg./4 hours of Hempios 350 controls my anxiety. 10.5 mg./4 hours CW Everday+ does not. Hope this helps someone using CBD for anxiety.

VI\u2019ve been smoking this strain almost daily for about a month now. Where I buy mine grows it with around 5%-7% THC and around 24% CBD. This makes for a very mild body and head high. It\u2019s a FANTASTIC sleep aid, even though it is a Sativa. Would recommend to anyone who isn\u2019t a huge fan of getting fucked up, but loves the medicinal properties of THC and CBD.

If you smoke too much you can nap too.\u000a\u000aThe prerolls are good too. \u000a\u000aNote though its not as uplifting as higher thc strains... so it will calm you the fuck down, but it wont make you happy unless you mix a little white russian or ak 47 or ATF in it.\u000a\u000aGot the same strain from pure green express and got some branches that look like birdpoop.\u000a\u000aSo make sure you get it from pot cargo or national compassion friends.\u000a\u000aDon&#39;t hesitate it will help you rebuild yourself from broken and fucked up.
