VThe doctor is in!! And he will knock you the f-out...Earthy mint flavor followed by slight berry flavor upon exhale. Perfect strain for beginners and connisuers alike. Definitely has the capability to knock anyone out within a few bowls &#128170;zzzzz!!!

VThe Doctor is a strain I just tried out last night before bed time. Not only did I get to sleep quickly and stay asleep after my encounter with The Doctor, but my nagging back pain was also relieved. Really nice flavour and pleasant smelling bag.

VHappy, super relaxed, euphoric/giggly. No coughing. The bud I used had the right amount of moisture making it easy to role. Will definitely buy again...true 5 star bud for someone who has a very high tolerance.

VThis strain is pretty to look at. Its rare to see the full color spectrum in a single strain but these nugs had orange pink and purple hairs. tasted heavy citrus which was odd in an indica. real strong typical indica effects. couch locked for a couple hours.

VThis strain tastes earthy and fruity with a mint undertone that made my lips tingle just a little.  The taste and smell on exhale reminds me of hash and is quite strong.   This strain relaxed my body making it feel light, while also relaxing my mind and helping melt away anxiety.  When I smoked this I had a headache and this strain did help relieve it, however, this strain doesnt get higher stars from me personally as it didnt taste that fantastic to me (although I am not a huge hash fan anyway).   Give it a try. I got mine from MedicalClub.ca.
