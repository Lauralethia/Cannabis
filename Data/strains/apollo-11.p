VThis indoor hybrid has a high calyx/leaf ratio &amp; finishes flowering in 7 weeks or less.  Our big-yielding, lemon-scented female clone named &quot;Genius&quot; because of her CLEAR, energetic, thought-provoking high was crossed with a robust Cinderella 99 male to create Apollo Eleven.  Expect some variation among individuals. The best females are short, heavily branched plants with multitudes of dense, resinous bud sites - perfect for SCROG.  The smoke has a sweet citrus flavour.  The high is UP &amp; HAPPY. \u000a\u000aFlowering: 45-50 days \u000aHeight: 100 cm. \u000aYield: 1-2 lbs per 1000W lamp.  \u000a\u000aGreat for hiking. It has all the advantages of a head stash sativa, but yields in 7 to eight weeks like an indica. the growth pattern is that of a hybrid. decent stretch. Huge Colas. Keep good air flow. Perfect for SCROG.

VThis weed is was much more popular in 2011, with it&#39;s super dense and extremely dark green buds with brown hairs, it isn&#39;t too crystally, but it is the stickiest and hardest to grind weed yet, with it&#39;s chemical citrusish skunky very unique and easy to identify flavor, this weed is a top hybrid choice as it gives off a very energetic high followed by a delightful indica type after high feeling. 4.5/5

VNow this IS a Rocket Science Strain Review of Apollo 11 received from a wonderful old-time friend of 35 years when I got home from my al most daily hospital jaunts for diagnostics and now the series of injections for the extreme anemia due to the two remaining cancers I fought off, with only kidney cancer to go.!\u000a\u000aThis strain is from the renowned Brothers Grim who crossed Cinderella 99 x Genius genetics to arrive at the creation of a new favoured strain of mine for morning exclusive uses !  This is a highly functional, creative, high \u000athat not only does it generate appetite but it gave me the energy to make breakfast in bed for my new girlfriend and I.   I am a 17 year wheelchaired guy that needs more than a thousand volt zap to have this much energy, a rare enough occasion for me to have this plussed sativa dominant strain.  It is known as a very spacey, creative strain that is great at relieving stress, cramps, and tension to create an ideal head put to other tasks than those one might be doing.\u000a\u000a\u000a I will be very good interested in taking two ounce to our setup to produce Cannabis Rosin in a 25K pound press with 600 watt plates above and below.  I am right proud to be one of the three that designed this product, of which we are already producing for sales of this machine.
