VHas a strong smell, although I&#39;m not a fan of the smell I do think it tastes amazing through my desktop vaporizer. Uplifting your spirits while relaxing your body, great way to relax while still staying awake and conscious. I found this strain to have an easy to function and communicate high and did minor muscle relaxing which my back was happy about.

VAfter grinding this strain up the smell reminded me of a really good cheesecake. Incredible, pleasant, very pronounced aroma.\u000aAfter firing this pretty strain up I got hit with  a spicy but almost sweet flavor and finished with a hint of earthy goodness. Very smooth...very pleasant smoke.\u000a The elevation is subtle but also focusing. Euphoria creeps up slowly but I would not call the buzz here super intense. A nice mellow ride.

VSuper smooth with a pleasant powerful full body kick. Purchased 5gr and I wish I had more as it sold out super fast. Definitely hits the head first with a nice euphoria flowing over the body soon after. No paranoia/anxiety and a very nice happy uplifting buzz. I will definitely get more when available. Certainly helps depression

VVapourized in the pax 2; \u000aSmells cheesey and subtle tastes of chocolate on the exhale.\u000aShared with brother-in law and he was overwhelmed with the taste. Good for conversation, getting deep into creative work - not recommended if you want to lounge around watching movies.\u000aOne of my favourite sativas so far!

VThis might be my favourite sativa but definitely in my top 3. Great euphoric yet energetic boost. Keeps head clear and lets my body get to work. Awesome daytime strain. I&#39;d buy this again and again.

VI wanted to love it. I really did. This is the only strain that got me aroused and SUPER euphoric, but I cannot get over the taste! It literally made me vomit once. Everything else is fine but the taste, however that is a big factor for me.

VThis is one of my favorite afternoon strains. The energy rises quickly with a focused euphoria and light relaxing body feel. If this strain were a band, it would be Black Sabbath. You can sense the UK Cheese uplifting, misty-ness. The Chocolope aspect might be responsible for the focused, sharpening visual effect. Great for playing live music, or something like Magic: The Gathering. &#128517; The energy is best channeled into some creative activity. The energy rides out into a chill cozy flannel vibe, perfect for cuddling  with your cat and/or partner.
