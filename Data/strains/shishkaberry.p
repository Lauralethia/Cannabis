VI am a Diesel lover at heart but Shish has won me over in a big way. I would have to say without a doubt that this is my favorite strain to date. I don&#39;t usually chase strains based on how they treat stress, insomnia, etc but if you are looking to quell any of those conditions this is the bud for you. As the name suggests, it has a very berry flavor but a lil earthy too. You will feel the sativa effects of this strain first with energy, creativity, and lust to be social. But when the Indica side kicks in, grab some popcorn and a movie and a chill buddy and enjoy the evening.

VSmell is amazing . Gives off such an earthy smell. Yet so sweet. The colors definitely come in right for the greenery it brings. I found this little buddy in Collective Efforts in Sacramento. One of the Berner cookie franchises. Testing the smoke-ability out now. First hit....brings a misty cloudy haze. Bringing me to a fruity taste. My endorphins for happiness just set off. Second hit....eased a pain I was feeling in my jaw. Third hit....I think I got a lazy eye.

VTonite after a 3 hour walk/hike looking for Pokemon at Mt. Tabor I\u2019m winding down with Shishkaberry. This is the strongest indica I\u2019ve used to date! Mine tested at 24.94% THC and .04% CBD. This one truly makes you feel \u201cstoned\u201d as opposed to \u201chigh\u201d. My head feels heavy and my eyes feel puffy and red just like all the stoner cartoons, and I\u2019m very relaxed. I used this briefly twice and it put me to sleep both times.\u000a\u000aI\u2019m more awake tonite, so I can finally experience and review it. Shishkaberry smells and tastes good, like pine and frosted winter berry. It\u2019s a hard hitter and I highly recommend this one for people who have insomnia. I give this strain full marks because of this medicinal potential, as it really can send me easily to sleep and I\u2019m now a seasoned stoner. It\u2019s not a romantic journey like Blue Chunk or Ultra Violet, but it gets you to Slumberland fast and sometimes that\u2019s what you need!

VInteresting strain. A complex blend of indica/sativa qualities. The sample I have is medium green with dark red hairs everywhere. The bud is very tightly packed with every surface coated in resin. The taste is earthy with a purple undertone. The effects start within three minutes with slight sativa spaciness, but also an indica body tug. My nausea was complexly resolved but this strain had a low munchie factor for me. Although the pain relief effects are good, this strain didn&#39;t force my eyes closed. I was still a able to get up and get some things done, although a little more slowly. Good afternoon strain after the hard part of the day. This strain is compatible with sleep but doesn&#39;t force it. Recommended for nausea, stress, anxiety, pain. -sy

VShiskaberry ia an Indica dominant hybrid that has a sweet and earthy flavour and smell.  One of the medical issues I have is insomnia, so this strain not only tasted delicious, but it also helped me fall asleep and sleep well.   When the high first hit me it really mellowed out my mood, allowing me to feel less anxious so I could actually relax.  Once the relaxation hit in, it only took about 30 minutes for me to be asleep on the couch.  Delicious strain and one that I always try to have on hand.

VLooks: Sticky stuff and medium density.  Nugs are a bit leafy but covered in frost with sparse orange pistils.  Many shades of purple decorate these buds from violet to lavender.  In fact, these nugs look like they were painted by Monet.  Amazing colors!\u000a\u000aSmell: Pungent and fruity.  A bit like berries and mango.  Stinky stuff for sure.\u000a\u000aTaste: Sweet berry flavor that lingered.\u000a\u000aBuzz Type: Somewhat weighty and heavy body high with a super relaxing head high.  I found Shishkaberry to resemble a good muscle relaxant.\u000a\u000aBuzz Length: Medium.  Up to 1.5 hours.\u000a\u000aOverall: It ever have great bag appeal!  I found this strain to be OH SO RELAXING!  In all honesty, this was some very visually pleasing bud, but there was nothing that stood out aside from that.\u000a

VShishkaberry is listed as an indica and I agree with that, with a THC of 23%. Preroll smoked well.\u000a\u000aThe high was a nice mellow that I usually get from strains with blueberry in them and also a nice amount of pain relief for me. Its made me want to take a nap.\u000a\u000aTaste is like sweet berry or a slight blueberry which is pretty spot on for the strain.

Its a regular thing when the heat gets turned upon me that I practically cannot function. Especially on a really highly detailed section.... \u000aAfter a bowl of &quot;Kish&quot; aka Shishkaberry, a few minutes later and &quot;Goliath&quot; was now mini-mouse!

I started noticing after two weeks that it took more and more to get any feeling of relief of my symptoms. It took more and more. Tonight smoked 4.5 bowls by myself and nothing. Nada, Zero, Zilche.

VPicked up a Select Elite 1g cart from Hi Cascade in Astoria Ore. I&#39;m a daily smoker so I have a tolerance. That being said. The taste is great if you&#39;re a berry lover. The overall effects were mild. Mostly just made me hungry at first. A little talkative and then relaxed. Not bad. 1 blunt up!

VWhen I tried this strain it was in a co2 cartridge. I loved the wonderful taste . It as been one of my all time favorites . I still haven&#39;t had a chance to try it in flower form. I know that when I do I will most definitely enjoy that moment. It took care of relaxing my muscles, which allowed my bone pain to lighten up and get the relief I so desperately need. I love this strain. I would love to learn to grow. This would be one strain I would choose. It helps me so much. I recommend this strain if you have Fibromyalgia , issues with Crones &amp; Hep C, and PTSD. I seriously was amazed at how much &amp; how well it has helped me and continues to when I can find this strain. like I said I would love to grow this one because it helps me that much .maybe it can help you as well.

I somehow managed to get a lot of homework done in a short amount of time after burning this... writing came naturally. Painted, then i crashed on the couch cuddled and watched reruns of my favorite daily shows before drifting off into stoned slumber. Very Nice, not knock you off your a$$ potent; but it certainly gets the job done.

VMy dad uses medical marijuana for cluster headaches and I had been told it would be a good night time strain so I was really excited for him to try it before bed tonight. Unfortunately, it seems to be having the opposite effect on him. He says he&#39;s tired, but he feels talkative and energetic at the same time. But it&#39;s a good body high and he&#39;s enjoying the buzz, so  I guess that evens it out!

VCouldn&#39;t get a sativa this last pick-up, so I was given this instead. Just reinforces why I don&#39;t like indica-dominant strains. While it is relaxing, it burns poorly (or maybe it&#39;s just my back-up papers) and leaves me super fogged. It also has zero (or negative) effects on my migraines/headaches. Definitely not a strain for me. Hopefully next paycheck I can grab some more Panama Red. :D

VPicked up a couple grams of Shiskaberry bubble hash and it was a little bit more expensive than the other variety I usually get. Needless to say, I expected it to be better. It tastes very very spicy and diesely, but it is a taste that is also very fruity and hashy. The smoke is especially harsh compared to other bubble hash I&#39;ve smoked and it is sort of painful to smoke by itself. I&#39;d rate this hash higher otherwise. It bubbles a little bit before shrinking rapidly and melting into the bowl before turning very dark and smoking. It works quite well on top of bud compared to just by itself. The effects I get are light, energetic, and merry. It worked well for me as a social-use strain and it seemed to pick up the mood of everyone around me. Not very much of a body high, but a adventurous mind high with just enough tingling to let you know its presence. Worked exceptionally well for a hangover cure, Lol.

VClear kush nose and aftertaste.  Great to enjoy with food! Superb bag appeal with dense and frosty nuggets.  \u000a\u000aOnset is quick with present head change, anxiety melts away. Slight pressure in the back of the head to the nape of the neck, but not unpleasant. Clarity is remarkable: I feel focused and energized.  Definitely pick this up if for your medicine cabinet! ;)

VAgain, found it average, i dont normally like the fruity berry type strains, i dont know the fruity berry strains always remind me of old fruit in paper lunch bags. Anyways, of all the berry strains ive tried, i thought this one actually smelled delicious. The effects were ok, i was definitely more impressed with this than the ATF. Didnt burn me out too bad either for an indica. Heavy on the eyes though i found. Would try it again but again, i generally dont choose fruity berry strains. All in all, if youre into the berry stuff, hit this up. If youre not, give it a try anyways, it will change your mind a bit about them. Average. 3-3.5. Not the greatest, but not a waste of money either.
