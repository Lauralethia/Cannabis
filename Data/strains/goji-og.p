VWow\u000aI&#39;m a very spoiled man, and this baby treated me right!\u000aAs the name implies, it tastes JUST like Goji berries, friggin delicious! \u000aAdd giggles, happiness, and overall euphoria. \u000a\u000aI&#39;m not too big on sativa&#39;s, because they give me anxiety, but this strain is on point. Seriously, just smoke some.

VGoji OG  is my absolute favorite morning smoke I have ever experienced. Super clear headed Sativa with strong aroma from a sour sweetness. Given that it is a very high THC level Sativa, mixing with something on the Indica side can definitely hit you with a relaxed, funny, go to bed feeling.

VGOJI OG. Snow Lotus X Nepali. Sativa dominant hybrid. Goji is known for toting an astronomically high thc%, 30.6% in my case.When Goji appears he looks a glimmering green to forest green with a darkish hue, short orange hair, covered in blankets of primetime crystals.\u000aGoji smacks of berry, cherry and anise.\u000aAt 30.6%thc 0.07cbd you guessed right If you thought that a little of this goes a looooong way. Despite the powerful high, it provides a fairly clear-headed, energetic, and talkative feelings. Euphoric, possibly arousing.\u000aShout out to Oregon&#39;s Finest for some tremendous Goji OG.\u000a#BLAZETHENUGS

VI am not a fan of this strain for personal reasons, my wife loves it but for me it makes me very anxious and a feeling of paranoia. For her it makes her feel relaxed and able to get things done. For me I don\u2019t like to be around anyone other than my wife. She\u2019s the only one I can talk to without getting the anxious feeling. I have to say though that the following morning I wake up feeling so refreshed and in a great mood so that is a huge benefit and the reason I tried it again. But I believe this strain is not for me

The buds are thick and solid with a dark green color and heavy orange hairs this strain is perfect for pain,realization, and also for depression this strain has been the best one I&#39;ve had so far and that means a lot all around the taste is amazing it&#39;s like a black cherry taste the best wraps to use if you use any would be the white owls blue raspberry the taste will have u speechless #618stonernation

VGoji OG offers a very interesting and explosive high.  I mostly prefer indica leaning hybrids but this is an excellent strain which I recommend.  I was interested in trying a vape pen and upon seeing this on the local Reef Dispensary menu as a disposable pen (for a great price!) and reading the strain reviews, this was an obvious choice.  I read some vape articles and the idea of efficiency and discreetness intrigued me.  Due to this efficiency as well as believing that my first pull was not effective, I took a bigger pull and boy oh boy, besides hacking up a lung (getting over a sore throat didn&#39;t help me here) an instantaneous cerebral high ensued.  Spacey with a little paranoia but not too bad.  Bubblegum is my favorite strain and it produces a slightly stronger sense of paranoia in my opinion but once it passes it&#39;s a very pleasing high.  Goji OG became quite psychoactive and had borderline hallucinating effects at times.  It made  me aroused as well.  This strain was my introduction to vaping and I can&#39;t wait to revisit this one again soon.

I was interested in trying a vape pen and upon seeing this on the local Reef Dispensary menu as a disposable pen (for a great price!) and reading the strain reviews, this was an obvious choice.  I read some vape articles and the idea of efficiency and discreetness intrigued me.  Due to this efficiency as well as believing that my first pull was not effective, I took a bigger pull and boy oh boy, besides hacking up a lung (getting over a sore throat didn&#39;t help me here) an instantaneous cerebral high ensued.  Spacey with a little paranoia but not too bad.  Bubblegum is my favorite strain and it produces a slightly stronger sense of paranoia in my opinion but once it passes it&#39;s a very pleasing high.  Goji OG became quite psychoactive and had borderline hallucinating effects at times.  It made  me aroused as well.  This strain was my introduction to vaping and I can&#39;t wait to revisit this one again soon.

VThis is a really nice strain I noticed that their really dense, and has a huge pungent smell coming from it, so it\u2019s not very good if your trying to hide it or mask the smell. After I took one hit I was amazed that it almost had two different flavors. When I inhaled I would taste like a fruity punch or Hawaiian Punch, and exhaled a taste of black licorice. On a scale of 1-10 I\u2019d give a solid 8

VI am not a fan of this strain for personal reasons, my wife loves it but for me it makes me very anxious and a feeling of paranoia. For her it makes her feel relaxed and able to get things done. For me I don\u2019t like to be around anyone other than my wife. She\u2019s the only one I can talk to without getting the anxious feeling. I have to say though that the following morning I wake up feeling so refreshed and in a great mood so that is a huge benefit and the reason I tried it again. But I believe this strain is not for me

VThis particular strain for me was very enjoyable. My local dispensary has 5 dollar grams on Friday. This in mind I commuted the thirty minute drive and had a little wait with the other friendly stoners. My budtender showed me this strain after hearing what I was looking for, and I decided to grab two grams (only ended up costing 8.50). There is a noticeable earthy flavor, with hints of citrus and lemon. Instantly after my sesh was finished I devoured two paninis and half a bag of chips. Very upbeat high as well. While smoking I suggested my girlfriend play Bohemian Rhapsody, and received the most theatrical (and probably terrible) singalong she\u2019s ever seen, both of us bursting out laughing and taking tokes as we sang along. My first impression was skeptical when I saw a few leaves and stems in the container, but after about a minute of careful plucking and removing excess material I saw a gorgeous trichome covered pile of nugs. 8/10 strain 10/10 fun

VGoji OG definitely should be handled with care. A very potent strain, Goji OG immediately gave be a combination full head and body high, and really helps with my back pain. Completely takes it way (and, hey, look ma, no opiates!). There&#39;s a mild bit of paranoia that happens if the dosage is just a smidge too high (though I&#39;m sensitive to that), but certainly a good strain. I got it in a concentrate cartridge and my dispensary doesn&#39;t add any extra terpenes back in, so the flavor is hard for me to comment upon. It tastes fine, and definitely has a stronger flavor than some others. \u000a\u000aI wasn&#39;t immediately sleepy after taking a full hit from the cartridge, but most definitely relaxed... in an alert sort of way. This would be a great movie-watching strain, again as long as you don&#39;t overdo it on the dosage. Go easy there and you&#39;ll be in great shape.

Vthis has an old school good chronic feel to it.  its a bread and butter strain, reliable strain on average across several pheno types to get the job done.  2 main phenos, one has high production heavy og kush smell and high.  the other leans snow lotus, buds arent as big but still a tasty good high

VTook it as a concentrate in peanut butter and found it to be most enjoyable without being overpowering. The body high allowed for some relief from the pain resulting from my spinal cord injury. I also noticed muscle relaxation at high dosage. Do not attempt this method unless you are a heavy user.  Wax dissolved easily into warm PButter. Plant is gorgeous with big, heavy, spears.

VSince I mostly buy indica strains it was fun for me to pick out a sativa this week, so I went with Goji OG. \u000a\u000aGoji OG smells sweet, like tropical punch with licorice.  Yum! Mine tested out at CBD 1.4% and THC 23.5%.  This Saturday morning I chose to wake and bake with Goji OG and I enjoyed it.\u000a\u000aI wish there was more I could say about Goji OG.  Some on Leafly report that it was an aphrodisiac, which is the main reason I picked it up, but I didn&#39;t find this strain to be any more or less seductive than any other strain.  It smells very nice and has a pleasant head high but nothing really stood out about it to me.  I give it average marks, and since the rest of the strains I have at home are more noteworthy, Goji OG will be what I use with edibles this week.

Vno problems. I was looking for something without the slowness factor of the of the Kush so I switched over to sativa and if you choose the top shelf item at Leafly get the local dispensaries best and I would say this is definitely a change from the Indica you can count on being a little more bright and a little more upbeat don&#39;t quite have the body zone out but that&#39;s what the indicas for I would recommend you get some air freshener because you will have dry eyes The Taste is a little sharper and burns a little bit more dirty but indicud just has especially Savor this burning sensation potatoes just generally do not so that&#39;s okay the effects are a little more rambunctious and you also get to you get less energy draw so you feel like you have more bounce overall I give it 5 stars because it&#39;s really no problem

VSo I have the organic flower and LiveResin. Both are the highest quality you can get the growers and extractors knew what they are doing. It&#39;s smells of earthyberrys and move to a sweet sharp taste. The high is fantastic pretty quick onset and last for couple hours. At higher levels can be good for relaxing and anxiety.  I use this as an all day smoke. Dosnt make you couch locked at the extreme levels and no uneasiness good for first timers and really good for anyone looking for that punch of thc with out the couch lock.

VBy all accounts, I should like Goji OG. It&#39;s a high THC sativa dominant hybrid, usually the keys to success for me. However, after giving it a fair shot for the past week or two, I must conclude that, for me at least, Goji OG fell flat: smoking brought all the physical effects of intoxication without any of the joy. There&#39;s no euphoria with this strain, no mood lift. For pain and other medical conditions, I can see how this could be good medicine. But for someone like me who is primarily looking for mood uplift - I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to pass. This strain is, however, gloriously sticky.
