VGreat flavor with ridiculous after taste that tricks you into think you just smoked a fire bowl (but actually you just dabbed some fire). One of the most unique waxes I&#39;ve ever hit with noticeably two tastes, the foretaste and aftertaste, both complimenting one another in the long haul.

VThis Cat 5 cannabis was my very first introduction to the herb. While riding shotgun on a road trip I proceeded to get slingshot into an alternate plane\u000a of euphoria. Slowly each part of my body grew lighter and lighter until it felt as if I was flying just above the seat in a landscape that resembled the old windows space screensaver as we cruised through the city. 4 hours later I began to descend gaining both a new respect and perspective on life as with this strain you have no choice but to confront your demons because once you hit this you aren&#39;t moving any time soon so relax get ready for the journey and put aside some you time.

VI may be a bit biased but Bubba has always been a top favorite for its unique serene high that is a fusion of both body numbness and mind alertness. This is accompanied with a sense of peace and balance that is typical of anti-anxiety kushes. The addition of Platinum OG for me amplifies the mind warp PBK offers by complimenting the intensely powerful body high. Awesome shatter smelled like a musky forest and the taste was very clean pine. \u000a\u000aPirates ye be warned! PBK is a creeper just as any version of our beloved Bubba!

VI think PB is okay... Not for me I am thinking. My experiences with PB is, It&#39;s very low to a maybe mild high; I am extremely sensitive to medication. PB does give me a head high; I am able to think well with it too with my body it does some slowing down to my energy. It makes me wake up, focus hard and I am thinking much more or not enough in the right direction. PB also makes me a lil lazy. It will take a bit more focus and discipline to get up and to do even a small action. It did kill a lot of my stomach pain and back pain. I did get a lil headache coming down off of it. I would need to take another strain with PB than just PB by its self. ^_^!!\u000a\u000aRainBow23

V*Review for Katsu Bubba Kush*\u000aPurple hued nugs, frosty from stem to leaf. Strong purps/og aroma with a taste of deep berry to match. Great smoke, smooth with a spice taste of holidays almost, the good kush pine flavor! The best part is the after taste creeps of bubblegum really bring heritage to its parents. Truly a delectable treat, and with a high that creeps before the bowl is finished it often leaves patients quite medicated. Became a favorite after just half a gram, and Bubba was never one to truly impress me... so that should say something.\u000a4.5/5

V*Review for Katsu Bubba Kush*\u000aPurple hued nugs, frosty from stem to leaf. Strong purps/og aroma with a taste of deep berry to match. Great smoke, smooth with a spice taste of holidays almost, the good kush pine flavor! The best part is the after taste creeps of bubblegum really bring heritage to its parents. Truly a delectable treat, and with a high that creeps before the bowl is finished it often leaves patients quite medicated. Became a favorite after just half a gram, and Bubba was never one to truly impress me... so that should say something.\u000a4.5/5

VI smoke pretty often but after 2 hits of this from a gravity bong I was basically half dead. Good shit but don&#39;t underestimate its power cause if you smoke too much you&#39;ll fall asleep.

This is a beautifully dense Frosty pungent flower that emits that jet fueled earthy aroma ,with a bit of piney and creamy undertones. Be warned a lil goes a long way.   If u revel in the flavor profiles of different strains then i highly recommend a dry herb vaporizer, Sit back relax and enjoy the ride.  &#128526;

VJust got some of this strain and it was so good that my plug didn&#39;t even want to give it up at first.  It smells particularly pungent and is really dense and riddled with kief.  It&#39;s definitely a creeper high, you can feel a deep subtle high set in when you first take a hit that slowly expands and envelops you over the next 15-20 minutes.  Good strain for people who ration weed, I am a daily smoker and less than a bowl of this gets me lifted for 2-3 hours. \u000a Very relaxing and puts me in a great mood, no anxiety or anything at all.  Overall this is a top-shelf indica, the kush of the kush, that has a ton of kief.  The smoke tastes great too.  Definitely one of my 2 or 3 favorite strains out of the ~25 I have tried.

Vone of the best buds I&#39;ve tried yet it&#39;s a little bit more stronger than the regular bubba kush and it&#39;s helps extremely with ptsd and anxiety and also depression and hunger  which I have very bad anxiety which chills me out to where I can interact more with people other than being spaced out if I could I&#39;d get this damn near every time. It also makes you eat a massive amount of food which I wouldn&#39;t stick with it forever or you may end up overweight .

VThis may be one of my  top 5. I am a fan of the purple distinctive &#127815; flavor. But also a fan of the fact that this flower itself is predominantly bright green! The amount of kief accumulated after crushing with my fingers on the joint paper was astounding! Great earthy grape fuel tone flavor wonderful!  It\u2019s vary relaxing and a sleepy flower but as u can tell it\u2019s eurphuic effects are of a land race and in my opinion, top notch genetics

VVery strong strain for me. Average tasting bud although very smooth to smoke, you just want to keep going. You feel yourself getting stoned then all of a sudden you&#39;ll be a good old ten. Creeper which is nice because you know it&#39;s coming which makes the wait very exciting. Wasn&#39;t very thoughtful with this strain but one of the best for giving body tingle and body relaxation. Average for the munchies and average paranoia but got the worst dry mouth I&#39;ve ever had. Lasts for a good 3 hours make sure you have a drink on stand by. Nice strain 5/5

VJust got some of this strain and it was so good that my plug didn&#39;t even want to give it up at first.  It smells particularly pungent and is really dense and riddled with kief.  It&#39;s definitely a creeper high, you can feel a deep subtle high set in when you first take a hit that slowly expands and envelops you over the next 15-20 minutes.  Good strain for people who ration weed, I am a daily smoker and less than a bowl of this gets me lifted for 2-3 hours. \u000a Very relaxing and puts me in a great mood, no anxiety or anything at all.  Overall this is a top-shelf indica, the kush of the kush, that has a ton of kief.  The smoke tastes great too.  Definitely one of my 2 or 3 favorite strains out of the ~25 I have tried.

Vvery dense, frosty, buds with a very nice sour smell. the high was a bit of a let down and all it did was get me mildly relaxed, and not even in a very euphoric level. I&#39;ve been smoking lots of good afgoo lately and it&#39;s been messing with how much I can appreciate other indicas, but overall this strain is okay, especially for late day time use.

As soon as your turn in rotation is up you count the seconds till its back in your hand... when finished you are hit by the euphoric energetic high which allows you to function but be warned!! As soon as you stop and get on the couch that&#39;s it!! Your not moving unless it&#39;s to eat/drink/laugh. Deep thoughtful high aswell and a great nights sleep is offered by this strain!! 5/5 great strain

VFirst time with this strain and not disappointing, comes on slow but once dug in this Kush stands out as smooth and blissful. This will quickly be my evening strain of choice because of the gentle but potent cerebral high. Not for newbies ;because of its slow climb you can hit this too much too fast and nighty night ... just sayin

VVery strong strain for me. Average tasting bud although very smooth to smoke, you just want to keep going. You feel yourself getting stoned then all of a sudden you&#39;ll be a good old ten. Creeper which is nice because you know it&#39;s coming which makes the wait very exciting. Wasn&#39;t very thoughtful with this strain but one of the best for giving body tingle and body relaxation. Average for the munchies and average paranoia but got the worst dry mouth I&#39;ve ever had. Lasts for a good 3 hours make sure you have a drink on stand by. Nice strain 5/5

VThis stuff is really good but the taste is my only complaint. Coming from a LOVER of the amazing taste of bubba kush, there is less of a fruitiness to it and more of an earthy kushiness; some might prefer this but i love fruity flowers. i give it an even 4.5 over all.

VGot a little bit of this to try out , as I am always searching for a Spectacular Indica. \u000aThis particular strain was grown by : Thompson Farm One  ( a producer that I am trying for the 1st time ) \u000aOne thing that was &quot; OFF &quot; - it was harvested on 3-1-16 Final test date was 3-10-16 &#128077;&#127996; BUT ... Packaged on 6-9-19 and I bought it on 6/26 !! &#128556; \u000aSo ~ of course it was dry ! \u000aI did a Sunday am wake and bake - 3 bowls - it creeped up on me &#128516; and before I knew it , I was sleeping &#128522;&#128164;&#128164;&#128164; \u000aIt turned out to be a pretty unproductive day. Although , when you are sick .. sometimes that&#39;s exactly what you are seeking !  \u000aEven though this was dry - I would buy more . Actually I will just keep an eye out for same strain , different producer &#128516;\u270c&#127997;\ufe0f

VThanks to Leafly reviews, I usually have a good sense of what to expect when trying new medicine. So thanks to all you reviewers out there for helping this newbie navigate the medical cannabis landscape. \u000a\u000aThat said, for whatever reason, Platinum Bubba Kush have me an unexpected experience. I picked up a couple of pre rolls from NETA Northampton. At 24% ish, and smoking this time instead of vaping (smoking for me usually results in a more intense effect), I prepared to be blown away and have a nice chill evening then melt into dreamland.  Nope. Paradoxical effect on me. Don&#39;t get me wrong it was a nice experience, just wish I hadn&#39;t tried it so late in the day. Mellow but very alert and focused. Dare I say peppy? Not sleepy at all. No paranoia. No munchies (yay!), but not the full relaxation and heaviness I was looking for in this indica. It&#39;s cool, I lay very relaxed listening to music for a while and that was awesome. Taste of the flower was OK, nothing stand-out. Since it was a preroll I cannot comment on the appearance of the bud. Could be a good wake and bake strain, think I will go that route next time. I&#39;m also looking forward to vaping it as maybe that will give me the heavy body feeling I was hoping for. \u000a\u000aBottom line: hit me more like a hybrid or sativa than the heavy hitting Indica I thought I had purchased. I would buy it again, but I can tell it&#39;s not going to be a favorite. Isn&#39;t it funny how now that we have so many choices we get particular? I mean, before MA legalized medical I would  have smoked this and been thrilled.
