VLemon Thai not only pleasing to the eye but the aroma from this strain is incredible: it&#39;s a fresh tangy yet sweet scent.  Whether smoked from a vaporizer or from a joint the zesty lemon taste is delicious.  This is a great strain with high THC that will surely deliver a great high.  Although, it should be noted the effects from the indica side of the plant will make you tired, so it may not be the best choice for during the day.

VVintage sativa (borderline landrace - it&#39;s parents are Thai and Hawaii, though most specimens now will have been genetically modified for stability and cannabinoid augmentation) that will give you a swift psycho-somatic buzz that hones in on cerebral drifting ... at the same it loosens up the body and provides a nice wind of euphoric energy. Very popular in LA amongst the cannabis hip.

VI got a Cannamas present from a patient friend a Lemon Citrus strain and for someone who grew Lemon Skunk, Lemon Burmese and Lemon Blueberry.  But this Medical Cannabis Patient has never had Lemon Thai a Dutch Masters Sativa dominant strain.  This stain arose when A Maui Wowie was crossed with Thai Stick.  Thai and Burmese genetics have always had a prominent place in all of the gardons that I grew.   I happen to really love a Citrus blast in the mornings to get this wheelchair body a grooving.\u000a\u000aThis strain I can recommend to any one seeking A creative, euphoric, energizing, very focused strain for use they would not regret it.\u000a\u000aMorning strains have to be for most of us some strains that literally ease us into our days  as obosed to some more cloying strains.

VNow This is a Perfect morning strain that is a serious contender for overall powerful effects as well as one the most lemony citrous bowl I have come across since the days of Lemon Skunk that I grew in the Canadian West. This 50/50 Sativa Indica Hybrid super tasting strain was bred from Hawaiian and Thai genetics to create this fine Cannabis with surprising force to its length of medicinal effects.

VI&#39;ve been smoking this for over a month. I wanted something that would make me feel sharp and active. This didn&#39;t quite do it for me. It starts off a little intense, even at a couple of hits from a glass bowl. When doing this alone, it kinda gets me in my head a bit and gives a little anxiety,\u000aespecially at the beginning of the high. However, it has been a good weed when sharing with others or in more social situations.

VThis strain has a nice lemony aroma. One of the nicest smelling strains I&#39;ve ever come across for sure, especially once it&#39;s ground.\u000aI couldn&#39;t taste the lemon when I smoked it, but it tasted very earthy, fresh and smooth.\u000aAfter I smoked it I felt a little baked but nothing crazy. Really glad I didn&#39;t smoke more because it had me on my ass 15 minutes later. Crazy strong creeper weed, but I love it.

VI got a Cannamas present from a patient friend a Lemon Citrus strain and for someone who grew Lemon Skunk, Lemon Burmese and Lemon Blueberry.  But this Medical Cannabis Patient has never had Lemon Thai a Dutch Masters Sativa dominant strain.  This stain arose when A Maui Wowie was crossed with Thai Stick.  Thai and Burmese genetics have always had a prominent place in all of the gardons that I grew.   I happen to really love a Citrus blast in the mornings to get this wheelchair body a grooving.\u000a\u000aThis strain I can recommend to any one seeking A creative, euphoric, energizing, very focused strain for use they would not regret it.\u000a\u000aMorning strains have to be for most of us some strains that literally ease us into our days  as obosed to some more cloying strains.

VSmells of citrus and tastes like a mellow lemon tea. The batch that I got my flower from must have had a low THC percentage as it takes a larger quantity to feel the psychoactive effects however after smoking my mood was elevated and I became super chatty.

VNow This is a Perfect morning strain that is a serious contender for overall powerful effects as well as one the most lemony citrous bowl I have come across since the days of Lemon Skunk that I grew in the Canadian West. This 50/50 Sativa Indica Hybrid super tasting strain was bred from Hawaiian and Thai genetics to create this fine Cannabis with surprising force to its length of medicinal effects.
