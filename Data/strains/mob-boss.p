VGreat strain! Effects are amazing for those looking for nicely balanced effects. The batch I got from the dispensary was testing at 27%, and had a pretty intense head high so new users should dose with caution. After the psychoactive boost (that does wonders for mood elevation) it just eases you down into relaxation thanks to the indica side. Versatile well rounded strain. Also I found that the indica side does great for anxiety and raciness that sometimes rises from more pure sativas. Really I can&#39;t say enough about this strain, if you have the chance to try this tasty treat please do so. If you suffer from mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or ocd, I would recommend this strain. just watch that potency

VI both love and hate this strain. First off its pretty potent, it is true that a little bit goes a long way with this. Yet while the intensity is quite strong it doesn&#39;t last that long for me. As for what I love about this strain, ironically (because I usually like indica&#39;s more), is the sativa-like effect. The distinct energetic, happy, euphoric, contented and uplifting effect of this plant is very lovable. However, again ironically I don&#39;t like the indica-like effect with this strain, not after such a nice happy sativa rush. The indica after effect is kinda sedating and unfocused in an annoying way for the day time. While the sativa-like effects are happy, clear and focused, the indica-like effects are apathy, ADD, and sedation. It is almost depressing when the sativa goes away! \u000a\u000aSo I&#39;m stuck with a love hate relationship with this strain. It definitely makes me want to try Chemdawg or whatever sativa strain most influenced the initial effects. In fact I need to try out more sativa strains in general.

VI&#39;ve been smoking on Mob boss for almost a month now, and all that I can say is this weed is outstanding, the nugs are very dense and full of crystals. This strain specifically gets me on another level, if I smoke a bowl by myself, I literally feel like I&#39;m floating. Mob boss makes everything extremely funny yet very relaxing. If you&#39;re not used to smoking sativa dominant strains, there&#39;s a possibility that this strain might bring out some paranoia, just be aware of your intake. Personally, I really enjoy smoking on this strain, it&#39;s great to smoke anytime of the day, including before bed. A mob boss kief blunt is a must if you decide to go on a hike. This is an awesome strain and I would recommend it for everyone! :) stay high \u270c&#127996;\u270c&#127996;\u270c&#127996;

VMob Boss is certainly a boss among sativa dominant hybrids. This strains buds were fluffy and had a light green color. Aromas consisted of a sweet diesel mixture that proves its lineage of Chemdawg. A strong citrus flavor makes this a favorite among sativa enthusiasts. The effects were mood enlightening and made the &quot;circle&quot; all laugh and enjoy each others presence! Recommended with great friends. Enjoy!

VHybrids rule my world and Mob Boss does not disappoint!  MB is like playing Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald on a snowy night while eating a home cooked meal in front of the fire....ok, perhaps just for me but this strain is euphoric and super happy!  Great for cleaning the house or checking boxes on a long list of things to do.  MB is a great appetite stimulant and perfect for after a stressful day at work.

VI&#39;m not much of a Hybrid fan. However Mob Boss has changed my opinion on that. Upon lighting up my bowl of Mob boss I could right away taste the hint of the Tang Tang and the ChemDawg. The high was cerebral to start then worked it&#39;s way over my body without that &quot;sleepy relaxing&quot; feeling. If you&#39;re hesitant to try Sativa&#39;s due to the &quot;high anxiety&quot; feeling you&#39;re likely to get then I&#39;d suggest starting off with this as a tester and work your way up from here. \u000a\u000aYou can&#39;t go wrong with Mob Boss out of a pipe, bong, or even a joint. Just a word of warning it is a high resinous strain so you&#39;d do very well to clean your bowl, pipe after a long smoke session.

VThe flower is light green, and so thickly coated in crystals that it honestly looks like moon rocks. Raw flowers smell of earth and pine. Smoked taste is mild, and along the same lines. The effects are almost immediate, and STRONG. I started remembering ludicrous things that have happened to me, and giggling about them. And I felt creative enough to start making up new ludicrous things. I also get an energetic kick out of this. I had it with a cup of coffee, and the combination was almost too much for me, so I guess it\u2019s a bit jittery.

VMob Boss is one of my favorite hybrid strains. I&#39;ve re-named it &quot;The Mob-tivator&quot; (get it? lol I&#39;m hilarious).\u000a\u000aFirst, it begins with the unwinding step. The first puff made my nervous system literally decompress. Like an iron straightens a cloth, it erased any knotted feeling I could have in my body. \u000aNow, in order to get the most out of this strain, you should have a task at hand, because this baby will put you to work! What happens with Mob Boss is that it enables mental clarity and drive above everything else. So you begin to focus, almost like in a &quot;tunnel vision&quot; way, making everything on the horizon achievable. \u000a\u000aBecause of these, I recommend it to anyone with general Anxiety / Depression related issues, that often get in the way when you&#39;re trying to be productive. Also any ADD/ADHD homies or anyone who wants to improve their concentration, focus, and drive. With the mild relaxant effect is also a good daytime option for Fibromyalgia patients who are in a &quot;daily discomfort&quot; zone, but not too far gone with the pain. Also, try it before or during exercise sessions (or after, why not?). Trust me, you&#39;ll be able to complete that 45 min. work out session for the first time in your life! \u000a\u000aThe only downside I&#39;ve perceived with it is that it can tend to give you a mild headache that goes away within minutes. So if you suffer from chronical migraines or want to use this to soothe them, this is not your best choice. Also, it leaves you thirsty AF, so try to have water near you whenever you consume it. Besides, we all have to drink a little bit more water right? Help your kidneys! \u000aMob Boss doesn&#39;t really activate the munchies, so if you want something to stimulate your appetite, this is not for you. Then again, if you are looking for something that doesn&#39;t necessarily make you eat your whole pantry, this is a perfect choice. \u000a\u000aIn conclusion, when you need to feel relaxed enough to get the job done,  Mob Boss is &quot;an offer you can&#39;t refuse&quot; (Like The Godfather, get it? I&#39;m on fire... )

VMob Boss is one of my favorite hybrid strains. I&#39;ve re-named it &quot;The Mob-tivator&quot; (get it? lol I&#39;m hilarious).\u000a\u000aFirst, it begins with the unwinding step. The first puff made my nervous system literally decompress. Like an iron straightens a cloth, it erased any knotted feeling I could have in my body. \u000aNow, in order to get the most out of this strain, you should have a task at hand, because this baby will put you to work! What happens with Mob Boss is that it enables mental clarity and drive above everything else. So you begin to focus, almost like in a &quot;tunnel vision&quot; way, making everything on the horizon achievable. \u000a\u000aBecause of these, I recommend it to anyone with general Anxiety / Depression related issues, that often get in the way when you&#39;re trying to be productive. Also any ADD/ADHD homies or anyone who wants to improve their concentration, focus, and drive. With the mild relaxant effect is also a good daytime option for Fibromyalgia patients who are in a &quot;daily discomfort&quot; zone, but not too far gone with the pain. Also, try it before or during exercise sessions (or after, why not?). Trust me, you&#39;ll be able to complete that 45 min. work out session for the first time in your life! \u000a\u000aThe only downside I&#39;ve perceived with it is that it can tend to give you a mild headache that goes away within minutes. So if you suffer from chronical migraines or want to use this to soothe them, this is not your best choice. Also, it leaves you thirsty AF, so try to have water near you whenever you consume it. Besides, we all have to drink a little bit more water right? Help your kidneys! \u000aMob Boss doesn&#39;t really activate the munchies, so if you want something to stimulate your appetite, this is not for you. Then again, if you are looking for something that doesn&#39;t necessarily make you eat your whole pantry, this is a perfect choice. \u000a\u000aIn conclusion, when you need to feel relaxed enough to get the job done,  Mob Boss is &quot;an offer you can&#39;t refuse&quot; (Like The Godfather, get it? I&#39;m on fire... )

VThis strain hits quick, but don&#39;t let the first five minutes fool you. The strain is high in THC, and will give you a calm , clearheaded , happy cerebral high. I got this strain with a 21% THC, and I was pretty high within the first 10 minutes. Good for depression, lack of appetite, pain, and insomnia. I would say this hybrid lays more on the indica side of things, but there is some good head high in there too. Wouldn&#39;t recommend to first time users, and one more thing. Make sure you bring some eye drops. You&#39;ll need them.

VLove this strain. With a name like Mob Boss, you would expect it to hit you super hard and heavy. Not the case for me. A nice easy going high that makes me feel happy with no paranoia. I have been trying hybrids and Indicas that claim to give you the same effects, but for whatever reason Indicas get me &quot;too high&quot;, or they have a mind numbing effect, which both induce paranoia for me. This strain is exactly what I wanted. It also eases you down into, what I think, is a great night&#39;s sleep. It really is one of the better ones to drift off (and wake up) to. In contrast with something like Bubba Kush, which leaves me groggy as hell. This one I wake up feeling amazing.\u000a\u000atl;DR:  No paranoia, a little energy, calming euphoria, easygoing enough to chill out to, and a great night&#39;s sleep.

VThis neat buds is VERY cerebral, in a fun, stress-free kind of way that is new to me. And I have smoked and swallowed a plethora of good stuff. One funny thing it does is make people want to talk - like, a lot. If one imbibes when no one else is around, one should not be surprised to find oneself chatting up the family pet about how much one likes this weed. Or signing up to Leafly to anonymously testify to the excellence of Mob Boss. I think they call it that because, &quot;It WILL make you talk.&quot; It is &quot;must try&quot; good.

VMob Boss gives you a cloud 9 cerebral high and muscle relaxation that works beautifully as a wake-and-bake. You will feel clear-headed and uplifted. If you can, set your vape on medium-high first to drink the delicious herbal-citrus notes. Then hit it hard on high. You will feel balanced and happy the rest of the day. As a night cap, Mob Boss makes an offer you can&#39;t refuse, not with cement shoes but with angel&#39;s wings.

VA wonderful strain for anyone who loves that feeling of &#39;blasting off&#39; into space with a sativa dom hybrid early in the day (or after work).  This stuff is getting hugely popular in CO (and elsewhere I&#39;m sure) due to it&#39;s strong effects on the mind and long lasting chatty high.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ve had a couple of different samples of Mob Boss and the smell can be wildly different based on the dominance of the cut - ranges from hard to distinguish from Chemdawg (funk/skunk) to fruity/earthy (Tang Tang dominant).  That being said, the extreme density and abundant light colored to medium orange hairs.  Sort of like big oversized sativa nugs on steroids.\u000a\u000aThe effects are quick to come on and very &#39;soaring&#39; mentally - while not being hugely expansive in the lungs or quite as &#39;hammer&#39; like as something like Sour Diesel.  Within a minute or two you have a pulsing head high with some energy and lots of euphoria - after 30 minutes I can feel the high envelop my body as well, providing some stability to the head high but leaving me very social and physically floaty/euphoric.  A great sativa high without the total absence of full strength balance that you sometimes find in pure sativa nug.

VWhen you get your hands on this flower it&#39;s similar to hooking up with a very attractive girl who ends up being a bit of a cold fish in the sack. Absolutely gorgeous flower and dressed to impress, however the high ends up being pretty weak to average. The smoke is a little harsh on the throat too. Overall not bad and it does its job but given a choice you won&#39;t be getting a second date on my dime.

VThe most powerful pot I know is Mb - a CO native fire strain.  My 1/4 from TGS was a single bud.  When ground the Tropical Tang  popped while  Chemdawg controls the taste and incredible high.  Listen to the boss.  ns

VThis is the first strain I&#39;ve purchased on my own, though I&#39;ve been smoking inconsistently for a few years now.. gotta say, it&#39;s pretty dope. Some reviews say it makes them feel energetic but I knock tf out on this strain. Maybe because when I medicate I pack a few bowls? Other than that the only other side effects I noticed were dry eyes, dry mouth, and a massive appetite. I&#39;d buy again
