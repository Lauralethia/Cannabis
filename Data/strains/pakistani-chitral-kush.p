VThis hardy Pakistani indica looks and tastes every bit as fancy as its name.  Boasting big nuggets of crystal coated buds, this is a couch-locker for sure.  Great for sleep and appetite, but don&#39;t plan on going anywhere for a while. Hunker down with Netflix and some Doritos and expect a fun ride.

VDefinitely some potent herb. I smoked it New Year Day with some family &quot;power tokin&#39;&quot; like a muthafucka. One bowl took three of us the highest place you can go, Hyperspace!!! Strong skunky, spicy-sweet taste that&#39;s mellow on the tongue. I got HAF!!! Need more!!!

VLet me start off with saying the strain I bought was Purple Pakistani, but after searching, I found out it was also this strain, Pakistani chiral kush. WOW!!! I might of found my next favorite strain, next to GDP and Ingrid for night time pain relief! There is no roller coaster ride to this one, it slowly sneaks up behind the eyes and your body goes limp and heavy. Sometimes you just want to medicate without the roller coaster ride, this would be that strain! It was nice to lay in bed happy and relaxed!

VVery relaxing, good for pain, and sleep you take more doses. 1 puff is equal to 1 dose. 2 tokes on this strain is perfect for daytime use.\u000aAnything more and couch locked unless your a heavy consumer. I&#39;ve noticed the middle east strains seem to be the best. If you look at the frosted purple crystals under a magnifying glass, you&#39;ll notice the amber color in this batch. This was grown to peek potency with mostly a body high for the effects.\u000aIn conclusion,  this is a 3.8 in my opinion. The lack of CBDs will always take away at least one star. So this is top notch quality and If I didn&#39;t know the benefits of CBD : this strain would be a 4.8 hands down.

Great for relaxing or pain maintenance...I&#39;ve been smoking it semi-regularly for about a month now and REALLY found out its positive effects for pain after having now injured both knees(one rather severely) over the last week and a half. Can&#39;t say enough about this strain

VA subtle, creamy Kush flavour with lots of berry and menthol undertones and a sweet, meditational buzz make this a very unique and coveted plant. \u000a\u000aThe lack of any noticeable sativa influence makes for a very calming, deceptively strong creeper of a buzz. Not necessarily total couch lock, but you won&#39;t want to move too far! \u000a\u000aExtremely enjoyable and delicious.

VThis one of my favorite bedtime strains, it should be called the \u201cvelvet hammer\u201d. It give me a brief feeling of euphoria and a great body high that makes me forget my aching arthritic knees and I typically just lose consciousness without remembering drifting off to sleep. My wife and I actually jokingly refer to it as \u201cPakistani Cunnilingus Kush\u201d; as my wife has aged and after 3 kids she finds oral sex too intense to be enjoyable and can\u2019t relax enough to partake. A few vaps and she says it is like rediscovering that part of herself all over again and I get to pretend I am in my 20\u2019s again!
