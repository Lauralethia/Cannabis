VI acquired some Pure Power Plant buds here in Finland and I must say that I have never smoked anything like this. Our weed is much lower in THC than in the USA, but this strain blew me away. I have low tolerance and just one bowl made me extremely euphoric sending waves of pleasure throughout my body, almost as if I was having dry orgasms. It makes you forget where you actually are and replaces it with some other location, if you get what I&#39;m saying.

VA lot of poorly grown of this stuff around due to how easy it is to have this grown nice with tricombs. Smoking a bit is hard to do cause it has such deliver sweet taste. Nugs can slightly very in colour from light brown go nice and green to absolutely covered in frost. Used to smoke this before j go to class. \u000a\u000aThis spring Montreal experienced an influx of this strain, causing it to be undermined in quality to the minds of too many people basically due to how wash it is to make it frosty. \u000aOne of my old fav strains

VWell... this... this one here. If you like an uplifting high, one that stimulates your cerebral state of mind as well as adding to a body effect that helps round off the back end of this experience, then PPP, or Triple P, or Pure Power Plant is the strain for you. It&#39;s buds are always beautifully green and pungent, and compressed in a way that allow for a large yield when breaking down. After heavy use throughout the day you&#39;ll find the high effect can become somewhat convoluted and although it&#39;s a sativa dominant hybrid strain, you&#39;ll eventually aim for that couch. Don&#39;t worry, this smoke is TERRIFIC for anything day time related and will help you stay wakeful and stimulated in the evening.

VThis is a strain report that I wrote back in 2005 when we last grew Pure Power the African Sativa and North American Indica parentage.  &#39;&#39;This was a very decent 70/30 ratio that was fantastic for the creative process when I had started my first Medical Cannabis documentary shot for Radio Canada by one of their production companies Pimiento. It&#39;s called l&#39;Autre Mari and its about Medical Cannabis here in Quebec for patients under the MMAR programme.  The initial programme run by Health Canada in 1990.  I am one of the first patients in Quebec who was and still am for usage of continual Cannabis use to treat health problemes.\u000a\u000aI was brought this strain by my Legal Grower while I was in hospital recovering from a Double Pneumonia.\u000aI was wheeled outside to a nearby park by Two of my very first Medical Angels.  Their expertise in joint rolling saved my skinny ass a few times until we bolted a Volcano Vapourizer to the floorboards of my girlfriend&#39;s Audi.\u000aWe sure get some knowing glances when we are rolling through traffic.\u000a\u000aThe Pure Power Plant sped along my recovery from said double pneumonia so fast and completely that my Pulmonary Specialist wrote up my recovery in the French Lancet.\u000a\u000aIt is quite euphoric a very sativaesque strain that was half decent for pain too.

VSecond review on sticky cured bud. tasting of sour fruit, smoky and dank this liquid smoke truly poured through a glass bong. Sharp sativa high, turning me loopy, brain wandering off into disjointed racing thoughts. the high is like being smacked by an electric rubber luncheon in the face. body buzz strong and warm, stone keeping me couch locked. enjoyable but more vivid than happy. definitely wake up weed.

VEasily the most seller friendly strain but if you know the right friends you can take advantage of these beautiful tricombs coming and hitting into one of the most versatile strains out there. Smoke a bit and you&#39;ll be happy and feel it hard in your face and eyes (sativa) smoke more of it and you&#39;ll get hit with a lovely full body buzz. The lack of nug denseness is made up for with the heavy coating of tricombs.

VGreat stuff.\u000aDaytime smoke, social high.\u000aIt hits by clearing the thoughts, followed by light positive breeze, and keeps on rolling. Long-lasting high.\u000aNote to young loungs: don&#39;t oversmoke, as your first encounter with this &#39;erb might end up knocking you down for a number of hours.\u000aVery positive thing also, no paranoia from constant smoking. Toleration does go up, but it never gets you edged. As compared to Blue Mystic, Jack Horror or even Blackberry. PPP is awesome stuff.\u000aFinished flowering 66-73 day.\u000aDuring veg it kinda looked like Indica, but leaves &quot;thined out&quot;, as the plants progressed toward the end of life.\u000aNo special coloring, the buds are golden with mostly milky glands, at least thats the ripeness i like.\u000aSuggestion to soil growers, start flushing 2 weeks before you plan to harvest.\u000aMy ferts are Hesi products which were added with every watering (which is 6 weeks +1 pre-veg for veg (with the first 3 weeks just clear water)) + flowering 7+ weeks, flushing started along with the start of the 8th week of flo. And i still kinda felt some fertiliser residue.\u000aPotGrond H soil, with manually added perlite and vermiculite to ratios of 2/10 of both.\u000aDried slowly for 8-10 days, cured for 1 month and thats the stuff.\u000aGood job Nirvana, thank you for an amazing adventure.\u000a

VGREAT strain if you want to relax but still have to focus and get ish done.  Does not inhibit motivation and may actually give a bit of a lift to productivity - depending on the person and the task at hand.  \u000a\u000aPutting it up against Jack Herer, which shares some similar characteristics, I think I like PPP just a bit better.  I find the high to be slightly more intense but for me, that also includes a bit more energy, as well.  Comparisons it to strains like Lamb&#39;s Bread and some of the Burmese strains that I refer to as &quot;work weed&quot;, same thing stands - the differences seem just a bit more pronounced and the PPP is a bit better tasting, as well.\u000a\u000aThere&#39;s no accounting for tastes, but my my measure, it&#39;s a fairly decent flavor when vaped.  FWIW, I use a Crafty by Storz &amp; Bikel.  It&#39;s certainly not bad but nothing that &quot;wows&quot; the palette, either.\u000a\u000aIt&#39;s become a go-to &quot;daytime&quot; strain for me and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who is looking to get lifted and still walk them dogs.

VExcellent strain for dealing with multiple ailments. I love the smell and taste. The strain is weird in general. It supposed to be a heavy Sativa, but the buds grow like Indica, the effect is Sativa as well, but too much of it will give you that couch-lock effect. The plant also grows like a short bushy Indica. Perhaps the pheno that I had did that? Don&#39;t know, but another one is coming and we shall see the results. Enjoy!

VExcellent strain for dealing with multiple ailments. I love the smell and taste. The strain is weird in general. It supposed to be a heavy Sativa, but the buds grow like Indica, the effect is Sativa as well, but too much of it will give you that couch-lock effect. The plant also grows like a short bushy Indica. Perhaps the pheno that I had did that? Don&#39;t know, but another one is coming and we shall see the results. Enjoy!

VThis strain probably has the most skunky smelling buds ive ever smelt. Even more than skunky Super Skunk. Very uplifting high that lasts for a good while. Really raises my mood and puts me in a completely different mind set and it feels as if i have left earth. The high is not over whelming but hits hard and can sometimes be a creeper. Once you start coming down though you may come down hard. Over all the look of the bud is a filthy with crystals, and is a veyr nice green. I have to say this is my favourite sativa and i will pick up more tomorrow for sure. Cant get enough!!!

Hits you hard and fast, often times I would be smoking and completely lose track that I am smoking more and more because I&#39;m so high. Tried going to a rave with this, thought it would be a good idea because it&#39;s Sativa, but i was pretty tired and kept wanting to sit down.

VGreat strain for the productive/busy stoner! I love smoking PPP during the day as it gives me a nice mental buzz and physical energy, great for getting lots of chores and work done. I also find PPP great for inducing creative ideas and smoke it frequently when I&#39;m drawing.

VI\u2019m a beginner and one hit of this and I was soarin\u2019. The high came on very quickly and very strong. On the way up I was a little nauseous and needed to lay down. After that wore off I didn\u2019t experience any energizing effects. In fact all I wanted to do was lay there. My shoulders felt like they were fuzzy and buzzing (like tingling). My face felt a light pressure around the front of my forehead with a very sensitive feelings on every inch of my skin. It was a very intense high that lasts for quite a while. I still feel the facial effects and it\u2019s been over 5 hours since the single hit out of a Chillum.

VIncredibly earthy, musky, yet not too powerful smell. Even if not stashed properly, buds keep that spongy texture for a while. Dense and heavy buds with lots of orange hair. Slight citrus taste with a dominant earthy flavor. Would probably use a bong or a pipe to smoke it, since it seems a bit too damp to roll it up. Good stuff for morning toker.

VNice body and head buzz. Sure will help with a kick of energy. Mostly cerebral high, with some body relaxation though smoke enough of this, then you&#39;ll start to relax more, and may induce a couch lock. Felt stoney, but not too spacy, and overall in a very good mood. Recommend for a wake and bake to start your day. There is some paranoia in this, but nothing panic inducing for me. \u000aPure Power Plant makes a good pain relief, and mood booster for depression or any other mood disorders. Would be careful if you have any anxiety disorders however. \u000aOverall very potent strain, and wouldn&#39;t mind smoking again.
