VHeavyDutyFruity has always been my favorite strain.  It has an excellent smell that says &quot;I can&#39;t wait to be vaporized&quot;, sweet fruity flavor and the best overall high I have come across in 40 years.

VThis strain is the best. You become very focused and relaxed at the same time. And most of all, my favorite part on this strain is that it gives you the LSD feeling. You smoke it and you get high and you\u2019d feel like you\u2019re on some acid euphoria. Also it\u2019s best to have sex on this and to listen to chill mixes with beats and bass and a lot of instruments. It\u2019s like giving you a super power of hearing cause you\u2019ll hear all the instruments clearly like you\u2019re in the music itself.

VThis bud did not have a strong smell to it. The high was quite powerful in the way it made me feel introverted and allowed my mind to wander to many profound thoughts. As the name would imply this strain tasted fruity but also slightly spicy. Very little negative effects, a little dry mouth and thats it.

VOK, so here&#39;s the thing.  I got this strain in concentrate suppositories from a dispensary down in Albany, Oregon. I&#39;m a medical patient up in Portland, Oregon. I was pretty put off at first of stick weed up my ass but the owner of the dispensary swears by them so I said what the hell I&#39;ll try anything once.  It was for my pain maintenance and I got GDP suppositories for my insomnia.  So,  I got home and..  Well,  I put it where It goes.  Now the package says it clocked in at like 38%THC.  I felt all 38%THC about 1/2 hours later!  Dude! The lady was right the best way to get maximum results from cannabis is either the anus, vagina, on men the balls and anus. It sounds fucked up but damn! Daniel!  Yo you gotta try that shit if you come across some at your dispensary.

V&quot;HDF is 50% Sativa 50% Indica. The heritage is Killin Garberville x Mendocino Hash Plant x Seattle Big Bud.&quot;\u000a\u000aGood smoke, I could definitely notice the &quot;muscle soothing&quot; capabilities of the strain. Left me with a nice euphoria quickly but could bring anxiety and/or laziness if used too much.

VThe HDF gave me a pretty heavy, quick intoxication that had me laying in bed watching whatever channel happened to be on. I seriously forgot about the option of changing channels, it simlply didn&#39;t exist. This wasn&#39;t an activity based strain, but the combination of power and sleepiness, mixed with an excellent taste leads me to a favorable review. This was on the fence between an A- and a B+ with the nod coming for the duration and the terrific sleep it provided in a mid-day setting.

VMy friend from DC grew this strain to a beautiful more indica looking pheno. The look/taste is 10/10 but effects are what i care about most and i must say it felt like a mild indica with no couch lock effects and a mild sativa with no real strong cerebral effect so i feal by being a hybrid this strain gives you a little of each which is good but it doesnt deliver those effects as strong as i thought it would have. I have to say it looked and smelled so nice really great looking bud.

VI got this strain on the suggestion of the lady at the dispensary.  I was looking for Afgoo, because it really helps with my insomnia.   Not only did this help me with my insomnia, but it also help with stress and anxiety.  The only thing is that this strain, for me, goes straight into the next day as far as sleep.  I was still a little sleepy at around 2:30pm the next day.  This strain has a name that really suits it.  I love it!!  Makes you a little bit giggly, relaxed and creative.

VHas a great purp skunk smell to it. Tastes good. High is intense and relaxes you. These plants tend to have nice big nugs too. Love this shit. Dueces

VThis flower smelt and taste of a bowl of Fruit Loops cereal. A very strong \u000ahead high stifled all creativity and made me very drowsy. It helped relive lower back pain and increased my appetite. Also a great night time sleep aid.
