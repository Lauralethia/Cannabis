VRoyal Kush, this stuff is pure royalty and very potent, one of the better hybrids I&#39;ve tried in my life. It leans a little heavier on the Indica side but doesn&#39;t completely &quot;couch lock&quot; you. It just puts you in a very peaceful relaxing state of mind, it&#39;s also very good medicine at that helping with pain, spasms, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Definitely a must try and I highly recommend this to everyone. If you see this strain at your local shops top shelf DEFINITELY grab some, you will not be dissapointed.

VRoyal kush and pretty much all kush aren&#39;t for me. I don&#39;t like indica strains because I&#39;m couchlocked and I fall asleep after 45mins so I can&#39;t enjoy the night with my friends and this kush is the worst for that. But I&#39;m still recommending the Royal for those who needs sleep or people who may like the indica&#39;s couchlock effect. This is a great indica but it&#39;s not for me. By the way, really soft on the throat.

VFirst off this weed smells amazing. it gives off a sour piney aroma. I decided to smoke just a little bit of this bud first to see if it is as powerful as it smells. Took a total of 2 gravity hits and 3 bowl pack rounds and I felt immediate effects. Starts off very relaxing and will keep you relaxed the whole time. Felt a nice sense of euphoria at the beginning of the high. Eventually you will get very hungry and youll find yourself eating anything.  By the end of the night youll be happy it has minor sleeping effects because youll be sleeping like a baby.

VRoyal Kush is ok. Nothing to great nor to off. Light on aroma. Like coriander and a hint of lemon. The look is bright green to beige nugs with crystals all over. Bright orange fat stubbly hairs moderately cover. Smoke is smooth. Tasty like grapes and a hint of wood. Effects are subtle euphoria that becomes happiness and a deep relaxation that encourages sleep without feeling like a iron blanket is on me.\u000a\u000aGood for relaxation and late nights with a book.

VThe big brother of Purple Kush (in terms of effects). Fitting, as purple was the color of royalty in an era. I digress though! Royal Kush is for sure a five star strain. It\u2019s so perfectly balanced but has a strong impact like a hammer. I\u2019ve taken two dabs spaced thirty minutes apart (it\u2019s been two weeks since my last dab) and wow it\u2019s tough writing this because it\u2019s just so relaxing. Notice I say relaxing and not sedating. I picked up an earthy citrus note akin to lemon. It\u2019s intensely creative, to the point that I would like to create a short film and I\u2019m so not the artsy type. However it\u2019s deeply numbing and relaxing. Definitely the strain I\u2019d go to for physical pain management associated with bone or muscle issues. Mood is boosted although it\u2019s more in a lack of care about whatever crap happened, as opposed to literally having a mood boost where you\u2019re giggly and chipper. And due it being so relaxing, this is one of those strains that slows things enough to give you almost that frame by frame effect, which allows one to really enjoy some triply videos. So that\u2019s what imma do right now. Peace &#129305;&#127995;

VOverall, Royal Kush is a great experience. Relaxing, euphoric, and a great strain for stress relief. I\u2019ve smoked this in a blunt, a bowl, and a bong. To say the least, a little goes a long way. Munchies are a big thing with this strain, and music sounds fuckin\u2019 amazing. But make sure not to over-do it. Royal Kush is a creeper for sure. Take a few hits and wait a minute or two before packing some more. On top of this weed being a creeper, it\u2019s also the easiest hitting weed I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s super smooth, and tasty. All in all, RK is s great strain and I would recommend this to both newcomers and experienced smokers. \u000aPros: Munchies, Pain Relief, Stress Releif, Happiness, Relaxation\u000aCons: Sneaky Weed, Somewhat tweaky

Absolute Xtracts 66%, oil vape. loved every minute of it from a chill relaxation perspective. been vaping solvent-free, Gold Drop oil due to the price and various potencies. also use pop natural due to it being solvents free and natural. haven&#39;t used AbX oil in awhile....and not sure why after grabbing this today! great relaxation and settling of muscle spasms.

VOne of my favorites. Very relaxing, into the next day also, not necessarily great if you got sh*t to do but if ya don&#39;t, you knowwwwwwwwwwww. Definitely a real skunk in there but weird IMO that crossing it with a Afghani makes it a &quot;Kush&quot; which, in all its iterations, is one of my favorite strains. Every time I smoke any kind of &quot;Kush&quot;, Hindu, Royal, I feel Alive, talkative BUT Supremely relaxed at the same time. Desert Island weed. I always remember my first Purple Kush experience years ago, thinking this &quot;Kush&quot; weed is different, in a crazy good way.

The high starts off good and slow, then it hits you hard. The description lf this strain on this app is so close to the actual experience. After it eases you in to a nice relaxed state, where you feel like sleeping. Would recommend this for any time during the day.

VBest sleep I&#39;ve ever had in my life; I smoke flower about 30 minutes before bedtime. 1-2 hits. Hold for 10 seconds each. Make sure your inhale has the smoke in your lungs and lungs are fully expanded for best results; don&#39;t take such a big hit that smoke stays in trachea or elsewhere. THC absorbs best in the lungs, not the trachea, mouth or other cavities.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m a light sleeper who gets up every hour or two. With this, 1-2 hits puts me out for almost the entire night. Not kidding. Next morning, no hangover at all, unlike Unisom and other sleep aids. This stuff&#39;s absolutely amazing from a medicinal perspective. So glad I found it. You can bet I&#39;ll be buying an ounce of this next time I see it.

VOverall, Royal Kush is a great experience. Relaxing, euphoric, and a great strain for stress relief. I\u2019ve smoked this in a blunt, a bowl, and a bong. To say the least, a little goes a long way. Munchies are a big thing with this strain, and music sounds fuckin\u2019 amazing. But make sure not to over-do it. Royal Kush is a creeper for sure. Take a few hits and wait a minute or two before packing some more. On top of this weed being a creeper, it\u2019s also the easiest hitting weed I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s super smooth, and tasty. All in all, RK is s great strain and I would recommend this to both newcomers and experienced smokers. \u000aPros: Munchies, Pain Relief, Stress Releif, Happiness, Relaxation\u000aCons: Sneaky Weed, Somewhat tweaky

VOutstanding!!! This strain is a gift to anyone in pain, can&#39;t sleep, stressed, anxiety melts away and sleep comes on nice and easy.  Really yummy terpene profile. Definitely takes after both parents Skunk#1

VI bought this in a concentrate in hopes of it being a relaxing strain for my muscular issues caused by fibromyalgia. While I did get a head high, I didn&#39;t feel it in my body and it was very short-lived. I didn&#39;t get any pain relief from it.

VAn &quot;up&quot; high for me. I was expecting a little more stoney effects, but overall not bad bud. \u000aLike the taste more than the feeling, but I&#39;m an indica man. Good stuff for beginners IMO. Happy smoking

Vlove it. Absolute Xtracts 66%, oil vape. loved every minute of it from a chill relaxation perspective. been vaping solvent-free, Gold Drop oil due to the price and various potencies. also use pop natural due to it being solvents free and natural. haven&#39;t used AbX oil in awhile....and not sure why after grabbing this today! great relaxation and settling of muscle spasms.

VDecent for pain. Good for pain if I pack the bowl tight. Spacey for sure. BIG APPETITE.  Small popcorn buds, coated throughout with crystals. Mild taste and smell, sweet and slightly piney/skunky.  Not bad for $44 per quarter, or just over $6 per gm.

VIt was &quot;OK&quot;.   I smoked some of this and it made me pretty mellow. (the full strain I had was &quot;Long-Valley Royal Kush&quot;.   Also smoked it as Royal Kush from Vape Pen (both the same)\u000a\u000aIt didn&#39;t give me the deep mellow feeling you can get from Godfather OG or the heavy fun / head high from Romulan Grapefruit or Jack Herer.  This seems to sit in the middle and it was really like a &quot;Ho Hum&quot; type of weed.   \u000a\u000aI wouldn&#39;t buy this again - there is so much other good stuff out there.

VI just came back to cannabis so my tolerance is low so I&#39;m prone to paranoia and an anti social, uncomfortable feeling. But I actually felt pretty chatty and super relaxed and it helped relieve my stress. It didn&#39;t put me to sleep but when I was ready to go to sleep it helped me drift off into a peaceful sleep which was great for me because insomnia is a problem for me. I didn&#39;t have any headaches while I was enjoying this happy/relaxed high. I have chronic headaches so it was a nice break from that. It was a good mix of sativa and indica for me. Usually I stick to indica to avoid feeling uncomfortable. It really felt like I could lean into the sativa or indica effects at will. Worth a try for sure. Immediate effects and for me it was strong so I had to be careful. (No tolerance at the moment). I was glad I didn&#39;t feel couch locked but I could still lay back and relax.
