VWow. Top 10 contender for sure. Bright, fresh lime green buds like its jack herer mother but with the fuck me high of its super skunk x haze father. Absolutely amazing pungent fruity tropical smell and flavour. The high hits you instantly with a nice even cerebral buzz, very euphoric and uplifting as with any well grown skunk variety. This cross is from Sensi Seeds and I&#39;ve gotta give them props they&#39;ve really outdone themselves this time. The only reason I didn&#39;t give it a 10 was the high wasn&#39;t quite as strong as straight haze, but its really just splitting hairs at this point.

VIt&#39;s rare you see so many reviews so consistently describe a strain. In the case of Jack Flash, they could not be more accurate. The first 15 or so minutes with this strain is intense  - highly energetic, psychedelic even - and always does a good job of locking me in place, completely fascinated with whatever I&#39;m doing or watching that moment. Afterward, the strain settles down into having more of an indica feel. It&#39;s a mellow, buzzy, and relaxing stone that lasts for a couple hours. This makes a great social strain for just passing around for a while over some good music and conversation.

VVery sweet and strong strain. The bud is dense, but not enough to make it too easily crumbled. The high takes very little time to kick in, smoked it an entire afternoon, the high can get really intense as you smoke more. I recommend if you don&#39;t want to get really backed you smoke this strain, because at first it is euphoric and fairly uplifting. As you get higher, the high gets fairly different, I got pretty tired, and had a bit of a headache. Definitely not a strain you need to smoke a lot of in order to get a nice relaxing high, but still a pretty great, dank, bud to smoke.

VLocation:  Unknown\u000a\u000aTHC:  Unknown\u000a\u000aCBD:  Unknown\u000a\u000aAdditional Notes:  While visiting Denver, this was the only strain I was able to try.  My friend&#39;s brother left it for him at the end of his visit and he could not remember where it came from or much else about it.\u000a\u000aAppearance Rating:  5.00\u000aAppearance Description:  The Jack Flash was a vibrant neon green with a good amount of distinct orange hairs.  The trichomes were very nicely developed and covered the flowers.  When breaking them open, the trichomes were even more prominent.  Very nice appearance overall.\u000a\u000aTaste Rating:  4.00\u000aTaste Description:  The taste (and smell for that matter) was exactly what you\u2019d expect from this plant.  Tones of earth, citrus, and even a touch of eucalyptus.  I am not a huge fan of this strain\u2019s smell or taste.  For people who are, I think whoever cultivated this Jack Flash hit it right on the money.  It had a very nice terpene profile, but just not a flavor I crave.\u000a\u000aEffects Rating:  4.00\u000aEffects Description:  The effects on this were very nice, but not quite as strong as I\u2019d hoped.  It left me feeling relaxed after a long day of travel.  With that being said, I had plenty of energy to keep myself active which was nice.  I do wish it had a little more potency to it, but there was no anxiety or paranoia and it actually didn\u2019t impact my appetite the way many strains do.\u000a\u000aOverall Rating:  4.33 (Rounded to 4 Stars)\u000aOverall Summary:  A very well done Jack Flash, but based on the flavor and the high I wouldn\u2019t be going back for more.  For anyone who does like this blend, they would have been very pleased with this particular flower.\u000a\u000aI&#39;m Keith Von Fraichen ... You Keep On Fraiching

After a night of smoking this the next few days are happy and energetic, I feel compelled to live happier and be more paitent with others.\u000a\u000aAs of yet I have felt no &quot;hangover&quot; effect, it makes a perfect social strain, including with more intimate social situations...Giggity!

VExtremely potent strain, I smoke heavily everyday, it takes some great weed to get me soaring... This beautiful hybrid had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. \u000a\u000aVery nice look, dense nugs with what looks like a dusting of snow with heavy trichomes. Quite the  sticky flower courtesy of its lineage.\u000a\u000aGood smell, extremely unique as other have noted. Definitely a hint of citrus with a odd chemmy smell. Hard to explain..\u000a\u000aMaybe the stuff I got was grown different but I definitely found a lean towards sativa with this strain, extreme concentration going through some things from work. Also played some guitar hero. Lots of fun.\u000a\u000a5/5 strain. Mid to top shelf bud, depending on your source of course.

No coughing. Overall good stress reliever and mood lifter.  Mild pain relief.  Effects 4 -  6 hrs.  Strong effects first 4.

VI am normally an indica guy, mainly I think because I tend to get a bit paranoid or anxious on the sativas. Jack flash is the exception. Not only did it not produce the typical paranoia but it actually seemed to be anxiolytic. \u000a\u000aVery fragrant with pleasant citrus notes. Taste is similar to the scent.\u000a\u000aLight, happy sativa with a clear head and no paranoia.

VI actually only gave this a try because it was on special. I&#39;m so glad I did! Very nice aroma and sweet taste with an immediate euphoric effect for a very happy and creative high. This was perfect after a long day at work, coming home to unwind, but not at a total couch lock. I&#39;ll definitely add this to my list of regular purchases, especially for snowed in weekends this winter!

VI&#39;m not much of a sativa guy honestly but when I bought my gram of Jack Flash and I smoked her up I could instantly tell the high was going to be cerebral but for me it wasn&#39;t over bearing and I was able to enjoy the eurphoric high which allowed me to binge game on Fallout 4. 10/10 will smoke again.

VJack Flash is a great morning or afternoon strain. It has a smokey taste that isn&#39;t special, but isn&#39;t bad. The taste does not live up to its interesting smell. It&#39;s a light strain that will give you positive vibes. It&#39;s a happy weed - perfect for being social while out and about. It&#39;s not a strain that will provide you with a lot of focus. It also doesn&#39;t give you couch lock, but it does provide some body numbing for relaxation purposes.

The high comes on immediately and continues for up to two hours.  Comedown is nice and easy...no headaches, although you can keep the high going by some well placed hits as time goes on.  Lovely...would buy again for sure.

VEnergetic but somewhat shorter lasting effects. Can be quite smooth when smoked. Some appetite simulation depending on medical condition type. Works 6/10 for my pain(stronger indica&#39;s work better)and not really suggested as best option for digestive/muscle conditions and pains, nor is it ideal for sleep due to its energy. Has a very pleasant, somewhat sweet, but not overpowering aroma. There are mid size trichromes  mostly visible on inner flower bud when split  open. Medium consistently sized nugs, of a medium density with a very slight stickiness and moderate compressibility. Not ideal for dry sift pollen  yield. Small to moderate amount of fairly vibrant orange hairs. Good daytime med of decently strong overall intensity and high energy, particularly if desiring shorter effects lasting closer to 2-3 hrs vs 4-6( varies by person and tolerance but decreased duration seems to be present at most dosage levels and tolerances.

VI really enjoy the terpene profile of the strain. It&#39;s pretty citrusy and sweet. The high is definitely not necessarily suitable for those easily provoked with anxiety. As in my personal experience, my heart rate increased and felt extremely restless. I would not smoke this before not having something to do! However, if you&#39;re going dancing or for a hike, this could be the perfect strain to bring along!

VI bought an 8th from Rocky Road Despensary (1712 S. Chambers Road, Aurora, CO) for about $25 with an add from the CanniPages. The staff actually was very helpful which I ended up buying some edibals which were amazing as well. But the Jack Flash haf a pleasant fresh taste while smoked through a pipe. More on the dense side of nugs red hairs with a frosty coating of crystals. Grinds up nicely. The high is very relaxing so I would say to probably if your a creative person who can excel in a small work space you my be able to get things done. Very much of a head high, sort of euphoric. But nothing visual. I would say stress levels are very minimal and now I would say probably because the Jack Flash was smoked the dry mouth is the only negative but nothing a bottle of water can&#39;t cure. Which everyone should be drinking water. So stay HIGHdrated everyone!\u000a-BP

Energetic buzz throughout, with a tiny bit of body numb after about 30 minutes - lingering for another 30. After about an hour and a half, i still had the mental buzz, but my body was feeling worn out (probably because i had 3 hrs of sleep the night before).  Very energetic.

VBegan with JF at 2:24 and it&#39;s 2:35 right now.  Over a matter of 10 short minutes I&#39;m feeling fantastic lol.  WICKED body high.  I&#39;m finding myself doing slow deliberate movements with my head and neck and I&#39;m very aware of my breathing.  I&#39;m focused and I&#39;m able to say *how* I&#39;m feeling, so that&#39;s good lol.  Descending the staircase, my legs were pretty much able to float.  Eyes getting dry now 2:39.  Really feel in to watching a movie and relaxing while the kids nap...yep...that&#39;s happening lol.  I did have a headache but now it&#39;s lessening - shoulder tension too, also lessening.

V1.5 / 5 Review below.  Previous Notes: Looking forward to this I hear one parent plant is &#39;Jack Herer&#39; which as you may see from my previous reviews comes highly rated &amp; my other favorite Super Skunk. If it&#39;s clear headed effects carried through to this Strain I shall be delightfully pleased! Acquired from The Medicine Man in Cortez, CO. \u000a\u000aUpdate: Not impressed, guess I expected too much. Smoked using J + Pipe and while nothing that bad about it, I just wouldn&#39;t get it again. \u000a\u000aUpdate: I am begging to think I got a bad batch. Will get some more of this strain and try again. I feel I was a bit unfair on this strain.\u000a\u000aRemember to take this review with a pinch of salt, every reviews subjective! #StayTuned #CGM

VPicked up the strain today. Was deciding between the familiar amnesia and the &#39;wild and unknown Jack Flash&quot;. \u000a\u000aMy girlfriend comes tomorrow so I wanted to blaze it for her and chose the odd one. Just a couple of hours ago I smoked it and boy oh boy. Thats a fist in the face. Don&#39;t think thats on the couple days smoke break or the empty stomach, That&#39;s actually a great and really potent weed, which gives you real boost of energy and a decent amount of creativity and &#39;giggliness&#39;. Music, especially stoner feels just right, that I believe is the Indica linage. I smoked a couple of medium-sized bowls and the high lasted about 2 or 3 hours, the big munch, however, doesn&#39;t seem to be on the list. Which may be desirable for some. \u000a\u000aAll in all, I believe that this is one of the best strains I have smoked so far. A nice choose for both indica-lovers, but a must-try for sativa fans.\u000a\u000aHave a nice time, chaps

Vthis strain is one of the best I&#39;ve tried. such a lovely cerebral high paired with a general feeling of lightness. I definitely feel the indicia elements but I&#39;m not feeling sleepy or tired like some others have made me feel. It helped my muscle soreness melt away. A great one for a movie day at home, but I feel like I could go out and do things if I needed to.

VGot this strain because it was on sale and I was low on cash. Bud was crispy and puffed out. The smell was like citronella candles before it was ground. Once ground, the smell was really sweet and citrus-y. The bud was slightly drier than usual, but it&#39;s nothing to complain about. The smoke was a little harsh and there wasn&#39;t much to comment on with the taste. If anything, it was sweet and woody. The high was sweet and happy, really blissed out. Dreamy. Body is amazing, mind is clear but soft. Great for listening to music and being in nature. Euphoric.

VI really enjoy the terpene profile of the strain. It&#39;s pretty citrusy and sweet. The high is definitely not necessarily suitable for those easily provoked with anxiety. As in my personal experience, my heart rate increased and felt extremely restless. I would not smoke this before not having something to do! However, if you&#39;re going dancing or for a hike, this could be the perfect strain to bring along!

VI bought an 8th from Rocky Road Despensary (1712 S. Chambers Road, Aurora, CO) for about $25 with an add from the CanniPages. The staff actually was very helpful which I ended up buying some edibals which were amazing as well. But the Jack Flash haf a pleasant fresh taste while smoked through a pipe. More on the dense side of nugs red hairs with a frosty coating of crystals. Grinds up nicely. The high is very relaxing so I would say to probably if your a creative person who can excel in a small work space you my be able to get things done. Very much of a head high, sort of euphoric. But nothing visual. I would say stress levels are very minimal and now I would say probably because the Jack Flash was smoked the dry mouth is the only negative but nothing a bottle of water can&#39;t cure. Which everyone should be drinking water. So stay HIGHdrated everyone!\u000a-BP

VEnergetic but somewhat shorter lasting effects. Can be quite smooth when smoked. Some appetite simulation depending on medical condition type. Works 6/10 for my pain(stronger indica&#39;s work better)and not really suggested as best option for digestive/muscle conditions and pains, nor is it ideal for sleep due to its energy. Has a very pleasant, somewhat sweet, but not overpowering aroma. There are mid size trichromes  mostly visible on inner flower bud when split  open. Medium consistently sized nugs, of a medium density with a very slight stickiness and moderate compressibility. Not ideal for dry sift pollen  yield. Small to moderate amount of fairly vibrant orange hairs. Good daytime med of decently strong overall intensity and high energy, particularly if desiring shorter effects lasting closer to 2-3 hrs vs 4-6( varies by person and tolerance but decreased duration seems to be present at most dosage levels and tolerances.

A bit of indica to give you just a bit of that classic stoned feeling, paired with some great calming sativa genes that can really help with any sort of anxiety issues or mental stress you may be having. It&#39;s not going force you to lay down, but it&#39;s not going to stop you from doing it either. Great for just about any time of day if you just want to boost your mood.

Vsurprisingly only a hint of that minty jack we are all accustomed to, with a funky skunky overtone. beautifully cured, no amber trichs but milky white. Chunky, dense nugs.  Energetic buzz throughout, with a tiny bit of body numb after about 30 minutes - lingering for another 30. After about an hour and a half, i still had the mental buzz, but my body was feeling worn out (probably because i had 3 hrs of sleep the night before).  Very energetic.  Great for drivers that need to stay up !

The effect was pleasant and uplifting but very mild. The buds had a very strong citrus &amp; earthy scent. I would recommend this strain for initiates.

VLove it. Strong high.  Makes me relax enough.  Gives me energy, too, one to use when i need to clean or do laundry.  No dry mouth.  No anxiety.

VThis strain is probably the prettiest smelling flower in the world. It hits fast, and is uplifting and borderline psychedelic. I love the effects if I&#39;m not really trying to accomplish much. It is energetic, and uplifting, but I don&#39;t focus as well when I smoke this strain. Still fun and worth revisiting sometimes.

VLike Adderal  without the jitters. I was jumping off the floor. My pulse was through the roof. Emotionally I felt calm. No reported loss of focus. Excitability lasted 45 minutes.

VIt&#39;s that classic &quot;I&#39;m so high right now&quot; feeling. Not much head rush, but extremely relaxing yet alert high. Super goofy. Just TRY to remember what you were thinking 2 minutes ago....you can&#39;t. Very smooth pain relief and body-numbing feeling. Not my favorite ever but definitely a fun one.

VIt&#39;s no Sour Diesel but still great for a pick-me-up. It&#39;s a happy head high, very relaxed and smiley. Filled the bowl half with Jack Flash and half Medibud for a body and head high which was better for pain alleviation.
