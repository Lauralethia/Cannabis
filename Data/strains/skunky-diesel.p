VThis strain stunk my car up so bad. Thankfully I have a medical card and nothing to worry about anymore. I smoked it and BOOM! instantly medicated. Such a strong skunk smell, beautiful flower. Definitely great for &quot;MY&quot; anxiety. \u000a\u000a

VI don&#39;t really care for skunky and indica strains but this one was definitely skunky. The deisle works well with it so I don&#39;t frustrated with it  The high felt more like a sativa high than an indica high, it felt great too.

VThe best smelling strain I&#39;ve smelled. not for beginners tho. Very sedating high  hits you hard you&#39;ll feel the sensation on your face and if you smoke too much you will experiment paranoia. if you keep it low it&#39;s very relaxing

VVery strong smoke, expands in the lungs, definitely not for beginners. You will start feeling the effects of this strain within the second hit. Short body high with a long head high.

VEuphoric feeling, just all around pleasant. Some physical effects-body pain less intense  but still evident. Feel heavy and giggly. THINK maybe I&#39;m smarter? Feel like I am but then second guess myself...not sure which is the smarter one. The one second guessing or the one first guessing...
