VThis isnt a review,  I just wanted to share the time I picked up some &quot;NY Cheese&quot;,  and it was a bad,  soily SD that had been sprayed or soaked with SOUR CREAM WATER.  The other strain tasted like milk,  so I know he had a mildew problem,  (they use dairy products to cover it up),  but SOUR CREAM for Sour Diesel?  Who makes that connection?!  No wonder the dude didnt let me pick and smell my pack like he normally did.  Man,  I must be surrounded by tweeking growers,  the stuff they do in these parts!  It never ends!

Made us both dizzy and was very hard to focus on things... not in the dreamy way that a purp will, but in a more scrambled unpleasant way.

VSeattle Quality Collective - Seattle, WA\u000a\u000aA classic strain still alive in the North West, Thai is a strong Sativa that kills pain, and reduces stress while keeping one focused and on point while going about day-to-day business. A euphoric head high leaves the individual in a trance like state, which sets on slowly and picks up intensity as the day goes on lasting hours on a .5 g. bong toke. Thai is a strong variety for patients who want to feel the powerful effects for hours, but don\u2019t want to be medicating all day long. \u000a\u000aThis Thai is a tightly grown flower, trimmed well, and covered in bulging calyx\u2019s sparkling with trichomes, so much so the bud appears to be wet inside. Opening a jar reveals an intense earthy, sour, skunk smell, permeating the surrounding environment. The initial taste is smooth and earthy, which blends nicely with a mild sour flavor shortly after exhaling. Excellent choice for the morning and daytime hours. \u000a

VI live with nerve pain, anxiety and mild depression. This one does a number on all of them! I got mine from Ross&#39; Gold in Kelowna, BC. \u000a\u000aThe initial impression is great. It presents very nicely; medium green buds with pretty dun orange orange trichromes. The nose is nice, like blue cheese and some kind of fruit. The taste is... Interesting. I really liked it. It&#39;s very sour and savoury. Not for everyone, though. \u000a\u000aThe effect is wonderful. The high CBD content really makes this a soothing, relaxing high, but there&#39;s enough sativa in it to really make your senses pop. \u000a\u000aAs for medical effects, it does a wonderful job of managing pain. The sativa in it really makes it helpful with lifting mood, but the high CBD content helps round off the edges and make it relaxing. \u000a\u000aGreat stuff, I&#39;m definitely buying it again.

VGot a oz of Sour Cream. Only bad thing wad i only got a OZ. Fluffy yet dense buds,one downside to this batch was it turned to shake pretty easily,prob with cure not the strain im guessing. The smell was verys chemmy diesel, rather than sour. The effects are what you would expect,very uplifting and cerebral, with a non couchlocking bodyhigh laying underneath it. This along with Sugar Plum Haze are my favorite daytime strains

VSo the strain of this I got was Berry Sour Cream, now I try and give all new pot I try a chance, but this did barely anything for me. When I acquired this strain it was when I started smoking again after a year long break from any cannabis use, so my tolerance was extremely low. now I&#39;m sure the way this was grown may have been what was effecting it&#39;s potency, not that the strain itself is weak, but this specific cultivator did not deliver the $24/g recreational top shelf price buzz it promised. The grower of this pot is Phat Panda, which in current experience their strains can be hit or miss, so this may have just been a miss, but would not get this again from this dispensary or grower.

VI was really skeptical when I picked this one up. It actually had a very nice sweet G13 smell to it.  The nugs were big, round and dense. This was the first strain that truly felt like a &quot;hybrid&quot;. I didn&#39;t feel over tired and there was no paranoia. I felt mentally sharp and experience ample pain relief. For being so skeptical on the name, I&#39;m really digging this strain. Hoping it&#39;s restocked soon, cause damn that medicine was amazing.
