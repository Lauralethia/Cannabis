VI&#39;ve smoked and documented more than 50 strains, and this is by far my favorite #1 weed.   There is NO BETTER weed for a concert or listening to music.\u000a\u000aThere is no better weed than Green Goddess, and I am not saying that because I&#39;m high on it now - I actually am smoking Diamond OG.  But, I regress.\u000a\u000aIf you see Green Goddess anywhere, you should pick it up, never pass it down.   It is a very unbeat sativa but has small indica (relaxed) feels to it.  \u000a\u000aI remember doing a Dead &amp; Company show here this year, and smoked a whole joint of this before going into the show.  I was completely high, but enjoyed every single minute of what was going on around me.

VThis could easily be my new favorite strain. The flower I smoked was homegrown, and I&#39;m not sure if that helps, but it was pretty potent. This one definitely helps with depression and anxiety. It is also one of few strains I&#39;ve found don&#39;t stop me from being productive, especially creatively. When I smoke Green Goddess before I draw, I spend less time second-guessing myself and get more accomplished faster.

VOne of the strongest strains I have ever tried, got it as a mid shelf and it was still pretty potent.I&#39;m somewhat scared to try it as a top shelf or private reserve.  If you are going to a concert or party this is the strain you need. It&#39;s the best of both worlds. Perfectly gives you both a Sativa and Indica high. The only downside to this strain is that when I smoked it in the morning I got a comedown in the afternoon that made me very sleepy and my body felt ready to call it a day and go to bed for the night even though it was only about 3 pm.

VWasn&#39;t too impressed with the small, subdued looking buds but big things come in small packages. Really unique flavours, Especially the aftertaste that lingers like fine wine. The only accurate word for this one is special. Zero couch lock but instead a creative, bubbly high that&#39;s already made me wish I&#39;d bought more. Bummer. Still $5/per at Releaf.

VAbsolute #1 Hybrid, smoked this before Cali Roots and the concerts were all amazing. I instantly fell in love and didn\u2019t find any Green Goddess anywhere for a while :( I was always looking for it 24/7 It was just the perfect balance of relaxed and uplifted. Finally found some GG in my area and bought from my nearby club. If I was stuck smoking one strain my whole life, it would be green goddess. Super tasty but also very earthy, a personal favorite. Super positive vibes, extreme euphoria, while also experiencing a nice body high. If you haven\u2019t tried GG yet, FIND SOME, YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE I PROMISE.

VNot impressed at all by the Green Goddess. It can be a good day strain since it kills pain and it&#39;s not to strong to carry on daily activities. But at the same time it&#39;s not a very potent painkiller and if you like to get buzzed it&#39;s far from the best. It kills stress. Taste almost nothing except being pungent herbal, slight spices and citrus but all of this very subtle compare to the herbal side. It&#39;s a love or hate kid and for this one I tend to slide slightly on the second option. At the same time it doesn&#39;t taste bad and it controlled the pain I had so it still did the job but not as perfect as other strains.

VGreen goddess is very very potent, but I feel I may have only had a hybrid from this strain, and that it was mixed with a high sativa, that tastes of lavender and citrus, but also a tangy banana after taste. The high was very calming but very potent and relaxing, and then uplifting and euphoric. Which is why I feel it was crossed with a high sativa strain on top of the goddess. Over all this is an amazing strain no matter how you look at; in the form I have it or form others have had it, smell, taste, high, appeal are all top notch.

High is heavy on indica but has some cerebral effects which are great for stress.  not so good as a muscle relaxant tho. 3 hits and ur done tolerance is at 500mg THC/day. its one hit shit otherwise.  buds are very dense. if it was more congolese x critical mass it would be my all day medicine.
