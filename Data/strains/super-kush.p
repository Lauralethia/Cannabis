VA mellow strain that melt pain and stress away without being overwhelming. I love this one for a shopping trip or a little short hike in the forest. It&#39;s Earthy, sweet and pungent like most kush but the one I got wasn&#39;t dominant at all. The buzz was very good and largely compensated the lack of taste. You fell relax, happy, you want to talk to peoples. Good strain to initiate someone to cannabis!

VThis has to be one of my favourite strains I&#39;ve had in recent times.  Got a fresh batch and the buds were perfect in terms of being reasonably dry on the surface but sticky in the middle and ground up quite well as there wasn&#39;t as much friction as what is normally encountered with sticky indicas.  Maybe a bit critical, but the only factor that prevented a 5 star rating was the lack of flavour, it does seem somewhat neutral.  The high was instant and put me in a relaxed state, but surprisingly didn&#39;t have me glued to the couch, which for me is not a bad thing.  Left me easy going and after an hour or so when it was time to hit the hay, I was in the right state of mind for a good sleep.  Would recommend to have as a reward after a long and stressful day as it puts your mind at rest.

VRelaxing, mind easing strain. It clears my head from bad thought and calms me down nicely. My body feels heavy, but I can still get and do stuff unlike with some other indicas that can make me get stuck in the couch or bed. I have some anxiety and some strains can make it worse but this one is the opposite. The only bad effect I could feel was a dry mouth 10-15 minutes after I smoked. Would recommend to others who wants to relax and have clear headed high.

VPicked it up off a medical local dispenser online. Love the effects; I&#39;m not stuck to the couch, but still feel a lot of body relaxation. I can focus cognitively, my mind doesn&#39;t race, and I feel an increased desire to be active. The taste isn&#39;t as fresh as I&#39;d like, but it isn&#39;t harsh and has a mild earthy tone. Works great for a good price, would recommend for wanting to relax.

VA great buzz, while it lasts. Definitely a night cap strain. Not the best taste, and kind of a weak smell. Trichomes cover this one, but unfortunately this time that doesn&#39;t mean fire. A good solid strain, but not to be capped above $50 if my batch sets the bar.

VI really like this strain. It leaves me feeling clear headed, happy and relaxed and works wonders for pain. It does not make me anxious at all and it is more of a head high but has some body high to go along with it. The flavour is quite pleasant as well, grassy, and a little fruity. The only downside for me is that it makes me incredibly hungry and that effect lasts a while.

Not great if you are in public and want to be low key but I tend not to worry about that much. A heavy hitter and an instant hitter. Hits you in the face right away, develops into a couchlock and lingers for a good while. Great for appetite, pain and insomnia! \u000aWould definitely try again and still so much more to choose from.

VSuper Kush is a nice, easygoing indica that is suitable for use almost any time of day. Although it is an indica, Super provides a clear-headed stone without overwhelming couch-lock effects. Super has a very soft, warm body high and relaxing, happy mental effects. Great strain for treating anxiety and depression. The nugs I acquired were quite visually appealing, being very frosty and possessing orange hairs spread throughout. Super Kush has an absolutely delicious aroma, with strong citrus and lime notes. Overall an excellent strain for medical users, beginners, and those looking for a mellow, functional high. If you&#39;re looking for something super potent, however, I&#39;d look elsewhere.

VI got a batch of super kush a month or two ago and it was pretty potent. I felt the effects almost immediately after hitting up the vape and within the first or second hit after smoking it. It was easy to smoke a bit too much leading to some paranoia so if it is as potent as the batch that I got try to take it slow and steady. It was a pretty nice head high with a relaxing body buzz. It had a mild kushy smell and flavour, but nothing too strong. I didn&#39;t get intense hunger with this strain but eating became comfortable. A pretty nice strain overall
