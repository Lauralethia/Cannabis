V&#129413;\u2604\ufe0f NYC Diesel has unusually energetic effects for such a balanced hybrid. The initial hit is a cerebral blast, weightless and intense. She is definitely an eyebrow raiser, with a pungent aroma of diesel and citrus. Great for getting lost in any kind of project or playing competitive video games. Such an awesome social strain and even though it gives you such a crazy head high, it is totally anxiety free! What an awesome strain. b-Myrcene: 6.1 mg/g, a-Humulene: 1.3 mg/g, b-Caryophyllene: 1 mg/g.

VPretty quickly zaps your ability to function. On the path between your brain wanting to do something and actually doing it - something goes wrong and you\u2019re stuck just waiting blankly. So, don\u2019t try to accomplish anything when smoking this. It\u2019s purely R&amp;R or non-mentally demanding tasks. Although...it only cuts off that section of your brain. Your internal head space remains surprising clear and cognizant. Actually wishing there was more disassociation and mood elevation. Vision is exciting - narrow and quick to focus - but watching things is surprisingly not fun. Hard to keep up with what\u2019s happening and far too distant emotionally, there\u2019s just no connecting to what\u2019s happening while you strain to even keep up. Pity. But it does succeed outdoors! Great for hikes and traveling. Feel physically medicated. Numbed all around and fuzzed out. Feel very distant from my body parts. Shortened attention span is well suited for music, which sounds rapturously captivating. It fills your senses and overwhelms you emotionally, all while hitting surprisingly deep. The short attention span allows you to ride the music like a wave, constantly being thrilled by each new second. The perfect outdoor music festival strain.

VGot some NYC Diesel a bit ago and fell in love. Twist open then jar and the room smells like walking through a gas station while drinking a mountain dew. Diesel and chemical smells accompanied by lemon/lime sweetness fill the room. So, I rolled a couple rice paper joints and went to town! Great flavor throughout the entire joint. Starts off lightly diesel with strong lemon/lime characteristics. Then, it begins to become more diesel and chemical dominant with fruit undertones. Towards the end it has a very chemdawg &#39;91 inspired flavor of burning plastic and diesel. Loved it. All of it. The high is energetic and clear. Not very talkative, but lightly uplifting and nicely energetic. I can&#39;t speak enough for the clarity of the high in combination with such pain and nausea killing power.

VI&#39;ve rated a hundred strains on here but I&#39;ve never been compelled to write a review until now. WHOA this shit is LOUD. I don&#39;t know if this strain is always this absolutely sparkling with crystals, or if this was just a particularly good grow, but holy fucking shit this stuff is wild. It has a taste like I&#39;m smoking keef, it&#39;s so crystallized it doesn&#39;t even taste like regular herb. The high is a sativa dominant rush of madness and euphoria, a lively high reminiscent of Walter White or Green Crack in some ways. The indica that&#39;s there was just enough to anchor my body so it didn&#39;t float away. I smoke a stupid amount, my tolerance is through the roof, I&#39;m basically permafried between tolerance breaks, but this stuff broke through the haze and smacked my love receptors into high gear. 5/5

VThis stuff has a nice, sweet, pungent odor, with a chemical taste to the smoke. The high is quite mellowing, but makes you very talkative. This is a GREAT social smoke. It puts you in a good mood, relaxes you, and makes conversation flow very well. Social Anxiety just melts away. Definitely a must have!

VJust became number 1 on my list (for now)!  In a word, awesome!  Taste is extraordinarily smooth on both in and exhale (one hit pipe).  Visually a great looking bud with brilliant purple leaves mixed with burnt orange accents, nice hairs and lots of crystals!  Fantastic head buzz with moderate body affects but close to eliminates by chronic back pain.  Can go either way depending on your mood but I can go happily into couch lock or easily switch up to doing something active and feel great either side of the spectrum.  Last a good two hours or more (time seems to fly right by though).  Seems to pick up intensity in increments until a level euphoric, happy, with great sense of well being.  I rate this a perfect 10 in all categories and now first on my shopping list!  If you have not tried this I would definitely recommend it!!!

VMakes me feel inspired and motivated. I actually want to go out and do things, and get things done (this is veryyyyy rare for me). Mild anxiety in the first 10-15 minutes after smoking, but it went away. I&#39;ve had a smile on my face this whole time. I feel like I could go spread sunshine to all kinds of people \u2728\u2600\ufe0f&#127774;\u2728 Like a happy little weed fairy! &#129498;&#127995;\u200d\u2640\ufe0f &#128154; This strain is also perfect for listening to music. This is definitely one of new faves, which is nice because I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be this good. Also lasts for quite a while and a couple hits goes verrrrrry far.&#127796;&#127793;&#127807;&#127811;&#128293;&#128168;&#127787; A+++++

VThe go-do-something weed. The Sour Diesel without the self-critical analysis. This strain packs almost as much invigoration but doesn&#39;t lead to any racing thoughts. The talk-to-people-while-blitzed cannabis. This strain is the only one I know that doesn&#39;t effect my social abilities in the slightest. The high isn&#39;t exemplary for a sativa, but bares resemblance to it&#39;s crack like cousins without any of the negative (paranoid) side effects. It allows you to feel much more present than other heady strains. If you&#39;re not a fan of sativa&#39;s this may be the last one to try before throwing in the towel.

It has the powerful first effects, happy but not dumb, sativa city all the way.....then later a nice relaxing buzz.  No ceiling. If I was cast away on a desert island and could have only one strain it would be NYCD.  I wouldn&#39;t need Wilson, hahaha.

VThe go-do-something weed. The Sour Diesel without the self-critical analysis. This strain packs almost as much invigoration but doesn&#39;t lead to any racing thoughts. The talk-to-people-while-blitzed cannabis. This strain is the only one I know that doesn&#39;t effect my social abilities in the slightest. The high isn&#39;t exemplary for a sativa, but bares resemblance to it&#39;s crack like cousins without any of the negative (paranoid) side effects. It allows you to feel much more present than other heady strains. If you&#39;re not a fan of sativa&#39;s this may be the last one to try before throwing in the towel.

VI hadn&#39;t tried this strain until this morning when I took 2 dabs of some NYC Diesel CO2 Wax to help start my day. The taste of Sweet Diesel Fuel lingered on my palate on the exhale. A strong cerebral buzz came on quickly accompanied by a nice boost of energy which was just what I needed without having any anxiety or paranoia. Dare I say that I may have found my go to AM strain?

I\u2019d definitely recommend to anybody who wants to smoke a strong strain during the day but wants to feel more of a sativa than an indica high, very similar to the effects of sour diesel.

VThe high is fairly short but hits you fast as hell. Nice head high with limited couchlock. Little more paranoia on the comedown than I&#39;m used to. Definitely not smoking this at night again, an excellent weekend day high. If you want a pleasant buzz, but need to get shit done, this is a fair choice.

VOne of my top 3 favourite sativas. I notice with this strain I have to smoke quite a bit to get high, but when I am high its lots of fun. I laugh alot and like to dance when I smoke this strain, it makes me feel super relaxed and forget about my problems so I&#39;d recommend this to people with anxiety and depression. Once the high passes though, it knocks me out.

VA buddy of mine has some light-deprevated outdoor grown NYC Diesel and its made it into my favorite strains. At first its a bit of a heady type of feeling, but as you ease into the full effects it has a very nice body high. It also has a very nice balance to it so you won&#39;t be too stoned to function, and the full body effects carry nicely with a smooth come down.

VIt is possible for a strain to disarm and then charm? Can cannabis be charismatic? This strain says yes, yes, and yes. I bought some on sale from SPARC SF because the deal was too good to pass up, but did not expect very much. What a delightful surprise! The flavor is lemony with some pine without that harsh diesel kick, and the smell matches. This will not overpower, but will relax, allow for a measure of focus, and creatively inspire. An absolutely delightful little bud. I liked it so much I bought it on my next visit at full price. Give it a try, especially if you need your medicine but need to be able to function socially. It&#39;s a wonderful bud.

VI was feeling nostalgic, so I went to my local dispensary and picked up this gem. I have always thought that it smells pretty strongly of rotten apples. The high I associate with this strain is all about feeling happy. It immediately lifts up my mood and reverses my negativities. I also like it for the floaty body high. I definitely would recommend it, one of my five all time favorites.

VThe smell from this strain is something else; apples, berries, citrus and, of course, that dirty, fuelly, sour funk. A great strain for wake-and-bake and early-day activities that you may need a bit of inspiration for. Not too difficult to grow, may stretch a fair bit but somehow my one showed indica-dominance in its growth pattern. Responds well to topping and LST.

VOne of my top 3 favourite sativas. I notice with this strain I have to smoke quite a bit to get high, but when I am high its lots of fun. I laugh alot and like to dance when I smoke this strain, it makes me feel super relaxed and forget about my problems so I&#39;d recommend this to people with anxiety and depression. Once the high passes though, it knocks me out.

VI was feeling nostalgic, so I went to my local dispensary and picked up this gem. I have always thought that it smells pretty strongly of rotten apples. The high I associate with this strain is all about feeling happy. It immediately lifts up my mood and reverses my negativities. I also like it for the floaty body high. I definitely would recommend it, one of my five all time favorites.

VNYC Diesel consistently left me with persistent headaches. So much so that i cannot recall the high nor any perceived medical benefits.\u000a\u000aI recently took 1.5 pulls from a J before getting onstage at a club: while the Audience raved about my performance (gracias! thank you!), i felt uncomfortable with my perception of time. However, i DID realize that my mind was moving so fast, that i was able to set up my instrument, tune, send a text to ask the Engineer for an extra long delay, place my mic, and cooly check out the crowd while the Band played my intro!\u000a\u000aSo there&#39;s that.

VThe first pull you take of NYC Diesel will instantly have your eyes low. The second pull will give you a nice calm head high, after the third pull you will feel both the effects of the indica and sativa in this potent hybrid strain. NYC Diesel has a very strong diesel scent and smells a lot stronger than your average strain. I\u2019d definitely recommend to anybody who wants to smoke a strong strain during the day but wants to feel more of a sativa than an indica high, very similar to the effects of sour diesel.  NYC Diesel is for people who need a push to their day or people who are stressed or feeling very anxious. I\u2019d give this 9 of 10 stars.

VI&#39;m usually a person to stay from strains that are sativa dominant cause of past experience with them but WOW! I love this strain. Hits almost immediately on the exhale. Very strong diesel smell and the nugs are coated in trichomes and very sticky. Didn&#39;t even want to come out of my grinder. Really good relaxation in the body but just enough sativa kick to keep you going :) giggly and happy high. keep the munchies near! I notice mad munchies in the come down. pretty spacey as well. smoke too much and you are going to zoned out lol. beginners be a little careful cause it hits fast and might overwhelm if over done. Love it. good for medicating and recreational. COLORADO!! no place like home :)

VJeez, were do I begin? First, the stuff is STINKY. I got this from a dealer here in NYC, and man. Smells like a rotting skunk (an honest to goodness faint rotting smell). Hashy smoke, hazy immediate head high followed immediately with a pretty deep body stone. This stuff has been Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for me in the past, and here it is again living up to its reputation. Immediately relaxed, stress is gonezo, and it&#39;s funny, first thing I thought was, &quot;well, so much for that party I was going to..&quot;. One word: Spacey. I haven&#39;t kept a solid train of thought going for 15 minutes. Overall, I&#39;ve found this to be the most consistent strain in my limited experience, but I will say this much: any time I&#39;ve had it in the States, it was far better than what I smoked in Amsterdam. NYC Diesel smokes like it sounds: tough and persistent. I love it, but it&#39;s not for amateurs - can get you paranoid if you smoke too much. Anyway, viva la NYCD!

VNYC diesel is a wonderful, sativa heavy, energetic strain.  I signed up for an account here because I take issue with the site&#39;s recommendation of this strain to anxiety prone patients. I would STRONGLY advise against panic attack or anxiety prone patients from using this strain.  It is one of the worst panic attack inducing strains in my experience.  That said, the high is wonderful and extremely energetic for those that don&#39;t suffer from anxiety.

VSmoked a joint with my Homeskillet. I&#39;m about 15 minutes in to this wonderful euphoric adventure. I&#39;ve only recently been introduced to different strains. This has to be one of the best experiences thus far! I&#39;ve read the summary and couldn&#39;t place the grapefruit taste until I see it noted. Im really stoned now.. Thank you

VI was only able to sample this strain once because it was gifted from a friend for my depression and all i can say is WOW. Amazing turbocharged sativa power straight to the head, man. Its really hard not to smile with this strain, it just leaves your head feeling plastered to the sky. \u000aThere is a slight relaxation to it so theres no paranoia/anxiety (thank you afghani genetics) but the nugs arent very conical, more indica looking as well. She is also resin-COATED. Beautiful. And the smell is pretty unique. It has a pungent diesel smell of course but there are hints of citrus and sweetness as well; very complex and satisfying. The taste is pure diesel that just stays in your mouth, but is so tasty you dont care! Highly recommendable, this easily moved up to a top spot on my sativa dominant list.

VI originally was skeptical about this strain because the dispensary had a really good deal. However, it&#39;s become one of my favorite strains. It&#39;s got the sativa punch with a mellow body high. Very functional. My new favorite daytime hybrid. Too bad more stores don&#39;t carry this. I wish it was a California staple, along with GC, BD, GSC, etc.

V&quot;Oil made from the hands of the god&#39;s of the Universe&quot; This is how we at @High_Bond, celebrated the annual 710 (July 10th, 2017) with this oil/concentrate made by the heavens. It is a flavorful, distinctive taste &amp; aroma that follows you through out the night. Its effects are pure mind: so focused on something until you realize it and then change focus to something new. Best strain for after your day is done or during the evening where you can sit back and relax, or creative new things. After 2 hours you can actually feel your body at peace and do something different from this point on and enjoy the strain while it effects change to a more subtle pace. The bad side of this is dry eyes and mouth, like if your being walking for days. but hey! NYC Diesel is for sure an awesome #CannabisExperience and @High_Bond approves it!! &#127872;

At 17% THC, you have just enough to enjoy but not pushing it.

VJeez, were do I begin? First, the stuff is STINKY. I got this from a dealer here in NYC, and man. Smells like a rotting skunk (an honest to goodness faint rotting smell). Hashy smoke, hazy immediate head high followed immediately with a pretty deep body stone. This stuff has been Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for me in the past, and here it is again living up to its reputation. Immediately relaxed, stress is gonezo, and it&#39;s funny, first thing I thought was, &quot;well, so much for that party I was going to..&quot;. One word: Spacey. I haven&#39;t kept a solid train of thought going for 15 minutes. Overall, I&#39;ve found this to be the most consistent strain in my limited experience, but I will say this much: any time I&#39;ve had it in the States, it was far better than what I smoked in Amsterdam. NYC Diesel smokes like it sounds: tough and persistent. I love it, but it&#39;s not for amateurs - can get you paranoid if you smoke too much. Anyway, viva la NYCD!

VSmoked a joint with my Homeskillet. I&#39;m about 15 minutes in to this wonderful euphoric adventure. I&#39;ve only recently been introduced to different strains. This has to be one of the best experiences thus far! I&#39;ve read the summary and couldn&#39;t place the grapefruit taste until I see it noted. Im really stoned now.. Thank you

VI smoke this stuff all the time. It&#39;s remarkably consistent, and doesn&#39;t leave you burned out, so it&#39;s a great all day strain. Comparable to Sour Diesel, but not as strong. Stinky as hell, really does smell like diesel fuel. Smooth on the smoke, hashy on the exhale. Creeps a little bit. Best way to describe it would be to call it a &quot;mood elevator&quot; - if you&#39;re stressed going in, you might freakout; if you&#39;re horny going in, well.. you get the picture. I can get pretty spacey with this stuff, so I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d recommend going to a party or anything, but not bad to smoke then go out to a bar late night where everyone&#39;s plowed anyway.

VGot this at Old Toby in Chehalis, WA. See pictures and detailed reviews on my blog - AgingEnt.com. --\u000a\u000aBrand: Twisted Sisters Gardens\u000aStrain: New York City Diesel\u000aSativa-dominant Hybrid\u000a--\u000aPotency Analysis: THC 22.4%\u000a--\u000aHarvested: 06/00/2015\u000aSmoked: 07/22/2015\u000a--\u000aPackaging: 2.25&quot; x 1.25&quot; clear plastic twist-off lid jar\u000aCost: $15/gram\u000aStore: Old Toby - Chehalis, WA\u000a--\u000aSeriously smells on this jar.  It&#39;s sweet, it&#39;s slightly tangy, there&#39;s cardamom and jasmine, there&#39;s a spicy basily scent real low.  Just smells all over the place - so many aromas that seem to just pulsate around these gorgeous buds.--\u000aBeautiful, spaced out Sativa nugget structure, and ridiculously tangible hairs.--\u000aThe flavors were herbal and spicy like the smell, but along with it was the taste of a late summer sunset.   This is some kind of magical.--\u000aMy body felt great and I was thinking well.  I didn&#39;t want to do much at all, even though I had to do some things.\u000a\u000aI later got some serious munchies.  I ate like a half pound of GORP.  And a blueberry granola bar.

VThis was great and worthy to try even at least once. The description from the original grower is exactly what it is if you google it, which shows the effort the growers put in out here. Its has grapefruit smell and a fruity subtle flavor.  Its not a 5 because I prefer creative, energetic , day time sativa strains but this was a great addition for the afternoon right before it gets dark. Its a great hybrid just a little stronger on the indica side than sativa. Stay up bros.. peace!

VGot this stuff from a buddy who grew it at his house. Really strong. A bit stronger than the plant he cloned it from. Not sure why that is.. but it&#39;s a bit atypical from any other NYCD I&#39;ve had. Buzz length is shorter, but the initial smoke is much stronger. Sits in your head like a cinder block, making your eyes very heavy, then moves to your body and makes camp there. Exceptionally even, smooth high without any burnout, with a nasty case of the munchies on the follow. This strain, in general, isn&#39;t for amateurs, and would be excellent for social anxiety syndrome as well as stress in general. Tough to concentrate, so movies are tough, but sports are great to watch.

Fast uplifting effects which make activities that can be routine like going to the gym, fun again or at least time flies and I get a lot done. That is what gives me the good comedown, otherwise I&#39;m using it a lot during the day, switching to some OG Kush or Gods gift if i&#39;m in real pain that night. \u000a Fun strain to be with good people.

VI suffer from chronic pain in my foot. I have rupters in both of my heels, the aftermath of plantar fasciitis. Imagine standing for about 15 minutes and gradually your heels feel as if they are stubs  and the ground is just below them. This strain greatly reduces the inflammation and makes it a little easier to maneuver around.  I feel no cannabis can cure it, but makes life a little easier when talking pain.  NYC diesel is one of the few stains that grants a large margin of relief from this pain. The cerebral plays more of an Indica role being rather absent minded but not too stupid. Overall great strain for inflammation.

No diesel in the smell or taste, both are pure funky grapefruit, The buds on the other show their sour heritage, knobby foxtails all over,only slighty condensed from the packing. The high was very hybrid stoney, Very mellow with head and body effects,great for getting ripped on a lazy day and chillin or boucon around doing aome light tasks.

Popcorn nugs that have little to no density, 10.3% THC .04% CBD. Main Street Marijuana usually has really good bud, but this stuff was fluffy and weak. I did get a pretty sweet deal on it though, definitely worth the money! Smells really good and it is fast-acting. But not very impressive effects even after a few bowls.

VPerfect daytime strain.  If you woke up in a bad mood, this strain will change that real fast!  Trust me.  You&#39;ll feel way better after a few good (vaporized) puffs.The feeling....a floaty energy.  I almost feel like exercising ( I said &quot;almost&quot;).  Anyway, I know it&#39;s not obvious from this review, but it did help with creativity....Pretty much erases anxiety.  I like being optimistic, and this strain is good for feeling positive about life.  I would buy it again for the euphoria alone.

VI think I was the only person I knew that didn&#39;t get caught up in the Sour Diesel craze. At that time, I had my favorite strains, and I didn&#39;t deviate much from them. So it being a Diesel baby didn&#39;t make me immediately have to have it. But a friend referred this strain, and I ended up really loving it! Everything about this strain is smooth, light, and airy. Uplifting, good pain relief, and mood enhancing with no couch lock, thank you Jesus! The odor has notes of sweet pine, citrus (lime/grapefruit), wood, and just a teensy bit earthy. The taste is crispy, and exactly what you&#39;d expect from the odor. The effect is multi-staged and very effective, but not overwhelming. Airy, cerebral, uplifting, focused, and functioning. I was able to get quite a few chores done with little interference from pain. Remained effective for approx 2 hrs, and I was then able to go about my day without the &quot;drained&quot; feeling afterwards. I am very impressed with this strain! Definitely worth getting again and again :)

VThis was a very weird sativa-dominant I smoked. I have horrendous illness whenever I smoke Indica, physically and mentally. At first it gives you a happy and excited buzz, not too strong but pleasant. It fades relatively quickly though and can leave you overthinking, paranoid, grumpy, etc. However, it makes you extremely hungry and quite aroused (my boyfriend and I both noticed this - I&#39;m female) \u000a\u000aI found this better for sleeping than Indica. \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend feels very much the same way. He has depression and anxiety and found this strain to be very unhelpful. He even went as far as to say he didn&#39;t like it that much. Personally, I feel like it just isn&#39;t that good of a sativa. It gave me more Indica effects but with a pounding heart and no lethargy or bad stomach. It didn&#39;t worsen by OCD but it didn&#39;t help at all. I felt weirdly anxious on this one and weirdly blank as well. I don&#39;t know why as I have had AK47 a much more powerful sativa-dominant with no poor effects at all. \u000a\u000aI do have to say that it does seem to be extremely good for nausea, IBS and even menstruation. I was surprised at how healthy I felt with it despite the rapid thinking. It is okay for gaming and relaxing but better used to dance and have fun or do something a little more active. It is also good for arousal and appetite problems. \u000a\u000aThe whole experience of this went from crippling excited happy etc to gradually over time worsening until I was left feeling quite stressed for no reason. At first it was good, not harsh but with a nasty petrol and chemical taste and smell. Almost a bit like ammonia. We always smoke from gravity bottles.\u000a\u000aIn general this is one of the worst strains I have tried purely because it just isn&#39;t that good, but I will gladly take it any day for OCD relief in comparison to how physically and mentally crippled Indica leaves me.

VI&#39;ve never been a Sativa kinda guy... until this strain! This NY Sour is really good! Taste is on point with a very sour pungent dankness that I&#39;ve never found in any other strain. It coated my mouth for a couple hours with a lingering taste that matched that sour smell. The high lasted only 2 to 2.5 hours but it was a focused euphoric stoney body high that had my lost in my work for the last 4 hours. I didn&#39;t get any kind of tired or groggy feeling. Not even now having worked outside (AZ) these last 4 hrs and now I&#39;m inside. Still feel great and awake and kicking. The buds are beautiful, sticky, fat, dense! Very awesome strain!

VI&#39;ve heard good things about this strain and I have to agree with all those good things. I tried a few grams of this one recently and really enjoyed the clean, balanced high. I was expecting more of the diesel to hit in this one, but it was subdued. The head high wasn&#39;t too racy and the body effects were long-lasting but not too heavy. \u000aThe dispensary I got this from didn&#39;t have the best quality, so I&#39;d like to try this again.

VOverall, I really enjoyed this strain! I picked it up from Green River Meds. The smell was really great and the taste was awesome. NYC Diesel is defiantly more of a sativa. The bud is dry; but, it&#39;s the perfect amount of dry! While grinding the nugs up, you hear a beautiful crunching noise, which is always awesome.  Personally, I found that the high from this strain, in particular, didn&#39;t last that long and I had to smoke a good amount to really feel it. However, NYC Diesel is a great strain I would forsure grab it again and I defiantly recommend to give it a try!

VThe look and smell of this strain sold me right away. Its buds were lush and colorful. The taste is citrusy and crisp with a good taste of diesel. Very smooth on the lungs. The best word to describe the high is cerebral. The mood is uplifting and happy. This strain is highly functional and ideal for daytime use. The perfect amount of euphoria brings you to a relaxed state with a nice body high as it runs its course. \u000a

V&quot;Oil made from the hands of the god&#39;s of the Universe&quot; This is how we at @High_Bond, celebrated the annual 710 (July 10th, 2017) with this oil/concentrate made by the heavens. It is a flavorful, distinctive taste &amp; aroma that follows you through out the night. Its effects are pure mind: so focused on something until you realize it and then change focus to something new. Best strain for after your day is done or during the evening where you can sit back and relax, or creative new things. After 2 hours you can actually feel your body at peace and do something different from this point on and enjoy the strain while it effects change to a more subtle pace. The bad side of this is dry eyes and mouth, like if your being walking for days. but hey! NYC Diesel is for sure an awesome #CannabisExperience and @High_Bond approves it!! &#127872;

VI originally was skeptical about this strain because the dispensary had a really good deal. However, it&#39;s become one of my favorite strains. It&#39;s got the sativa punch with a mellow body high. Very functional. My new favorite daytime hybrid. Too bad more stores don&#39;t carry this. I wish it was a California staple, along with GC, BD, GSC, etc.

VNYC diesel is a wonderful, sativa heavy, energetic strain.  I signed up for an account here because I take issue with the site&#39;s recommendation of this strain to anxiety prone patients. I would STRONGLY advise against panic attack or anxiety prone patients from using this strain.  It is one of the worst panic attack inducing strains in my experience.  That said, the high is wonderful and extremely energetic for those that don&#39;t suffer from anxiety.

VThe name belongs with this strain. The flavors are just as much of New York City you can get from marijuana. the diesel flavors taste of the streets and the city. The pungent aroma smells like a busy city. The slight sweetness is the excellent feeling of being in The Big Apple. This strain is a great medicine for anyone looking to be cool and relaxed while still having a good attention of your surroundings.

VI grew some autoflowering NYC Diesel, and wow!  It&#39;s the perfect combo of mellow &amp; uplifting without leaning too far in either direction.  Got both depression AND anxiety?  This is the strain for you, as it boosts energy &amp; motivation without triggering paranoia or negative thought loops at all.  It feels about 65% Sativa &amp; 35% Indica if I was guessing.  A perfect functional daytime smoke with absolutely no anxiety.  And that&#39;s coming from someone who gets pounding heart &amp; dry mouth from any amount of THC.\u000a\u000aThere is a little cognitive confusion with this strain, but nothing I can&#39;t handle.  TV shows &amp; conversations are hard to follow due to zoning out.  But there&#39;s virtually no couchlock or comedown, which is amazing if you suffer from fatigue/lethargy.  You will want to be active &amp; creative after a hit of NYCD, or at least let your mind wander among the clouds.\u000a\u000aThe smell profile is piney with citrus overtones &amp; a hint of grapefruit.  This is a beautifully colored strain with aquamarine buds, an abundance of orange hairs &amp; silvery trichome frost.

VGreat strain. Hits quickly. I only had to fill the vaporizer halfway and it lasted all night between myself and husband. Stand out effects were euphoria and major arousal. Also, I&#39;m not sure if this will be an isolated incident but I had NO MUNCHIES. I actually felt more full and even when fast food commercials came on (usually an instant catalyst to major munchies) I had no desire to eat. I&#39;ll have to see if this remains constant with this strain. Overall very enjoyable high for a mellow night of TV with the hubby.

VI felt pretty good on this but not SUPER energetic which is fine. I would probably smoke it towards the end of the day. It did make me a bit paranoid, not a huge amount but enough to make me not want to smoke it and go do stuff. Made me very inward- thinking a lot to myself and creative in that way.

VI&#39;m going to preface with this saying that I am a relatively new smoker (about 8 months), but I smoke quite a but (about 4-5 days a week). I purchased a vape because I had used one multiple times in the past. I got this strain as a cartridge for my Kindpen slim vape pen.  I smoked it 2 days in a row last but each time was only 1-3 hits because this cartridge is pretty potent at 80% THC. after the second day of smoking this, I felt high for 3 DAYS after! I felt like I was in a dream the entire time. I also a bit experiencing of paranoia and was hearing and seeing things that weren&#39;t there. It was actually pretty scary!\u000aI&#39;m confused as to why this strain affected me so intensely because I have a pretty high tolerance now. It&#39;s a bummer because I actually really enjoyed the initial high. It had me feeling light, painfree and energized. It&#39;s also a very social strain for me... I was laughing lots, talkative and engaging with people! The only reason why I gave it 1 star was because of the 3 day long high (with the exclusion of that, this is actually one of my favorite strains I&#39;ve smoked).\u000aSince then, I took one small hit of it yesterday and I had a mellow high which went away by this morning. I took two hits of it tonight so we&#39;ll see how I&#39;m feeling in the morning (Right now, I&#39;m feeling realllllllll good ;)   ).

VThe NYC Diesel I got from Med Oasis was as white as a widow or super silver haze. The trichome production on this strain was outragous. The scent and taste is very piney and the smoke is really smooth. The high is a very uplifting sativa that puts you in a good mood and gave me a great deal of motivation for the day. There is almost no trace of body high in this strain, so if you&#39;re looking for the exclusive mental experience this strain is for you. Great for day time and weekday activities. Won&#39;t put you out but is certainly a noticable head high. Great for listening to music and enjoying blue Colorado skies.

VI&#39;ve been smoking weed for years and this is the only strain that has made me, my sister, and work colleague freak out lmao. I&#39;m not sure if my bud was laced with some weird shit, but if you suffer from anxiety (even just a little) I would not recommend this strain. All 3 of us got really paranoid thoughts while on this and my sister and I both experienced some scary showers haha, the light in my bathroom blew so I lit up a heap of small candles and placed them on the floor, bench, and windowsill thinking it&#39;d be nice like a spa. Nope. I was dumb high and my phone was on some old classics radio station and all of a sudden &quot;ring of fire&quot; came on and I instantly thought I was a part of the &quot;final destination&quot; movie franchise as I looked through the steamy glass to see flames everywhere. I thought at any second the tea light candles were going to explode into a giant fireball and destroy my house, and I was too scared to skip the song in case it angered whatever higher being that was inflicting this terrifying situation onto me. At one point the shadows created by the candles even looked like a damn ghost boy. I have never been that scared of a shower in my life HAHA. Looking back on it now I was just waaaay too high but still, it was genuinely scary and I was scared to smoke this bud again. My sister had a similar situation when she also showered with candles after smoking and she thought she had gone to hell. Anyways, tasted good. Very potent, and also turned me into the funniest comedian on earth by the way my sister would laugh at me after we&#39;d smoked a bowl and ate dinner. I think there&#39;s a fine line between being in the best mood ever, and feeling like you&#39;re about to get robbed by shower demons, so be cautious that you don&#39;t go overboard with this stuff. Or just avoid showers and candles...
