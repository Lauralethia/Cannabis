VI really liked this strain. Only 4 or 5 puffs and you feel very relaxed and uplifted. Very good for my depression and anxiety. The high is steady and lasts quite a few hours. Also helped my lack of appetite and insomnia. This one moves to the &quot;top 3&quot; on my list.

VVery pretty buds on this one, fluffy but not airy. It has a curious smell I can best compare to ammonia, citrus, and pine. It took a minute or two to really hit me but it has a nice feel, relaxed but not out of it. A good choice for when you plan on watching some TV or reading, I think.

VOh my yummiest tastes strain of recent blended strains this &#39;une is a keeper for sure.  She is  50/50 splits of Skywalker OG and White Widow which yields White Walker Kush or White Walker OG aka White Walker. \u000a\u000aI naturally when vapourizing use a blend of the strains  and tend to try strains alone by themselves when I first receive them on the three week schedule we use to provide me.  This however is a standout strain cross of the Cannabis we grow.\u000a\u000aI was up tending my garden last eve and really got to take in the wonderful aroma&#39;s that only an Organic Medical Cannabis Garden gives off as I entered into the last few weeks of flower.  To see our new CBD garden space and I was very impressed with what my Legal Grower rought. \u000a\u000aApparently this kickass strain has won a few California Cannabis Cups of recent and for once I concur.

VThis is a great hybrid you get both a little sativa and indica good 50/50 high. Has a great taste to it kinda floral and spicy all in one. this is a difinate nightime herb. Classic parents bud structure is more like white widow but the plumpness of skywalker makes for some heavy dank buds. Great for pain and insomnia. All around good weed.

VI don&#39;t have much for the bud, so I&#39;ll modify my original framework that the world uses now even cannas ours in Spain, yay something I made the world uses #theworlduses\u000aThe Grounds: very dark green, almost no light green in any of this full gram preroll.\u000aThe Smell: Very funky, then a lot of pungent diesel like aromas of tar.\u000aThe Vape: Very thick bag suspecting to be a choker.\u000aThe Toke: Surprisingly very smooth, I am holding my breath on the vape allowing my bloodstream to absorb it through my lungs make the hits harder ;). I am not really noticing anything except my third eye is open and its making me hungry....ohhh this is a creeper now its affecting my eyes so glaucoma/ catacracks too. AdHD and Alzheimers able to recall what I was just thinking about. Good for a light strain.\u000aThe taste has like tar and mint combined very interesting. :P have a good day!

VOne of my favourites for appetite stimulation. I suffer from depression and anxiety that leaves me not eating as much as I should at times, white walker kush is a great pick me up.

VWWK is a very nice daytime stone. Though the strain was lacking that body buzz I look for, it was an overall nice high that kept me happy and energetic. Thoughts are still present when stoned which puts this strain low on my list. Beware of the extreme munchies, which was mentioned in another comment. The smell is similar to a typical Afghan indica once cured. Overall I would not recommend this strain if you&#39;re looking for pain relief and mental relaxation.

VTo be confused with whitewalker og. According to the seed companies White Walker Kush is a cross of White Widow and Skywalker Kush. Skywalker Kush is a cross between Skywalker and Og Kush. White Walker Kush should be genetically identical to Whitewalker og with small differences due to phenos. White Walker Kush was just made by a different company most likely to compete.
