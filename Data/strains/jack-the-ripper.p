VI got seriously ripped off JTR. She immediately ripped through my brain enhancing colors while bending my mind into a creative, cerebral concoction of uplifting bliss. When grown right this bud is straight dynamite. The smell is a very sharp, peppery, citrus musk with intense pungency. I found it great for creativity, elevating the body and mind, depression, fatigue, appetite and nausea

VEveryone has that strain they love and they love every strain it&#39;s mixed with.  That&#39;s how I feel about Jack The Ripper. For the longest time I couldn&#39;t find it but I kept finding strains that had JTR as one of the parent strains. Every single one I had I loved. Here are just a few some are even indicas. Agent Orange, 9 pound hammer, strawberry daiquiri, Mickey&#39;s Kush, and Jesus OG. I know there&#39;s a couple I&#39;m forgetting but you get the point.\u000aThis strain gives me energy without anxiety, relaxes me without couch lock, helps with my appetite without giving me full blown munchies, and it acts like an antidepressant.

VWent Picked this up from Clear Choice Collective in Tacoma Lakewood, WA Area. I liked it.. I travelled the wood&#39;s here in this rain forest type park area. Seemingly thing&#39;s got quite scary around these times of smoking my girlfriend came upon 666 3x&#39;s in 1 day at work with FXO. I felt like blurting thing&#39;s out lately I cannot keep a secret right now. I do have some anxiety. That might be because i just ran out of this stuff. This shit made things get scarier 3x as much as normal.. Freaked out at the park a little. I felt like dead bodies was buried in just footsteps away because the earth just looked so private and disgusting. This is WASHINGTON. Jack The Ripper made me want to watch some thrillers while on this stuff. Hence thy name.. It might have been all coincidental but man this strain was some fire from this place got a free Piece of glass as well. Will be creating a review for Clear Choice Collective being the most professional by far in this area.

VThis strain was really nice, although it is a Sativa, I found that it was making me sleepier than some of my indicas, I felt for me personally this is not a strain I would want to go to work or socialize with people who I should not be high in front of.\u000a\u000aI would definitely say this is more of a play games or watch movies type of strain, I personally just don&#39;t feel it&#39;s a day time strain for myself but others have good results with it so go for it. 4/5 stars just because I was hoping to use it and go out and about but instead a point 4 killed me for awhile lol.

VSkunky, medium vape, but lingers for a bit. Has a sweet citrus smell, leafy buds but can be compact. Nice happy thoughts while the stress goes away and my energy comes back. Visually laggyness, bright colors seem to pop more, clear headed. Great for pain hunger or energy recommend it for sativa vacations. Very dry mouth and eyes not so much the paranoia or dizziness. Would be better if the taste was so skunky. I like a lot of the interesting flavors like tar diesel, honey, ect. Perfect before a sunset. Has a relaxing feeling along with some body buzz, and some day dreaming very interesting.

VJTR is a delightful strain perfectly suited for day-time use. The effects are quick to onset, ripping through the mind with an uplifting euphoria, leaving the user in a state of bliss. The heady effects of this strain seem to be concentrated in the forehead and neck, but a subtle feeling of relaxation is noticeable throughout the body. A particularly aromatic strain which will fill the room with a bold citrus scent, however a pungent earthy aroma is also present. A powerful citrus taste is also noticed at first, and is followed by a faint spicy yet sour flavour.  The ideal choice for anyone needing a potent day-time medication.

VI noticed that this has a very nice sweet lemon smell. After I took a few tokes of this strain. I didn&#39;t notice anything at all and then it slowly starting to come onto my cerebral cortex that it eased into my body. It is one of the more relaxing city because that leaves you in a positive mood. taste however is very skunk and would very funky. I would say I&#39;ve gone a phenotype of the Jack the Ripper. Although I&#39;ve never had Jack the Ripper and this is my first time having it. Even for its phenotype I should still resemble some of the Effect from its parents. If you have an hour or two to spare I would say first trying a little bit and if you like how it affects you do a little bit more it&#39;s all about dosage and control with the strength I would say a little bit goes a long way.

VDefinitely not a strain for the first time smoker. The high from JTR gets pretty standard to the point that about 20 minutes into smoking I often find myself saying \u201cthere\u2019s Jack\u201d as the paranoia and anxiety kick in. Definitely a high anxiety high paranoia strain. JTR, however, was still a great strain and will be kind to the experienced consumer. I\u2019ve found that JTR can be all things to you if you let it: if you want to go on an adventure it\u2019s great, if you want to turn into a vegetable and watch tv it\u2019s great, this strain is even great for taking an intense nap. Would give 4.5 if possible but I can\u2019t so a 4 it is.

VA cross between Jack&#39;s Cleaner and Space Queen this strain has natural uplifting tendencies. Often described as potent and fast acting. The blended aroma of lemon and pineapple that wafts from its resin-heavy buds is carried over to its taste as well, and its subtle relaxation does not dampen the motivation one expects from a Sativa-dominant hybrid.

VSmoked this strain via a bong and with raw papers. Had a delicious smell and taste. Smoked evenly in both a bowl and wrapped up. Ground well and fluffy. \u000a\u000aI haven&#39;t smoked a lot lately so this strand seemed to hit me harder than most. However, I was feeling euphoric and energetic as the page suggests. \u000a\u000aAlso, I&#39;m not sure how helpful this is, but I felt extremely paranoid for a while during me session. Convinced myself I had ARDS and it was scary. Haha. \u000a\u000aOther than that, extremely quality strain!

Vmy brother gave me a jack the ripper seedling this year an I had the pleasure of growing this girl out, I grew in organic soil an fed her nothing but organic nuits. Ah The smell of this plant was amazing such a nice lemony citrus smell that just threw it&#39;s self into your nostrils, an the taste of the bud is amazing as well it taste like earthy lemons, if you understand that you know what I&#39;m talking about. The high of this herb is great, after half a joint it&#39;s a full effect of a soaring sativa but no too overwhelming it&#39;s a perfect mix of psychoactive head an a tingly body, not once did a feel tired smoke jtr. Jack the ripper is in my stash jar always. I would recommend this strain to a veteran smoker an a newby.

VThe worst strain I have ever tried. Very dirty high. I tried it two times both with amazingly weird results. It&#39;s almost in the category of &#39;its so bad it&#39;s good&#39;. Truly a strain that has earned its name. I see a lot of people saying it isn&#39;t for new smokers and I agree and just want to add that it isn&#39;t for anyone and it&#39;s a sh*t strain.\u000a\u000aFirst time I smoked it, it was too much. Made it very hard to get over the buzzing. Very hard to get anything done. Very hard to speak. But also made you want to move around. Made me hungry and forget I even cooked anything, thank god I left the burner off.\u000a\u000aSecond time was funny. Me and my roommate smoked it because he wanted to see how bad it was. He was like, &quot;It&#39;s not that bad.&quot; and went to bed. Then came out of the room screaming about a bee. We were both stoned and you can imagine what it looked like. So he had already took out his screen and messed up his room trying to get rid of it. Turns out it was just a moth. But it was some sort of weird underworld magic to be sure.\u000a\u000aLong story short, try it if you dare.

VJack the Ripper was one of those strains that completely surprised me.  It was very potent, and stayed at a good strong head high for a couple hours.  Not only did I have a great constant high, I felt like moving and getting things done. It&#39;s a great strain if you have a day off for work but still want to make something of your day. I gave it a 9 out of 10 mainly because of how potent it was, and the high, not a full 10 only because I like a brittle keify weed.

To build some background I&#39;m a daily smoker, wake and bake and smoke all day kind of guy. I waited until 1pm to smoke on an empty stomach. I packed a pre rolled RAW cone and went for it. Focusing on the effects: the high came on as previously mentioned, a very clear high. Then all of a sudden it was just excitement and euphoria. I AM HAPPY. I feel extremely content and focused, very chatty as well. Jack the Ripper is a new favorite.

VI had wanted to try this strain purely because of its name, and I was very surprised at how quickly it met my expectations. I smoked it from a pipe and the high came on very quickly. It is a very heavy head hitter (alliteration ha), and was great for watching comedy, and also reading. It definitely reduced my anxiety. At times, it became difficult to focus on one thing for a significant period of time. It is, nevertheless, a strain I will purchase on a regular basis.

VOne of my all time Favorites  Jack The Ripperrrrrrrr made by one of Washingtons finest breeders!!! One of TGA Subcools best genetics to date and if you can fine the ultra rare Pink Lemonade Phenotype you are in for a spectacular treat! The standard more readily available phenotype of JTR is fantastic as well! A citrus sweet 70% sativa that has a wonderful Jacks Cleaner high. Very few Washington recreational producers are producing Jack the Ripper so next time you see it give this well rounded sativa a try!

At first I thought I was getting high, but then I waited it out and snap there you go, you have a eureka moment and you&#39;re blown. Has nice orange hairs, with a decent amount of trichomes on the the leaves. Decent looking strain, not anything special, but still dank. Sativa dominant will have you thinking.

I suppose.\u000aUm I like uppers and I didn&#39;t feel like this raised energy but it also didn&#39;t make me sleepy so it wasn&#39;t doing its job and I get overwhelmed easily so I didn&#39;t enjoy the high but the rest was alright and soothed me. But all weed is soothing.

VOne of my all time Favorites  Jack The Ripperrrrrrrr made by one of Washingtons finest breeders!!! One of TGA Subcools best genetics to date and if you can fine the ultra rare Pink Lemonade Phenotype you are in for a spectacular treat! The standard more readily available phenotype of JTR is fantastic as well! A citrus sweet 70% sativa that has a wonderful Jacks Cleaner high.

Vmy brother gave me a jack the ripper seedling this year an I had the pleasure of growing this girl out, I grew in organic soil an fed her nothing but organic nuits. Ah The smell of this plant was amazing such a nice lemony citrus smell that just threw it&#39;s self into your nostrils, an the taste of the bud is amazing as well it taste like earthy lemons, if you understand that you know what I&#39;m talking about. The high of this herb is great, after half a joint it&#39;s a full effect of a soaring sativa but no too overwhelming it&#39;s a perfect mix of psychoactive head an a tingly body, not once did a feel tired smoke jtr. Jack the ripper is in my stash jar always. I would recommend this strain to a veteran smoker an a newby.

VJack the Ripper is the most effective strain I&#39;ve used in trying to manage depression. After smoking I feel sociable and slightly uplifted, encouraging me to go out and interact with people. Definitely helps with depression; the only strain I&#39;ve tried that does. Warning: don&#39;t start watching a movie on TV or something because you will watch all of it.

VOkay, this is an update on a previous review. Really had a good chance to judge Jack the Ripper just now and WOW. To build some background I&#39;m a daily smoker, wake and bake and smoke all day kind of guy. I waited until 1pm to smoke on an empty stomach. I packed a pre rolled RAW cone and went for it. Focusing on the effects: the high came on as previously mentioned, a very clear high. Then all of a sudden it was just excitement and euphoria. I AM HAPPY. I feel extremely content and focused, very chatty as well. Jack the Ripper is a new favorite.

VLoud. This strain actually rips, I love a nice sativa for outdoor activities and this was perfect for just walking along with my bubbler. I had a weird feeling of a pressure around my head,  If you&#39;ve ever smoked headband you will recognize it. It was super super pleasant. Very happy thoughts and also a very anxiety inducing energetic high lots of fear sometimes (which I personally love)

VThe bud looks extremely mattered when you first see it, commonly people will point out the hilt lining like substances that spirals around the bud. \u000a\u000aThe smell is that of a very pungent lemon must. If you only smelled this bud, you would think you had lemon haze, however the mustiness can be the best indicator of the smell. \u000a\u000aJtR smokes like an absolute champion. This is one of the best strains  of marijuana in my opinion. This bud does put you into a very ripped state, and first time users often smoke too much before the bud starts creeping. JtR is about ten - fifteen minutes late on its full blast high delivery. Once this kicks in you automatically feel very high, and very uplifted at the same time. I love to relax and listen to music on the bud.

After I stopped coughing, i realized this was some above average stuff,  I quickly took another hit and held it in for 5-7 seconds, this boosted my high tremendously.  After two hits, i was really high and happy i might add.  I finished that bowl and went over to a friends house and stayed pretty high the whole time.  Strains like these always put a smile on a stoners face.  9 out of 10 just because i had better but i definatley wouldnt pass up on this strain if its in your area.

VJack the Ripper was one of those strains that completely surprised me.  It was very potent, and stayed at a good strong head high for a couple hours.  Not only did I have a great constant high, I felt like moving and getting things done. It&#39;s a great strain if you have a day off for work but still want to make something of your day. I gave it a 9 out of 10 mainly because of how potent it was, and the high, not a full 10 only because I like a brittle keify weed.

We were on our way to see TMNT at the New Beverly, and I hit the J my beloved had rolled earlier that day, while in the car on the freeway(I was not driving!). 10 minutes later I was in 4 different time zones mentally. I was still at his house in bed(fantasy). I was in the car stuck in traffic headed to LA (reality). I was on the side of the road, waiting for a cop to help us with the accident we&#39;d been in. Trying to think of how to talk to the cops while I was so monumentally high(paranoid fantasy). And I was sitting in the theater, watching the 35mm print of TMNT(fantasy). \u000aOverall, it was really cool, but a little terrifying. Too intense for this big baby!\u000aJack ripped my time line.

VA cross between Jack&#39;s Cleaner and Space Queen this strain has natural uplifting tendencies. Often described as potent and fast acting. The blended aroma of lemon and pineapple that wafts from its resin-heavy buds is carried over to its taste as well, and its subtle relaxation does not dampen the motivation one expects from a Sativa-dominant hybrid.

At first I thought I was getting high, but then I waited it out and snap there you go, you have a eureka moment and you&#39;re blown. Has nice orange hairs, with a decent amount of trichomes on the the leaves. Decent looking strain, not anything special, but still dank. Sativa dominant will have you thinking.

Oh man. I thought I was going to have a chill day off, smoked a lot and got a call from work a stressful one. and I couldn&#39;t ditch the fealing after that, I was  way stressed, a heavy stress. once my anxiety started it was hard to re direct. but before I got that call I was awesome

The bud structure is very dense bright green in color absolutely sticky with resin and the smell of citrus and lemon really jump out whenever I crack open the jar. The upbeat euphoric nature of this strain may cause some people with anxiety issues a bit of a problem but not sure about that, just a guess.

VI&#39;m pretty cerebral and active and prefer sativas. This here is nice: it came on slow. I hit my pipe a couple of times, took a little break, then hit it again. The high rolled in like a big wave of light water. I feel brilliant, euphoric. This is great for my depression, and it energizes me -- gives me not only ideas but the energy to make them happen. I can&#39;t see trying to take a nap right now; this isn&#39;t a bedtime med. But I&#39;m just sure that this will forever be one of my main daytime meds.

VDef. some lemon there. the color is light green almost white in part. decent amount of trichromes, in clusters on the buds and sweet leaf. this batch was def. done right and most def. dry&#39;d/cured right. the high is one of my new favorites, great head high, uplifting, clear headed, creative, non drowsey. and it had a satisfying body stone to go along with it. a hybrid done well.

VI am very pleased with this strain from my local access point! It has one of my favorite strains in its genetics: Jack&#39;s Cleaner. You can smell the pine sol odor and taste it as well. Also a very deep fruity, piney smell to this strain. This particular batch has incredible looking buds - very dense, tight, bud COVERED in crystals just begging to be enjoyed. Tiny wisps of red hairs extend throughout, but not too much. This is one amazing strain. Creates a great change of head space along with a tingly body feeling. I highly recommend this if you come across it :-)\u000a\u000aOne love...EuphoricVoyage...

VJTR-Grown with Pro Mix and Advanced Nutrients- Smells like citrus pinesol. A blend of grapefruit, orange, and chemical. The buds are medium sized, dense with a long narrow shape. Light green with frosty white trichs and orange hairs. The effects of the strain are speedy almost hyper, clear headed with a medium body high. (Hallucinations available in high doses.) This strain makes people talkative and social. Smells amazing in the jar. Tastes great with a sharp sour citrus flavor that makes your mouth water even on the last hit of the bowl.

VNice, but not heavy head high. Relaxed non-racy feel for a Sativa for me. Kind of hits quick and falls off quickly. Nice soreness relief after a long swim, but still giving me good energy. Great! A 5 star has to wow me, this was close 4.25. And my first review, which should tell you something.

VSmoked two different grows of this strain, one grow gave me pretty bad anxiety, might have been due to how much of a creeper this strain is, didn&#39;t see it coming.. Second time around it made me feel great, very relaxed but energetic at the same time. Very good strain, however my eyes were bloodshot to hell, even after using eye drops, both times. And my eyes don&#39;t usually get very red. Makes me a little paranoid in public but i don&#39;t think that&#39;s from the weed, just my eyes hahaha..  Very good strain 8/10.

VThe bud looks extremely mattered when you first see it, commonly people will point out the hilt lining like substances that spirals around the bud. \u000a\u000aThe smell is that of a very pungent lemon must. If you only smelled this bud, you would think you had lemon haze, however the mustiness can be the best indicator of the smell. \u000a\u000aJtR smokes like an absolute champion. This is one of the best strains  of marijuana in my opinion. This bud does put you into a very ripped state, and first time users often smoke too much before the bud starts creeping. JtR is about ten - fifteen minutes late on its full blast high delivery. Once this kicks in you automatically feel very high, and very uplifted at the same time. I love to relax and listen to music on the bud.

It&#39;s also good at night to chill with, ease anxiety while reading , talking to a friend or just watching a movie. The only down side is the pain relief effects and overall it just doesn&#39;t last as long as some other strains. However it&#39;s worth it, so I still gave it 5 stars. It&#39;s a strain I will definitely buy on a regular basis. Love the chill but energetic feeling.

VI tried this last night and overindulged by accident. Didn&#39;t think a sati and would hit as hard as this one did in the Stoney feeling I got. I&#39;m not an everyday smoker so my tolerance isn&#39;t as high as some. I don&#39;t feel swag weed anymore really but I still have a  medium tolerance medicating 2-4 times a week. 4 bong hits made me puke. Smell pungent sour candy lemons. Taste was sour as well and a bit harsh on the exhale not much though. I was drinking grapefruit juice but I think JTR left a sour tart taste in my mouth I liked. Again coulda been the ruby red juice. It&#39;s more powerful than any Indication dominant strain I&#39;ve had in a while. Cured perfect , grown in organic soil so taste n smell were spot on. I think another week of cure and the smell will hit you from across the room I still had to sniff the jar from a few feet away to get the full smell. I&#39;ve had other TGA strains but never their flagship strain and wish I would have tried it 1st. I don&#39;t give 5 stars out to just any strain but this one is unique and in a lower dose hopefully I can handle it better. Not for the light weight and it lasts 4ever. I&#39;m still feeling it a little. The THC must me really high I don&#39;t know how to check it but if you like strong sativa dominant strains you have to try this one. Head stash weed for me. &#128293;

VYou get up, get ready to leave your spot and you realized you have been zoned out for a while and you are just like shit I&#39;m high af. You start lagging like a mf and time seems so slow, visually too with the lags. About 30 minutes later once the lag wears off it&#39;s really enjoyable not too heavy your happy uplifted and just having a great time but it all comes in stages. Munchies aren&#39;t too bad but you still pretty hungry. Smells like lemon and skunk. First time I ever smoked I smoked this I got pretty freaked with the lags and feeling like it wasn&#39;t real. Awesome with nic. Super euphoric with nicotine works amazingly.

I can&#39;t blame the dispensary for it, I&#39;m just guessing it&#39;s not going to work for me and never will. Oh well, it&#39;s back to Durban Poison during the day from now on and Granddaddy Purple at night.

VJack the ripper is one of those creeper sativa strains, although its not lemon tasting more of the skunk taste and flavor for this one. It still has a nice warm an uplifting feel to it. It&#39;s great if you&#39;re a mess and can&#39;t seem to find a starting point. It has a golden memory feeling its like revisiting a wonderful place again there are memories that stick with us forever. Jack is great if you can&#39;t seem to open your self up. Great for depression and mood changer for sure. Not to mention head and spinal cord pain.
