VOkay so I tried this one at the suggestion of a budtender and am I ever glad I did. At first glance this bud looks dark, but if you look at it under a light it sparkles giving off a purple hue.   The bud broke up beautifully, and smelled\u000amusky and earthy with a sweet, earthy flavour.   This strain relaxed my whole body, silenced my ever moving mind,  and helped me get ready for sleep. It also assisted with pain relief.   After smoking, I felt content and okay, despite all the stress I am going through in my life.  For me this strain is perfect for watching tv after a long day of work.  I could see if I smoked this during the day that it might cause giggles, but that is not the affect I had when I smoked at 9pm at night.  The munchies also, were not an issue.  I have to say, this is now one of my all time favs.

VGot this bud a while back from a local dispensary, smoked a little today with another patient. Wasn&#39;t as potent as the medical I had but had pretty much the same effects, maybe less intense. But I smoked it, got medicated after a few bowls and bong rips and went straight to my bed and turned on Weeds. Got the munchies, and they were getting bad but I didn&#39;t want to get out of bed so I grabbed sunflower seeds on my night stand and peeled them open at first, but I was so hungry and too cozy to get out of bed so I called  my little brothers cell and had him get me some cookies, the hot cheetos, one of my ice cream twix and a banana lol and paid him a dollar. Got caught up in watching 2 seasons of weeds back to back, laughed at alot of the shit on that show.. freakin funny and fell asleep and woke up in the middle of the night an the TV was still on and like season 5 was playing and I knocked out before turning of the DVD and TV and room light not to mention!

VMy questions.... Will I laugh more and Will I have the munchies? (fyi I love to laugh and eat)\u000aAfter two hits off my pipe, I started watching Portlandia. Half hour goes by and I realized the strain could not make that program funny to me.\u000a I walked into my kitchen and went through my full cabinets &amp; fridge. I have homemade tamales, cereal, chips and even small cute chocolate &amp; strawberry donuts....nothing called out to me...I just wanted to relax, not watch moving pictures, not eat anything and write this review.\u000a\u000aokay so an hour and a half went by and I decided to smoke again but this time twice as much. Results were different... I ate a dozen carmels (not typical for me) and I had a bowl of tomatoes, basil &amp; mozzarella. I did yoga/dance for half hour then painted for 2 hours straight with increased focus powers :) Sadly I never got the giggles ;( oh I did freak myself out with my own shadow and I thought I heard a scary voice while I was listening to music w/ headphones. Overall I really enjoyed this strain and will smoke again. Next time I will be watching some funny SNL skits to put it to the test.

VLineage: Blackberry Kush x Diamond OG\u000aThis is certainly the diamond in the rough, with its glitter frosting and purple buds throughout. It has a unique nose, it has a complex earthiness that has notes of deep red wine, almost like a funky French Bourdeaux. On the palate, Black Diamond is smooth and continues to develop the earthiness from the nose into a bolder musky flavor with subtle berry hints. Despite being a potent Indica, this strain is great for socializing and it&#39;s one of the great laughter/giggle inducing strains making it perfect for relaxing with friends. Black Diamond also is a great appetite stimulator, which is perfect for those seeking that medicinal aspect, but fair warning to all others- this strain will give you the munchies! You can expect a happy relaxed euphoric high that&#39;s perfect for nighttime use, medicinally Black Diamond is great for stress relief, depression, pain management, appetite stimulation and digestive issues, insomnia, PTSD and anxiety.

VSupposed to be 5 STARS not one. \u000a\u000a\u000aBeautiful high. Opiate-like. Def a Sunday afternoon smoke. Wouldn\u2019t recommend as a W&amp;B or casual blaze. This shit is strong. Amazing smell and taste. Diesel, earthy, dark and rich smell I\u2019ve come to enjoy. Unlike anything I\u2019ve ever had.\u000a\u000a A bit harsh on the throat, even when vaped. Nonetheless, Couchlock is complete and total. Body high is amazing with fully relaxed muscles which is a godsend for someone with PTSD like myself. Really sands down all the jagged edges of your day and dampens the hyperarousal. \u000a\u000aHead was a bit fuzzy but in a very good way. Had a South Park marathon and almost pissed myself laughing. Really brings out laughter and a good mood, which is why I blaze. Arguably the best strain I\u2019ve ever had.

VOne of my favorite strains. Picked this up on accident but was actually really stoked. Sweet and Woody taste, a few bong rips and my anxiety completely melted away, relaxing, positivity, heavy eyes,  but clear-headed, focused and could talk, totally dealt with breaking up with someone on this, and honestly felt calm and content. Really relaxing\u200b and chill. Would recommend to someone looking for the indica feel without the paralysis or paranoia.

Vafterwards a couple more sessions with this strain I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s very sedative to a moderate extent I can say it&#39;s tasty and good to run through a pipe as well however after smoking on it for a while the high is captivated by extreme sleepiness and will knock you out for a very long time if uninterrupted I slept from 6:30pm-6:30 am shortly after I put down the pipe. overall it&#39;s a nice unwinding strain at the end of the day however I think kosher kush or blue dream might be more for a relaxed feel personally the name is really cool but don&#39;t get too excited I would definitely say it&#39;s the perfect buzz and strain for someone with insomnia however I noticed it to be good at numbing pain as well slightly with a little bit of eye pressure not one of my favorites but definitely the strain to put me to bed for a long time so in conclusion I&#39;d say the buzz is alright not the best indica high out there by any means but it&#39;s medicinal value and high thc content makes it a fantastic medical strain for insomniacs and anxiety stricken people alike if you buy this strain because it has a bad ass name you will be very disappointed

VVery similar to Black Domina, Black Diamond is a divine strain. Although it&#39;s an indica, this plant gives a very focused functional high. Intense muscle relaxation with a heavy couchlock in higher doses. The world becomes funnier, food tastes better, and colors have never been richer.\u000aFollow me on IG @weedtalkmtl for more cannabis culture and content.

VThe strain I smoked was 11%.  I found this to be a great percentage for an Indica strain, as it did not leave me overwhelmingly couch locked or fatigued.  This strain is ideal for an end of night smoke that will facilitate sleep without knocking you out.  Black Diamond will definitely give you the munchies.  The product I purchased did not exactly meet the expectations I had from other reviews, however, I believe that a more lengthy Cure process would significantly improve the affects of this strain.  I will purchase this strain again in the future to see how it compares.  Overall I recommend.

V4.5 is the correct rating. Black diamond is a great strain but not my favorite probably because I like to be faded to the extreme.\u000a\u000aThe head high is mild. It stimulates the mind and keeps you focused enough to have a conversation and is very good if you have &quot;brain fog&quot;. \u000a\u000aThere is a mild body high but you can still function with black diamond however beware that if you lay down and get comfy you will drift off into a wonderful sleep. Keep the dosage small if sleep is NOT what you aim for. \u000a\u000aThis strain is also good for pain and headaches but I will say there are other strains I&#39;d recommend for these ailments over black diamond &#128142; \u000a\u000aThankfully this child to the stain blackberry does not cause headaches like it&#39;s parent does &#129316;

V This is a great strain for anyone who enjoys sleep, in the one bowl I smoked I&#39;ve already put away half a bag of gummy worms and a bowl of rice with chicken, mind you it&#39;s only been 4 minutes, the bud doesn&#39;t carry a harsh feel either it&#39;s actually very smooth and has a piney yet sweet taste, has a nice couch lock feel to it I keep catching myself staring off at things that in any other case wouldn&#39;t be interesting, great strain gotta love it

VRelieved my headache and nausea quickly and efficiently which was most of what I was looking for, but a bit more spacey than indicas typically are for me.  Also had a bit more of an anxious side, didn&#39;t have quite the usual &quot;everything is as it should be feel&quot; that I turn to indicas for.\u000a\u000aMight have made me a bit more hungry than I&#39;d care for, but definitely not too much as I&#39;ve had some strains do, and appetite is an effect I do seek out, so this is overall a plus.\u000a\u000aI did find it to be a very compliant high:  I decided to play video games, and I had enough energy and focus for video games; I wanted to clean up a bit, and was gathering things up before I knew it.\u000a\u000aOverall for me: a pleasant enough high, a bit happy, not relaxed, euphoric or giggly though, a strain that will get me &quot;there&quot;, but not a favorite from this experience.

VFirst felt in the head. Comes on at a reasonable pace. Brain grows more and more distant similar to Sour Diesel\u2019s goneness. There\u2019s a full bodied unsettledness all the way to the core as well as mental space. Hardly any mood elevation save for a mild serenity and Buddhist-like focus on the moment. Very aware and in control of what you\u2019re doing, making it ideal for physical tasks, hobbies, and sports. Music is...ok, in that it\u2019s definitely a new experience, but it\u2019s tempered more than improved. Unfortunate amount of reasons not to recommend this one. Mostly I just can\u2019t get past how dower it is. Who wants that?

VA flavourful smoke that seems to lean toward the hybrid-end of Indica. I feel I know my Indica strains pretty well and if I had smoked this for my first time before reading its profile here, I would have said it feels like a 60/40 Ind-dom. If you have a chance to vape this strain, do it! The flavour is a wonderful thing. With the sample I had, the gardener certainly knew their science. A perfect strain for social situations - enjoyable with laughter coming easily. A very psychedelic high for an Indica. Unless it were all I had, I wouldn&#39;t choose to smoke this strain on my own. I end up with too much going on in my head. In a social setting it&#39;s completely different (this one is, for me, dependant on set and especially setting more than virtually any other strain I can think of) ... different in a great, often refreshing - again, leaning toward the more psychedelic - way. 3.8/5.

VMust read for anyone who trips out while smoking.\u000a\u000aI been smoking weed for about 5 months now every evening but I usually twitch, have bad thoughts, feel dysfunctional, slur my words and feel super paranoid. \u000a\u000aUntil I tried Black Diamond. I felt exceptional, happy, content, focused, tingly, relaxed!!! I felt the way I imagine my friends feel when they smoke. I smoked it a few nights in a row and felt the same each evening, it was great. Not to mention, a wonderful sleep. I&#39;m told I think about my high to much and that&#39;s why I get paranoid and I see my friends acting so normal. However this is not the case, I go into hitting my bong with the same mind set each evening and Black Diamond treated me well. It&#39;s not the thoughts in my head, its the stain and I&#39;m very pleased with Black Diamond =)

VDefinitely an earthy taste but very smooth. I can quickly feel the indica effects, very relaxing but at the same time my mind is going very fast. I feel like I will slowly melt into sleep, I wish I had a massage right now haha. It feels easy to breathe, stretch and meditate. Going for the second hit: Listening to Sunny by Boney M. it sounds peculiar and I like it. I find it easy to focus and become immersed in thought. Ate a clementine, very juicy and tasty. Took a third  hit: Stairway to Heaven is now playing, amazing song.senses feel amplified, specially touch and hearing. I will definitely be taking a last toke or two before sleeping and I&#39;m sure it will be some great sleep. Highly recommended for muscle pain, insomnia and stress!

V4.7/5 - great strain. It&#39;s an indica, but seems more like a hybrid. But I tend to use indicas most. So this was a good during the day for me. Gave a general happy feeling. Good to binge watch shows lol. \u000aGreat flavor too. Little diesel, little berry. Mellow. Highly recommend. But probably not to newbies.

VWhat a strain!!\u000aThis is by far one of the best strains I&#39;ve had. I got it from Chubby&#39;s MedHouse in Montclair, Ca. It smells fantastic with and an almost pine and spice smell, the nugs are medium sized, and sticky as can be. Also it holds an ember like no other, very convenient if you&#39;re using the bong or passing it around. The flavor is basically spot on to the leafly description, which I really enjoyed. Definitely a 5 star review! And I will definitely get some more of this! Highly recommend this strain for people who want a nice mellow high, to help them go to sleep.

I feel like I will slowly melt into sleep, I wish I had a massage right now haha. It feels easy to breathe, stretch and meditate. Going for the second hit: Listening to Sunny by Boney M. it sounds peculiar and I like it. I find it easy to focus and become immersed in thought. Ate a clementine, very juicy and tasty. Took a third  hit: Stairway to Heaven is now playing, amazing song.senses feel amplified, specially touch and hearing. I will definitely be taking a last toke or two before sleeping and I&#39;m sure it will be some great sleep. Highly recommended for muscle pain, insomnia and stress!

VA flavourful smoke that seems to lean toward the hybrid-end of Indica. I feel I know my Indica strains pretty well and if I had smoked this for my first time before reading its profile here, I would have said it feels like a 60/40 Ind-dom. If you have a chance to vape this strain, do it! The flavour is a wonderful thing. With the sample I had, the gardener certainly knew their science. A perfect strain for social situations - enjoyable with laughter coming easily. A very psychedelic high for an Indica. Unless it were all I had, I wouldn&#39;t choose to smoke this strain on my own. I end up with too much going on in my head. In a social setting it&#39;s completely different (this one is, for me, dependant on set and especially setting more than virtually any other strain I can think of) ... different in a great, often refreshing - again, leaning toward the more psychedelic - way. 3.8/5.

VA very pungent smelling dense purple nug that I&#39;d recommend grinding very finely for maximum flavour.

The flavour is smooth with a powerful floral mango with undertones of nuts and pine cones. \u000a\u000aI like the level headed high thats fairly euphoric and relaxing while still keeping me lifted. Real mong behind the eyes with this one, it lays you almost horizontal. great for cruising on a longboard with some music in your ears.

I felt exceptional, happy, content, focused, tingly, relaxed!!! I felt the way I imagine my friends feel when they smoke. I smoked it a few nights in a row and felt the same each evening, it was great. Not to mention, a wonderful sleep. I&#39;m told I think about my high to much and that&#39;s why I get paranoid and I see my friends acting so normal. However this is not the case, I go into hitting my bong with the same mind set each evening and Black Diamond treated me well. It&#39;s not the thoughts in my head, its the stain and I&#39;m very pleased with Black Diamond =)

Vsometimes &#39;as advertised&#39; is a good thing.  the Leafly review is very accurate.  Sociable, euphoric, hungry. This isn&#39;t the &#39;sexiest&#39; strain, its not too extreme in any of its affects, its just good quality bud.  Not overwhelming, but certainly not lacking either.  The only thing i&#39;d caution is if you&#39;re looking for more classical indica affects, this will disappoint you a little.  If my opinion mattered (which it doesn&#39;t !) i&#39;d put this in the hybrid category.  No couchlock, not a big physical high, but makes movies, videogames, conversations, chores fun and fly by.  At the end of the night it will help you with sleep.  Overall, do not shy away from this if you&#39;re looking for a indica dominant hybrid experience.  If you&#39;ll looking for that dank knock-you-off-your- feet indica, this isn&#39;t it, but it&#39;s certainly &#39;as advertised&#39;.

VThe rare short &amp; sweet review much like the strain Black Diamond OG.  Short period of time before my head hit the pillow albeit not for sleep necessarily more to indulge in a good veg out.  For me sometimes that mellow lost in a few different arenas maybe tv, writing, texting, munching out all the while with the occasional toke, drift off into sleep waking up minutes later well rested with a simple choice to do more of the same recharging veg or step back into reality outside of my bliss.  The nice thing is this strain does have a bit of a hangover so the user is bound to drag some droopy eyed dreaminess into the next day.  Can be tricky if bordering on depression so beware in that sense &amp; also is heavy on the munchies so use accordingly.\u000a\u000aShort &amp; Sweet, ha-ha.  Well I will keep my word (or less of them as is the case :) for sweet saying this flower is very much so.  And a little tart too.
