VJust tried my first bowl of organic Grapefruit Kush as recommended to me by my friend. Very distinct grapefruit aroma and flavor. It is sweet and a little creamy. The high comes on in a straightforward, yet easy manner. It feels simultaneously invigorating yet calming and eases into a peaceful sense of focus.

VA most interesting strain. I was provided this bud from EHC and it was a perfectly cured little flower.  I made this into an edible.  The effects came on slow but steady.  Started out in that uncomfortable, woah this is new, kind of feeling but was replaced by a very nice relaxation that was in my legs and arms.\u000aHead was very clear, not heady at all but also not a couch locker.  Could have done a lot if I wanted to.   I used it to calm down some major mid-back pain, but this med did nothing for it.  However I was able to sleep in a cocoon like sleep for two hours and get much needed rest.  Very valium like without the feeling of being a piece of rubber with no memory.  Effects wore off very gently, didn&#39;t even notice it was done, let me off quite nicely.  Would recommend for a social smoke, very nice.

V&#127818;&#127816; It&#39;s amazing how a flower can capture the essence of grapefruit so well... I almost want to eat it. Grapefruit Kush is an incredible member of the Kush family. Such a unique, sweet citrus blast with that classic afghani hash aftertaste. Great for anxiety. Amazing for any purpose, really. I love this strain. It feels like a sativa dominant, but with more of a chill indica vibe. No racing feeling, but noticeable and wonderful cerebral effects.

VThis chunky light green bud gives off a very pungent fruity smell.  This is a perfect harmonious blend of Indica and Sativa. It produces a very happy euphoric buzz, with a calming of anxiety effect.  My girl and I shared a joint of it about thirty minutes ago.  The clouds floating outside our window seem to emulate it&#39;s dreamy summonings.  I highly recommend this strain and I speak from experience.

VSlightly bitter taste just like grapefruit! Really distinguishable bud when smoked, happiness just flows through you, i pet my pup for probably 2 hours and just enjoyed being outside with a nice lifted feeling and a little pressure behind the eyes, my week just melted away. STRESS FREE BUD. Being a patient medicating for pain this did no use just made my day a little brighter and joyful. Solid 8/10

VScent is exactly like a fresh cut grapefruit but taste is a little harsh, even with a good cure. Frosty, dense, and covered in long orange hairs, really has a ton of bag appeal, especially if you like citrus strains, but effects are pretty middle of the pack. Relaxing without being sedating after a euphoric head rush. 3.5/5.

VI was intrigued by the strain after being a big fan of grape ape. Grapefruit was the next strain I wanted to experience. In oil form I was able to get my hands on this strain and test its effects. It has a very fruity taste with a light grape flavor. The first hit is very euphoric and immediately feel the focus and eye pressure reliever. Within minutes my body relaxes with a very calming feeling on pain areas. Definitely fast hitting and very giggly type of high. I was overwhelmed with a very happy and content feeling and definitely is great for movie sessions. Would love to try in flower form but overall a really relaxing strain that gives a euphoric focused feeling and a body healing benefit to any tolerance user

VI don&#39;t find this one to be as potent on the indica side as others seem to...  I&#39;m a big Grapefruit fan, but I can take this one or leave it. Granted, I have to keep in mind that I simply ran into a sub-par batch here. Indeed it does seem a tad dry. Buzz is good though, just doesn&#39;t knock me back and make me take notice. The blend does indeed have a creamy taste to it - almost a soapy flavor even. Not terrible, just different. In the end, just not my favorite Grapefruit cross, like say Grapefruit Gift.

VOver all a great smoke.  personally I had a better experience rolling joints instead of using a pipe, which I almost never do.  but I feel it honestly allowed for a better taste experience.  it wasn&#39;t until I decided to roll one that I could taste the sweet and sour flavors of grapefuit.  Also the very long, dense red hairs were great.  also provided more keif than I&#39;m used to seeing after grinding up a full 7 grams.  Very uplifting and creative.

VI was intrigued by the strain after being a big fan of grape ape. Grapefruit was the next strain I wanted to experience. In oil form I was able to get my hands on this strain and test its effects. It has a very fruity taste with a light grape flavor. The first hit is very euphoric and immediately feel the focus and eye pressure reliever. Within minutes my body relaxes with a very calming feeling on pain areas. Definitely fast hitting and very giggly type of high. I was overwhelmed with a very happy and content feeling and definitely is great for movie sessions. Would love to try in flower form but overall a really relaxing strain that gives a euphoric focused feeling and a body healing benefit to any tolerance user

VExcellent Sativa dominant hybrid; beautiful odor, taste, and body due to the Kush lineage, as well as the immediately observable cerebral beauty of it&#39;s Grapefruit parent. Specifically vaporized to combat anxiety and depression, and an immediate cerebral lift was felt, whilst enhancing focus. Little to no physical pain was observed prior, so Indica potency was not observable.  Would highly recommend as a daily strain for those suffering from anxiety/depression, ADD/ADHD.

VReally awesome shit. The flavour is sweet, lemony (why?) and indeed strongly fruity/juicy, but the great thing is that YOU CAN FEEL THE FUCKIN&#39; GRAPEFRUIT!!! Smooth and light hit in the mouth/throat, a plasure to smoke. The effect is clearly tensing to indica, but always balanced, i would say 60/65% indica. Stony and relaxing hit that makes you happy and laughy like a child. I would recommend this for stress, but i&#39;m sure it&#39;s perfect for everything you use it. It&#39;s a fruity gift from Kush Family, remember me &#39;Mango Kush&#39;, but this is more indica and the fruity flavour is different. Daily dream. 4.5

VThis was, at one point, one of my favorite strains. Not only was I able to function, I did so at a better level. The high was a peaky, sophisticated mind high with a slow release of body effects. The body effects usually kicked in after the first two hours post-smoke. They included hunger (enough to eat two bagels and a bag of popcorn, but it was about time to eat anyway), an over abundance of happiness, and the uncontrollable need to do *something*. Overall a very enjoyable strain. Highly recommended for those who want to feel medicated throughout the day but still be able to function.

VI don&#39;t find this one to be as potent on the indica side as others seem to...  I&#39;m a big Grapefruit fan, but I can take this one or leave it. Granted, I have to keep in mind that I simply ran into a sub-par batch here. Indeed it does seem a tad dry. Buzz is good though, just doesn&#39;t knock me back and make me take notice. The blend does indeed have a creamy taste to it - almost a soapy flavor even. Not terrible, just different. In the end, just not my favorite Grapefruit cross, like say Grapefruit Gift.

VVery tangy scent upon opening the bag, strong citrus with slight pine and hint of afghan coming thru. Taste from glass leave a slightly tangy after taste lingering under the tongue and in the cheek lining just like a real grapefruit would do. Very nice mild cerebral to mid body high great for pain, relaxation or anxiety really takes the edge off of things

VFirst off taste is fire.  Like a nice sour/sweet grapefruit it&#39;s on point. A slow ooze of wellness flows from your head slowly down the body. Relaxes the mind and stresses soon after. Nice for anxiety and ptsd related issues. Relaxes the stomach as well which is great for chrons. Really a great overall strain. Perfect for just kicking it but you could be functional just take one hit!

VZesty, ruby red grapefruit rinds! or maybe pink, either way it&#39;s 100 percent true lol. Strong narcotic body buzz, good for indica lovers, even tho it has a bit of headiness in there as well. This stuff is loud when burnt, i could smell it from coming out from under my friends bedroom door, straight grapefruit peppery hash from 5 feet away.

V9/10\u000a\u000a_-_-_-GrapeFruit Kush-_-_-_\u000a\u000aUpon opening your medical marijuana container, a funky floral/kushy smell should arrive at your nose, with a very sweet skunky purple smell faintly in the backround. \u000a\u000aThe nugs are completely caked with frost annd they are small/medium size structure. \u000a\u000aThe High: Initial onset in &gt;5mins. ((Bear in mind I just woke up and I wake and baked this strain (11:20am lol) so it may take longer for the high to peak for you as I&#39;m on an empty stomach.)) It&#39;s a top notch hybrid effect, I&#39;d say its a sativa dominant, but it leaves you without the racing feeling and instead you with a much more indica chill stone. \u000a\u000aThe Flavor: You can taste the fruity sativa on the inhale, and taste the kushy afgahni hash taste on the exhale. Taste&#39;s like a bomb hybrid if you&#39;re an experienced toker. \u000a\u000aThe Verdict: I think this bud is an all around hitter. I can see this being used in a lot of situations. For personal and social smoking I would rate this a 9/10, It seems like a great strain but the batch I got at Platinim 45 in Costa Mesa CA looks like it has fallen through a snowstorm so I would reccomed to all the heads out there to really dig deep and get the topshelf version of this strain cause it&#39;s a great chill strain which can literally be used for any occasion besides insomnia which I&#39;d suggesting smoking The Purps for that.

VI did not like this strain. And everyone knows it sucks when you&#39;re stuck with a bag of weed you don&#39;t like. Anyways I think this type of weed makes you a lot more paranoid then relaxed which is the main reason why I would&#39;nt suggest it to poeple trying to have a nice and relaxed high. You also feel really shitty afterwords.
