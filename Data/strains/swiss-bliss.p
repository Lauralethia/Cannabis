VWell, let&#39;s just say...this was amazing.  I wished I had bought a half dozen.  Great flavor, but such a smooth balance of the effects too. I will be back for more!

VSwiss Bliss seems to be extremely potent. the first time I smoked it, I got paranoid and felt &#39;melt-your-face&#39; high. 2nd time was much better.  I think it&#39;s a creeper,  too, so watch out. In short, take it slow at first. positives are that it makes you laugh at shit and does get you super high on less smoke.
