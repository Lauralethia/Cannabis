VSky High Gardens - purchased 10/15/15 at Greenway Marijuana - No date of harvest on this package, but THC analysis is included in full review.\u000a\u000aThis strain is actually pretty stony, but not as much as the THC content would suggest. It tends towards the sativa side of hybrid. What disappointed me was the almost total lack of taste or smell. It&#39;s slightly grassy and earthy. I will probably smoke the rest of it, a daytime weed, but I won&#39;t buy it again.

VAt Xanders we call this the 3 hitter quitter. Makes you laugh like a schoolgirl, smile like a cheeseball and feel like you are wearing your ass for a hat. Immediate head rush and terps are out of this world.

V@SkyHighgardens #SkyHighGardens @Skyhigh #Skyhigh\u000a\u000a#AlienAsshat #AAH (&lt;-exactly what i thought after the #bong hit)\u000aLabel: \u000a#Potency Analysis - Total - 27.20%\u000a#THCA - 29.53%\u000a#THC - 1.30%\u000a#CBD - 0.1%\u000aPurchased from @GreenwayMarijuana in #PortOrchard (just hit the shelves as i was there)\u000aMy #BudTender i prefer to speak to is Steven, this guy is one of the best #BudTenders i have had the pleasure to have met.\u000aThe #atmosphere there is super friendly and knowledgeable. Everytime, i asked to see a #bud, Steven brought over two or three packages, just so i can see which package has the better #Nugs. I even asked him, why he did that. And his answer was, &quot;just so you have a choice if you want one big nug or little nugs.&quot; They also have a frequent smoker card, pretty cool concept.\u000aAlien Asshat smells very pungent, a mix between citrus and orange, with a #Skunk undertone. After packing a bowl in #TheJet (Jet Waterpipe)  I held my #hemp wick slightly over the bowl and sucked deep and hard, i had the flame pulled into the top of the #bowl just barely touching the Crystalline green grindings, within the #ThatThing &#39;s bowl. As the #smoke traveled through the #stem into the base, morphing into a whirlpool,  while a rubber ball evenly distrutes the smoke across a 52 #percolator screen,  filling 18&quot; of chamber! I press down on the #carb and clearing every bit of that smooth ice cold \u2744 smoke, blasting with a heavy Lemon juice, citrus flavors glistening across my tongue,  down my throat, completely filling my lungs. After exhaling my after taste is lemonade, i dont even know how that happened.  Lol The high is intense, very, very intense. I feel like im wearing a hat. My blood feels like it is rushing to my brain,  ringing in ears. Athough, i have a fan going, i could be hearing the bearing spinning,  since its the only thing making a noise. I just looked at the fan, the ringing is my left ear, and the noise is the fan! \u000aI would highly recommend this #bud for anything.  If you are a #Newbie,  know your limits,  i coughed twice total on a big ass #bong. Those little bongs can catch you, sometimes you dont realize how much you have taken in. If you are someone who will cough and is known to coughing,  i recommend having a container near by,  because you may throwup. My bong makes the smoke tasty and clean, so clean you can taste the terps when burning the bowl. In a bong like most on the market,  the skunk undertone will get you hard in your last little breath.  After all that is over. I guarantee you will be #HighAF higher than everyone else around you. This #bud kicks you in the dick and sends you speeding into the outer atmosphere.  This bud is phenomenal,  It is a #hybrid, im postive its a #Sativa Dominant hybrid. This #pot is good for any activity,  that you could use your brain, im noticing that im highly focused, not only in writing thing, but i have pinpointed every noise in this house and its location,  using my ears. Since i turned off the fan, i would think my feet would get cold, nope! I can&#39;t feel my feet.... \u000aOne word to describe this bud #Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  i know where it can be found for sure, in #Portorchard near #Bremerton, follow the top links,  if none are working,  Google it!!!! It&#39;s called GreenWay Marijuana..

VFirst time trying the Asshat and thus far it&#39;s been an enjoyable experience and is close to earning itself a place in my top 5. The high is smooth and uplifting, a very positive feeling. Two things standout for this high, I&#39;ve never slept better, super deep sleep and no burnt feeling when awakening. I&#39;ve also noticed that sex is also heightened as well, so there&#39;s that too. All in all, I&#39;ve been toking only twice per night and the Asshat is where it&#39;s at.
