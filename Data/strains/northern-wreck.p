V8/10 Very good strain for pain and anxiety. I&#39;ve been trying to find a good solid indica to keep in my rotation that won&#39;t make me too couch locked and this is it. Just right not too heavy but definitely not a light weight in terms of effects she will put your ass down lol and make you eat that full plate of dinner and enjoy your night of tv and family just like she does for me, and so far the taste is something of a fresh cheese plus earthy candy lol so it&#39;s very interesting to smoke to say the least. Savor this flower she&#39;s got a lot of medicinal value &#127795;&#128293;&#128119;&#127995;&#128168;\u000a

Very heavy head high and tingly body high that follows. A short time after I walked inside I melted into the couch and woke up at 3:46 am to eat some cookies with milk. 11/10.

VBeautiful, large dense buds, riddled with purple over a dark green flower. Smell is mild, a touch of orange peel and black pepper. Earthy Inhale yields to an acrid, almost salty exhale. A little harsh on the throat, but not quite enough to make you cough much, if at all. Effect is immediate and physically inebriating, like gravity just doubled itself. Clean mentally, but probably best to stick to sitting down while letting ones mind wander, rather than attempt outdoor activities. Definitely an &quot;end of day&quot; Indica.

VLet me just start this off by saying I don&#39;t usually go for indicas; sativas are usually my go-to instead. This strain bridges the gap in a lot of ways, and I found it to be rather pleasant.\u000a\u000aMild body high, increased focus, and it left me with no ability to properly track time. I found myself utterly engrossed in all of the things I did today, and I had fun even when the tasks would otherwise be fairly grueling. And it did all this without the usual interruption-triggered antisocial irritability I usually get from strains like Berzerker &amp; Blue Widow\u000a\u000aI plan to grab a fair bit more.

VNow tis is a new strain to try and what a great Sativa Goddess Blessed strain she is of Skunk F1 x White Widow both highly loved obvious to anyone who reads these oft detailed True Medical Cannabis Strain for a lifelong Chronic Pain Patient and /or for long term Cannabis use such as my 47 year love-affair with the most used healing aid on the Planet for the Entire History of Us All, &#39;The Naked Ape&#39;. \u000a\u000aStrains on this order need to be held-on to strains which might sound terribly difficult to have the same strain perform as it did within the first use of the Cannabis Strain !  One of my personal goals to accomplish within the year is the critical care for Mother Plants which when properly kept yield the clones of itself in the cuttings we remove,  a secret revealed here !!! we don&#39; t use typical cuttings we do leaf cloning which yields much great number of clones to cover any size of grow needed via mass-cloning.  Granted we use a worm compost tea called Eco-Tea which we have used exclusively for the last year with unexpected results that have blown us away both yield-wisely and medicinally also.  Hands Down The Best Damned Organic Plant Nutrition neither my Medical Cannabis Grower nor myself have ever seen such mind blowing results before in our lives.  \u000a\u000aEuphoria like this needs to be shared with at least everyone in Qu&#233;bec if this emirates further a field well satisfied I will be !!!

VIt was great, my first time buy  this one and I was left very impressed with this strain, longtime smoker so very nice to find a strain that gets me where I wanna be, and that&#39;s my happy place.  Big head change in beginning followed by a relaxing body high at the end. Not a all day smoking type strain but very nice to use after a nice dinner and time to relax and zone out on a movie before bed.

V30.7% THCsays the lable. tasted like doing a dab with full flavors. earthy, fruity, spicy like, blend.  Every other nug, had a slightly different taste. stuff  hits the body then balance out, very relaxing,stress free feeling.   does make me sleepy in higher doses. 4 or more hits. \u000awell worth a try if you find this.

VNorthern Wreck is the best indica dominate hybrid that I&#39;ve tried as of current. I would without a doubt about reordering this strain, if your looking for a strong indica strain than this strain is definitely worth trying.

VIf this strain is anything like they say then I&#39;m comfortable giving it a 5 star, but I am a true and threw a fan of indica so I really hope it&#39;s as good as it sounds. I&#39;ve been looking for something specifically for sleep assistance. ChemDawg was nice, GDP helped but still insomnia was still in sight so I hope this will work. If anyone knows of any other good indica&#39;s specifically for sleep let me know please, thanks...
