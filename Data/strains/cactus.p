VWow... As for me, this strain gets a standing ovation &#128079; &#128079; &#128079; After 30 years of chronic use, I have an EXTREMELY high tolerance, and have a hard time getting truly high. THIS strain is the first one I&#39;ve smoked lately that actually got me STONED. So delighted! Got this from Nature&#39;s Medicines. Opened the container, and hit with a decidely pungent smell. Buds are DANK, practically juicy, and very sticky. Scissors work better, grinder not so much. Taste matches scent, but is pleasant. It&#39;s also stout, and found it best not to draw too deeply. Oh, sweet, sweet buzzy oblivion! I have chronic pain, so I like to mix a little of this with a nice CBD strain, and I get awesome pain relief with a lovely head high. Definitely a new favorite.

VGave 9 because it relieves migraines so well. Smell is haze like. Mellow smoke. Don&#39;t hit much to body. More like calms your brain activity. One hour after you begin to loose focus and start to forget what you are speaking. It wear of nicely. Makes you feel lazy but not tired, if you smoke more it gives focus and energy. Middle day smoke.\u000a\u000aYea, you feel like you have haze in head.

VSneaky strain, comes on very slow and subtle.  Stacks tremendously with multiple doses so be wary.  Modest pain relief (from a chronic illness standpoint so it might do very well for some).

Vany strain with Northern Lights in the lineage has my attention. and with the second parent being the landrace Aghani strain, you are in for one hell of a treat. the smells are deep and long lasting and the relief from stress and pain is almost immediate.

VI just picked up my first taste ever of Cactus (Devil&#39;s Lettuce/Green Mart) and loving it.  It&#39;s got that great indica funky nose with hints of clove over a very faint background of overripe citrus.  I keep going back to smell this again and again and I keep getting new notes - earthy, at first I did not detect any diesel elements, but it&#39;s there too.  Extremely complex scent profile, not simply a strong one.  I&#39;d love to see its terpene profile. I&#39;m only one hit and 5 minutes with my nose in the bag into this and I can already tell  that this strain is going to become a new favorite.   Great powerful heady creative uplifting buzz along with a deep body buzz as well.  No couch lock, this is an energetic high for me, not sleepy in any way.   If you told me this was Northern Lights, I would have told you &quot;Yup, true to strain&quot;.  Enough said.  This is an almost instant classic in my mind and certainly should be considered by any Northern Lights connoisseurs

VCactus is a really great strain and I highly recommend it. Good taste. The high was short but pretty intense. At lower doses, it gave me a little energy just through good mood alone, but with a high dose, it knocked me out quick. The high itself was significantly more mental than a body high. It also gave me major munchies.

VCactus is one of those strains that you simply do not forget. A deeply rooted earthy aroma complemented by complex floral fragrances that emanate from this juicy bud&#39;s core may be the first thing you notice about this beautiful flower. It&#39;s pungent, nostril scrunching capabilities are sure to baffle and amaze any who come into its presence. Diamond-sapphire crystals burst from every crevasse and bright orange hairs reach out in all directions. The stone is equally complex and while it is a potent indica, it feigns a super sativa, making for very spacey, psychedelic moments in between bouts of intense chillage and relaxation. Of all the strains I have tried, this one in particular carried the scent over to the flavor of the smoke, making it almost sweet. I simply can&#39;t say enough about this strain. It&#39;s amazing! A favorite for sure.

VCactus is a heavy hitting indica that does exactly what an Indica is supposed to do. This strain is helpful for sleep, pain relief, or an evening at home with a movie. Its strong, but it has enough uplifting qualities to still be social if you need to be.

VAfter smoking a couple grams and trying some dry sift rosin over the past few weeks, cactus has solidified itself as my favorite strain. I would not buy the dry sift again but the flower is amazing every time. It has the hard hitting effect of an indica, but gives a huge burst of energy that lasts until a rather sudden wave of tiredness. If you happen to be by nature&#39;s meds in AZ, definitely try some.

VOne of the top 3 best smelling strains along with Acapulco and Bubblegum. Very fruity, almost like a watermelon-kiwi smell. Smooth smoke. \u000a\u000aThis is an indica in structure but feels a lot more like a 50-50 hybrid. Relaxing, but a great afternoon smoke that won&#39;t put you to sleep. Not an overwhelming high, but a unique creative headspace. Would consider growing and crossing with bubble gum or a cherry strain.

Vthis is another testimonial about Cactus...I like this fantastic and amazing flower. it is true medicine for my body and mind. nice for my back spasams. most definitely a &quot;medical&quot; grade strain. her genetics speak volumes alone...Northern Lights and Afghani, it&#39;s hard to beat this strain. my local dispensary tests theirs at 22% to 26% plus some CBD&#39;s so it is in fact a nice strain...actually it&#39;s one of my absolute favorites.

VSo sad to be stuck in AZ.. Reading these reviews and reminiscing of the days of real weed... Bought this for 6 bucks, which is super low price in AZ.  But what&#39;s the point?  When even the top shelf version is baloney bud.  No funk,  no pungency.  Leafly, you truly are useless.  Because this crap has nothing to do with Jordan,so why let people review it when it&#39;s grown by minimum wage novices who don&#39;t know strains? (The only people allowed to grow under corporate mmj laws). \u000a\u000aShould be mandatory to list where it was purchased or who grew it.  Otherwise,  strains don&#39;t mean anything. The growers in Az don&#39;t know what they are doing, and the smokers are mostly delusional placebo people.  This crappy bud rarely has any characteristics of the real deal.  Sad as hell, there&#39;s no point in trying any new strain since moving to AZ.  Its all the same garbage!
