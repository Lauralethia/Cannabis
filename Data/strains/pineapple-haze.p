VI was expecting great things since I love Lemon Haze so much, but honestly my experiences with this strain have been nothing but unpleasant. I felt extremely dissociated in a not-so-fun way and had a lot of muscle weakness and was just very uncomfortable in general, feeling agitated but detached and like I was going to pass out. It wasn&#39;t a downer, didn&#39;t put me to sleep or give me couch lock by any means, but it was not a happy or fun or uplifting experience either. I&#39;ve tried it a bunch of times now and it&#39;s always the same. I&#39;m sure it has different effects on different people, but Pineapple Haze is not a strain I&#39;ll be smoking again myself.

VPerhaps because I purchased a cheap 1/8th of outdoor Pineapple Haze, I noticed a tendency to get dizzy and slightly nauseated when I smoke this stuff. Other than that, I definitely get the cerebral effects, so as long as I&#39;m lying down, this strain is helpful for my depression and anxiety.
