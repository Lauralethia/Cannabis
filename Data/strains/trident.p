VIncredible strain for body pain, inflammation, and mild appetite stimulation without an overly strong head high. Great medicine!

VI was using it for it&#39;s CBD properties, but did not expect to get high. Granted it wasn&#39;t a bad high or a heavy high, but enough to know I was feeling it. After about 5 min I was ready for bed, falling asleep on the couch. Relaxed, tingly, comfortable. So this strain will definitely help with insomnia. My original pain had subsided, though I did feel new pain from getting up. Waking up the next day I did feel better over all, and felt rested. This was only my first use, as I continue trying it I will add more information on my experience. I do recommend this strain if you&#39;re looking for relaxation.

VThis is for what the label calls a 2:1 CBD/THC. It doesn&#39;t say what percentage of each. \u000a\u000aHaving been using Harlequin for a while, I find that this Trident relaxes me as much without getting me in the least bit jittery. I was able to go through a full bowl and felt good the entire time. \u000a\u000aIf anyone knows where I can find this strain in Flower, let me know and definitely try it!

VI don&#39;t like to feel foggy, so this was a great strain for me. I walked all day with no pain, I talked to all sorts of people with no anxiety and I had a general feeling of happiness and slight euphoria. This is perfect for beginners, or if you want to stay focused and happy all day. 5 stars!

VWow, not sure who grew this but he deserves a handshake and a 5/5 star rating. This is by far one of the best and most potent strains that I&#39;ve tried in a while.

VA good friend and I went to go pick up another friend and go for a cruise. When he got in the car he broke out a bag of Trident which smelled Pine/minty and fresh. Packed a fat sherlock of it  and drove around some side streets. The cruise felt like I was propelling slowly through warm clouds as the CBD dominated my body. The body high sensationalized all over my body slowly tingling outward in waves like having warm water flow over me periodically. Great experience but I love to have body and cerebral effects as well so not quite the strain for me!

VI have epilepsy so I smoked a little snap out of my pipe and I didn&#39;t have to worry about having seizures for a while:) however if anyone reading this also has epilepsy and falls to cannabis as a treatment please take note that I had seizures a few hours after my snap, but then again I&#39;m not sure what a dosage is I smoked more and they stopped but this strain is definitely suitable for epilepsy just smoke more so you don&#39;t worry about seizures.

VI purchased this strain from a local dispensary to treat some severe arthritis pain in my knee. I chose the Trident for the high level of CBD; 12.2% CBD &amp; 5.8% THC. I wanted something that I would be able to smoke during the day without any sort of &quot;stoney&quot; aftereffects. The effects aren&#39;t super long lasting, but I often &quot;notice&quot; that it&#39;s been awhile between when I last felt pain after smoking. Definitely try this one if you haven&#39;t before and want to be pain-free and focused. I usually make a blend of this and some Indica for a nighttime smoke. The aroma is a nice lemon pinesol plus mint. This batch is a bit harsh as a joint, but vapes up REALLY smooth.
