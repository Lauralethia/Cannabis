VThis is my favorite sativa. I didn&#39;t even know marijuana could make you so energetic. I&#39;ve had a few that gave me energy, but not on this scale.  It&#39;s like drinking 2 red bulls without the yucky feeling. I keep trying to post this review, I must&#39;ve done like ten of them by now.  But it&#39;s just THAT good I had to make sure other people read it when they click on reviews. I know I always check reviews out before trying a new strain.\u000aMethod: Dab\u000aTaste: Sweet\u000aEffects: SUPER energetic. Focused yet relaxed. S

VI just want to say that I was very excited to try my friends green house grown lady that I helped trim this season, and I was not disappointed. Very sweet honey and citrus taste upon inhale and an earthy sweet on exhale, I love her!! The sativa effects are evident, but not enough to induce paranoia. Highly recommended day time medicine.

Voh. my. god. this strain is phenomenal.  Gives me 5 times more energy than Green Crack.  I am very glad I picked up a gram of this from Urban Greenhouse.  When I do a lot of dabs I start feeling like I drank 2 red bull&#39;s without the yucky feeling that comes with it. I can&#39;t comment on the aroma &amp; taste, something that sadly gets lost with dispensaries making their own concentrates. I personally don&#39;t care about taste if it&#39;s strong.\u000aI do think this strain is OK for patients with anxiety, I suffer from a mild case &amp; I&#39;m nothing but smiles.\u000aGreat for depression!

VIt&#39;s a nice strain. I&#39;ve seen it come in multiple colors before and that pheno is the best in my opinion. In fact this batch I got is all orange hairs and kinda reminds me of agent orange in that it packs a pretty potent citrus smell. The multi color pheno smelled more berry like if I recall right. I think I remember it having more crystals and less hairy as well. It&#39;s wake and bake and time to enjoy my Saturday. Try it either way and you have less of a chance of being disappointed than if you tried something else. It&#39;s one you&#39;ll wanna try for sure. The flavor is always interesting. The high always pretty strong as well. - Source:Downtown Dispensary Tucson - Kinda cool this strain has so few reviews, are others not really getting this in their area? idk.

I was having this headache earlier because I was recovering from a stomach flu and I felt as if I was never sick in the first place. Got me into a giggly mood and was able to have fun with my friends and still able to get a lot done. Definitely looking forward to smoking this strain again.

Never before understood why peeps put song lyrics in their reviews.  Mickey gently informed me...with a tiny bit of Trainwreck thrown in 30 min prior. But didn&#39;t feel this good til I met Mickey. Feels like we&#39;re on a 1st name basis already!! Vapin some fabulous shatter (thanks again, UGD!!). Had a huge locust fly in my hair &amp; I gently removed it&#128514;. No longer in nerve &amp; joint pain, zero anxiety, depression gone (was bad today), ADD doesn&#39;t feel so in charge.could be day or night, depending on dosage. \u000aI COULD get off the couch &amp; be productive, but I&#39;m good right where I&#39;m at.

VMickey Kush presents quite differently depending on how you consume it.  I have used Mickey Kush all week.  Smoking Joints and Hookah and Vaping with a V-Tower and a Solo unit.  Hands down the best body effects come from the Hookah.\u000a\u000aThis review is for Vaping:\u000aMakes me feel warm and cozy.  Great for a lazy Sunday afternoon of movies and napping on the couch.  Or binge watching a great show with a friend.  Or laughing and playing cribbage with my boyfriend.   It is great for everything.  It flows with your interests at the time.\u000a\u000aContinually raising the temp brings out unusual flavors and aromas: mustard, cheeseburger, watermelon, mushroom, tuna and more.  It tastes like a picnic.

My wife picked this up at the dispensary in concentrate form to throw on the vape pin. It sat at 58% THC..  The taste was fruity nice back of the tongue fruit finish. Effects were a little slow and it didn&#39;t hit you all at once it grew on you if that makes since. I&#39;m not agian a fan of sativa strains but when I do smoke it better be top shelf and this was indeed nice strain when grow correctly thus is wonderful. It should be that way with the flower form also.  If your every around this strain at your dispensary grab it. Totally dank smelling weed you&#39;ll love it

VFantastic strain for anyone suffering from bipolar disorder or depression! If I\u2019m feeling fatigued this strain gives me tons of energy. I also feel very focused, uplifted, grateful, creative, euphoric, and just an overall great well-being. MK is my go to for fighting depression. &#128074;&#127995; \u000a\u000aHighly recommend!

VI got a free gram of this at my local dispensary in the $12 a gram selection. The smell and taste were very sweet and had me craving a taste for myself. Everything tasted exactly as I thought it would, which was very pleasant. Sadly this is were I have to drop it done 2 stars. After smoking a joint of Micky Kush, I started to have a bad migraine and eventually had to take a migraine pill. Great smell and taste but maybe I just had a bad run this time with this tasty sweet Sativa.

VMickey Kush gives me a really spacey feeling. It definitely doesn&#39;t make me tired, but it slows down my mind and allows me to explore the world around me in a different way, and yes I&#39;m high right now. I&#39;m not great with rating tastes because they all taste the same to me for some reason so I can&#39;t judge that.

VPhenomenal strain.  Strains work differently for different people, here&#39;s my experience with it.\u000a\u000aThis strain gives me more energy than Green Crack. When I indulge heavily my heart rate increases, and I feel like I had 2 red bulls minus the icky feeling. I picked up a gram @ Urban Greenhouse in PHX, it was made by them, $35 a gram. I regret not getting more!\u000a  If you are anxiety prone

VA pleasant and uplifting euphoria. Still able to take a nap if needed and not overwhelming at small doses. Really works wonders for my chronic arthritis pain. I barely even noticed that my hip and knees were hurting. As for the taste, upon exhaling through the mouth and nose it gives the faint Aroma of fresh cut grass. However when smelling it in the container it has a definite odor of pears and maybe even pomegranate.
