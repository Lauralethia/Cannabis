VThis is ONE of my TOP 5 STRAINS of ALL TIME. Hopefully this review will give you some personal perspective if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for&#129300;&#128527;&#128076;     \u000a\u000aWhat the kind Professor Chaos has helped me achieve has been nothing more than bliss. It&#39;s been a perfectly transition medication to who I am now BOTH physically, personally, and mentally!\u000a\u000aM/37/Med build \u000a\u000aMEDICAL: Motorcycle accident 2011=TBI, broken left ankle, left elbow, shattered knuckle, and torn/ripped/muscles and ligaments around my neck and shoulders, TBI (Traumatic Brain injury) and then diagnosed \u000a\u000aCURRENT: Funking LIVED LA freeway @80 MPH and surrounded by ADJECTIVES&#128405;.   Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m not a dumbass and had more than just a helmet on. Ducati STILL in 3 pieces though RIP &#128584;. \u000a\u000aPAST: Creator and Producer of a television travel guide to adventure sports around the world. Spent the 2000\u2019s Filming, Teaching, Producing The series throughout South East Asia\u000a\u000aMEDS: Professor Chaos is a RARE find and just that perfect strain to have on my drive/trek/slog back home &#127969; before I get to the house. Pain, depression, insomnia are all my top 3 medical needs. Pain and depression should be obvious, But the insomnia is the one that catches people by surprise considering Jack Herer are 1 of 2 of its major genetic parents. \u000a\u000aAs the The420mon elaborated on in a previous review was that comedown was hard and not to use it for studying which I agree with him on 100%. But I myself have ADHD and I find this flower to be the perfect compliment to making dinner, cleaning up, and then off to veg out in front of TV before rolling off into bed\u2026\u2026 Hopefully\u000a        \u000aEFFECT: Couldn\u2019t be better. Puts me in a great happy mood to typicaly finish out the day on a happy note for myself and those around me. \u000a\u000aSo long story short, I buy this whenever and wherever I can find it as it can be very hard to find. \u000a\u000aP.S:  The420mon if you want to clean the house, I suggest green crack :-)\u000a\u000a\u000aP.S.S: Super Jack = Best daytime functional strain with the best focus and no BrainHaze

VProbley my new favorite, felt totally relaxed but still had energy, could use this as a wake up bowl before the work day. Don&#39;t feel overwhelmed with the high, it&#39;s perfect and just right. Stress and anxiety are gone from it . Best I&#39;ve had

VThis strain is pure fire. Great head high, very sativa leaning. Tastes piney and is strong as fuark. Mine was 26% thc. One of the best daytime smokes I&#39;ve had, next to Maui Wowie. Get this if you see it. With two hands.

VI love this strain. I didn&#39;t get much sleep last night and I can feel how tired my eyes are, but this is giving me energy! Never thought weed would wake me up. I&#39;m doing household chores I haven&#39;t done in weeks. I have yet to draw/paint, so I&#39;m not sure how it affects my creative abilities. The description is on point when it says it doesn&#39;t sacrifice your productivity. I was able to read everything on this page and completely comprehend it, which is a stretch for me usually because I have REALLY bad ADHD. This one doesn&#39;t make you fuzzy headed. Would definitely buy again!!

VI thought this strain did exactly what it&#39;s proposed for. It definitely has pain relieving properties. As soon as I started hitting my blunt, a few mintues later, I could tell this was an energetic high. My entire body felt relaxed. I could feel my body relaxing from my head to my feet, it was really calming...but not to calming to the point I wasn&#39;t able to function. I could have definitely worked on this strain and not geek out. Lol. &#128514; All in all, I think it had stress relieving properties, it does what it&#39;s intended to do. I like it. Although I thought it made me relaxed enough where I could fall asleep. I didn&#39;t seem to have any issues with sleeping at all on this strain. In fact I thought it helped me to relax enough before bed, that I would fall asleep much faster after smoking a blunt of pRoFfESOR ChAoS*~

VThis hybrid will be one of the legendary strains. This is a no nonsense pain and stress reliever. Very potent, the combination of cannabinoids is perfect, both for rec. use and medical use. If you are one of those that like to let a good hit expand... you can&#39;t, not for very long. A half step toke will be enough take the top of one&#39;s head off most folk. After the initial buzz subsides to an overall sense of well being you will want to be active.

VThis strain made me down, lethargic and tired. I tried it twice. it may be ok for night time. I reached out to dispensary they said it was good for video game play etc. I usually love high CBD sativas, regular sativas, and sativa dominant hybrids along with indicas at night. I would not even want to use this at night but would rather use a smooth indica. Just not for me:( But 2 stars rather than one since I did not get intense paranoia or any really so that is good.
