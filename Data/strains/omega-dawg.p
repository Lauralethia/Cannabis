VSuper Tasty! Fruity and pungent! I loved the texture and density of this one, along with the intense zen and serene soothing mental effects. I started picking up French, Mandarin, Japanese, and advanced English app classes on my phone and went to town.\u000a

VI had a 24% THC batch that was pretty lackluster. Hybrids are becoming favorites, but this one, despite the high THC didn&#39;t really deliver. Wonderful aroma, but kind of a harsh smoke that didn&#39;t leave much of a balanced high.  I kept thinking it was a creeper, but nothing ever kicked in.

VGreat 50/50 hybrid. Granted, there is not much smell to the flowers, but outdoor grows are like that. This strain I keep for daytime use
