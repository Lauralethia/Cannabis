VThey told me this would be close to my favored Blackberry Kush and so I took it. Didn&#39;t even read the blurb or reviews... got in the back seat and took a drag on the &#39;smoky pen&#39;. Once my friend started driving I started investigating and was reading the effects and saw Giggly which in turn made me bust out laughing and my friend and his wife start laughing. Getting stoned with the Godparents is neat! \u000a\u000aBut seriously, I&#39;ve got a rare form of muscular dystrophy where my muscles do not relax. They are contracted to the point of having a horribly debilitating Charlie Horse but all fucking over your body. I&#39;m in pain constantly. One inhale and slowly let it out along with all of the negative energy I&#39;d been holding in through my pain. I was grounded mentally but my body was so relaxed I felt I was floating. Would definitely recommend this strain, but use caution. It&#39;ll hit you right between the eyes and knock you out.

VFifty year old weed virgin here to update my review. I have since widened my pallette and tried much stronger, more cerebral strains. NB cuts a gentle swath through the more mind-scrambling strains and offers a gentle path to rest and sleep. I find the effects evenly balanced between head and body with no overwhelming surprises for newbs like me. If you need a louder experience you will want a different strain. NB is happy to give you enough to drown out the day without drowning you in the process. If you want your egg scrambled consider a Haze or Widow strain, or Jack Herer.

VPowerful indica - immediately mellows you out and relaxes body and mind (though body more for me). Didn&#39;t improve depression really for me but did ease my anxiety. Hunger creeps up on you, then bam - tired dry eyes ready to sleep, and a lil dizziness and slight headache too. Even though I was very chill, I got majorly engrossed in researching holiday hotel packages and looking at the pictures lol so still focused creatively I guess. Not as good as it&#39;s hyped up to be for me but still solid, and not for the faint hearted. B+\u000a\u000aAND IT STINKS :)

VMeet Northern Berry (or Northernberry), daughter to the power couple Northern Lights #5 and Blueberry. Her father passes on that signature blueberry aroma underscored by notes of earthy hash. Despite its heavy indica influence, Northern Berry delivers a complex balance of cerebral and body effects best suited for late afternoon or evening consumption. Novices, take caution: Northern Berry is intense experience for both mind and body, and may induce an early night\u2019s sleep when overdone. However, for you patients treating pain and insomnia, these crushingly heavy effects may be just what you need to put symptoms to rest.

Others I have overindulged on accident because they took a while to hit. I plan on growing this strain next season. This was an Applegate Valley Organics product--nicely done!

VI had a very interesting experience with Northern Berry.  Recently I started smoking again, previously having experienced panic attacks oftentimes when smoking weed.  \u000a\u000aI began researching CBD&#39;s and decided to try the Cannatonic strain.  Long behind, I didn&#39;t freak out!  It was a nice body high without the lost in space heady feeling.  Eventually I branched out and tried many other strains, mostly indicas and hybrids.  Only one session of an unknown strain did I get to *almost* panic attack.\u000a\u000a2.5 months in, and I decide to buy a bubbler.  I test it out by taking 2 hits of the same Northern Berry big bud I had been pinching off of.\u000a\u000a20 minutes later and I went into a full blown panic attack.  I was stunned and I still don&#39;t know what caused it.  Richard at Home Grown Apothecary explained to me that while it could have been a number of things acting as the cause, that his guesstimate on was that it was perhaps some pesticides.  Apparently if it isn&#39;t organically grown with certification, it&#39;s prone to pesticides.  Richard also added that the pesticides can and do cause paranoia to occur.  This may explain the sudden and completely out-of-place feelings I had.  \u000a\u000aI drank some water, walked around the block about 15 times, and eventually started to come down after about an hour of complete hell.\u000a\u000aI&#39;ll be buying organically from now on unless I am comfortable with a random purchase of a heavy indica.\u000a\u000a~JCM

Vthe one I&#39;m currently smoking is a cross with Blueberry called Northern Lights Blue by Delicious Seeds. But since there&#39;s no separate article for that one yet I will leave a review here. This strong indica remotely reminded me of Mazar I had before. It&#39;s very euphoric and body relaxing. Very pleasant smell, however I expected more berries in it. It&#39;s sweet and pungent, still a little harsh when smoking, made me cough. started almost immediately in body than euphoria caught up and after 1,5 hours NLB left me sedated and chill. very enjoyable strain and not too couch lock which I like.
